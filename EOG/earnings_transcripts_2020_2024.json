[Operator instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Tim Driggers, chief financial officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nTim Driggers: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions, as well as reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call or in the accompanying investor presentation slides may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday. Participating on the call this morning are; Bill Thomas, chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, chief operating officer; Ezra Yacob, president; Ken Boedeker, EVP, exploration and production; Lance Terveen, senior VP marketing; and David Streit, VP, investor and public relations. Here's Bill Thomas\nBill Thomas: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Last year was historic, and we were tested like never before. In a challenging environment, I am proud to say our EOG employees who personify our unique culture responded exceptionally without a beat. I'd like to thank our employees for delivering such outstanding performance. We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow, earned adjusted net income of $850 million and ended the year with $3.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We increased our sustainable dividend rate by 30% and shored up what was already an industry-leading balance sheet to a low 11% net debt-to-cap ratio. We lowered our finding and development cost, improved our capital efficiency and earned a direct after-tax rate of return of more than 50%, with an all-in after-tax rate of return of 25% based on our premium price deck of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. Such extraordinary results in a $39 oil price environment were made possible by our shift five years ago to our premium strategy, which established an investment hurdle rate of 30% direct after-tax rate of return using flat $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas prices. Using such a stringent hurdle rate shields the company from cyclic oil and gas prices. 2020 was a true test of that shield, and that is a testament to the power of our premium strategy. Beyond delivering stellar financial results last year, we continued to invest in long-term value of the company. Through our low-cost organic efforts, we added 1,500 net premium locations to our inventory, including 1,250 from the newest addition to our portfolio, Dorado, a South Texas natural gas play with 21 Tcf of net resource potential at a breakeven price of less than $1.25 per Mcf. We believe Dorado is one of the lowest cost and lowest emissions natural gas fields in the U.S. and expands EOG's portfolio of assets that we believe will play a significant role in the long-term global energy solution. We also completed two pilots of infield technology to reduce emissions, a hybrid solar and natural gas-powered compressor station that reduces combustion emissions and a closed-loop gas capture system to reduce force flaring as a result of downstream market interruptions. Reducing flaring is an industrywide priority, and we plan to publish our closed-loop gas capture technology for others to replicate. We entered the next phase of the cycle a much improved company. With the countless, creative and innovative ideas we implemented in 2020, we're in the process of making significant improvements to EOG's future performance. Looking forward, the following six steps summarize the foundation for our 2021 plan and outlook for the next three years. Number one, maintain fourth-quarter 2020 production. There is no reason to consider growth until the market rebalances. Signs of an earlier recovery will not change our $3.9 billion 2021 capital plan. Number two, shift to a double-premium drilling program. Our focus on increasing returns never waivers, and this year is no exception. We're raising the investment standard again. Double-premium wells earn 60% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas and make up the top half of our 23-year drilling inventory. Shifting to double premium will make another step-change in our future performance by delivering higher returns, lower decline rates and more free cash flow potential. We have more than 10 years of double-premium inventory and are optimistic we will replace double-premium locations faster than we drill them. Number three, accelerate new exploration projects. Last year, our exploration program focused on technical evaluations across numerous new prospects. We're excited to resume a more robust leasing and testing effort this year. We're evaluating a large number of double-premium oil plays in the U.S. and internationally with the potential to deliver low finding costs and development costs and low production decline rates. The focus of our exploration program is to continue to improve the quality of our inventory and EOG's total shareholder value. Number four, raise the bar again on our ESG performance and ambitions. After achieving significant improvements in safety, emissions and water performance in 2020, we have announced our ambition to reach net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040. As one of the steps along the way, we expect to eliminate routine flaring by 2025. We believe this is possible using creative applications of current and future technology. We're currently implementing internally developed technology with a goal of measuring granular real-time emissions data for all facilities in the company. This will encourage innovation and development of unique solutions to achieve our net zero ambition. Number five, resume moderate production growth only when the market is balanced. Assuming a balanced market by year-end, we are positioned to grow oil 8% to 10% in 2022 and 2023. We forecast that our shifting well mix toward double premium will lower our base decline rate to less than 25% within five years from 34% last year. This optimal growth rate delivers the most long-term total value by delivering higher returns, lower decline rates and more free cash flow over the long term. And number six, generate significant free cash flow. All cash allocation decisions are focused on enhancing total long-term shareholder value. Our top priorities for free cash flow are to sustainably grow the dividend and reduce debt. Beyond these priorities, when excess cash materializes, we will evaluate other options opportunistically, such as supplemental dividends, share repurchases and low-cost property additions. With our deep inventory of double-premium locations, moderating decline rates and sustainable cost reductions, EOG's free cash flow potential is improving significantly. Before I turn it over to Billy, I want to address our thoughts on federal acreage. From the statements made by the current administration, we believe that our current existing federal leases and corresponding federal drilling inventory can be fully developed. EOG is well prepared to manage through any regulatory changes that could impact the pace of development on federal acreage. The combination of our large number of federal permits in hand, our flexibility to pivot within our deep inventory of double-premium locations and our ability to add new inventory through organic exploration gives us the confidence that the future performance of the company will not be affected. Now here's Billy.\nBilly Helms: Thanks, Bill. Let me start by expressing my warmest appreciation to all of our employees. I am truly amazed by their talent, commitment and resiliency as demonstrated by the dramatic improvements achieved in 2020. Within weeks of publishing our initial 2020 capital plan, we quickly cut capital by scaling back activity by nearly half. To protect the company's financial strength, our employees responded with urgency and purpose, finding new ways to sustainably reduce our well cost structure further. What stands out the most to me is how the EOG culture of innovation and multidisciplinary collaboration and teamwork increased at a time when everyone was working remotely to protect themselves, their families and their communities. The results of that innovation and teamwork can be seen clearly in our 2020 operational performance. We significantly improved our capital efficiency by reducing total well cost 15% and per unit cash operating cost 4%. With respect to our year-end reserves and excluding the low impact of low commodity prices, we reduced finding and development costs 15% to a low of $6.98 per barrel of oil equivalent and replaced nearly 160% of our 2020 production. The speed with which we spread technical innovations directed at lowering cost and improving well performance throughout the company has increased. We believe the communication challenge presented by remote work and the teamwork required between individual operational areas to execute our significantly revised plan last year inspired what we believe will be a permanent improvement in how we integrate new learnings and innovations companywide. Our operational execution fired on all cylinders during 2020, reaching our stretch goal to reduce well costs 15% last year with about three-quarters of that coming from sustainable efficiency improvements. We expect to maintain this momentum and reduce well cost another 5% this year. We also expect to carry sustainable operating cost reductions into 2021. Our reductions to LOE during 2020 remarkably outpaced the volume reductions and shut-in production as a result of exceptionally low commodity pricing. We reduced LOE 22% on a total-dollar basis versus 8% decline in production volumes. Shutting in volumes afforded us the opportunity to take a closer look at our maintenance and workover programs and streamline our lease upkeep practices, resulting in sustainable cost reductions. We finished the year with fourth-quarter oil production at a little over 440,000 barrels of oil per day and having spent $3.5 billion of capital, exactly what we forecasted back in May when we revised our plan in response to the downturn in oil prices. We increased our rig count from a low of five rigs last summer and are now running about 24 rigs to support a 2021 program that will maintain essentially flat oil volumes. The rig count is currently at the high point, and it will drift down throughout the year to an average of about 22 rigs. Looking back to when we introduced the premium strategy in 2016, our per unit cash operating costs have declined by 18%, and our per foot well costs are down about 40%. This operational excellence has enabled EOG to raise the bar further and target double premium as our new investment standard. With such significant progress the past five years and the momentum we are carrying, I'm convinced we are only just getting started at being one of the lowest-cost energy suppliers. We also made significant strides in our ESG performance in 2020. First, on the safety side, our total recordable incident rate, the primary safety metric, improved more than 25%. Safety is always our first priority, and we continue to focus on ways to enhance our safety culture even further. On the environmental side, we increased the percent of reused water used in our operation to about 45% of our supply and significantly reduced total barrels of freshwater used. And we increased our already-strong wellhead gas capture rate from 98.8% in 2019 to an astounding 99.6% in 2020. Our ambitions for the future are a reflection of that performance. We have set a goal to raise the wellhead gas capture rate to 99.8% in 2021 and achieve zero routine flaring by 2025. We're literally fighting for the last remaining 0.1 percentage point now. Longer term, we have set an ambition to be net zero in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040. Ultimately, it is our highly creative and passionate employees that gives me confidence in this aspiration. In the past five years, we have achieved a number of technical innovations and operational advancements that have enabled us to generate significant reductions in methane and overall GHG intensity rates to date. Our approach to emissions reductions remains operationally focused, investing with returns in mind and seeking achievable and scalable results. Our investments in projects such as closed-loop gas capture and solar-powered compression pay off in two ways; they lower emissions and function as learning mechanisms for future innovation. We know that to be part of the long-term energy solution, we not only have to be low cost; we have to do it with one of the lowest environmental footprints. Our newly formed Sustainable Power Group is working to identify low emissions power generation solutions and accelerate innovations to support our missions, goals and ambitions. I'm excited about all the innovation occurring in the company, and that gives me confidence we can achieve our goals and ambitions. Finally, I want to take a minute to express my sincere gratitude for the tireless efforts of our production and marketing teams in the wake of the severe winter weather event last week. The teams worked in difficult conditions without any safety incidents to manage the production interruptions caused by extensive freezing weather and delivered as much critical production to our downstream customers as possible. All of our production is now back online, and we expect our average daily production in the first quarter to be reduced by about 4%. Beginning with the onset of the storm, the production staff also worked in close coordination with our marketing team who communicated with our downstream customers to redirect natural gas production in Texas to local distribution companies that deliver natural gas to heat homes and to utilities for electric power generation. These efforts supported by critical -- these efforts supported critical human needs throughout the Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin, Houston and other Central and East Texas communities. Further, in line with our core values at EOG, we sold these redirected gas shipments at prices consistent with those received prior to the winter weather event rather than high and volatile daily spot prices. Through it all, the EOG culture of interdisciplinary teamwork and nonbureaucratic decision-making, technology leadership and commitment to do the right thing shone through, and I couldn't be more proud of everyone involved. Here's Ezra for an update on our exploration efforts.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Billy. Our organic exploration focus has always been the driver behind successfully replacing what we drill every year with better inventory. Our current effort is built around adding plays with shallower decline rates that also meet our double-premium hurdle rate, ultimately offering higher capital efficiency than our existing inventory. Dorado, the South Texas natural gas play we announced late last year, is the most recent example of EOG creating shareholder value through low-cost organic exploration. Early entry and capture of a high-quality reservoir across a contiguous acreage position with access to low-cost services and proximity to multiple markets is the recipe for a high-return investment opportunity and is exactly the type of prospect we're looking for. Our strong financial position, combined with our proprietary database of unconventional plays, has positioned us to capitalize countercyclically and capture exploration opportunities with little to no competition. We are focused on oil, and we are in the process of drilling and testing high-potential prospects. We are optimistic we can prove up a number of them and capture additional acreage at competitive pricing that will further improve the quality of what we believe is already one of the best portfolios of assets in the industry. Our vision is to develop double-premium oil plays in each operating area, including international. This is highly efficient and allows us to allocate capital across a wide array of plays to optimize returns and capital efficiency. This decentralized multi-basin approach is a hallmark of EOG, one that leverages our competitive advantages in exploration, technology and low-cost operations, all benefiting from knowledge transfer between the basins. The results, if we are successful, will flow through our financials with higher return on capital employed, lower operating costs, higher capital efficiency, shallower declines and even more free cash flow. When we look back at this time several years from now, I'm confident we will recognize 2021 as a step-change in EOG's performance and financial profile, much like we look back on our shift to premium drilling in 2016. Here's Tim to review our financial position.\nTim Driggers: Thanks, Ezra. EOG's financial performance in 2020 demonstrates the resiliency of our business model and portfolio of high-return assets. In response to the lower oil prices caused by the price war and pandemic, we elected to utilize our operational flexibility to quickly cut activity. Levered by the sustainable cost deductions that Billy discussed, we reduced capex in 2020 by 44% to $3.5 billion. The result was $1.6 billion of free cash flow, a great performance in what we certainly hope will prove to be the bottom of the cycle year. The board of directors voted to increase the dividend by 10% to an annual rate of $1.65 per share. EOG's dividend has grown at a compounded annual rate of 20% over the last 21 years. This reflects the continued improvement in the profitability and cost structure of the company and our confidence in EOG's long-term resiliency. I'm pleased to say we have never cut the dividend and never issued equity to support it. We analyze numerous stress down-cycle scenarios to evaluate the size of the dividend and to ensure it can be sustained over the long run. The regular dividend represents our first priority for returning cash -- free cash flow to shareholders. Beyond that, we have set a target to reduce debt outstanding by $2 billion from the level at the end of last year. We have made a down payment on that goal, paying off with cash on hand a $750 million bond that matured in February 1. There are no additional debt maturities until 2023 when a $1.25 billion bond is scheduled to mature. Beyond that, we have no plans to further reduce debt. Our goal is to maintain about $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet on average through cycles. This is not a hard-and-fast rule. The actual amount of cash on the balance sheet at the end of each quarter will vary depending on business conditions at the time, but this should give you some rough idea of what to expect going forward. EOG is firmly committed to generating significant free cash flow. Our top priorities for free cash flow remain -- is to remain sustainable dividend growth and debt reduction. As cash materializes and we have more visibility into the future, we will opportunistically consider other options, such as a supplemental dividend during the up-cycles or share repurchases during market lows, along with low-cost property additions with potential to improve EOG's performance. Now let me turn the call back to Bill.\nBill Thomas: Thanks, Tim. In conclusion, I would like to note the following important takeaways. First, due to market conditions, EOG will not accelerate production in 2021. Second, after this year, once the market rebalances, developing our current drilling inventory at a moderate growth rate of 8% to 10% optimizes returns and free cash flow potential over time. Third, our shift to double-premium investment metrics paves the way for another step-change in EOG's returns and future performance. Fourth, our domestic and international exploration portfolio is stronger in both quality and quantity than it's ever been. This year, we are accelerating the testing and leasing efforts on many of those prospects that have the potential to significantly enhance total shareholder value of the company. Our exploration projects have the potential for higher returns, lower costs and lower decline rates than our current inventory. And finally, we are passionate and excited about the innovation and technology that continues to manifest itself in EOG. It gives us confidence that we will continue to lower well costs and operating costs and reduce our environmental footprint. Our goal for EOG is to be one of the lowest-cost, highest-return and lowest-emissions producers playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] And our first question today will come from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nArun Jayaram: Bill, my first one is for you. In 2021, you're gonna hold, call it, a maintenance program. And based on your '22 and '23 outlooks, you could have some growth, call it, 8% to 10%. I guess, my question is, given typical shale cycle times, would you have to spend any incremental capital in 2021 to prepare you to meet that 8% to 10% growth in '22?\nBill Thomas: Hi Arun. I'm going to ask Billy to comment on that.\nBilly Helms: Yeah, Arun, no, we don't anticipate that we would have to spend any additional capital this year to be able to accommodate growth in the future. And beyond this year, I would add that we'll only add activity once we see a more balanced market, as Bill described.\nArun Jayaram: Tim, I got one for you. In the guide, we did note a step-change lower in the tax deferral with the company's current tax mix now above 90%. Can you talk about the drivers of the higher cash tax mix in 2021? And as we would have thought some of your IDCs would have led to a lower cash tax rate. And can you just talk about, is this a one-year phenomena or indicative of the go-forward tax rate?\nTim Driggers: Arun, this is Tim. Yeah, so as we become more and more profitable, obviously, it has lowered the price that we have to make a taxable income. So that's the first thing. We are an extremely profitable company now. And if you go back and look to the -- to 2020, for sure, in the $39 oil, there wasn't much tax profit there. So in the $50 environment, we have significant taxable income, and we have no net operating losses left to offset that with. So it's a simple math of being a very profitable company and paying taxes. So beyond that, I could clarify it more offline, if you'd like, but that's the general answer.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. So sorry, Tim, not to keep pushing you on Arun's question right now. But in terms of '22 and '23 on the deferred tax, how that might trend, is it possible that the deferred guidance might improve a little bit next year as you get back to growth to 8% to 10% because you'll be spending more money? The strip is backward dated, which, I guess, is lower cash, so good news, bad news for this. As well as you've got a lot of gains on the nat gas side for this year that maybe may not material next -- materialize next year. So maybe just furthering on Arun's question, is it possible that 0% to 15% could be something different in '22 and '23 as you get back to growth?\nTim Driggers: That's exactly right. As we spend more capital in the growth mode obviously we'll have more IDCs to deduct to lower our cash taxes. So it a backward dated environment where we got lower oil prices then yes, it would lower that deferred ratio.\nJeanine Wai: Thank you for the clarification. My second question is just on cash returns. So given the high-class problem of your forecasted free cash flow and you formally set the total debt target to $3.7 billion with no plans to further reduce debt, what's the minimum operating cash balance that you're comfortable? And I guess, it's a backdoor way of asking like does your new formalized debt target, does that imply that you plan on paying out 100% of excess free cash flow in a year after dividend and after whatever you may allocate toward low-cost property acquisitions? Or am I just getting ahead of myself here?\nBilly Helms: Yeah Jeanine, I'll let Tim talk about the cash need to operate the company.\nTim Driggers: So what we have said is that of around $2 billion is the number we feel comfortable with through the cycles. That doesn't mean it's a hard-and-fast rule that we will have $2 billion on the balance sheet. Some quarters, it will be more; some quarters, it will be less, especially during the quarter based on how money comes in and out of the company. So that's the level that we're comfortable with for now.\nBilly Helms: Yeah. And Jeanine, the second part of the question is, I think it's important to know that our board is very, very committed to returning cash to shareholders. And we -- I think we've demonstrated that certainly, over the last 20 years, a 20% compounded annual increase in the dividend, the last four years, 146% increase. And then, last year, even in a down year, we increased the dividend and sustained it by 30%. So we're very committed to giving cash back. At the same time, we think it's important to be flexible and opportunistic, which means we want to be able to give the cash back in the way that it creates the most return, the most total shareholder return. And so that will be different in different situations. In an up-cycle, it certainly could be we want to continue to work on the regular dividend. That's the primary way we want to give cash back. And so we are gonna continue to work that really, really hard. And then, on top of that, we'll consider other things opportunistically. As the company continues to improve and get better and improve our free cash flow potential, which we think we're gonna be able to do very consistently over time, we'll consider other options. As Tim mentioned, potentially, a supplemental dividend; potentially, in certain situations, stock buybacks. And then, we are always looking at opportunistic low-cost, high-return bolt-on property acquisitions. And we did a number of those last year. Some of those were in our exploration plays. Some of those in -- really in the Delaware Basin, where we're actually drilling bolt-on acquisitions. So we're always looking to improve the drilling potential of the company through those kind of things, too. So we've got a lot of great options. We're very excited about having a lot of free cash flow and continuing to build on that. That's not a problem. That's a great opportunity. And we're just looking for the right way to redistribute that and generate the highest returns for the shareholders.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Bob Brackett. Please go ahead.\nBob Brackett: Hey, good morning. I was comparing the net expected well completions for this year by play versus last year. And am I over-interpreting it? But I see a decrease in the nonfederal areas, call it, the Texas Eagle Ford. I see a rise in the PRB in the Delaware. Is that program predicated on federal lease concerns or desires? Or am I over-interpreting?\nBill Thomas: I am going to ask Billy to answer that one.\nBilly Helms: Bob, no, I would say, we've -- in the past 10 years, a lot of our growth previously came from the Eagle Ford, and that is a more mature play at this point. And going forward, they still have quite a bit of inventory, and a lot of that is still double premium. But we see a lot of the growth coming from the Delaware Basin and the Powder River Basin, as you mentioned. Part of that is that in the last couple of years, even last year, we built out some infrastructure on federal land. And just as a natural progression of our development program, we start moving activity into those areas. That's true both in the Delaware and the Powder River Basin. But that's kind of where we see activity moving. And that will also help in the decline rate that Bill and Ezra we talked about earlier in the call.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: I want to continue on Jeanine's line of questioning. Thinking more about this year, you'll have about $2.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet post bond repayment, and you mentioned retaining $2 billion over the long term. But you also have the '23 maturity, and then you'll generate $1.5 billion of free cash at $50 this year and even more, another $1 billion or so at $60. So just how do you think about use of cash this year, especially if capex is not going to flex? How do you think about building cash for the '23 maturity? Is that above and beyond the $2 billion you mentioned? And how do you balance that against returning cash this year if the strip is right?\nTim Driggers: Sure. So we've already committed to spending $1.7 billion of the free cash flow through the payment of the bond that matured and then our regular dividend. So that's the first thing. And then, at the end of each quarter, we will review with the board what our cash position is, and we will look at, sight into the future and see what the condition as an industry look like and make decisions based on where we are at that point in time. So there's no hard-and-fast rule on what that answer will be. It's a long-term outlook, not a short-term outlook. So that's the way we're building this model.\nScott Gruber: Is the $2 billion kind of how you're thinking about the right cash balance for this year or does it, this is a little bit higher given the '23 maturity? How does that come into consideration?\nTim Driggers: No, the $2 billion is -- two pieces to the $2 billion; one is normal operating conditions and one is a surplus for abnormal operating conditions. So they're both built into that number, and that's the number that Tim Driggers feel comfortable with. So that's how that number was derived. Having lived through a lot of these cycles and knowing the size of our company, I know what I feel comfortable with to not be stressed in a stressful situation on the cash side. So that's how we derive that number.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nLeo Mariani: Just wanted to delve a little bit into the capex here in 2021. Certainly noticing from the slides that you guys are spending an extra $500 million kind of above maintenance. I wanted to get a sense of how much of that is devoted to some of these new exploration plays that you guys were discussing here. And then, ultimately, it sounds like there's quite a bit of testing happening with the drill bit in '21 versus last year. Do you guys see this year as really having a potential as kind of a breakout year for exploration success for EOG, given the higher spend.\nBill Thomas: Yeah, Leo, let me start that, and then I wanna ask Ezra to give some color on it. But the important thing to consider on our exploration program is that we're investing in plays that we believe will make a significant step-change in the performance of the company. And when I talk about that, that's in addition to the double-premium change we are making this year. It's above and beyond that. We're really looking for plays that are really the new technology we see for the future of horizontal drilling for the most part. These are much, much better rock and have the potential to be much better than -- and deliver results like lower decline rates to help us to generate even more free cash flow and higher returns than ever before. So we're investing in very significant potential -- future potential for the company. The breakdown on the half of the $500 million is $300 million in exploration and $100 million in international and $100 million in ESG projects. And I'm gonna let Ezra comment just in general on our exploration efforts and give a little bit more color.\nEzra Yacob: Thank you for the question, Leo. So as Bill highlighted, we pulled back in 2020 a little bit on our exploration budget, commensurate with reducing the capital spend across the board. And so we are excited this year to be able to return 2020 levels to kind of a pre-pandemic level or more of a historic balance level for the exploration side. And while I can't promise specifics on timing or anything like that, I can give you a little bit of color on how the process goes. And obviously, we like to capture leasehold, and we prefer not to talk in too great a detail about our exploration plays until we get the leasehold captured. And especially what we think is not only the Tier 1 areas, the sweet spot of these plays, but also in a contiguous position. And then, as you can see from the last few announcements, Dorado, the Powder River Basin and the Wolfcamp M and Third Bone Spring, we like to have a handful of wells tested, not only testing the geologic concepts and the producibility of the play but also just testing the repeatability on it. And so those things are different from each of these plays, each of the rock types, giving us the confidence and the transparency to start talking about those publicly. As Bill said, and you highlighted, we are leasing and testing across multiple plays this year. We're very excited about the potential that they'll dramatically increase the quality of the already-robust inventory that we have. And as we shifted from premium in 2016 to focus on double premium this year, we really think these exploration plays have the potential to deliver another significant step-change for EOG's performance in the future. And we're -- last thing I'd highlight is we are doing this at a time when much of the industry has really pulled back on any new exploration at all. And that leaves us in kind of a countercyclic opportunity here where we are excited that we've been able to put together these prospects and get them drilled and tested and provide a little additional color for you, guys, when we have the information.\nLeo Mariani: I really appreciate that. Just for my follow-up question, I just wanted to ask a little bit about kind of production cadence here on the oil side in 2021. Obviously, the goal is to kind of keep things roughly flat with the 4Q '20 levels of 442,000. You're kind of, obviously, starting at a lower point in 1Q because of a lot of the storm downtime. Does that imply that we're gonna see a bit of a gradual ramp on those volumes to kind of get to the average as we work our way into midyear and second-half '21 for the U.S. oil volumes?\nBilly Helms: Sure, Leo, no, the production each quarter will be about the same, targeting around that 440,000 barrels a day, which really was our target here in the first quarter. Obviously, the storm affected basically a one week of production, and that came largely in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford areas. All that production is back on now. And that downtime is gonna result in about a 4% decrease in the first-quarter production. And we've stated we've not -- we are not gonna grow production in an oversupplied market. So basically, once we kind of get this production -- now that the production is back on, we'll maintain this rate at around the 440,000 barrels a day in each of the remaining three quarters.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.\nNeal Dingmann: Bill, just a quick or easy question for you, or Tim, just wondering about hedging these days, your thoughts. You did pretty well with it in '20, when you had some on, you took off, realized the gains on that. So I'm just wondering, with the improvement we've seen in oil prices here, although we're in kind of, obviously, steep backwardization, how are you all thinking about that?\nBill Thomas: Yeah. Neal, we remain opportunistic on our hedging. Obviously, the price has moved up very dramatically here in the first quarter of the year, faster than really we had thought. We added a few hedges there at the beginning of the year, just to lock in above 50 and 55. But we're currently watching the market and watching it move up, and we'll be opportunistic and add hedges as we feel that they will be beneficial. And we have no hedges in natural gas at this time.\nNeal Dingmann: Okay. And then, just you guys have been successful on your organic exploration you've talked about. I'm just kind of curious, with the plan this year, as you have -- I guess, my question is, do you have a set plan on sort of regardless what happens to either pricing or the success of these plays throughout this year and into the '22 what you would do activity and sort of spending-wise on that? Is it pretty set? Or is that -- could that still ebb and flow.\nBill Thomas: We'll let Ezra talk about this.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Neal, thanks for the question. We have kind of a base plan setup for our exploration, but what I would say is much of it's going to be dependent on what we see -- how we get these leases put together and what we see on the early results of these plays. So we remain fairly flexible on how quickly we think we could start to allocate capital to these. What I would say, just a little more color, is all of our domestic exploration plays, as we've highlighted in the past, are in areas of preexisting oil and gas operations. So they're not frontier basins or anything like that. There is some form of infrastructure, albeit maybe legacy. And so we would be able to get these things kind of produced and up and moving once we have the results on the repeatability of the plays and have the acreage tied up.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBrian Singer: My first question is a two-part question with regards to the decline rate impact from the shift to double-premium locations. What characterizes either the underlying geology or what you're doing in your completion techniques to achieve these lower decline rates? Or is it just a shift away from the Eagle Ford? And then, if this represents a new capital-efficient shift for the company, why would it not push down maintenance capital below the $3.4 billion?\nBilly Helms: Sure, Brian, good morning. So as far as the decline rate shift, that's coming mostly from focusing our areas on better rock, to be honest, that as we mature the Eagle Ford Play, as we mentioned earlier, and more of our capital is going toward the Delaware Basin and even the Powder River Basin, in general, those are plays that had essentially better rock and capability of a lower decline. So that's a large part of that. And then, on the new -- with the shift in the capital efficiency and the maintenance capital, I would remind you, the $3.4 billion, when we set that, I guess, a year or so ago, that was at a production rate of about 420,000 barrels a day. And that was also pre-Dorado. So we are maintaining the $3.4 billion at a higher oil production rate of 440,000 barrels a day, and we've also added in the capital on Dorado because that is part of our announced plays going forward.\nBrian Singer: Great. Thanks. And my follow-up actually does involve Dorado because you mentioned that a couple of times in your prepared remarks as a potential global energy solution. And I wonder how you monetize that. Is there an LNG contract or partnership with a global player? Or are you taking a more bullish view on medium- or longer-term U.S. natural gas prices?\nBilly Helms: Brian I am going to ask Lance to talk about the L&G potential for Dorado?\nLance Terveen: Hey, Brian, good morning. This is Lance. Yeah, I mean, I think as we've talked about in the past, that's what makes it so exciting about the Dorado play. It's just -- when you think about the proximity to the market, I mean, we're so close to the proximity to both -- all our domestic customers, but then also the LNG markets as well. So I think the biggest thing, again, is just the proximity. It's the location. It all -- it's very complementary with what we've done in the past in a lot of our plays, moving gas downstream to, obviously, try to capture the highest prices. So we'll just continue to stay very opportunistic there, but the big thing I want to focus on is just the proximity and what's in place today.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Good morning, it's Doug Leggate, actually, from Bank of America. I'm afraid that I'm just going to focus on one issue, Bill, and you have to forgive me, it's on the growth plan post 2021. And I want to kind of just set this up a little bit. And then, my question really is why 8%, 10% is the right number and how you define a balanced market? Now I know I've gone through some of this before, but I just want to set it up here a little bit. Basically, just about everybody has dropped their breakeven price. And I think Saudi would argue that their optimal production rate is a lot higher than where it is today. So when you talk about an optimal plan, you talk about a $53 average oil price in the last four years, but we know that Saudi was subsidizing that. So I'm back to the same question I had a number of years ago, which is why when you represent 0.5% of global supply, it's OK to grow at 10% or 5% of global demand because that puts you back to being part of the problem? Hopefully, you see where I'm going with this because if everyone else said the same thing. The U.S. is 500,000 to 1 million barrels a day. And your price war comment, my last comment, I want to just offer a little different perspective on that. Saudi put 2 million barrels of a day on the market in April, put it on a ship and sent it to the U.S. That was a price war. It wasn't a Russia price war. It's an E&P U.S. subsidized growth price war. And so my question for you is, why is 10% OK? How do you define a balanced market? And will you revisit this at some point in the future because it puts us back in the same place you were a few years ago?\nBilly Helms: Yeah, Doug, yeah, thank you for the question. It's -- first of all, we've been really clear. We're not gonna push oil in an oversupplied market. We're very, very cognizant of the fragile recovery that we're in, and it's important that we don't put any more pressure on that and allow the market to recover. And we are going to watch that the rest of this year. Obviously, we're not gonna -- we've made a commitment. We're not going to be increasing production this year, and we'll watch it next year before we set our plan. So we're not -- we are not interested in growing oil in an oversupplied market, period. And when the market is right and we begin growth again, the reason that 8% to 10% is the right number because it really optimizes all the metrics in the company, returns and free cash flow potential over time. We got a great chart that we put together in Slide No. 10, and it really shows that the operating efficiency, the operating cost, the earnings and cash flow per share growth, the return on capital employed, the three-year cumulative free cash flow and the long-term free cash flow, all are at an optimal level at an 8% to 10% growth rate. If we go slower, some of those are not optimal; they're worse. If we grow faster than that, at the same thing, some of those are not optimal; they're worse. So the 8% to 10% really optimizes a balanced growth rate, a moderate growth rate, where the company can continue to get better very fast and optimize our returns, our earnings potential, our cash flow potential and our long-term free cash flow..\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Maybe as a quick follow-up then, Bill, on the same topic. So I understand the point about optimal, but optimal is because of what the strategy you decide to adopt. So for example, you don't need to spend $0.5 million or $1 billion on exploration. If you do, you could high grade. You never rightsize the company with a slow growth rate. And you still describe taking 5% of global demand as moderate. So I guess, my question is, between 2017 and 2019, Saudi have 2 million barrels a day held up to market before COVID. Is your definition of a balanced market that the lowest cost producer is still subsidizing the business by bringing back any production? Because that, by definition, is subsidizing your business. So optimal -- I'm just having a tough time understanding why you're not learning any lessons from growing nine times in 10 years with very little cumulative free cash flow, and your share price response, obviously, was terrible. So why is 5% global demand growth for a company with 0.5% global supply okay?\nBilly Helms: Yeah. I think there's two elements that we look at really closely, obviously, to determine whether the market is relatively balanced or not. One of them is the inventories. We want to see them get down to the five-year average or lower and keep hitting lower. Then the other is spare capacity, worldwide spare capacity. So we're watching spare capacity, and as it's -- at the moment, it's still 10 million barrels a day, and we need to have some work. So we want to get spare capacity down in the world to kind of a historic normal level. And so we'll be watching both of those. And we are very definitely committed to not overpressuring the market and working with the market we have to work with and staying disciplined and not trying to push oil or grow oil into an oversupplied market. We're making that commitment. We've always done that. We did it in 2015 and 2016. We didn't grow. We, obviously, shut in production last year, and we're staying -- we're maintaining that exit rate this year. So we're very disciplined and we're very cognizant of that. Beyond that, when the market is available, we want to run a company to generate the highest total return for the shareholder value. That is our job. We want to generate value, business value, really core business value. And that's what we're about, and that's what we're going to stay focused on.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.\nCharles Meade: I wanted to ask a question about your double-premium inventory and really the rate of change there. If you took that definition of double premium and applied that to your '19 program and your '20 program, what percentage of that '19 program or '20 program would have fit -- would have qualified for that double-premium bucket? And what's it gonna be in '21?\nBill Helms: Yeah, Charles, Yeah, the double premium, we've been building more double premium every year as we get our cost down and improve our well productivity. Last year, it was about 50%. In 2019, it was less than that. So last year, it was about 50%. And this year, our goal is to get it up to 75%, maybe even higher percent as that. And then, next year, it will even be higher than that. So we're focused on improving the wells, not only with the cost, but there's a slide, Slide No. 7, I think it is. It shows that these double-premium wells are much, much more productive. In fact, over the first two years, they cumed 39% more oil than the wells we've been drilling in the last several years. So they're better wells. Obviously, we're lowering our costs at the same time. And I think that's really a differentiator for EOG. As the industry data shows, most of the industry well productivity is flattening out. Where at EOG, the well productivity is continuing to increase. So we're not through. We're gonna get better every year. We figure out how to target better rock. Our completion technology continues to increase. Obviously, our well costs are going down significantly. And all that is sustainable. And that's on really the EOG culture and our methodology of not really getting into a maintenance mode and just doing routine every well the same. We are in the learning process. We gather tremendous amount of data and technology. We're learning the geologies. We drill the wells. We're learning the pay quality. And we're figuring out just continuously on a real-time basis how to get better in every aspect of the company. And so we're excited about our future and continuing to increase returns and capital efficiency and free cash flow potential as we go forward.\nCharles Meade: Thank you, Bill, that's helpful insight into your thinking process. And perhaps, picking up that one thread on better rock, am I interpreting that the right way that -- is that essentially the shift from these -- the resource shale plays more toward these combo-clastic kind of plays? And is that a -- is that just kind of a coincidence? Or is that more of a fundamental arrow for you guys?\nBill Helms: Well it's not a coincidence. I am going to let Ezra talk about that.\nEzra Yacob: Yeah. Charles, thanks. That's perfect. You kind of hit the nail on the head. As you move away from these, the actual true shale plays themselves are some of the tightest rock. And so as we've moved into not only different basins and different formations but especially targeting the specific landing zones. As we've developed some of our petrophysical, some of our geologic models to really understand the specific landing zones in rocks like the Austin Chalk per se, you fundamentally have higher porosity and permeability, just better all around rock quality that adds to not only the returns but also, as Bill was highlighting, to the shallower decline profile.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nPaul Cheng: Two questions, please. Last year, you signed a gas supply agreement. That seems to be well timed, given the sharp rise in the JKM prices. Can you tell us that what is that volume for this year? And how quickly you would ramp to 440 million cubic feet per day? How many years that we get there? And also that since it's linked to both JKM and Henry Hub, can you tell us that what percent is on JKM and what percent is in Henry Hub? That's the first question. Second question, I think this is probably for Bill. Some of your competitors have decided to formalize the excess cash return framework that once that they have excess free cash after capex and paid dividend, they will pay that out. Just curious that why from EOG standpoint, you don't think that will be a maybe workable program for you because I think the market would love cash return, but that they also love transparency and sort of understanding that under what circumstances they can get what. So just curious that, why that we do not believe that will fit into the EOG model? Thank you.\nBill Helms: Yeah Paul, I am going to ask Lance to talk about the JKM.\nLance Terveen: Hey, yeah, thanks for your question, especially related to LNG. Yeah, I'd say it was fairly bearish last year, right, related to JKM and just global LNG pricing with the warm weather and, obviously, the oversupply. And things have changed, haven't they, quite drastically to where, on a go forward, it looks very constructive, definitely, as you look at global prices. So yes, just as a reminder there, Paul, we've got 140 million a day that goes into that agreement that we have with Cheniere. Like you said, we're excited for the benefit there that we've seen, especially in a go forward. We kind of had that view going into before and finalizing our agreement. We're definitely constructive kind of long-term related to global prices. And obviously, having exposure to JKM and being very correlated with oil too and having the upside, that's where we kind of wanted to be positioned from an LNG pricing standpoint. So yes, we've been very pleased here in the first quarter with that pricing and constructive from a long-term standpoint as well. And yes, your second question was -- there was just kind of how it ramps up, and you're right. It's the 140 million is the JKM, and there's an additional 300 million that will be tied to Henry Hub.\nPaul Cheng: And for the JKM, is that the one to one or that is a factor?\nBill Thomas: Paul, could you ask that one more time please sir.\nPaul Cheng: For the link to the JKM, is it a direct price you get the JKM? Or you say factors? Is there an S-curve or anything like that?\nBill Thomas: I am not going to go into the specifics contractually, but it's very familiar from what you've heard from Cheniere as well in their IPO model. And so that's how we've structured that.\nOperator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Bill Thomas for any closing remarks.\nBill Thomas: 2020 was a year with many challenges, and I'm so very proud of the employees of EOG. They responded with an exceptional performance in an exceptional year. We entered 2021 and this next up-cycle with lower cost and more potential than ever in the history of the company. Our organization and culture are focused on improving returns, playing a significant role in the future of energy and delivering substantial long-term shareholder value. So thanks for listening, and thanks for your support.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and at this time, you may now disconnect your lines.",

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Bill Thomas",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Last year was historic, and we were tested like never before. In a challenging environment, I am proud to say our EOG employees who personify our unique culture responded exceptionally without a beat. I'd like to thank our employees for delivering such outstanding performance. We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow, earned adjusted net income of $850 million and ended the year with $3.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We increased our sustainable dividend rate by 30% and shored up what was already an industry-leading balance sheet to a low 11% net debt-to-cap ratio. We lowered our finding and development cost, improved our capital efficiency and earned a direct after-tax rate of return of more than 50%, with an all-in after-tax rate of return of 25% based on our premium price deck of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. Such extraordinary results in a $39 oil price environment were made possible by our shift five years ago to our premium strategy, which established an investment hurdle rate of 30% direct after-tax rate of return using flat $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas prices. Using such a stringent hurdle rate shields the company from cyclic oil and gas prices. 2020 was a true test of that shield, and that is a testament to the power of our premium strategy. Beyond delivering stellar financial results last year, we continued to invest in long-term value of the company. Through our low-cost organic efforts, we added 1,500 net premium locations to our inventory, including 1,250 from the newest addition to our portfolio, Dorado, a South Texas natural gas play with 21 Tcf of net resource potential at a breakeven price of less than $1.25 per Mcf. We believe Dorado is one of the lowest cost and lowest emissions natural gas fields in the U.S. and expands EOG's portfolio of assets that we believe will play a significant role in the long-term global energy solution. We also completed two pilots of infield technology to reduce emissions, a hybrid solar and natural gas-powered compressor station that reduces combustion emissions and a closed-loop gas capture system to reduce force flaring as a result of downstream market interruptions. Reducing flaring is an industrywide priority, and we plan to publish our closed-loop gas capture technology for others to replicate. We entered the next phase of the cycle a much improved company. With the countless, creative and innovative ideas we implemented in 2020, we're in the process of making significant improvements to EOG's future performance. Looking forward, the following six steps summarize the foundation for our 2021 plan and outlook for the next three years. Number one, maintain fourth-quarter 2020 production. There is no reason to consider growth until the market rebalances. Signs of an earlier recovery will not change our $3.9 billion 2021 capital plan. Number two, shift to a double-premium drilling program. Our focus on increasing returns never waivers, and this year is no exception. We're raising the investment standard again. Double-premium wells earn 60% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas and make up the top half of our 23-year drilling inventory. Shifting to double premium will make another step-change in our future performance by delivering higher returns, lower decline rates and more free cash flow potential. We have more than 10 years of double-premium inventory and are optimistic we will replace double-premium locations faster than we drill them. Number three, accelerate new exploration projects. Last year, our exploration program focused on technical evaluations across numerous new prospects. We're excited to resume a more robust leasing and testing effort this year. We're evaluating a large number of double-premium oil plays in the U.S. and internationally with the potential to deliver low finding costs and development costs and low production decline rates. The focus of our exploration program is to continue to improve the quality of our inventory and EOG's total shareholder value. Number four, raise the bar again on our ESG performance and ambitions. After achieving significant improvements in safety, emissions and water performance in 2020, we have announced our ambition to reach net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040. As one of the steps along the way, we expect to eliminate routine flaring by 2025. We believe this is possible using creative applications of current and future technology. We're currently implementing internally developed technology with a goal of measuring granular real-time emissions data for all facilities in the company. This will encourage innovation and development of unique solutions to achieve our net zero ambition. Number five, resume moderate production growth only when the market is balanced. Assuming a balanced market by year-end, we are positioned to grow oil 8% to 10% in 2022 and 2023. We forecast that our shifting well mix toward double premium will lower our base decline rate to less than 25% within five years from 34% last year. This optimal growth rate delivers the most long-term total value by delivering higher returns, lower decline rates and more free cash flow over the long term. And number six, generate significant free cash flow. All cash allocation decisions are focused on enhancing total long-term shareholder value. Our top priorities for free cash flow are to sustainably grow the dividend and reduce debt. Beyond these priorities, when excess cash materializes, we will evaluate other options opportunistically, such as supplemental dividends, share repurchases and low-cost property additions. With our deep inventory of double-premium locations, moderating decline rates and sustainable cost reductions, EOG's free cash flow potential is improving significantly. Before I turn it over to Billy, I want to address our thoughts on federal acreage. From the statements made by the current administration, we believe that our current existing federal leases and corresponding federal drilling inventory can be fully developed. EOG is well prepared to manage through any regulatory changes that could impact the pace of development on federal acreage. The combination of our large number of federal permits in hand, our flexibility to pivot within our deep inventory of double-premium locations and our ability to add new inventory through organic exploration gives us the confidence that the future performance of the company will not be affected. Now here's Billy. Thanks, Tim. In conclusion, I would like to note the following important takeaways. First, due to market conditions, EOG will not accelerate production in 2021. Second, after this year, once the market rebalances, developing our current drilling inventory at a moderate growth rate of 8% to 10% optimizes returns and free cash flow potential over time. Third, our shift to double-premium investment metrics paves the way for another step-change in EOG's returns and future performance. Fourth, our domestic and international exploration portfolio is stronger in both quality and quantity than it's ever been. This year, we are accelerating the testing and leasing efforts on many of those prospects that have the potential to significantly enhance total shareholder value of the company. Our exploration projects have the potential for higher returns, lower costs and lower decline rates than our current inventory. And finally, we are passionate and excited about the innovation and technology that continues to manifest itself in EOG. It gives us confidence that we will continue to lower well costs and operating costs and reduce our environmental footprint. Our goal for EOG is to be one of the lowest-cost, highest-return and lowest-emissions producers playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A. Hi Arun. I'm going to ask Billy to comment on that. I am going to ask Billy to answer that one. Yeah, Leo, let me start that, and then I wanna ask Ezra to give some color on it. But the important thing to consider on our exploration program is that we're investing in plays that we believe will make a significant step-change in the performance of the company. And when I talk about that, that's in addition to the double-premium change we are making this year. It's above and beyond that. We're really looking for plays that are really the new technology we see for the future of horizontal drilling for the most part. These are much, much better rock and have the potential to be much better than -- and deliver results like lower decline rates to help us to generate even more free cash flow and higher returns than ever before. So we're investing in very significant potential -- future potential for the company. The breakdown on the half of the $500 million is $300 million in exploration and $100 million in international and $100 million in ESG projects. And I'm gonna let Ezra comment just in general on our exploration efforts and give a little bit more color. Yeah. Neal, we remain opportunistic on our hedging. Obviously, the price has moved up very dramatically here in the first quarter of the year, faster than really we had thought. We added a few hedges there at the beginning of the year, just to lock in above 50 and 55. But we're currently watching the market and watching it move up, and we'll be opportunistic and add hedges as we feel that they will be beneficial. And we have no hedges in natural gas at this time. We'll let Ezra talk about this. Paul, could you ask that one more time please sir. I am not going to go into the specifics contractually, but it's very familiar from what you've heard from Cheniere as well in their IPO model. And so that's how we've structured that. 2020 was a year with many challenges, and I'm so very proud of the employees of EOG. They responded with an exceptional performance in an exceptional year. We entered 2021 and this next up-cycle with lower cost and more potential than ever in the history of the company. Our organization and culture are focused on improving returns, playing a significant role in the future of energy and delivering substantial long-term shareholder value. So thanks for listening, and thanks for your support."

            "name": "Billy Helms",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill. Let me start by expressing my warmest appreciation to all of our employees. I am truly amazed by their talent, commitment and resiliency as demonstrated by the dramatic improvements achieved in 2020. Within weeks of publishing our initial 2020 capital plan, we quickly cut capital by scaling back activity by nearly half. To protect the company's financial strength, our employees responded with urgency and purpose, finding new ways to sustainably reduce our well cost structure further. What stands out the most to me is how the EOG culture of innovation and multidisciplinary collaboration and teamwork increased at a time when everyone was working remotely to protect themselves, their families and their communities. The results of that innovation and teamwork can be seen clearly in our 2020 operational performance. We significantly improved our capital efficiency by reducing total well cost 15% and per unit cash operating cost 4%. With respect to our year-end reserves and excluding the low impact of low commodity prices, we reduced finding and development costs 15% to a low of $6.98 per barrel of oil equivalent and replaced nearly 160% of our 2020 production. The speed with which we spread technical innovations directed at lowering cost and improving well performance throughout the company has increased. We believe the communication challenge presented by remote work and the teamwork required between individual operational areas to execute our significantly revised plan last year inspired what we believe will be a permanent improvement in how we integrate new learnings and innovations companywide. Our operational execution fired on all cylinders during 2020, reaching our stretch goal to reduce well costs 15% last year with about three-quarters of that coming from sustainable efficiency improvements. We expect to maintain this momentum and reduce well cost another 5% this year. We also expect to carry sustainable operating cost reductions into 2021. Our reductions to LOE during 2020 remarkably outpaced the volume reductions and shut-in production as a result of exceptionally low commodity pricing. We reduced LOE 22% on a total-dollar basis versus 8% decline in production volumes. Shutting in volumes afforded us the opportunity to take a closer look at our maintenance and workover programs and streamline our lease upkeep practices, resulting in sustainable cost reductions. We finished the year with fourth-quarter oil production at a little over 440,000 barrels of oil per day and having spent $3.5 billion of capital, exactly what we forecasted back in May when we revised our plan in response to the downturn in oil prices. We increased our rig count from a low of five rigs last summer and are now running about 24 rigs to support a 2021 program that will maintain essentially flat oil volumes. The rig count is currently at the high point, and it will drift down throughout the year to an average of about 22 rigs. Looking back to when we introduced the premium strategy in 2016, our per unit cash operating costs have declined by 18%, and our per foot well costs are down about 40%. This operational excellence has enabled EOG to raise the bar further and target double premium as our new investment standard. With such significant progress the past five years and the momentum we are carrying, I'm convinced we are only just getting started at being one of the lowest-cost energy suppliers. We also made significant strides in our ESG performance in 2020. First, on the safety side, our total recordable incident rate, the primary safety metric, improved more than 25%. Safety is always our first priority, and we continue to focus on ways to enhance our safety culture even further. On the environmental side, we increased the percent of reused water used in our operation to about 45% of our supply and significantly reduced total barrels of freshwater used. And we increased our already-strong wellhead gas capture rate from 98.8% in 2019 to an astounding 99.6% in 2020. Our ambitions for the future are a reflection of that performance. We have set a goal to raise the wellhead gas capture rate to 99.8% in 2021 and achieve zero routine flaring by 2025. We're literally fighting for the last remaining 0.1 percentage point now. Longer term, we have set an ambition to be net zero in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040. Ultimately, it is our highly creative and passionate employees that gives me confidence in this aspiration. In the past five years, we have achieved a number of technical innovations and operational advancements that have enabled us to generate significant reductions in methane and overall GHG intensity rates to date. Our approach to emissions reductions remains operationally focused, investing with returns in mind and seeking achievable and scalable results. Our investments in projects such as closed-loop gas capture and solar-powered compression pay off in two ways; they lower emissions and function as learning mechanisms for future innovation. We know that to be part of the long-term energy solution, we not only have to be low cost; we have to do it with one of the lowest environmental footprints. Our newly formed Sustainable Power Group is working to identify low emissions power generation solutions and accelerate innovations to support our missions, goals and ambitions. I'm excited about all the innovation occurring in the company, and that gives me confidence we can achieve our goals and ambitions. Finally, I want to take a minute to express my sincere gratitude for the tireless efforts of our production and marketing teams in the wake of the severe winter weather event last week. The teams worked in difficult conditions without any safety incidents to manage the production interruptions caused by extensive freezing weather and delivered as much critical production to our downstream customers as possible. All of our production is now back online, and we expect our average daily production in the first quarter to be reduced by about 4%. Beginning with the onset of the storm, the production staff also worked in close coordination with our marketing team who communicated with our downstream customers to redirect natural gas production in Texas to local distribution companies that deliver natural gas to heat homes and to utilities for electric power generation. These efforts supported by critical -- these efforts supported critical human needs throughout the Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin, Houston and other Central and East Texas communities. Further, in line with our core values at EOG, we sold these redirected gas shipments at prices consistent with those received prior to the winter weather event rather than high and volatile daily spot prices. Through it all, the EOG culture of interdisciplinary teamwork and nonbureaucratic decision-making, technology leadership and commitment to do the right thing shone through, and I couldn't be more proud of everyone involved. Here's Ezra for an update on our exploration efforts. Yeah, Arun, no, we don't anticipate that we would have to spend any additional capital this year to be able to accommodate growth in the future. And beyond this year, I would add that we'll only add activity once we see a more balanced market, as Bill described. Yeah Jeanine, I'll let Tim talk about the cash need to operate the company. Yeah. And Jeanine, the second part of the question is, I think it's important to know that our board is very, very committed to returning cash to shareholders. And we -- I think we've demonstrated that certainly, over the last 20 years, a 20% compounded annual increase in the dividend, the last four years, 146% increase. And then, last year, even in a down year, we increased the dividend and sustained it by 30%. So we're very committed to giving cash back. At the same time, we think it's important to be flexible and opportunistic, which means we want to be able to give the cash back in the way that it creates the most return, the most total shareholder return. And so that will be different in different situations. In an up-cycle, it certainly could be we want to continue to work on the regular dividend. That's the primary way we want to give cash back. And so we are gonna continue to work that really, really hard. And then, on top of that, we'll consider other things opportunistically. As the company continues to improve and get better and improve our free cash flow potential, which we think we're gonna be able to do very consistently over time, we'll consider other options. As Tim mentioned, potentially, a supplemental dividend; potentially, in certain situations, stock buybacks. And then, we are always looking at opportunistic low-cost, high-return bolt-on property acquisitions. And we did a number of those last year. Some of those were in our exploration plays. Some of those in -- really in the Delaware Basin, where we're actually drilling bolt-on acquisitions. So we're always looking to improve the drilling potential of the company through those kind of things, too. So we've got a lot of great options. We're very excited about having a lot of free cash flow and continuing to build on that. That's not a problem. That's a great opportunity. And we're just looking for the right way to redistribute that and generate the highest returns for the shareholders. Bob, no, I would say, we've -- in the past 10 years, a lot of our growth previously came from the Eagle Ford, and that is a more mature play at this point. And going forward, they still have quite a bit of inventory, and a lot of that is still double premium. But we see a lot of the growth coming from the Delaware Basin and the Powder River Basin, as you mentioned. Part of that is that in the last couple of years, even last year, we built out some infrastructure on federal land. And just as a natural progression of our development program, we start moving activity into those areas. That's true both in the Delaware and the Powder River Basin. But that's kind of where we see activity moving. And that will also help in the decline rate that Bill and Ezra we talked about earlier in the call. Sure, Leo, no, the production each quarter will be about the same, targeting around that 440,000 barrels a day, which really was our target here in the first quarter. Obviously, the storm affected basically a one week of production, and that came largely in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford areas. All that production is back on now. And that downtime is gonna result in about a 4% decrease in the first-quarter production. And we've stated we've not -- we are not gonna grow production in an oversupplied market. So basically, once we kind of get this production -- now that the production is back on, we'll maintain this rate at around the 440,000 barrels a day in each of the remaining three quarters. Sure, Brian, good morning. So as far as the decline rate shift, that's coming mostly from focusing our areas on better rock, to be honest, that as we mature the Eagle Ford Play, as we mentioned earlier, and more of our capital is going toward the Delaware Basin and even the Powder River Basin, in general, those are plays that had essentially better rock and capability of a lower decline. So that's a large part of that. And then, on the new -- with the shift in the capital efficiency and the maintenance capital, I would remind you, the $3.4 billion, when we set that, I guess, a year or so ago, that was at a production rate of about 420,000 barrels a day. And that was also pre-Dorado. So we are maintaining the $3.4 billion at a higher oil production rate of 440,000 barrels a day, and we've also added in the capital on Dorado because that is part of our announced plays going forward. Brian I am going to ask Lance to talk about the L&G potential for Dorado? Yeah, Doug, yeah, thank you for the question. It's -- first of all, we've been really clear. We're not gonna push oil in an oversupplied market. We're very, very cognizant of the fragile recovery that we're in, and it's important that we don't put any more pressure on that and allow the market to recover. And we are going to watch that the rest of this year. Obviously, we're not gonna -- we've made a commitment. We're not going to be increasing production this year, and we'll watch it next year before we set our plan. So we're not -- we are not interested in growing oil in an oversupplied market, period. And when the market is right and we begin growth again, the reason that 8% to 10% is the right number because it really optimizes all the metrics in the company, returns and free cash flow potential over time. We got a great chart that we put together in Slide No. 10, and it really shows that the operating efficiency, the operating cost, the earnings and cash flow per share growth, the return on capital employed, the three-year cumulative free cash flow and the long-term free cash flow, all are at an optimal level at an 8% to 10% growth rate. If we go slower, some of those are not optimal; they're worse. If we grow faster than that, at the same thing, some of those are not optimal; they're worse. So the 8% to 10% really optimizes a balanced growth rate, a moderate growth rate, where the company can continue to get better very fast and optimize our returns, our earnings potential, our cash flow potential and our long-term free cash flow.. Yeah. I think there's two elements that we look at really closely, obviously, to determine whether the market is relatively balanced or not. One of them is the inventories. We want to see them get down to the five-year average or lower and keep hitting lower. Then the other is spare capacity, worldwide spare capacity. So we're watching spare capacity, and as it's -- at the moment, it's still 10 million barrels a day, and we need to have some work. So we want to get spare capacity down in the world to kind of a historic normal level. And so we'll be watching both of those. And we are very definitely committed to not overpressuring the market and working with the market we have to work with and staying disciplined and not trying to push oil or grow oil into an oversupplied market. We're making that commitment. We've always done that. We did it in 2015 and 2016. We didn't grow. We, obviously, shut in production last year, and we're staying -- we're maintaining that exit rate this year. So we're very disciplined and we're very cognizant of that. Beyond that, when the market is available, we want to run a company to generate the highest total return for the shareholder value. That is our job. We want to generate value, business value, really core business value. And that's what we're about, and that's what we're going to stay focused on."

            "content": "Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions, as well as reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call or in the accompanying investor presentation slides may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday. Participating on the call this morning are; Bill Thomas, chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, chief operating officer; Ezra Yacob, president; Ken Boedeker, EVP, exploration and production; Lance Terveen, senior VP marketing; and David Streit, VP, investor and public relations. Here's Bill Thomas Thanks, Ezra. EOG's financial performance in 2020 demonstrates the resiliency of our business model and portfolio of high-return assets. In response to the lower oil prices caused by the price war and pandemic, we elected to utilize our operational flexibility to quickly cut activity. Levered by the sustainable cost deductions that Billy discussed, we reduced capex in 2020 by 44% to $3.5 billion. The result was $1.6 billion of free cash flow, a great performance in what we certainly hope will prove to be the bottom of the cycle year. The board of directors voted to increase the dividend by 10% to an annual rate of $1.65 per share. EOG's dividend has grown at a compounded annual rate of 20% over the last 21 years. This reflects the continued improvement in the profitability and cost structure of the company and our confidence in EOG's long-term resiliency. I'm pleased to say we have never cut the dividend and never issued equity to support it. We analyze numerous stress down-cycle scenarios to evaluate the size of the dividend and to ensure it can be sustained over the long run. The regular dividend represents our first priority for returning cash -- free cash flow to shareholders. Beyond that, we have set a target to reduce debt outstanding by $2 billion from the level at the end of last year. We have made a down payment on that goal, paying off with cash on hand a $750 million bond that matured in February 1. There are no additional debt maturities until 2023 when a $1.25 billion bond is scheduled to mature. Beyond that, we have no plans to further reduce debt. Our goal is to maintain about $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet on average through cycles. This is not a hard-and-fast rule. The actual amount of cash on the balance sheet at the end of each quarter will vary depending on business conditions at the time, but this should give you some rough idea of what to expect going forward. EOG is firmly committed to generating significant free cash flow. Our top priorities for free cash flow remain -- is to remain sustainable dividend growth and debt reduction. As cash materializes and we have more visibility into the future, we will opportunistically consider other options, such as a supplemental dividend during the up-cycles or share repurchases during market lows, along with low-cost property additions with potential to improve EOG's performance. Now let me turn the call back to Bill. Arun, this is Tim. Yeah, so as we become more and more profitable, obviously, it has lowered the price that we have to make a taxable income. So that's the first thing. We are an extremely profitable company now. And if you go back and look to the -- to 2020, for sure, in the $39 oil, there wasn't much tax profit there. So in the $50 environment, we have significant taxable income, and we have no net operating losses left to offset that with. So it's a simple math of being a very profitable company and paying taxes. So beyond that, I could clarify it more offline, if you'd like, but that's the general answer. That's exactly right. As we spend more capital in the growth mode obviously we'll have more IDCs to deduct to lower our cash taxes. So it a backward dated environment where we got lower oil prices then yes, it would lower that deferred ratio. So what we have said is that of around $2 billion is the number we feel comfortable with through the cycles. That doesn't mean it's a hard-and-fast rule that we will have $2 billion on the balance sheet. Some quarters, it will be more; some quarters, it will be less, especially during the quarter based on how money comes in and out of the company. So that's the level that we're comfortable with for now. Sure. So we've already committed to spending $1.7 billion of the free cash flow through the payment of the bond that matured and then our regular dividend. So that's the first thing. And then, at the end of each quarter, we will review with the board what our cash position is, and we will look at, sight into the future and see what the condition as an industry look like and make decisions based on where we are at that point in time. So there's no hard-and-fast rule on what that answer will be. It's a long-term outlook, not a short-term outlook. So that's the way we're building this model. No, the $2 billion is -- two pieces to the $2 billion; one is normal operating conditions and one is a surplus for abnormal operating conditions. So they're both built into that number, and that's the number that Tim Driggers feel comfortable with. So that's how that number was derived. Having lived through a lot of these cycles and knowing the size of our company, I know what I feel comfortable with to not be stressed in a stressful situation on the cash side. So that's how we derive that number."

            "content": "Thanks, Billy. Our organic exploration focus has always been the driver behind successfully replacing what we drill every year with better inventory. Our current effort is built around adding plays with shallower decline rates that also meet our double-premium hurdle rate, ultimately offering higher capital efficiency than our existing inventory. Dorado, the South Texas natural gas play we announced late last year, is the most recent example of EOG creating shareholder value through low-cost organic exploration. Early entry and capture of a high-quality reservoir across a contiguous acreage position with access to low-cost services and proximity to multiple markets is the recipe for a high-return investment opportunity and is exactly the type of prospect we're looking for. Our strong financial position, combined with our proprietary database of unconventional plays, has positioned us to capitalize countercyclically and capture exploration opportunities with little to no competition. We are focused on oil, and we are in the process of drilling and testing high-potential prospects. We are optimistic we can prove up a number of them and capture additional acreage at competitive pricing that will further improve the quality of what we believe is already one of the best portfolios of assets in the industry. Our vision is to develop double-premium oil plays in each operating area, including international. This is highly efficient and allows us to allocate capital across a wide array of plays to optimize returns and capital efficiency. This decentralized multi-basin approach is a hallmark of EOG, one that leverages our competitive advantages in exploration, technology and low-cost operations, all benefiting from knowledge transfer between the basins. The results, if we are successful, will flow through our financials with higher return on capital employed, lower operating costs, higher capital efficiency, shallower declines and even more free cash flow. When we look back at this time several years from now, I'm confident we will recognize 2021 as a step-change in EOG's performance and financial profile, much like we look back on our shift to premium drilling in 2016. Here's Tim to review our financial position. Thank you for the question, Leo. So as Bill highlighted, we pulled back in 2020 a little bit on our exploration budget, commensurate with reducing the capital spend across the board. And so we are excited this year to be able to return 2020 levels to kind of a pre-pandemic level or more of a historic balance level for the exploration side. And while I can't promise specifics on timing or anything like that, I can give you a little bit of color on how the process goes. And obviously, we like to capture leasehold, and we prefer not to talk in too great a detail about our exploration plays until we get the leasehold captured. And especially what we think is not only the Tier 1 areas, the sweet spot of these plays, but also in a contiguous position. And then, as you can see from the last few announcements, Dorado, the Powder River Basin and the Wolfcamp M and Third Bone Spring, we like to have a handful of wells tested, not only testing the geologic concepts and the producibility of the play but also just testing the repeatability on it. And so those things are different from each of these plays, each of the rock types, giving us the confidence and the transparency to start talking about those publicly. As Bill said, and you highlighted, we are leasing and testing across multiple plays this year. We're very excited about the potential that they'll dramatically increase the quality of the already-robust inventory that we have. And as we shifted from premium in 2016 to focus on double premium this year, we really think these exploration plays have the potential to deliver another significant step-change for EOG's performance in the future. And we're -- last thing I'd highlight is we are doing this at a time when much of the industry has really pulled back on any new exploration at all. And that leaves us in kind of a countercyclic opportunity here where we are excited that we've been able to put together these prospects and get them drilled and tested and provide a little additional color for you, guys, when we have the information. Yes, Neal, thanks for the question. We have kind of a base plan setup for our exploration, but what I would say is much of it's going to be dependent on what we see -- how we get these leases put together and what we see on the early results of these plays. So we remain fairly flexible on how quickly we think we could start to allocate capital to these. What I would say, just a little more color, is all of our domestic exploration plays, as we've highlighted in the past, are in areas of preexisting oil and gas operations. So they're not frontier basins or anything like that. There is some form of infrastructure, albeit maybe legacy. And so we would be able to get these things kind of produced and up and moving once we have the results on the repeatability of the plays and have the acreage tied up. Yeah. Charles, thanks. That's perfect. You kind of hit the nail on the head. As you move away from these, the actual true shale plays themselves are some of the tightest rock. And so as we've moved into not only different basins and different formations but especially targeting the specific landing zones. As we've developed some of our petrophysical, some of our geologic models to really understand the specific landing zones in rocks like the Austin Chalk per se, you fundamentally have higher porosity and permeability, just better all around rock quality that adds to not only the returns but also, as Bill was highlighting, to the shallower decline profile."

Here's Bill Thomas.\nBill Thomas: Thanks Tim and good morning everyone. Our third quarter results underscore EOG's unique ability to organically create sustainable shareholder value through the commodity cycle. Along with substantial cost reductions and solid earnings results, we announced Dorado our new premium South Texas natural gas play. We also introduced a three-year reinvestment and production outlook. First, I want to highlight our stellar execution this year then provide some context on our capital allocation and three-year outlook. We continue to make rapid and sustainable improvements to our cost structure and capital efficiency through innovation while also improving the quality and size of our premium portfolio through exploration. Our results show we can invest in both innovation and exploration to improve the company, while also generating significant free cash flow improving the balance sheet and protecting the dividend. Capital spend for the third quarter was $2.7 billion over $300 million less than our revised plan had forecasted. In the third quarter, we substantially beat our cash unit cost targets as well as each of our oil, NGL, and natural gas production targets. As a result we have generated more than $930 million of free cash flow year-to-date already more than enough to cover the full year dividend. Our 21 Tcf Dorado natural gas play announced yesterday is a great example of EOG's ability to identify and capture high-quality rock and add substantial premium inventory to our organic exploration efforts. We believe Dorado will be one of the lowest cost and lowest emission natural gas plays in the U.S. with advantaged access to both domestic market hubs and international market via LNG. EOG has a long and successful exploration history and we continue to be excited about the potential of our current exploration portfolio. I'm incredibly proud of EOG employees' performance during this pandemic. They remain highly motivated and have demonstrated EOG's return-focused culture by improving the company at a record pace in a volatile environment. We will encourage -- we will emerge from this downturn an even stronger company positioning EOG to excel through the commodity price cycles. Yesterday, we also introduced a three-year outlook. The goals of disclosing this outlook are to provide more transparency into our capital allocation process and meaningful visibility into the next three years particularly given the ongoing level of uncertainty in the oil and gas market. Our capital and growth profile optimizes the total shareholder value of the company through the cycles. Our strategy remains dynamic and our operations are flexible enough to adjust our spending to match market conditions. At the bottom of the cycle as we find ourselves today we have no interest in growing oil into an overbalanced market. In an improved market, our disciplined growth strategy compounds the benefits of growth and continuous operational improvements to optimize returns and free cash flow potential and maximize long-term shareholder value. EOG represents a full-cycle investment opportunity. At lower prices, EOG is clearly a sustainable business. Maintenance capital and the dividend can be funded with oil in the mid-30s. In a more constructive market, EOG has significant leverage to higher oil prices through high-return reinvestment and significant incremental free cash flow. EOG has a unique business model in our industry. We approach this business differently which has become more apparent than ever with recent industry developments. First, the state of recent M&A activity stands in contrast to one of our most distinctive competitive advantages, organic exploration. Capturing high-quality rock is the primary way of improving the quality of our premium inventory. It's how we create more value than our competitors. Our newest play Dorado is a prime example. It's great rock in a great location and that's a resource you can't buy through M&A. Second, we're decentralized. Value is created in the field, not at headquarters. The exploration idea behind Dorado emerged bottom-up from one of our eight operating areas. In fact, perhaps for the first time in our history, every one of our eight areas has significant potential for premium plays, plays that if successful, will add to the top of our inventory not the bottom. Third, the improvements we're making are sustainable. The number one source of our cost reduction this year is from innovation, not cyclic service price reductions. Once again, that's the power of our decentralized organization. It's an innovation incubator and a driving force behind EOG's leading performance. Fourth, we execute our operational plans reliably and consistently. This year, we worked hard to provide transparency in our operations by providing guidance throughout one of the most volatile periods in the industry's history and we've delivered on our plan. Fifth, performance drives our ESG efforts, not PR. We believe the demand for oil and natural gas will gravitate towards the most efficient producers, the most efficient from a capital perspective and the most efficient from an emissions perspective. Our goal is to be part of the long-term global energy solution, while generating strong returns for our shareholders. Finally, and most importantly, we believe we have the most talented and motivated employees in the industry. We've not laid-off employees and we've empowered our workforce by leveraging our robust information technology infrastructure to support collaboration and innovation. Our employees and culture are a massive competitive advantage during these unusual times. And we're not standing still. Our relentless drive to improve means that, this is just a starting point. We are confident that we will continue to improve performance through the development of new plays like Dorado, further cost reductions and well productivity improvements. We're excited about the future of EOG. Now, here's Tim.\nTim Driggers: Thanks, Bill. Our goal is to maximize shareholder value through the cycles. We measure our progress against a number of metrics, return on capital, free cash flow, sustainable dividend growth, operating cost and finding cost and financial leverage. We create business value through a balanced approach that maximizes returns as well as both current and future free cash flow generation. It's an integrated optimization exercise, not a simple formula. Reinvestment ratios and growth rates are outputs of this exercise. Our three-year outlook provided this quarter addresses the currently oversupplied market and assumes gradual improvement over the next three years. Our plan each year is based on conservative price assumptions. The pace of activity is optimized to generate high returns on incremental capital, increased return on capital employed, support improvements in operating efficiencies and technical advances and fund our free cash flow priorities. That said, our outlook is just that an outlook. We have operational flexibility to adapt quickly to changing supply demand conditions. At $50 oil, reinvesting 70% to 80% of discretionary cash flow, generates up to 10% oil growth, with significant free cash flow. At higher prices, we would expect to maintain this optimal level of activity and production growth, while returns and free cash flow expand significantly. But why grow at all? And how is the optimal growth rate determined? Volume growth drives higher ROCE, free cash flow potential and the fundamental driver of a growing sustainable dividend. Reinvesting in high-return wells with low operating and finding costs improves the company's recycle ratio, expanding our return and cash flow leverage. We have determined the optimal growth rate from our current assets through 2023 is about 8% to 10%. This pace of activity and growth maximizes the operational and capital efficiency of our current premium inventory. Due to the short payback periods of our investments, capital invested today is quickly recovered by free cash flow in the future. Relative to a lower growth scenario, the value of the additional cash flow we earn after the third year of our outlook far outweighs the incremental reinvestment to support our 8% to 10% plan. The proof is in our performance. During 2017 to 2019, EOG improved our return on capital employed, improved our return of capital through the dividend, reduced debt and grew production while reinvesting less than 80% of discretionary cash flow at $58 oil. Reinvesting at high returns and growing production, the last three years is the reason we believe EOG will generate more free cash flow over the next three years at $50 oil than we did at $58 oil. Sustainable dividend growth is our highest priority for returning cash to shareholders. It is a stream of cash flow that clearly demonstrates our confidence in the resiliency of our financial model and reinforces capital discipline. Strategically, free cash flow generated from higher oil prices, should be at least partially directed to shoring up the balance sheet to preserve financial flexibility for future downturns. Value preservation and value creation are two sides of the same coin when it comes to managing the balance sheet in a capital-intensive cyclical industry. This year has demonstrated the value of a strong balance sheet like no other and we worked hard to maintain our financial strength. Cash at the end of the third quarter was $3.1 billion offsetting total debt of $5.7 billion for a net debt to total capitalization ratio of 12%. We remain committed to pursuing our objective to strengthen our balance sheet further during upturns. Beyond the regular dividend and debt reduction we regularly review performance scenarios that may present options for additional cash return to shareholders. We haven't ruled out buybacks or a variable or special dividend and we'll consider all options for additional return of cash to shareholders when the opportunity presents itself. Next up is Billy to review our operational performance.\nBilly Helms: Thanks Tim. During the third quarter, we exceeded our volume expectations across the board while spending well below our forecasted capital. The capital savings were largely attributed to achieving our 12% well cost reduction target for the year. Our expectation for full year capital expenditures remains $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. The savings provided by our well cost reductions allows us to increase activity and exit the year near the level required to maintain production through 2021. Savings will also be used this year to invest in future value drivers for the company. Our organic exploration program is as active as ever and we are optimistic we can capture additional acreage at competitive pricing. That will further improve the quality of what we believe is already one of the best portfolios of assets in the industry. Finally, we are excited to initiate a number of infield innovations to improve our environmental performance. These projects have the potential to both reduce future emissions and improve efficiencies to generate a healthy return on capital. In the third quarter cash operating costs which includes LOE, transportation and gathering and processing expenses were 13% below target. LOE savings were generated across the board as we have streamlined our lease-up key practices and other facets of our production operations. We track about 100 different categories of LOE spending and 94 of these were flat to down in the third quarter compared to the second quarter on a per unit basis. We are excited about the steady improvements we continue to make. I am confident that most of the capital efficiency gains and operating cost reductions we are making this year will sustain into 2021. With current oil market fundamentals we plan to maintain flat oil production in 2021 at about 440,000 barrels per day which is where we expect to exit the fourth quarter this year. Capital required to maintain fourth quarter production throughout the year is about $3.4 billion. Due to sustainable cost reductions achieved this year, maintenance capital and the current dividend can now be funded with oil in the mid-30s. If oil prices allow additional funds will be allocated to: One, balanced activity across all of our premium plays including our new South Texas gas play Dorado and the Powder River Basin. Two, fund infrastructure investments that further improve our cost structure increase water reuse and reduce emissions; and three, advance both our domestic and international exploration opportunities. At $40 oil we can meet all of these priorities while spending within 80% of discretionary cash flow and comfortably funding our dividend. In late September, we published our 2019 sustainability report that details a number of step-change improvements to our performance on emissions, flaring, water use and safety. We reduced our total greenhouse gas intensity rate more than 15% improving emissions efficiency across all significant sources. For the second year in a row we reduced our methane intensity rate 45%, thanks to an effort to retrofit and remove pneumatic controllers and pumps in the field. We continue to find opportunities to reduce flaring. Our wellhead gas capture rate improved to 98.8% last year and we are on track to be over 99% this year. Freshwater volumes used in our operations declined nearly 30% as a result of significant expansion of our water reuse capabilities. And most importantly our safety rates both total recordable incidents and lost time incidents improved significantly. The goal of preparing this report every year is to clearly demonstrate how our ESG efforts are integrated into our strategy, planning and operations. In this year's report we want to step further with our commitments. We established longer-term targets for greenhouse gas and methane rate reductions. We have also set annual goals to reduce emission rates which are tied to executive compensation. At EOG our approach to ESG is performance-based. While we are committed to enhancing disclosure of our policies and metrics that are important to our operations we evaluate the success of our ESG efforts by performance and performance improvement. And just like every other area of our operations, we drive performance improvement through innovation. New ideas are coming from every corner of the company driven by passionate employees who are excited about the opportunity to invent new ways to lower emissions, reduce our freshwater use and make a stronger positive impact in the communities where we live and work. Finally, I want to thank our employees for maintaining focus in a volatile year. We have significantly reduced both well cost and cash unit operating cost. We kept a close eye on our environmental and safety performance. In fact, the trend indicates, we will once again improve wellhead gas capture rate and safety rates this year.  Constant experimentation, exceptional company-wide collaboration and a no-limits mindset are why I'm confident EOG will continue to lead the industry on performance and technology. Here's Ken to provide details on our newest play Dorado.\nKen Boedeker : Thanks, Billy. We're excited to announce a major new natural gas discovery in the Western Gulf Coast Basin. Located in South Texas, Webb County we've named this discovery Dorado. With a breakeven cost of less than $1.25 per Mcf, we believe this play represents the lowest cost supply of natural gas in the United States.  We have identified an initial resource potential of 21 Tcf net to EOG in the Austin Chalk and Lower and Upper Eagle Ford formations. Both targets display premium level economics. At Henry Hub prices of $2.50 per Mcf Dorado competes directly with our premium oil plays. This play is a textbook example of how our exploration program is focused on adding to the top of our premium well inventory elevating the overall quality of our assets. We first identified the potential of the Austin Chalk formation as an oil play on top of our Eagle Ford footprint back in 2016. We have since completed about 100 gross Austin Chalk oil wells in that area capturing 59 million barrels of oil equivalent of reserve potential net to EOG.  Shortly following that discovery, we began evaluating the Austin Chalk formation in the Gulf Coast Basin and identified its potential as a dry natural gas play in Webb County. Our current 163,000 net acre position is a combination of legacy acreage and new acreage captured through low-cost, organic leasing, trades and a bolt-on property acquisition. We believe our position covers the majority of the sweet spot of the play. We completed our first two wells in Dorado in January of 2019 targeting the Austin Chalk in the Eagle Ford. To further delineate the play and collect more data, we completed 15 more wells over the remainder of 2019. We paused our drilling activity during 2020 to evaluate both the production results and the significant amount of technical data we collected from cores, petrophysical logs and 3D seismic surveys. This data including a year's worth of production history from our drilled wells has generated a robust reservoir model giving us confidence in our resource estimates and projections for well performance. We are leveraging our proprietary knowledge built from prior plays to move quickly down the cost curve with our initial development. We currently estimate a finding cost of $0.39 per Mcf in the Austin Chalk and $0.41 in the Eagle Ford. Combined with EOG's low operating costs an advantaged market position located close to a number of major sales hubs in South Texas, access to pipelines to Mexico and several LNG export terminals, Dorado is in an ideal position to supply low-cost natural gas into markets with long-term growth potential. Dorado is dry gas with close proximity to multiple markets. Therefore, we expect Dorado's gas will have a lower carbon footprint than most other onshore gas plays in the U.S.  In addition, the recently formed Sustainable Power Group, we introduced last quarter is leveraging company-wide expertise to build out an operationally efficient and low emissions field. As we expand development of Dorado into a core asset, we expect it will help lower EOG's company-wide emissions intensity rate. In 2021, our preliminary plan is to turn about 15 net wells to sales with initial development targeting the Austin Chalk. Eagle Ford development where we are expecting lower drilling and completion costs will follow. The Eagle Ford utilizes a lower cost wellbore design optimized to a more forgiving drilling environment compared to the Austin Chalk.  In addition, we can leverage water and gas gathering infrastructure put in place for the Austin Chalk. We will evaluate the capital allocation to the South Texas gas play each year based on market conditions. Dorado adds 1,250 net locations on fee acreage to our premium inventory with 530 of those from the Austin Chalk and 720 from the Eagle Ford. These new premium Dorado locations along with approximately 150 new locations from other premium plays make up the 1,400 new net premium locations added in 2020 replacing three times what we drilled and more importantly, improving the overall quality of our portfolio. The number of wells in our premium inventory that have returns of 30% or more at $30 oil and $2.50 natural gas has now increased from 4,500 to 6,000 wells. We also divested the remainder of our Marcellus Shale position during the third quarter for proceeds of about $130 million. The sale of this non-core sub-premium asset will fund much of Dorado's development capital next year and upgrades the quality of our gas portfolio. This is a great example of how EOG's organic exploration strategy and disciplined capital management creates significant shareholder value. Now I'll turn it over to Bill for concluding remarks.\nBill Thomas: Thanks, Ken. In conclusion, I'd like to note the following important takeaways. Number one, EOG continues to significantly lower cost operating costs and well costs with sustainable technology and efficiency gains. The company will emerge from the downturn a much lower-cost company. Number two, our organic exploration effort delivers another significant industry-leading play. We believe EOG's Dorado and natural gas play will be one of the highest margin and lowest emission gas plays in the U.S. Dorado is an example of how our robust exploration portfolio will continue to lower the cost structure and improve the future capital efficiency of the company. Number three, our multiple year outlook is designed to deliver industry-leading financial performance and free cash flow. It's a balanced strategy that maximizes total shareholder value through the cycle. EOG represents a full-cycle investment opportunity with significant leverage to higher oil prices. Number four, EOG is a leader in innovative initiatives to lower GHG and methane emissions. Every aspect of ESG is embedded in and driven by EOG's talented and return-focused culture. New ideas are coming from every corner of the company driven by passionate employees who are excited about making our environment and communities a better place to live. EOG is committed to being a leader in the future of energy. And finally, EOG's third quarter results demonstrate our unique and sustainable organic business model, whether it's exploration, operations, information technology or ESG performance. Our culture-driven value creation throughout the company has never been better. EOG's ability to maximize long-term shareholder value through the cycles has never been stronger. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from an Arun Jayaram, pardon me, with JPMorgan. Please\u2026\nArun Jayaram: [Technical Difficulty] on your 2021 outlook and how you're thinking about the incremental investments that you highlighted on the slide beyond the $3.4 billion sustaining number. And any preliminary thoughts on mix, as it does sound like you'll be shifting some activity amongst the premium plays to the PRB and Dorado?\nBill Thomas: Yes. Thanks, Arun. I'm going to ask Billy to comment on that.\nBilly Helms: Yeah. Good morning Arun. Just to make sure, I understood your question. I guess for the 2021 outlook, our maintenance capital as we've stated was about $3.4 billion. We are likely to evaluate. It's early yet to say what our capital might look like next year, but we'll certainly do the same as we always have. We'll allocate it based on our outlook at oil prices at the beginning of the year of course. And as we move into that year, we have certainly a lot of flexibility to allocate between our different plays. So as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we can fund our maintenance capital and our dividend down to oil prices in the mid-30s. So as we see oil prices moderate either above that level or wherever they might be, we'll have flexibility to allocate capital to our new play Dorado and the Powder River Basin as we explained in our prepared remarks.\nArun Jayaram: Okay. Fair enough. But you did say Billy at $40 oil, you could reinvest 80% of -- or have an 80% reinvestment rate and cover the dividend and some of these incremental investments. Is that...\nBilly Helms: Yes, that's true.\nArun Jayaram: Is that fair?\nBilly Helms: Yes. Well I'm sorry we missed the first part of your question, so I apologize.\nArun Jayaram: No problem, no problem. And just my follow-up maybe for Tim. EOG has historically been pretty conservative on the oil and gas prices that underpin your outlook. So some question from investors on just the rationale for using $50 per barrel. I know it is a bit longer term, but which is quite a bit above the strip. And maybe if you could help sensitize those future growth outlooks if we assumed call it a $40 to $45 WTI type number?\nBill Thomas: Yes, Arun, this is Bill. Yes, the outlook $50 is how we ran the model to determine how to optimize the company and what the most important parameters are. But I wouldn't get too hung up on $50. Whether it's $45 or $50 or $55, the fundamentals of the outlook stay the same. We're focused on returns. The first thing that we have to determine each year are the market fundamentals. Is the market still in an overbalanced situation? If it still is, we don't want to force oil into that situation. But if it's a balanced market and it turns out at $45 oil, certainly we believe the 8% to 10% growth rate, the reinvestment rate of 70% to 80%, the focus on optimizing returns and compounding the growth with operational improvements and margin improvements, and maximizing current and future free cash flow, and doing all that to maximize the total shareholder value of the company. And so the guidelines really apply to almost any price that would be in a balanced market.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Thanks, Bill.\nOperator: The next question comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nLeo Mariani: Hey, guys. Just wanted to kind of ask a couple of things just surrounding Dorado. If memory serves me correctly this seems to be kind of EOG's first kind of major foray into a gas play, probably harkening back to sort of the 2003, 2004 time frame where I think you guys made a concerted effort to kind of move more to oil plays based on the macro, which was certainly the right decision over that period of time. Just wanted to get a sense, are you guys sensing that there may be some shifting macro dynamics on the gas side, which can make the Dorado play something that becomes a lot more meaningful in the years to come? You guys did outline 15 wells for 2021, which in the grand scheme of things given EOG's size doesn't seem like a big number. I just wanted to kind of get your sense on how that can play out over the next few years.\nBill Thomas : Yeah, Leo. I think the first thing is, we've had a premium price deck. It's based on $40 flat oil and $2.50 flat gas prices. And so any kind of play that would have premium economics 30% rate of return at those flat prices, that's okay with us. We're not particular on the commodity, whether it's gas or oil or even a combo play. So that's the first thing. And then the second thing is, yes, we do believe that gas has got a prominent future in the future energy supply. There's no doubt about that. And this play just happens to be, we believe the best -- one of the best play, the best play probably dry gas play onshore U.S. It is a fantastic play and it's really driven primarily through the extremely high rock quality of the Austin Chalk. And so it fits everything we're looking for in the company. It upgrades our portfolio. It gives us more exposure to gas going forward. It gives us a lot of optionality in the future to switch capital between types of plays as commodities prices might vary a little bit. But all of it is based on our premium price deck $40 flat and $2.50 flat gas and this one certainly generates super high returns at $2.50 flat gas.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. That's great color. And just focusing on third quarter for a second. It certainly looks like EOG beat production guidance pretty handily, but it did also look like that the shut-ins that you had were actually slightly higher than you projected for the quarter. So just wanted to get a sense of what kind of drove the better than expected third quarter production performance?\nBill Thomas: Billy?\nBilly Helms: Yeah Leo. This is Billy. So yes, we -- the outperformance is really driven by -- and you touched on it there the shut-in wells bringing those back on production. As we brought the wells back on production that had been shut in for some time, we exhibited some amount of flush production from those wells, as we've talked about before. And then the second part of that is, we did start bringing on a few newly completed wells and those outperformed our type curves. So that's really kind of what drove the two parts of our beat on the volumes.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBrian Singer : Thank you. Good morning. Wanted to ask on the maintenance capital of $3.4 billion. This is the number you've been talking about for the last couple of quarters, and I think you were a bit more upfront. And I think it was slide 8 of talking about in an ideal world some of the potential other additional investments, you want to fund. And I wondered if you could kind of quantify what that -- what those would represent the ESG exploration, cost structure improvements and balancing activity, how much is a normal level of spending there? And then potentially to offset that, I think you've talked in the past that cost savings and efficiencies and cost reductions for the last couple of quarters are not included in the $3.4 billion. What would that represent in -- based on today's cost structure?\nBilly Helms: Yes. Good morning, Brian. This is Billy. So our $3.4 billion maintenance capital, you're right. You are correct. It did not -- it does not anticipate any improvements in our cost structure on a go-forward basis. It's based on our current existing cost. So that's the first thing. And then as far as the amount of capital over and above that, we'll -- as we go into the year, I think, we're trying to provide a little bit of a framework on how we would think about allocating capital. As we look into next year based on the outlook for oil prices, we're just looking at merely maintaining our exit rate into the next -- in the fourth quarter into next year. So if oil prices moderate above or below where they are today, we'll look at how much money we can spend on these types of other projects, the infrastructure or exploration-related activities, or ESG-focused projects in relation to what that oil price indicates and stay within our guidance of spending certainly within a 70% to 80% of our discretionary cash flow. So that's kind of the outline, the framework. So it really -- it's a little bit early to speculate on what that magnitude of that dollar might be.\nBrian Singer: Got it. Thanks. And then, my follow-up is, with regards to the exploration portfolio. And if we look at the plays you've announced in recent quarters, Trinidad and the Dorado play, they've been more natural gas focused. And I wondered if you could characterize the exploration optimism from here, or at least the exploration portfolio from here, on oily versus wet gas versus dry gas plays and how you see that playing out over the next year or two.\nEzra Yacob: Yes. Brian, this is Ezra. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I think, as Bill highlighted, really what we start with that exploration program, our focus right now is to find plays where we can capture the sweet spot acreage positions in those plays. And we're looking for plays that are really going to be additive to the front end of our inventory. So as we've talked about, we've got multiple exploration plays we're currently evaluating. And we just don't want to build a deeper inventory, but really strengthen that inventory. And if we look at what we've done this year, our -- the minimum rate of return on our 11,500 premium well inventory generates a 30% direct after-tax return at $40 oil and $2.50 flat natural gas price. But in this year's program, we've illustrated the significant value of focusing on the top end of our inventory. And we've delivered lower well costs and production outperformance and high-grading our investment criteria, to focus on the upper half of that inventory. And so, said another way, our 60% premium rate of return median well inventory will pay out approximately twice as fast as a 30% rate of return well. And so, our emphasis on organic exploration has always been a key to our success and it continues to be how we sustainably replace what we drill every year in our inventory. The Austin Chalk announcement today, I think, provides a very good example of what a higher rock quality can do in this exploration effort. The Austin Chalk is really more of a hybrid play, so it shares characteristics of unconventional and conventional reservoirs. And when we apply our technology, our data collection on core and log, to really identify the sweet spot landing zones that will react very well to our horizontal completions technology, that's when we really have -- that's when we really get excited and see the power that these hybrid plays can add. As we translate that into oil plays, we expect a very good outperformance with these hybrid zones. And we should be able to see a shallowing decline profile and lower finding and development costs, as we move forward into those.\nBrian Singer: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJeanine Wai: Hi. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on the base decline. I think in the 2022, 2023 outlook you now anticipate that BOE growth will outpace oil growth. And I think some of that is related to Trinidad and Dorado. But how does the oil base decline trend in your 8% to 10% per year growth rate scenario? And is that level of growth enough to kind of allow the base to moderate?\nBill Thomas: Yes. Hi, Jeanine. I'll ask Billy to comment on that.\nBilly Helms: Yes. Good morning, Jeanine. Yes, I think you're correct. The base decline from the oil properties is moderating over time. That's a function of really the activity levels this year and -- but also the quality of the inventory that we're bringing to production. The better quality rocks just simply have a lower decline over time. So it's really those two things that are helping to moderate the oil base decline. And, certainly, the outlook that we have with our maintenance capital is sufficient to maintain that on a go-forward basis.\nJeanine Wai: Okay. Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. My follow-up question is, maybe dovetailing on a few of the other ones about the other CapEx that is going to be included in the 2021 outlook. So on the potential investments on slide eight that you list, we know that the amount of CapEx will depend on the headroom that you have in oil prices. I think I heard you say that previously. But can you comment on how that 2021 amount might compare to prior years? But I guess more specifically, how much of that other CapEx is really embedded in that $50 2022-2023 outlook? Thank you.\nBilly Helms: Yes. Jeanine this is Billy, again. You're right. The level of how much we spend on those different categories will certainly depend on the oil price. And I'd say, there is some amount of that baked into the $50 estimate in the outer years, but it's not a major portion of our capital spend. So it's -- I'd say, it's in keeping with what we've done in the years past.\nJeanine Wai: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\nBob Brackett: Hi. Good morning. You've gone quite down dip in Dorado. And those 9,000-foot laterals imply some of these wells are approaching four miles measured depth. And so it seems cost control is absolutely critical. Is there some innovation there to share with us?\nBill Thomas: Yeah. Bob I'm going to ask Ken to comment on that.\nKen Boedeker: Yeah Bob, this is Ken. We have a significant history of developing the Austin Chalk in addition to the Eagle Ford, up dip in the oil window. So we've also had 17 wells that we've drilled in that area, that have provided excellent results. And we haven't had many drilling issues or completion issues to deal with. So, keeping the costs in those areas are anticipated to be, what we've shown right now in our 2021 program. So it looks like the -- we have a very, very good confidence that we'll be able to generate those returns. We've shown that are competitive with our other premium oil plays at $2.50.\nBob Brackett: So I'll do a combo follow-up. So it's not sort of managed pressure drilling say like the Powder River? And then my follow-up would be, you mentioned domestic and international exploration activities in that seriatim, that people keep referring to. Could you remind us of what is included in the international bucket?\nEzra Yacob: Yes. Bob this is Ezra. On the international front, I'd highlight we did just recently wrap up our recent drilling campaign in Trinidad with some additional outstanding results. We highlighted some of the discoveries, on the last call. But I'd follow-up and say, our most recent completion the Oilbird -- a well off the Oilbird platform came on in the third quarter at over 60 million cubic feet a day of natural gas with an additional 2,500 barrels of condensate per day. We brought on a well off of our Kitscoty platform, that's cleaning up right now, its flow back rates of approximately 30 million cubic feet, per day of gas. And so we continue to be excited about the discoveries that we made during this campaign and look forward to sharing future results, from this high-return asset. And then also during the third quarter, we entered into the country of Oman, with the acquisition of about 4.6 million net acres in Block 36. Block 36 is in the southwest portion of the country. It's located in the Rub Al Khali basin, which is a well-known hydrocarbon-bearing basin. And as -- we've been looking really outside the U.S. for the right opportunity to apply, our expertise in tight oil development, and we view Oman is really offering that. They offer a very low geopolitical risk, and they offer access to competitively priced oilfield services and equipment, that we think is going to be required to make tight oil successful. And so as part of the agreement, we plan to drill two test wells in the next two years to evaluate the potential of the acreage. And we're very excited about the low-cost of entry in Oman and the option to evaluate a basin with significant potential upside. And I think, maybe Ken could add some color in addition to that.\nKen Boedeker: Yeah. I just -- I wanted to clarify something Bob. When you talked about managed pressure drilling like the Powder River Basin, we are doing managed pressure drilling like the Powder River Basin, in Dorado. But we have a significant amount of experience doing that across several plays in the company.\nBob Brackett: Great. Thanks for all that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Subash Chandra with Northland Securities. Please go ahead.\nSubash Chandra: Yeah. Hi, everybody. Just doing some, I guess, bar napkin math, using your decline rates and the dollar for flowing capital efficiency calculation. I'm coming up with, I don't know maybe around $5 billion for what CapEx requirements are, for 10% type oil growth. Do you think I'm in the right ballpark there?\nBilly Helms: Yeah Subash, this is Billy Helms. It's a little premature to maybe give out a directional number, but I think you can approximate. With the data we've given you, I think you can derive some pretty close estimates. I'd say you're probably not too far off the right numbers.\nSubash Chandra: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then secondly just on, dividend decision. I guess the next one comes up, early part of the New Year. I'm just curious the $3 billion in cash, you talked about having the right balance sheet cushion to ride out the cycles. From a, cash perspective, is there a right number that we should be assuming? And is it and should we also assume that the cash does not go into the dividend decision, that the dividend decision is just derived from operating cash flows or free cash flows?\nTim Driggers: This is Tim. And you're exactly right. It is the operating cash flows, that determines the -- a sustained dividend. As far as the $3 billion in cash, we do have a bond coming due in February. And currently we are anticipating being able to pay that bond off with that cash. But we have significant flexibility if the market changes to do whatever we need to do. So, we're in a good position to manage that situation.\nSubash Chandra: Okay. And to ask it a different way, should we assume some sort of minimum cash that you'd want to keep on the balance sheet?\nTim Driggers: There -- again, we evaluate it depending on the conditions at the time. So, to give you a number there's not a number I can give you. It all depends on what the stock -- I mean, the price of the commodities are at the time, as to how much cash we need to have on the balance sheet. And also what our budget is, our capital budget and how much capital we'll be spending.\nSubash Chandra: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nPaul Cheng: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Just curious that when you look at the three-year outlook for your capital allocation and the growth target or that the maximum growth ceiling, should we assume that that's also applied for the longer term? And if notm is there any reason that the same will not be applied?\nBill Thomas: Yes, Paul I think three years with those parameters are a good guide. We did include - we did not include any additional well cost, operational cost advancements in those projections. So certainly, we expect to continue to do that. We have a very sustainable model of being able to do that. So as time goes on and certainly in three years we expect we'll be a lot better company. So I wouldn't just apply those numbers to what we could do four years from now. I think we're hopeful we'll \u2013 through these exploration efforts getting better rock and continuing to reduce our costs we should be a much better company.\nPaul Cheng: Well I'm sure that the company will be operationally much stronger. I'm more referring to that is the ceiling of 10% growth is a variable over the longer term or that is only applied for the next two or three years?\nBill Thomas: Yes I think right now it's just for the next two or three years. We'll just have to evaluate where the company is in the four or five years from now and see where we are.\nPaul Cheng: And then my second question is that on \u2013 whether it's the Dorado or that your overall CapEx spending certainly that the price signal is important. But with the future strip moving quite substantially from one day to another so that's probably not a very good indicator or at least let's say a forecast vehicle. So what are the factors that you guys are using maybe that's more determinating how you decide on your program for a particular year if the price signal from the future market are unreliable there as we can see?\nBill Thomas: Yes, Paul I think the first thing is what's the price based on and that's whether we're in an overbalanced market situation or a balanced market. And we believe there's significant structural changes obviously have been going on in the business particularly in the U.S. with a lot more capital discipline, a lot more return of cash to shareholders. They need to work on balance sheet consolidation, et cetera. In the international arena, there's been folks that have basically changed their business philosophy and they're certainly not going to be investing as much in oil in the future. So there's a lot of things that go on in there. And all that leads to \u2013 in the future, certainly we believe OPEC will be the swing producer the \u2013 really totally in control of oil prices. So we want to take that in consideration and make sure that the market is balanced. And we've taken all that in consideration as we formulate our plans.\nPaul Cheng: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Bill I'm really just looking for a little clarification on a couple of the things you've announced today. First of all, the beginning of the year you talked about your cash breakeven being around $40. Second quarter you said it was a little less than $40. Now it's dropped to the mid-30s. Can you tell us what's changed there given that the sustaining capital is still $3.4 billion?\nBill Thomas: I'll ask Billy to comment on that.\nBilly Helms: Yes. Good morning, Doug it's really the cost structure of the company continues to improve. We continue to drive down our well cost. As I mentioned earlier we've already achieved our 12% cost reduction that we expected throughout the year. And then our unit costs, we've driven down our unit operating costs quite substantially this year. So those combination of things is allowing us to continue to reduce that breakeven cost.\nDoug Leggate: Is the gas price a factor Billy?\nBilly Helms: No sir, it's really not. It's really driven mainly by the cost reductions, the structural changes we've made and the cost reductions of the company.\nDoug Leggate: Okay. My follow-up is really, Bill I hate to do it but go back to the 10% growth number. I know you've been asked a lot about it today. But I want to put a hypothetical to you. So let's assume oil is $50 but it's only there because Saudi is still \u2013 or OPEC+ has still got seven million barrels off the market. That's not exactly a balanced market. So what does EOG do in that scenario?\nBill Thomas: Yes, Doug, that's exactly right. We would not want to force oil into that kind of situation. We don't want to put OPEC in a situation where they feel threatened like we're taking market share, while they're propping up oil prices. So that much commitment by them that's not a time we would force oil.\nDoug Leggate: That's the clarity I was looking for. Thanks so much, guys. I appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from Paul Sankey with Sankey Research. Please go ahead.\nPaul Sankey: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Guys, could you -- on the Dorado, could you give us an activity and volume outlook to help us with valuation? And given it's an organic success, could you just talk a bit about your perspective on the consolidation that we've seen in the sector from EOG's point of view? Thanks.\nKen Boedeker: Yeah. Paul, this is Ken. On Dorado's volume and activity outlook, it's a little early to give any volume outlook for 2021 or the future years. We have talked about a 15-well program in 2021 that we should be bringing on some gas early in the year and then towards the second half of the year from there. As far as M&A...\nBilly Helms: Yeah. Paul, this is Billy. I'll touch maybe on the M&A question. I think -- certainly, I think the industry needed to go through some M&A some consolidation in the space. And I think we're certainly supportive of what we've seen so far. For EOG, we've looked at just about every possible combination that's out there. And we certainly understand the financial uplift or the accretion that you might get from a corporate M&A, but we look at that more as a one-time event. And we're really looking -- for us to be entering that market, we would look at the longer-term impact that a possible M&A would have on our current inventory. And so we look at the inventory that a company might have in comparison to the inventory, we already have or what we're seeing in our exploration program, and we just don't see anything that we're -- we need to allocate any funds to at this point in time. There nothing that really meets our objectives. And I guess it just stems from the fact we have such a high level of confidence in our current exploration program, which is mainly aimed at improving the quality of our premium inventory.\nPaul Sankey: Thought you might say that Billy. The follow-up is you've adjusted your framework somewhat here. Could you just talk about your philosophy on hedging the latest -- if anything's changed regarding how you think about hedging? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nBill Thomas: Yeah. Paul thanks. Yeah, we haven't changed our philosophy there. We're always opportunistic. We have a very robust, rigorous commodity analysis macro view. We're working all the time. It's quite a rigorous process. So we believe we're not always right, but we believe we've got a pretty good idea where oil prices are headed. So we'll just stay opportunistic on that, and same thing with gas prices.\nPaul Sankey: Which is -- so you're less hedged right now?\nBill Thomas: Sorry. What was the question? I'm sorry I missed it.\nPaul Sankey: Which is to, say, that you're less hedged right now?\nBill Thomas: Yeah. That's right. We're not hedged on oil.\nPaul Sankey: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.\nCharles Meade: Good morning, Bill, to you and your whole team there. I just wanted to ask a question kind of pull on the thread about this Dorado -- the Dorado play you have. The Austin Chalk, the D&C cost you put for the Austin Chalk is a little higher, I believe for -- than the Eagle Ford did. And I'm just kind of wondering, what's the driver of that? Is the Austin Chalk in a -- is it perspective in a deeper session, or is the lateral a little slower to drill, or what -- is that a relevant piece of the puzzle? And what does it point to?\nKen Boedeker: Yeah. Charles, this is Ken. We just see a little bit harder drilling conditions when we're drilling the Austin Chalk compared to the Eagle Ford, so we've added in additional cost for that at this point. We always work on lowering our cost basis, and you can see that on every one of our plays. So we anticipate that we'll be able to lower the cost in Dorado as well as we drill some additional wells in that play.\nCharles Meade: Got it. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to touch on the Delaware Basin. It's still a big driver for you guys obviously. Are you guys seeing anything different, or do you expect to see anything different either in the operating environment out there or the opportunity set to continue to add out there?\nBilly Helms: Yeah. Charles, this is Billy. Really nothing's changed, except our continuous improvement we're seeing in the well performance and the cost structure of our Delaware Basin plays. We're extremely proud of the team we have there and the improvements they continue to make. We haven't really changed a lot as far as the well spacing or anything like that, that a lot of other companies talk about. I think we continue to make improvements in the way we drill and complete the wells. And I think we're delivering a lot more consistent results as a result of that. So, we're extremely confident in our ability to continue to execute that program and deliver superior results. We are continuing to have success in blocking up acreage through trades and we've been doing that really for many years. So I don't expect that's going to continue to change. But outside of that that's kind of what we see.\nCharles Meade: Great, thanks a lot.\nOperator: At this time, the question-and-answer session is concluded. I will turn the conference over now to Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO for concluding remarks.\nBill Thomas: Yeah. In closing, I'd just like to say, we cannot be more proud of our EOG employees. Our third quarter results were outstanding, thanks to everyone in the company. The culture of EOG is performing better than ever, and our ability and commitment to creating long-term shareholder value has never been stronger. Thanks for listening, and thanks for your support.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bill Thomas",
            "content": "Thanks Tim and good morning everyone. Our third quarter results underscore EOG's unique ability to organically create sustainable shareholder value through the commodity cycle. Along with substantial cost reductions and solid earnings results, we announced Dorado our new premium South Texas natural gas play. We also introduced a three-year reinvestment and production outlook. First, I want to highlight our stellar execution this year then provide some context on our capital allocation and three-year outlook. We continue to make rapid and sustainable improvements to our cost structure and capital efficiency through innovation while also improving the quality and size of our premium portfolio through exploration. Our results show we can invest in both innovation and exploration to improve the company, while also generating significant free cash flow improving the balance sheet and protecting the dividend. Capital spend for the third quarter was $2.7 billion over $300 million less than our revised plan had forecasted. In the third quarter, we substantially beat our cash unit cost targets as well as each of our oil, NGL, and natural gas production targets. As a result we have generated more than $930 million of free cash flow year-to-date already more than enough to cover the full year dividend. Our 21 Tcf Dorado natural gas play announced yesterday is a great example of EOG's ability to identify and capture high-quality rock and add substantial premium inventory to our organic exploration efforts. We believe Dorado will be one of the lowest cost and lowest emission natural gas plays in the U.S. with advantaged access to both domestic market hubs and international market via LNG. EOG has a long and successful exploration history and we continue to be excited about the potential of our current exploration portfolio. I'm incredibly proud of EOG employees' performance during this pandemic. They remain highly motivated and have demonstrated EOG's return-focused culture by improving the company at a record pace in a volatile environment. We will encourage -- we will emerge from this downturn an even stronger company positioning EOG to excel through the commodity price cycles. Yesterday, we also introduced a three-year outlook. The goals of disclosing this outlook are to provide more transparency into our capital allocation process and meaningful visibility into the next three years particularly given the ongoing level of uncertainty in the oil and gas market. Our capital and growth profile optimizes the total shareholder value of the company through the cycles. Our strategy remains dynamic and our operations are flexible enough to adjust our spending to match market conditions. At the bottom of the cycle as we find ourselves today we have no interest in growing oil into an overbalanced market. In an improved market, our disciplined growth strategy compounds the benefits of growth and continuous operational improvements to optimize returns and free cash flow potential and maximize long-term shareholder value. EOG represents a full-cycle investment opportunity. At lower prices, EOG is clearly a sustainable business. Maintenance capital and the dividend can be funded with oil in the mid-30s. In a more constructive market, EOG has significant leverage to higher oil prices through high-return reinvestment and significant incremental free cash flow. EOG has a unique business model in our industry. We approach this business differently which has become more apparent than ever with recent industry developments. First, the state of recent M&A activity stands in contrast to one of our most distinctive competitive advantages, organic exploration. Capturing high-quality rock is the primary way of improving the quality of our premium inventory. It's how we create more value than our competitors. Our newest play Dorado is a prime example. It's great rock in a great location and that's a resource you can't buy through M&A. Second, we're decentralized. Value is created in the field, not at headquarters. The exploration idea behind Dorado emerged bottom-up from one of our eight operating areas. In fact, perhaps for the first time in our history, every one of our eight areas has significant potential for premium plays, plays that if successful, will add to the top of our inventory not the bottom. Third, the improvements we're making are sustainable. The number one source of our cost reduction this year is from innovation, not cyclic service price reductions. Once again, that's the power of our decentralized organization. It's an innovation incubator and a driving force behind EOG's leading performance. Fourth, we execute our operational plans reliably and consistently. This year, we worked hard to provide transparency in our operations by providing guidance throughout one of the most volatile periods in the industry's history and we've delivered on our plan. Fifth, performance drives our ESG efforts, not PR. We believe the demand for oil and natural gas will gravitate towards the most efficient producers, the most efficient from a capital perspective and the most efficient from an emissions perspective. Our goal is to be part of the long-term global energy solution, while generating strong returns for our shareholders. Finally, and most importantly, we believe we have the most talented and motivated employees in the industry. We've not laid-off employees and we've empowered our workforce by leveraging our robust information technology infrastructure to support collaboration and innovation. Our employees and culture are a massive competitive advantage during these unusual times. And we're not standing still. Our relentless drive to improve means that, this is just a starting point. We are confident that we will continue to improve performance through the development of new plays like Dorado, further cost reductions and well productivity improvements. We're excited about the future of EOG. Now, here's Tim. Thanks, Ken. In conclusion, I'd like to note the following important takeaways. Number one, EOG continues to significantly lower cost operating costs and well costs with sustainable technology and efficiency gains. The company will emerge from the downturn a much lower-cost company. Number two, our organic exploration effort delivers another significant industry-leading play. We believe EOG's Dorado and natural gas play will be one of the highest margin and lowest emission gas plays in the U.S. Dorado is an example of how our robust exploration portfolio will continue to lower the cost structure and improve the future capital efficiency of the company. Number three, our multiple year outlook is designed to deliver industry-leading financial performance and free cash flow. It's a balanced strategy that maximizes total shareholder value through the cycle. EOG represents a full-cycle investment opportunity with significant leverage to higher oil prices. Number four, EOG is a leader in innovative initiatives to lower GHG and methane emissions. Every aspect of ESG is embedded in and driven by EOG's talented and return-focused culture. New ideas are coming from every corner of the company driven by passionate employees who are excited about making our environment and communities a better place to live. EOG is committed to being a leader in the future of energy. And finally, EOG's third quarter results demonstrate our unique and sustainable organic business model, whether it's exploration, operations, information technology or ESG performance. Our culture-driven value creation throughout the company has never been better. EOG's ability to maximize long-term shareholder value through the cycles has never been stronger. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A. Yes. Thanks, Arun. I'm going to ask Billy to comment on that. Yes, Arun, this is Bill. Yes, the outlook $50 is how we ran the model to determine how to optimize the company and what the most important parameters are. But I wouldn't get too hung up on $50. Whether it's $45 or $50 or $55, the fundamentals of the outlook stay the same. We're focused on returns. The first thing that we have to determine each year are the market fundamentals. Is the market still in an overbalanced situation? If it still is, we don't want to force oil into that situation. But if it's a balanced market and it turns out at $45 oil, certainly we believe the 8% to 10% growth rate, the reinvestment rate of 70% to 80%, the focus on optimizing returns and compounding the growth with operational improvements and margin improvements, and maximizing current and future free cash flow, and doing all that to maximize the total shareholder value of the company. And so the guidelines really apply to almost any price that would be in a balanced market. Yeah, Leo. I think the first thing is, we've had a premium price deck. It's based on $40 flat oil and $2.50 flat gas prices. And so any kind of play that would have premium economics 30% rate of return at those flat prices, that's okay with us. We're not particular on the commodity, whether it's gas or oil or even a combo play. So that's the first thing. And then the second thing is, yes, we do believe that gas has got a prominent future in the future energy supply. There's no doubt about that. And this play just happens to be, we believe the best -- one of the best play, the best play probably dry gas play onshore U.S. It is a fantastic play and it's really driven primarily through the extremely high rock quality of the Austin Chalk. And so it fits everything we're looking for in the company. It upgrades our portfolio. It gives us more exposure to gas going forward. It gives us a lot of optionality in the future to switch capital between types of plays as commodities prices might vary a little bit. But all of it is based on our premium price deck $40 flat and $2.50 flat gas and this one certainly generates super high returns at $2.50 flat gas. Billy? Yes. Hi, Jeanine. I'll ask Billy to comment on that. Yeah. Bob I'm going to ask Ken to comment on that. Yes, Paul I think three years with those parameters are a good guide. We did include - we did not include any additional well cost, operational cost advancements in those projections. So certainly, we expect to continue to do that. We have a very sustainable model of being able to do that. So as time goes on and certainly in three years we expect we'll be a lot better company. So I wouldn't just apply those numbers to what we could do four years from now. I think we're hopeful we'll \u2013 through these exploration efforts getting better rock and continuing to reduce our costs we should be a much better company. Yes I think right now it's just for the next two or three years. We'll just have to evaluate where the company is in the four or five years from now and see where we are. Yes, Paul I think the first thing is what's the price based on and that's whether we're in an overbalanced market situation or a balanced market. And we believe there's significant structural changes obviously have been going on in the business particularly in the U.S. with a lot more capital discipline, a lot more return of cash to shareholders. They need to work on balance sheet consolidation, et cetera. In the international arena, there's been folks that have basically changed their business philosophy and they're certainly not going to be investing as much in oil in the future. So there's a lot of things that go on in there. And all that leads to \u2013 in the future, certainly we believe OPEC will be the swing producer the \u2013 really totally in control of oil prices. So we want to take that in consideration and make sure that the market is balanced. And we've taken all that in consideration as we formulate our plans. I'll ask Billy to comment on that. Yes, Doug, that's exactly right. We would not want to force oil into that kind of situation. We don't want to put OPEC in a situation where they feel threatened like we're taking market share, while they're propping up oil prices. So that much commitment by them that's not a time we would force oil. Yeah. Paul thanks. Yeah, we haven't changed our philosophy there. We're always opportunistic. We have a very robust, rigorous commodity analysis macro view. We're working all the time. It's quite a rigorous process. So we believe we're not always right, but we believe we've got a pretty good idea where oil prices are headed. So we'll just stay opportunistic on that, and same thing with gas prices. Sorry. What was the question? I'm sorry I missed it. Yeah. That's right. We're not hedged on oil. Yeah. In closing, I'd just like to say, we cannot be more proud of our EOG employees. Our third quarter results were outstanding, thanks to everyone in the company. The culture of EOG is performing better than ever, and our ability and commitment to creating long-term shareholder value has never been stronger. Thanks for listening, and thanks for your support."

            "name": "Ken Boedeker",
            "content": "Thanks, Billy. We're excited to announce a major new natural gas discovery in the Western Gulf Coast Basin. Located in South Texas, Webb County we've named this discovery Dorado. With a breakeven cost of less than $1.25 per Mcf, we believe this play represents the lowest cost supply of natural gas in the United States.  We have identified an initial resource potential of 21 Tcf net to EOG in the Austin Chalk and Lower and Upper Eagle Ford formations. Both targets display premium level economics. At Henry Hub prices of $2.50 per Mcf Dorado competes directly with our premium oil plays. This play is a textbook example of how our exploration program is focused on adding to the top of our premium well inventory elevating the overall quality of our assets. We first identified the potential of the Austin Chalk formation as an oil play on top of our Eagle Ford footprint back in 2016. We have since completed about 100 gross Austin Chalk oil wells in that area capturing 59 million barrels of oil equivalent of reserve potential net to EOG.  Shortly following that discovery, we began evaluating the Austin Chalk formation in the Gulf Coast Basin and identified its potential as a dry natural gas play in Webb County. Our current 163,000 net acre position is a combination of legacy acreage and new acreage captured through low-cost, organic leasing, trades and a bolt-on property acquisition. We believe our position covers the majority of the sweet spot of the play. We completed our first two wells in Dorado in January of 2019 targeting the Austin Chalk in the Eagle Ford. To further delineate the play and collect more data, we completed 15 more wells over the remainder of 2019. We paused our drilling activity during 2020 to evaluate both the production results and the significant amount of technical data we collected from cores, petrophysical logs and 3D seismic surveys. This data including a year's worth of production history from our drilled wells has generated a robust reservoir model giving us confidence in our resource estimates and projections for well performance. We are leveraging our proprietary knowledge built from prior plays to move quickly down the cost curve with our initial development. We currently estimate a finding cost of $0.39 per Mcf in the Austin Chalk and $0.41 in the Eagle Ford. Combined with EOG's low operating costs an advantaged market position located close to a number of major sales hubs in South Texas, access to pipelines to Mexico and several LNG export terminals, Dorado is in an ideal position to supply low-cost natural gas into markets with long-term growth potential. Dorado is dry gas with close proximity to multiple markets. Therefore, we expect Dorado's gas will have a lower carbon footprint than most other onshore gas plays in the U.S.  In addition, the recently formed Sustainable Power Group, we introduced last quarter is leveraging company-wide expertise to build out an operationally efficient and low emissions field. As we expand development of Dorado into a core asset, we expect it will help lower EOG's company-wide emissions intensity rate. In 2021, our preliminary plan is to turn about 15 net wells to sales with initial development targeting the Austin Chalk. Eagle Ford development where we are expecting lower drilling and completion costs will follow. The Eagle Ford utilizes a lower cost wellbore design optimized to a more forgiving drilling environment compared to the Austin Chalk.  In addition, we can leverage water and gas gathering infrastructure put in place for the Austin Chalk. We will evaluate the capital allocation to the South Texas gas play each year based on market conditions. Dorado adds 1,250 net locations on fee acreage to our premium inventory with 530 of those from the Austin Chalk and 720 from the Eagle Ford. These new premium Dorado locations along with approximately 150 new locations from other premium plays make up the 1,400 new net premium locations added in 2020 replacing three times what we drilled and more importantly, improving the overall quality of our portfolio. The number of wells in our premium inventory that have returns of 30% or more at $30 oil and $2.50 natural gas has now increased from 4,500 to 6,000 wells. We also divested the remainder of our Marcellus Shale position during the third quarter for proceeds of about $130 million. The sale of this non-core sub-premium asset will fund much of Dorado's development capital next year and upgrades the quality of our gas portfolio. This is a great example of how EOG's organic exploration strategy and disciplined capital management creates significant shareholder value. Now I'll turn it over to Bill for concluding remarks. Yeah Bob, this is Ken. We have a significant history of developing the Austin Chalk in addition to the Eagle Ford, up dip in the oil window. So we've also had 17 wells that we've drilled in that area, that have provided excellent results. And we haven't had many drilling issues or completion issues to deal with. So, keeping the costs in those areas are anticipated to be, what we've shown right now in our 2021 program. So it looks like the -- we have a very, very good confidence that we'll be able to generate those returns. We've shown that are competitive with our other premium oil plays at $2.50. Yeah. I just -- I wanted to clarify something Bob. When you talked about managed pressure drilling like the Powder River Basin, we are doing managed pressure drilling like the Powder River Basin, in Dorado. But we have a significant amount of experience doing that across several plays in the company. Yeah. Paul, this is Ken. On Dorado's volume and activity outlook, it's a little early to give any volume outlook for 2021 or the future years. We have talked about a 15-well program in 2021 that we should be bringing on some gas early in the year and then towards the second half of the year from there. As far as M&A... Yeah. Charles, this is Ken. We just see a little bit harder drilling conditions when we're drilling the Austin Chalk compared to the Eagle Ford, so we've added in additional cost for that at this point. We always work on lowering our cost basis, and you can see that on every one of our plays. So we anticipate that we'll be able to lower the cost in Dorado as well as we drill some additional wells in that play."

            "name": "Billy Helms",
            "content": "Thanks Tim. During the third quarter, we exceeded our volume expectations across the board while spending well below our forecasted capital. The capital savings were largely attributed to achieving our 12% well cost reduction target for the year. Our expectation for full year capital expenditures remains $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. The savings provided by our well cost reductions allows us to increase activity and exit the year near the level required to maintain production through 2021. Savings will also be used this year to invest in future value drivers for the company. Our organic exploration program is as active as ever and we are optimistic we can capture additional acreage at competitive pricing. That will further improve the quality of what we believe is already one of the best portfolios of assets in the industry. Finally, we are excited to initiate a number of infield innovations to improve our environmental performance. These projects have the potential to both reduce future emissions and improve efficiencies to generate a healthy return on capital. In the third quarter cash operating costs which includes LOE, transportation and gathering and processing expenses were 13% below target. LOE savings were generated across the board as we have streamlined our lease-up key practices and other facets of our production operations. We track about 100 different categories of LOE spending and 94 of these were flat to down in the third quarter compared to the second quarter on a per unit basis. We are excited about the steady improvements we continue to make. I am confident that most of the capital efficiency gains and operating cost reductions we are making this year will sustain into 2021. With current oil market fundamentals we plan to maintain flat oil production in 2021 at about 440,000 barrels per day which is where we expect to exit the fourth quarter this year. Capital required to maintain fourth quarter production throughout the year is about $3.4 billion. Due to sustainable cost reductions achieved this year, maintenance capital and the current dividend can now be funded with oil in the mid-30s. If oil prices allow additional funds will be allocated to: One, balanced activity across all of our premium plays including our new South Texas gas play Dorado and the Powder River Basin. Two, fund infrastructure investments that further improve our cost structure increase water reuse and reduce emissions; and three, advance both our domestic and international exploration opportunities. At $40 oil we can meet all of these priorities while spending within 80% of discretionary cash flow and comfortably funding our dividend. In late September, we published our 2019 sustainability report that details a number of step-change improvements to our performance on emissions, flaring, water use and safety. We reduced our total greenhouse gas intensity rate more than 15% improving emissions efficiency across all significant sources. For the second year in a row we reduced our methane intensity rate 45%, thanks to an effort to retrofit and remove pneumatic controllers and pumps in the field. We continue to find opportunities to reduce flaring. Our wellhead gas capture rate improved to 98.8% last year and we are on track to be over 99% this year. Freshwater volumes used in our operations declined nearly 30% as a result of significant expansion of our water reuse capabilities. And most importantly our safety rates both total recordable incidents and lost time incidents improved significantly. The goal of preparing this report every year is to clearly demonstrate how our ESG efforts are integrated into our strategy, planning and operations. In this year's report we want to step further with our commitments. We established longer-term targets for greenhouse gas and methane rate reductions. We have also set annual goals to reduce emission rates which are tied to executive compensation. At EOG our approach to ESG is performance-based. While we are committed to enhancing disclosure of our policies and metrics that are important to our operations we evaluate the success of our ESG efforts by performance and performance improvement. And just like every other area of our operations, we drive performance improvement through innovation. New ideas are coming from every corner of the company driven by passionate employees who are excited about the opportunity to invent new ways to lower emissions, reduce our freshwater use and make a stronger positive impact in the communities where we live and work. Finally, I want to thank our employees for maintaining focus in a volatile year. We have significantly reduced both well cost and cash unit operating cost. We kept a close eye on our environmental and safety performance. In fact, the trend indicates, we will once again improve wellhead gas capture rate and safety rates this year.  Constant experimentation, exceptional company-wide collaboration and a no-limits mindset are why I'm confident EOG will continue to lead the industry on performance and technology. Here's Ken to provide details on our newest play Dorado. Yeah. Good morning Arun. Just to make sure, I understood your question. I guess for the 2021 outlook, our maintenance capital as we've stated was about $3.4 billion. We are likely to evaluate. It's early yet to say what our capital might look like next year, but we'll certainly do the same as we always have. We'll allocate it based on our outlook at oil prices at the beginning of the year of course. And as we move into that year, we have certainly a lot of flexibility to allocate between our different plays. So as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we can fund our maintenance capital and our dividend down to oil prices in the mid-30s. So as we see oil prices moderate either above that level or wherever they might be, we'll have flexibility to allocate capital to our new play Dorado and the Powder River Basin as we explained in our prepared remarks. Yes, that's true. Yes. Well I'm sorry we missed the first part of your question, so I apologize. Yeah Leo. This is Billy. So yes, we -- the outperformance is really driven by -- and you touched on it there the shut-in wells bringing those back on production. As we brought the wells back on production that had been shut in for some time, we exhibited some amount of flush production from those wells, as we've talked about before. And then the second part of that is, we did start bringing on a few newly completed wells and those outperformed our type curves. So that's really kind of what drove the two parts of our beat on the volumes. Yes. Good morning, Brian. This is Billy. So our $3.4 billion maintenance capital, you're right. You are correct. It did not -- it does not anticipate any improvements in our cost structure on a go-forward basis. It's based on our current existing cost. So that's the first thing. And then as far as the amount of capital over and above that, we'll -- as we go into the year, I think, we're trying to provide a little bit of a framework on how we would think about allocating capital. As we look into next year based on the outlook for oil prices, we're just looking at merely maintaining our exit rate into the next -- in the fourth quarter into next year. So if oil prices moderate above or below where they are today, we'll look at how much money we can spend on these types of other projects, the infrastructure or exploration-related activities, or ESG-focused projects in relation to what that oil price indicates and stay within our guidance of spending certainly within a 70% to 80% of our discretionary cash flow. So that's kind of the outline, the framework. So it really -- it's a little bit early to speculate on what that magnitude of that dollar might be. Yes. Good morning, Jeanine. Yes, I think you're correct. The base decline from the oil properties is moderating over time. That's a function of really the activity levels this year and -- but also the quality of the inventory that we're bringing to production. The better quality rocks just simply have a lower decline over time. So it's really those two things that are helping to moderate the oil base decline. And, certainly, the outlook that we have with our maintenance capital is sufficient to maintain that on a go-forward basis. Yes. Jeanine this is Billy, again. You're right. The level of how much we spend on those different categories will certainly depend on the oil price. And I'd say, there is some amount of that baked into the $50 estimate in the outer years, but it's not a major portion of our capital spend. So it's -- I'd say, it's in keeping with what we've done in the years past. Yeah Subash, this is Billy Helms. It's a little premature to maybe give out a directional number, but I think you can approximate. With the data we've given you, I think you can derive some pretty close estimates. I'd say you're probably not too far off the right numbers. Yes. Good morning, Doug it's really the cost structure of the company continues to improve. We continue to drive down our well cost. As I mentioned earlier we've already achieved our 12% cost reduction that we expected throughout the year. And then our unit costs, we've driven down our unit operating costs quite substantially this year. So those combination of things is allowing us to continue to reduce that breakeven cost. No sir, it's really not. It's really driven mainly by the cost reductions, the structural changes we've made and the cost reductions of the company. Yeah. Paul, this is Billy. I'll touch maybe on the M&A question. I think -- certainly, I think the industry needed to go through some M&A some consolidation in the space. And I think we're certainly supportive of what we've seen so far. For EOG, we've looked at just about every possible combination that's out there. And we certainly understand the financial uplift or the accretion that you might get from a corporate M&A, but we look at that more as a one-time event. And we're really looking -- for us to be entering that market, we would look at the longer-term impact that a possible M&A would have on our current inventory. And so we look at the inventory that a company might have in comparison to the inventory, we already have or what we're seeing in our exploration program, and we just don't see anything that we're -- we need to allocate any funds to at this point in time. There nothing that really meets our objectives. And I guess it just stems from the fact we have such a high level of confidence in our current exploration program, which is mainly aimed at improving the quality of our premium inventory. Yeah. Charles, this is Billy. Really nothing's changed, except our continuous improvement we're seeing in the well performance and the cost structure of our Delaware Basin plays. We're extremely proud of the team we have there and the improvements they continue to make. We haven't really changed a lot as far as the well spacing or anything like that, that a lot of other companies talk about. I think we continue to make improvements in the way we drill and complete the wells. And I think we're delivering a lot more consistent results as a result of that. So, we're extremely confident in our ability to continue to execute that program and deliver superior results. We are continuing to have success in blocking up acreage through trades and we've been doing that really for many years. So I don't expect that's going to continue to change. But outside of that that's kind of what we see."

            "content": "Good morning and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing third quarter 2020 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions as well as reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call or in the accompanying investor presentation slides may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday. Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP Exploration and Production; Ezra Yacob, EVP Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP of Marketing; and David Streit, VP Investor Relations and Public Relations. Here's Bill Thomas. Thanks, Bill. Our goal is to maximize shareholder value through the cycles. We measure our progress against a number of metrics, return on capital, free cash flow, sustainable dividend growth, operating cost and finding cost and financial leverage. We create business value through a balanced approach that maximizes returns as well as both current and future free cash flow generation. It's an integrated optimization exercise, not a simple formula. Reinvestment ratios and growth rates are outputs of this exercise. Our three-year outlook provided this quarter addresses the currently oversupplied market and assumes gradual improvement over the next three years. Our plan each year is based on conservative price assumptions. The pace of activity is optimized to generate high returns on incremental capital, increased return on capital employed, support improvements in operating efficiencies and technical advances and fund our free cash flow priorities. That said, our outlook is just that an outlook. We have operational flexibility to adapt quickly to changing supply demand conditions. At $50 oil, reinvesting 70% to 80% of discretionary cash flow, generates up to 10% oil growth, with significant free cash flow. At higher prices, we would expect to maintain this optimal level of activity and production growth, while returns and free cash flow expand significantly. But why grow at all? And how is the optimal growth rate determined? Volume growth drives higher ROCE, free cash flow potential and the fundamental driver of a growing sustainable dividend. Reinvesting in high-return wells with low operating and finding costs improves the company's recycle ratio, expanding our return and cash flow leverage. We have determined the optimal growth rate from our current assets through 2023 is about 8% to 10%. This pace of activity and growth maximizes the operational and capital efficiency of our current premium inventory. Due to the short payback periods of our investments, capital invested today is quickly recovered by free cash flow in the future. Relative to a lower growth scenario, the value of the additional cash flow we earn after the third year of our outlook far outweighs the incremental reinvestment to support our 8% to 10% plan. The proof is in our performance. During 2017 to 2019, EOG improved our return on capital employed, improved our return of capital through the dividend, reduced debt and grew production while reinvesting less than 80% of discretionary cash flow at $58 oil. Reinvesting at high returns and growing production, the last three years is the reason we believe EOG will generate more free cash flow over the next three years at $50 oil than we did at $58 oil. Sustainable dividend growth is our highest priority for returning cash to shareholders. It is a stream of cash flow that clearly demonstrates our confidence in the resiliency of our financial model and reinforces capital discipline. Strategically, free cash flow generated from higher oil prices, should be at least partially directed to shoring up the balance sheet to preserve financial flexibility for future downturns. Value preservation and value creation are two sides of the same coin when it comes to managing the balance sheet in a capital-intensive cyclical industry. This year has demonstrated the value of a strong balance sheet like no other and we worked hard to maintain our financial strength. Cash at the end of the third quarter was $3.1 billion offsetting total debt of $5.7 billion for a net debt to total capitalization ratio of 12%. We remain committed to pursuing our objective to strengthen our balance sheet further during upturns. Beyond the regular dividend and debt reduction we regularly review performance scenarios that may present options for additional cash return to shareholders. We haven't ruled out buybacks or a variable or special dividend and we'll consider all options for additional return of cash to shareholders when the opportunity presents itself. Next up is Billy to review our operational performance. This is Tim. And you're exactly right. It is the operating cash flows, that determines the -- a sustained dividend. As far as the $3 billion in cash, we do have a bond coming due in February. And currently we are anticipating being able to pay that bond off with that cash. But we have significant flexibility if the market changes to do whatever we need to do. So, we're in a good position to manage that situation. There -- again, we evaluate it depending on the conditions at the time. So, to give you a number there's not a number I can give you. It all depends on what the stock -- I mean, the price of the commodities are at the time, as to how much cash we need to have on the balance sheet. And also what our budget is, our capital budget and how much capital we'll be spending."

            "name": "Ezra Yacob",
            "content": "Yes. Brian, this is Ezra. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I think, as Bill highlighted, really what we start with that exploration program, our focus right now is to find plays where we can capture the sweet spot acreage positions in those plays. And we're looking for plays that are really going to be additive to the front end of our inventory. So as we've talked about, we've got multiple exploration plays we're currently evaluating. And we just don't want to build a deeper inventory, but really strengthen that inventory. And if we look at what we've done this year, our -- the minimum rate of return on our 11,500 premium well inventory generates a 30% direct after-tax return at $40 oil and $2.50 flat natural gas price. But in this year's program, we've illustrated the significant value of focusing on the top end of our inventory. And we've delivered lower well costs and production outperformance and high-grading our investment criteria, to focus on the upper half of that inventory. And so, said another way, our 60% premium rate of return median well inventory will pay out approximately twice as fast as a 30% rate of return well. And so, our emphasis on organic exploration has always been a key to our success and it continues to be how we sustainably replace what we drill every year in our inventory. The Austin Chalk announcement today, I think, provides a very good example of what a higher rock quality can do in this exploration effort. The Austin Chalk is really more of a hybrid play, so it shares characteristics of unconventional and conventional reservoirs. And when we apply our technology, our data collection on core and log, to really identify the sweet spot landing zones that will react very well to our horizontal completions technology, that's when we really have -- that's when we really get excited and see the power that these hybrid plays can add. As we translate that into oil plays, we expect a very good outperformance with these hybrid zones. And we should be able to see a shallowing decline profile and lower finding and development costs, as we move forward into those. Yes. Bob this is Ezra. On the international front, I'd highlight we did just recently wrap up our recent drilling campaign in Trinidad with some additional outstanding results. We highlighted some of the discoveries, on the last call. But I'd follow-up and say, our most recent completion the Oilbird -- a well off the Oilbird platform came on in the third quarter at over 60 million cubic feet a day of natural gas with an additional 2,500 barrels of condensate per day. We brought on a well off of our Kitscoty platform, that's cleaning up right now, its flow back rates of approximately 30 million cubic feet, per day of gas. And so we continue to be excited about the discoveries that we made during this campaign and look forward to sharing future results, from this high-return asset. And then also during the third quarter, we entered into the country of Oman, with the acquisition of about 4.6 million net acres in Block 36. Block 36 is in the southwest portion of the country. It's located in the Rub Al Khali basin, which is a well-known hydrocarbon-bearing basin. And as -- we've been looking really outside the U.S. for the right opportunity to apply, our expertise in tight oil development, and we view Oman is really offering that. They offer a very low geopolitical risk, and they offer access to competitively priced oilfield services and equipment, that we think is going to be required to make tight oil successful. And so as part of the agreement, we plan to drill two test wells in the next two years to evaluate the potential of the acreage. And we're very excited about the low-cost of entry in Oman and the option to evaluate a basin with significant potential upside. And I think, maybe Ken could add some color in addition to that."

Here's Bill Thomas.\nBill Thomas: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. EOG's second quarter results demonstrate the company's ability to quickly adapt to an unprecedented drop in commodity prices. We exceeded our own expectations by delivering more oil for less capital and lower operating costs, allowing the company to generate significant free cash flow during the quarter. In May, we published our revised plan which aggressively reduced our full-year capital more than 45% and LOE more than 20%. EOG's employees rose to the challenge, not only achieving the incredible reduction targets we said, but beating them. Compared to our aggressive plan and guidance for the second quarter, we produce 7% more oil spent a whopping 26% less capital. And our cash operating costs, which include LOE, transportation, and gathering and processing, were 10% lower. With a rapid reduction in capital and operating costs, the company generated nearly $200 million of free cash flow, while oil process average less than $28 a barrel. Our second quarter results are a testament to the return-focused culture of EOG employees and our ability to pivot quickly in response to the unprecedented level of market volatility and industry conditions. Last quarter, we laid out seven strategic focus points for the remainder of 2020. Here's a quick progress report. Our first strategic point is only to invest capital if it generates a premium right a return. Premium return is defined as a 30% or higher direct after-tax rate of return using a prospect of $40 flat oil. In this downturn, we have raised a return bar even higher by using $30 oil instead of $40 to calculate our 30% rate of return. Our second focus point this year is to exercise operational flexibility to quickly reduce costs, with capital 26 below target, and cash operating costs 10% below target. Our second quarter results demonstrate our ability to move quickly in a volatile environment. Our third focus point is to accelerate our technical innovation across the company. This is an area where we're most excited about. While we anticipated some additional opportunity for innovation because of the slowdown in our pace of development; our employees' ability to accelerate innovation even while working remotely has exceeded our expectations. We recently completed our yearly technical conferences across each discipline, all via video conferencing. We are amazed at the volume of new innovative ideas presented some creative ways to cut costs and new tools to identify and evaluate prospects. I am confident that the tremendous progress we've made this year will accelerate EOG's lead as the sustainable improvements start paying dividends in the future. By driving down the profitable required generating double digit returns and extending EOG's industry leadership and returning on capital employed. Our fourth focus point is to exit 2020 with momentum in the next year by increasing production into the price recovery. As Billy will cover in a few minutes, we've increased our quarterly and full-year production volume estimates. In addition, with the cost reduction for making this year, we have improved our maintenance capital outlook for 2021. We now expect we will be able to maintain higher volumes for the same capital and cover both capital and the dividend with cash flow and less than $40 oil. Our improvements in volume coupled with reductions in well and operating costs are setting us up for strong performance next year. Our fifth focal point this year is to remain hyper vigilant about maintaining our financial strength. Our goal each year is to spend within cash flow and maintain an impeccable balance sheet to support operations and protect our dividend. This downturn has demonstrated the value of the EOG's historically strong balance sheet more than ever. With this goal in mind, we reduced CapEx more than 45% to $3.5 billion so that full year cash flow funds CapEx in the low 30s. If oil prices average $40 for the year, full year cash flow also funds the dividend and generates free cash flow. Sixth, our focus is to continue to invest in the long-term value of the business. In fact, once again, this break in our pace of development has actually accelerated our progress by creating more time to fine tune our quality exploration work. We continue to drill on prospects that we believe will further improve company performance. You will hear from Ezra in a moment regarding recent exploration progress. The seventh focus on this year is the most important. Protecting and enhancing EOG's culture is the key to our continued success. We have highly skilled employees who are focused on constantly improving every area of the company; we remain committed to our employees as they are the ones who are making EOG, a much better company during this downtime. Armed with extensive data for proprietary apps and information technology, EOG employees are overcoming the challenging conditions by continuing not only to innovate, but to accelerate innovation. We believe we're in the process of making another significant improvement in EOG's performance, similar to the last downturn when we initiated our premium drilling program in 2016. As a reminder, with premium standards in place from 2017 through 2019, EOG delivered an industry leading average return on capital employed of 14%, generated $4.6 billion in free cash flow, increased the dividend by 72% and reduced net debt $2.2 billion, and increased proved reserves by 55%. The EOG culture is rising to the challenge again, with innovation that is significantly improving the company's current and future performance. EOG's long-term game plan has not changed. We remain focused on high return reinvestment disciplined organic growth and generating substantial free cash flow to fund a sustainable growing dividend and maintain a strong balance sheet. EOG will emerge from the downturn a much better company and our commitment to creating long-term value for our shareholders has never been stronger. Before, I turn it over to Tim and Billy; I want to note how excited we are to continue our progress towards reducing GHG emissions. We are near the start-up of our 8 megawatt solar and natural gas hybrid electric power compressor station. In addition, we recently formed a sustainable power group within the company. This group will support our innovative culture to bring return focused, low emissions technology and projects forward quickly. EOG is committed to being an innovative leader in sustainability and the long-term in our energy solution. Next up is Tim.\nTimothy Driggers: Thanks Bill. EOG proved to be exceptionally resilient during one of the most severe quarters for the industry in our memory. I'd like to review the high-level changes in EOG's cash position during the second quarter. EOG had $2.9 billion of cash at the end of the first quarter. During the second quarter, the company generated discretionary cash flow of $672 million and after deducting CapEx of $478 million, we generated $194 million of free cash flow that nearly covered dividend payments of $217 million. Overtime, EOG's working capital position tends to be fairly balanced between current assets and liabilities. However, the increase in market volatility, our working capital balance can fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter. Changes in working capital in the second quarter represented a net cash outflow of $1 billion, which was more than offset by net cash inflow from working capital in the first quarter of $1.2 billion. We expect changes in working capital will be approximately neutral for the full year 2020 based on the current outlook for commodity prices. Moving on to the financing side of the ledger; EOG issued $1.5 billion of new debt and paid off a total of $1 billion in maturing notes during the quarter. This left the company with $2.4 billion of cash on hand at the end of the second quarter. Considering total debt of $5.7 billion, this yields a net debt the total cap ratio of 14%. In addition to cash on hand, a very strong liquidity position is further supported by a $2 billion unsecured revolving line of credit which has no borrowings against it. Looking ahead, we expect discretionary cash flow to exceed CapEx and dividend payments for the remainder of 2020, and oil prices in the mid-30s. In late April and early May, we elected to close out most of our hedge positions for the remainder of the year, as the volatility and commodity markets had abated, and prices seem to have more upside than downside. We affected this primarily by entering into offsetting contracts for those hedge positions we elected to close. Therefore, the timing of cash received or paid for settlement of these closed out hedges remaining the periods for which they are effective. We expect to receive $360 million in net cash payments in the second half of 2020 from these hedge positions that have been closed. As 2021 comes into focus, we will be the opportunistic about hedge -- adding hedges, if prices look attractive relative to our assessment of market fundamentals. Next up is Billy to review our operational performance.\nBilly Helms: Thanks, Tim. Last quarter, we made the decision to shut-in existing production and deploy our new wells rather than sell into an uncertain and low-price market. Our intent was that our lowest activity levels, lowest capital expenditures and lowest production volumes wouldn't coincide with the lowest point of the commodity price curve. And doing so, we enhanced the cash flow and margins for each barrel produced and maximize the rate of return for our investments. Our employees' execution of our challenging new plan during the second quarter was stellar. They answered the challenge by beating by wide margin; nearly ever capital expense and production goal we targeted under the new plan. After rapidly reducing our full year capital plan by nearly half, second quarter capital came in an additional 26% below target. We also reduced our cash operating expenses a total of 10% compared to the target. One of the hallmarks of EOG is striving for continuous improvements. But the downturn brought a new intensity to this effort. Our employees delivered even more by continuing to innovate capital and expense reductions that will benefit future operations. For example; we increased our full-year total well cost reduction target to 12% up from 8% just a few months ago. Our operating teams continue to drive efficiency in every aspect of our business. Drilling times are consistently improving, yet completion cost of seeing the most improvement during the quarter, down more than 15%. About half the capital savings can be attributed to cost efficiencies and the other half to service cost reductions. Our drilling rigs and frac fleet are largely under existing term contracts. So, service cost savings have been more from ancillary services. As rig and frac fleet contracts expire, we expect to see further cost reductions; therefore, we believe most of these savings to be sustainable. Our cash operating costs were down more than $50 million, or 10% relative to our second quarter guidance. Our operating teams went into high gear to identify opportunities to reduce expenses during the second quarter with a focus on every category. Some of the largest cost reductions are reduced work over expenses, water disposal and lease maintenance and repairs. These reduced expenses played a major role in helping to generate free cash flow during the second quarter. It is also important to note that we have reduced our full-year cash operating cost guidance by almost $20 million, or 6% on a per unit basis. On the production side; we also beat our forecast. This is mainly due to bringing the shut-in volumes back on sooner than anticipated. One observation from our production data revealed that almost every well exhibited some level of flush production before we returning to its previous decline profile; further evidence that the well sustained no damage from the shedding period. In addition, the decline observed from the base production was less than previously forecasted, also contributing to the production beat. As a result, we have raised our full-year oil production guidance by 16,000 barrels of oil per day or 4%. Our dramatically reduced activity and the temporary shut-in our production, combined with the expense reductions generated positive net cash flow, and deferred a large amount of production into a higher price quarter. Slide 12 of our presentation this quarter illustrates the updated shut-in volumes and the corresponding product price. While we have slowed our overall spending, we have maintained our commitment to reducing GHG emissions by continuing to invest in innovative new technologies and initiatives. Our focus on reducing flaring continues with our gas capture right now exceeding 99.5%. To further minimize flaring, particularly when caused by unpredictable downstream market interruptions; we tested a new EOG innovation we have named Closed-Loop Gas capture. Closed-Loop Gas capture is an automated process developed in-house to reroute natural gas back into existing wells when a downstream interruption occurs. Initial results were successful in indicate that our Closed-Loop Gas capture process has the potential to both reduce flaring and return a majority of the captured gas from the well back to production. In late 2019, we initiated a pilot project in New Mexico to combine solar and natural gas to power electric motor driven compressors. Compressors typically use natural gas to power the engines and our source of GHG emissions from stationary combustion. Since solar power is only available during the day, we designed a hybrid power plant to supplement daytime solar power generation with reliable natural gas generation at night. During the day, the solar panels should produce 8-megawatts of power with no combustion emissions. Compared to the traditional natural gas-powered compression; we believe our hybrid power compression will result in lower operating expenses and a meaningful reduction in emissions. This facility will become operational later this month. Both of these projects demonstrate that we approach GHG like every aspect of our business, focusing on sound economic decisions; and continuously improving our operations. EOG has a long history of adapting to changing industry conditions and using technology to improve the company. As Bill noted earlier, to further enhance our efforts to be a leader in GHG reduction, we recently announced a new strategic initiative to identify and implement returns focused, low emissions power generation within EOG. We are confident that this initiative led by our sustainable power group will be another area in which EOG will lead the way in finding more cost-effective methods to generate power while reducing our impact on the environment and generating a healthy rate of return. And finally, I am extremely proud of how all of our employees have responded to this year's challenges, and doing so while adapting to remote working conditions. Here's Ezra for an update on recent exploration success in Trinidad.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Billy. EOG has had very successful business in Trinidad for 27-years. About 20% of EOG's natural gas production comes from shallow water, offshore fields in the Columbus Basin of Trinidad. Most of the gas is sold as feedstock into a sizable petrochemical industry on the island, primarily producing ammonia and methanol. Trinidad has had a competitive financial profile within EOG due to our competitive advantages in the country as a low-cost operator, and our long track record of exploration success. While our capital investments in Trinidad typically make-up a small percentage of our overall CapEx budget, the returns on that capital are competitive with EOG's domestic portfolio, and consistently generate free cash flow and net income. The latest round of exploration and development in Trinidad kicked-off in the spring of 2018 with the acquisition of a set of modern seismic images; the combination of new seismic and updated geologic models provided a deep inventory of prospects to develop our exploration plan. This plan included farming into new acreage held by another operator, where we could apply our low-cost structure to improve the economics on these high potential exploration blocks. Drilling began in July 2019, and we have recorded 4 initial discoveries with estimated natural gas potential of 1 Tcf gross and 500 BcF net to EOG. The discoveries are located in shallow water off the Southeast Coast of Trinidad. Our 2 open-water exploration will support the installation of new production platforms beginning in 2021. The final two wells and the current drilling campaign are in process and should be completed by your end. Production from this drilling campaign will more than offset natural declines from existing wells and provide a foundation of growth EOG's total production in Trinidad. Lastly, the initial success of this latest Exploration Program sets up the potential for additional delineation, and exploration drilling in Trinidad in future years. I would also like to take a moment to discuss our own ongoing domestic exploration effort. We've made good progress moving multiple prospects forward during 2020 despite a reduction to our initial capital plan. Leasing across multiple basins is going well, and we are capturing contiguous positions and what we feel are the sweet spots of these plays. We have an initiated drilling in some projects and are currently incorporating modern well logs and core data into our geologic models. We look forward to providing updates regarding the testing of these prospects at an appropriate time. Next up is William to provide concluding remarks.\nBill Thomas: Thanks Ezra. In conclusion, I would like to note the following important takeaways. First, our second quarter operational results were outstanding. We rapidly reduce capital and operating costs while increasing volumes. This resulted in significant free cash flow. Second, we have improved our full-year 2020 guidance by increasing volumes and further reducing costs. Third, our 2021 maintenance outlook has improved to include more oil with no increase in capital. We can maintain higher volumes and cover both capital and the dividend with cash flow at less than $40 oil. Fourth, as demonstrated by results, the EOG culture continues to rapidly and sustainably improve the company. During this downturn, we believe we're in the process of making another step change to improve further profitability. And finally, EOG's fundamentals have not changed. Our focus on returns, discipline; growth, and generation of significant free cash flow to fund a growing sustainable dividend; and strong balance sheet have not wavered. Our commitment to creating long term shareholder value has never been stronger. Thanks for listening. And now we'll go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nLeoMariani: Hi, guys. I was hoping to get maybe a little bit more color on some of the cost reductions on the well side, from a capital perspective this year. Just looking through the slides, I mean, it looks like maybe it's a little bit more concentrated in the Permian in terms of your expectations. I know that's, where a lot of your activity is occurring, but are you seeing kind of outsized gains there, maybe relative to the Eagle Ford in terms your expectations throughout the year?\nBillThomas: Yes, thank you, Leo. We're going to ask Billy to comment on that.\nBillyHelms: Yes. Good morning, Leo. Yes, you're right at most of our CapEx is generally directed towards the Delaware Basin. So certainly on $1 basis that's where most of the savings are as well. Just to give you a little more color on the capital savings, about a third of the capital savings are from efficiency gains. A third from pricing improvements and a third is really just delaying facilities and infrastructure from the second quarter into the future third and fourth quarter of quarter. So from that we were able to see most of the cost savings probably on the completion side of our business, as I mentioned during the notes on the call, and you have to remember, we're still under some long-term contracts for drilling rigs and frac fleet. So, as that roll-off, we expect to be able to capture some of the market rate saving on those in the future, but we're seeing savings on some other ancillary services that I mentioned. Largely things like maybe chemicals being down 20% to 25%, some of the equipment rentals being down 20% to 30%. And things like that. So, you're seeing some savings on some of the other aspects of the business, not necessarily on the frac fleets and drilling rigs.\nLeoMariani: Okay, that's helpful color for sure. And I guess I was hoping, if you could talk a little about the potential issue surrounding federal acreage here. Certainly saw from the slide, you guys are kind of saying roughly half your premium inventory is located on federal lands. Obviously, the election is clearly uncertain. But do you guys have any thoughts as to kind of, whether or not there might be any limitations going forward on the event of a Biden victory?\nBillThomas: Yes, Leo, this is Bill. We've got a lot of experience drilling on federal land for decades, and we've been able to successfully navigate all the changes in the past; we've had many changes over the years. And so I'm confident we're well positioned to continue to adapt and not let those changes significantly affect us. There are two reasons why I'm confident. And then I'll ask Billy to add some additional color. The first is we've got a large amount of premium quality drilling potential on non-federal land; we have a tremendous inventory. That's really not affected by the federal changes; that provides significant operational flexibility. On top of that our exploration program that Ezra mentioned, we believe is going to provide some outstanding opportunities to continue to improve our inventory with better rock. And most of that is located on non-federal lands. And we've got a lot of confidence that we can continue to generate and add non-federal potential. That's even better what we have. And then we've got a very strong growing backlog of approved drilling permits on federal land. And I think Billy's got some numbers on that. And then number two; our governments that have a system of checks and balance that allow the voices of many stakeholders to be heard. And as a part of these checks and balances, any changes would take time and have to consider all those stakeholder interests. And so the success of our responsible development is aligned with many important states and communities where we operate; for example, from federal lands, they're shared, the revenues are shared with the States and in 2019 over $2 billion or revenue was paid out over to 35 states. And so it's not an easy thing to change significantly the Federal drilling potential. So I'm going to ask Billy to add some more color.\nBillyHelms: Yes, thanks, Bill. As Bill mentioned, we're starting with a lot of flexibility with our decentralized culture, multi basin approach, we have the ability to move activity around quite extensively. On top of that, our exploration program, which is in basin really outside of our current operating areas, has the opportunity to further add to our non-federal drilling inventory. As Bill mentioned, we have quite a few premium locations that we've announced and about half of those are on non-federal lands. In addition, almost half of our premium locations that work at $30 are also non-federal lands and you can look at Slide 10 of our deck that illustrates that. So the part of that was to meet the rate of return hurdle at $30, about half of those are non-federal. So it's pretty good distribution of both federal and non-federal makeup, that entire inventory list. And the non-federal inventory is just as high quality as our federal. So the impact of our non-federal inventory it supports at least eight years of drilling with similar capital efficiency is we're experiencing in our 2020 plan. And Bill mentioned, we have quite a few federal permits, we have about 2,500 federal permits that are approved or in progress, and which is certainly more than four years of inventory. And also in the Permian Basin, over 90% of our federal acreage is held by production. Our government also provides, as Bill mentioned, an important system of checks and balances which provides for due process before any regulatory changes, and these changes have to consider the interests of all stakeholders, ultimately, regulatory and legislative changes that denies access to current property rights could amount to a government taking. So there certainly be some legal consequences of going through the process. And then, just to point out too, we have a very good close alignment with our stakeholders, including the communities we work in. And Mexico is a great example of that. We recently conducted a very successful partnership with a state control to complete our Closed-Loop Gas capture project and I mentioned earlier and on a day-to-day basis, I'm very proud of that close working relationship we have built with regulatory agencies really to have a responsible development, open communication, paying attention to their needs. It also enables us to meet our goals and operate in a timely and efficient manner. And our success in turn has helped support a better quality of life for the people of New Mexico, for example, in 2019; the state received nearly 40% of its overall revenue from the oil and gas industry. And that certainly supports the initiatives to increase funding for public health, education, and infrastructure improvements, and so on. On top of that, oil and gas development supports 100,000 jobs in Mexico along with the associated economic activity and benefits. A significant amount of that revenue from oil and gas activities on federal lands is also dispersed to the state governments to support local communities. And of course, the two states have benefited the most are New Mexico and Wyoming. New Mexico received $1.2 billion and Wyoming $641 million in 2019 alone. And the BLM estimates that oil and gas activity on federal lands provided about $70 billion economic uplift nationally, and supported about 300,000 jobs. So there are a lot of important considerations and stakeholders involved in any of these decisions to consider when changing the rules on federal land. So for these reasons, along with our diversion, and really growing inventory, we remained extremely confident that EOG will be able to continue to navigate through any changing regulatory landscape, just as we have in the past.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\nBobBrackett: Good morning. I'm intrigued by the comments that bringing back shut-ins led to flush production and lower than expected decline, is there a learning there to apply to future developments? And is the mechanism understood?\nBillThomas: Billy, do you want to comment on that? Or Ken?\nKenBoedeker: Yes. This is Ken, Bob. The majority of our worlds are single zone wells under primary depletion. So as we shut those wells in; they continue to build bottom hole pressure and then we turn them on those wells will show flush production until that bottom well pressure is has gone down to what it was prior to that. So it's a mechanism that's well understood for the horizontal wells that we have that are under that. We don't have any wells that are under water floods or multiple zones where you can have one zone damaging another. So it is well understood and it's following exactly what we expected on the flush production profiles.\nBobBrackett: And then what about the lower than expected decline?\nKenBoedeker: On the base decline; in terms of the base decline, we'll see the lower base decline was just that we saw those wells we had forecasted them conservatively, and the wells are performing better than what we thought they would.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nPaulCheng: Thank you. Good morning. I'm just curious that, I mean, one of the comments is that with the slowdown in the activities, you have seen a substantial improvement in the efficiency because you have more time there to work on. So if we extrapolate that, I mean, even when the commodity prices are returning to higher level, is it better off for the company from a return standpoint for you to slow your activity level and not trying to grow as fast?\nBillyHelms: Yes, Paul, thank you. The efficiencies we've seen a substantial amount of innovative ideas that have been generated and I think when people have more time to think, instead of doing things they think through and they are able to look at the data and analyze it. They are able to come-up with more ideas and a lot of creative ideas. One of the basis of our disciplined growth strategy is to grow at a pace that we can get better; we don't ever want to grow so fast and have so much activity that we cannot get to we cannot get better at the same time. So it's really is a balance you can only allocate capital in a certain speed; if you go too fast, you outrun your learning curve, et cetera, et cetera. So there is a benefit to a proper pace. And we have been able to benefit from this slowdown, every downtime that we are in. And we have experienced multiple ones over my 40-years. Every downturn, we make the biggest improvements in the company. It's a challenge, the times are challenging. This has been no different than any of the others; other than we're working more remotely than we ever have. And we're very fortunate to have in place our very extensive information technology system and our database, and all of our apps. In that we've leveraged all that technology to analyze and to make changes; and to come up with ideas how to kind of continue to improve the company. So we're super excited about where we're headed. I think we're going to exit this downturn a much, much better company; able to generate even higher returns than we have in the past, and really do all of our business better than we have in the past. So it's a very exciting time for us.\nPaulCheng: Can I follow-up on that slightly different way? One of your major competitors is also a well-known premium growth E&P company have drastically shifted their business model, and taken a more balanced growth and cash return with a well-defined cash flow reinvestment approach or a distribution approach. And one of the arguments that they also make is that while growing faster may on paper see a higher net percent value but in logic you are at the mercy of OPEC. And I think the behavior of NPS and Putin in the recent times show that may no longer be a reliable to depend on. So I mean do you guys agree with that kind of argument? And if not, why not? I mean we're trying to understand why that a premium operator like EOG will not want perhaps to have a more a balanced growth and cash return business model and trying to grow at a slower pace than what you previously has been, even when the commodity price is getting much higher?\nBillThomas: Paul. Yes, that's an excellent, observation. And we are fundamentally a return focus company and that's what we've been doing for a number of years. If you look back at the last three years, we gave out these numbers. They're on our slide deck, and I've talked about it in the opening, we've been a leader in the industry return on capital employed, so we're focused on improving returns every year. And we've also been a leader in generating free cash flow; we generated over one and a $1.5 billion of free cash flow over the last three years every year and for $4.6 billion. And that funded a very sustainable growing dividend. We increased the dividend by 72%, and we reduced our debt; our net debt over $2 billion. So we've been a very disciplined company, and we did all that at a spending level that was our cash, our CapEx to cash flow ratio was about 80%. So really what you're hearing from really the rest of the industry is are now moving into the model that EOG has been working really for the last three years. And we're thrilled about that. That is fantastic. For the industry, for investors, and certainly, it's very positive for all processes, we move forward. So, we agree, they're doing the right thing. And that's the thing that we've been doing for a number of years, and we fully support their move.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please go ahead.\nNealDingmann: Good morning, all. And nice to see the continued diversified approach. My first question is around as comments in your release about the improved 2021 maintenance CapEx leading to a higher for 4Q exit rate. Really, I guess the way my comments on this, based on this, could you speak to what this mean for the trajectory for next year as well as what this potentially could mean for even 2022?\nBillThomas: Billy, do you want to address that?\nBillyHelms: Yes. Good morning, Neal, this is Billy. So on 2021 maintenance capital; previously, in previous quarter, we outlined the same capital number for about 420,000 barrels a day, which was believed to be at that time what our exit rate would be for the for 2020. Certainly bringing out a bunch of extra production this year, but also incorporating the cost savings we're achieving this year. We believe we can do this same capital dollar number $3.4 million, but maintain the exit rate we're seeing this year of 300 -- or 440,000 barrels a day, which is a significant improvement again in our capital efficiency number. So we believe we can maintain that as we go forward; that is not just meant to be a single snapshot. I think one thing it doesn't make into that and make sure everybody understands this is forecasting on what we're achieving today. It doesn't make in any improvements in, and well performance that we expect to be able to continue to see, as well as cost reductions that if things stay where they are, and we're saying in this environment; we're extremely confident we'll still continue to see cost improvements that will drive our maintenance capital number improvements in the future. So, yes, I'm extremely confident we can have ongoing maintenance capital program and this same kind of area that we're talking about today.\nNealDingmann: Very good. My second question just around your technical innovations, given the strength and I think you'll have really above anybody else on the upstream side, would this ever lead you to consider broadening the business by considering any sort of clean tech or [Indiscernible] related investment?\nBillThomas: Neil. Yes, our focus on GHG reductions is in this forming this sustainable power group within our company is to really focus on technology, bringing technology forward more quickly inside the company, and it's really another organic efforts like we do everything else inside the company to really improve our emissions, but also make sure that we can do it at a very high rate of return. And so it's really to facilitate our ongoing culture. We have tons of ideas that are coming from our divisions, and our folks involved in the field operations. And so we -- so we're really excited about the technology, and the innovations that's coming forward. And we're really excited about continuing to reduce our emissions. And certainly any kind of technology in this area, we believe will not only benefit EOG, but it could benefit the industry. And so we're open with that. It's not a proprietary thing. It's something we're doing to really continue to improve our environment.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Phillips Johnston with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.\nPhillipsJohnston: Hey, guys, thank you. Just to follow-up on Paul's question. EOG really stands out because unlike all your peers, you never cut the dividend over the last six years, and you also resisted all the pressure to buy back your stock over the last few years almost of your competitors; destroyed a lot of value doing that. The company that Paul talks about is laid out plans to start paying variable dividends or special dividends on top of the regular base dividend. I realize you guys want to continue to grow the base dividend at a healthy clip, but my question is, is there any appetite at the board level to supplement your regular dividend with recurring variable dividends? And if not, what kind of flaws do you see with that type of payout strategy that would prevent you guys from going down that road?\nBillThomas: Yes, Phil. Yes, your observation is right. We believe a sustainable growing dividend backed by an impeccable balance sheet is certainly the best way to return cash to shareholders, and we're very committed to that. And we don't want to take anything away from that. Having said that, we're certainly open to consider other additional things options. And so when we certainly welcome any shareholder input on that, and we will remain open and flexible to do what's best for everybody.\nPhillipsJohnston: Okay, are there any flaws or drawbacks that you kind of see with that type of variable dividend strategy?\nBillThomas: Well, I think the biggest one is it's kind of unknown and inconsistent. And the feedback we've received from many folks as they were -- they would really focus on a more consistent growing dividend. And certainly as you pointed out, we've never ever cut the dividend. And we want to make sure it's sustainable and certainly backing it up with an impeccable balance sheet. And so the mix we've had over the last several years as we talked about, we believe is a really good mix. And we believe that will create very, very significant shareholder value going forward.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Douglas Leggate of Bank of America Merrill. Please go ahead.\nDouglasLeggate: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I hope everyone's doing well out there. Bill, I'm afraid I'm going to be beat up on Paul's question a little bit for change question. And just play a couple of things back to you, if I may. It's not that long ago that EOG talked about 15% to 25% oil growth between $50 and $60 oil and the $58 oil price you refer to was subsidized by Saudi, who ultimately sent a bunch of cargoes to the U.S., presumably to teach the U.S. a lesson. So my question is when you walk through all the things that you're laying out about reinvestment rates and so on, the feedback from your peers is that their shareholders are telling them they don't want as much oil growth. So I guess my question to you is what are your shareholders telling you and asking you to do? And why is it not right to cut oil growth in a market that just doesn't need?\nBillThomas: Yes, Doug. I think as we stated in the opening remarks; fundamentally, we believe we've got a very, very strong game plan. And we've got a tremendous track record to back that up, being the leader and return on capital employed in the industry, while generating very significant free cash flow; and giving it back in a very strong dividend increase, and strengthen our balance sheet. And we believe that was the right strategy before the downturn. It certainly has put the company in a tremendous position where we are right now. And going forward, we believe that's the right strategy going forward to continue to create significant shareholder value going forward. So we believe our game plan is really solid. Our growth is always been very disciplined. Again, we've only allocated about 80% of our cash to CapEx. And so we've been able to grow the company in a very disciplined pace. And as we go into 2021 and the future, obviously, we need to keep our eye on the macro view of oil. We need to be aware of the market conditions. We're not interested in growing all oil volumes at a strong pace and an oversupplied market. Certainly, that's not the right thing to do. But we want to continue when the time is right, we want to continue to grow the company at a disciplined pace, at the pace to where we can continue to improve our returns, and improve our performance.\nDouglasLeggate: Bill, but as a footnote to the question, I think, people would really appreciate your leadership as a company here because you are one of the bigger companies and capital discipline needs to be defined, and I would urge you to try and do that. And my follow-up is maybe in an obtuse way of asking the same question. You're running 10 to 11 rigs right now; you've got the potential clearly to run three times that amount. So I guess what I'm really trying to get at is, are you planning to retain the same operational capability? In other words, the rest of you move back to that level? Or is like some of the other companies? Is there an opportunity here to address the cost base of the company by right sizing to perhaps a lower level of activity? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nBillThomas: Yes, Doug, we are really committed to our employees; they are the ones that are making our company better. They're the most valuable asset we have in the company. And so we have a lane, we run lane, we actually peaked on employment about four or five years ago; even though we've gotten a much bigger company, our employee base has really not grown. And so they're very highly productive. They're highly motivated. And they're certainly the part of the company that we want to keep intact and take care of and encourage. So we believe we're at the right size to be effective, to be ready as the downturn is over; so we're focused on continuing to maintain and to actually increase our culture or ability as we go forward, so we're very committed to keeping the company in great shape going forward.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nScottGruber: Yes. Good morning. Can you hear me? Great. I think your rig count today, I think, is around half a dozen rigs. Correct me if I'm wrong on that number, given the continued efficiency gains that you guys continue to achieve? What is the new level of maintenance rig activity and frac activity? \nBillThomas: Billy, do you want to answer that one?\nBillyHelms: Sure. Scott. This is Billy. So yes, you're right. We have actually 7 rigs counting to one in offshore Trinidad. So 6 domestically, 1 offshore. And our maintenance capital plan would require about 20 rigs and 10 frac fleets. And we're generally running as I mentioned 7 rigs and 5 or 6 frac fleet today. So we're well under it, when we pulled back our activity, we dropped to a level well below our maintenance capital level. And that's important to note. So the plan certainly going into the third and fourth quarter is be looking at whether or not we want to add a rig or two going into the next year to get to that maintenance level or not.\nScottGruber: Got it. And then you mentioned also that you have -- most of your rigs and frac crews under long-term contracts. I imagine those were the ones you kept just given the cost of ending those contracts. Are these generally multiyear contracts and support of new frac e-fleets or did the majority roll off over the next 12-months? I am trying to ascertain when those savings manifest; I imagine the rigs and frac crews today given the deflation on other services, these regional frac crews maybe pushing towards 40% or 50% of your direct well costs. I just trying to get my head around when you could see those savings roll through?\nBillyHelms: Yes, sure, Scott. Yes, they are multiyear contracts. And I'd say they're various term-- various terms on the contracts. But in general, they're starting to roll off in the next 12 to 18 months. I think the one thing that's important to note is we build what we think are valuable relationships with our most trusted service providers. And we worked through this in partnership with them to make sure we retained not only the performance and the high performing equipment personnel, but the ability to ramp back up when we need to. So it gives us a lot of flexibility as we work through this. And I think, certainly, we build a lot by building that relationship. It's a very trusted relationship we have; it allows us to make to capture some cost savings just been able to capture rates at below market rates in current times, but also maintain the high performing levels of activity that we need to sustain our business. So we're very proud of our relationships we have with them. But, yes, they typically roll off in the next 12 or 18 months. And we'll kind of reassess where we need to be working with those trusted partners.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Juan Jarrah with TD Securities. Please go ahead.\nJuanJarrah: Yes, thanks, guys. And thanks for squeezing me in and congrats on the exploration success in Trinidad. I did want to follow-up a bit on your onshore exploration efforts. I noticed easier said than done, but can you comment on any other exploration efforts you consider pursuing outside of the Lower 48 and with that Canada comes to mind and as you know, one of your peers recently announced adding a position to their Montney in Canada, so just curious on that, and I'll stop there.\nBillThomas: Ezra?\nEzraYacob: Yes, thanks. Thanks Juan. This is Ezra. As you know, we've got -- you mentioned our Trinidad exploration effort, and then our domestic exploration effort. And so when we think about anything else outside of the Lower 48; it really comes down to how competitive can it be with our pre-existing domestic portfolio? And that's the main driver on it. When we talk about any of our new exploration ideas, whether it's Trinidad or the new domestic portfolio; we're exploring for prospects and rock quality that will be additive to the front end of our pre-existing inventory. At 10,500 premium locations, I'm not sure if we necessarily just need more to continue to backfill that deep inventory; what we're really trying to do is add to the front end of it. And that's what the exploration efforts focused on.\nOperator: The next question will come from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBrianSinger: Thank you. Good morning. You mentioned in the 10-Q, that you expect to replace the $750 million of debt coming due next year with other long-term debt. And I thought that was interesting because you've been talking while I think about paying down debt and having the cash on the balance sheet to do so. And so I wondered, if you could add a bit more color on, a; how you're thinking about the right level of free cash flow to pursue? And then if not allocated to paying down debt, where you see the best areas of allocation between incremental drilling, returning it to shareholders, or keeping a high amount of cash on the balance sheet or deploying it elsewhere like M&A?\nBillThomas: Tim?\nTimothyDriggers: Yes. So the reason we chose to keep the debt and long-term debt at June 30 was just the uncertainty of the market going forward between now and February when our next debt is due. Certainly, the goal has not changed. And that goal is to pay down debt. So if market conditions play out as such that we have the cash, sufficient cash then we will pay down that debt. But to be conservative, we left it in long-term, just because of the uncertainty in the market. And I guess, Bill, will address the capital allocation portion of your question.\nBillThomas: Yes, the right level of free cash flow, Brian, is really a function of -- it's obviously variable every year, number one, based on the oil price. We normally we have -- and we will continue to kind of use a conservative view, our macro conservative view of what oil process will be that year. And then we certainly have a goal every year to generate significant amount of free cash flow; is example the last three years we've generated about $1.5 million a year on average free cash flow. And we want to use that to continue to, as Tim said, consider paying our debt now, our goal is to continue to paying our debt down more, and certainly continue to work on our dividends when the environment is healthy. And then after that we will allocate the capital, continue to allocate it at a very disciplined level just like we have in the past. And discipline means that we're not going to allocate the capital at a speed that's too fast to where we cannot learn and grow and get better. We want to always be increasing our capital efficiency and lower our funding costs. Continuing to lower our operating costs, and those kinds of things. And so you have to go at the proper speed to do that every year, and that's really the governor on allocating the capital. And whatever free cash flow is left over after all those things are done, obviously, it's that will be variable by year-by-year, according to the commodity process. We will continue to be committed to using that capital to continue to create shareholder value, and making sure we get the highest return possible avenues on using that cash.\nBrianSinger: Right, thank you. And then my follow-up goes back to the exploration program. I think as you mentioned, a couple comments I thought was interesting one was that the exploration you're pursuing is even better than what you have, and then that it's in basins outside the current operating area, and largely not on federal land. And I wondered if you could add a bit more color on what type of impact the onshore exploration you're pursuing could have on your potential production or capital investment. One or two years out how, what the proximity is to being able to really move these plays into development and have a level of materiality on your production. And then whether there are above ground issues that need to be worked out with the areas from midstream or other perspective?\nEzraYacob: Yes, Brian, this is Ezra. Let me try to unpack that one-by-one here. First, I'd say our -- as we've talked about in the past, our domestic exploration effort; these aren't really in Frontier or Wildcat basins. These are in basins where there is an established legacy, oil and gas production. And so if these prospects work out the way that we think they will, and they're additive to the front-end quality of our inventory, we should be able to move them into active development basis pretty quickly, obviously, pending results. The second part of that going back to just the quality of what we're looking for; this is -- it's a better rock quality as we've talked about before, a lot of what we're looking at is tied to what we think we can develop with our horizontal completions technology. And what I mean by that is just exactly how does the rock -- how's it going to respond. How is it going to actually be stimulated and fracture in combination with our stimulation designs? And so those are the two things that we think are really we're focused on; it is definitely not traditional, unconventional types of rocks that have been focused on in the past. And so as we continue to kind of push these prospects forward and get data on them, we will update you guys with our results on the testing. But we're feeling very confident. Everything that we're seeing today that they are going to continue to be, as I said earlier, additive to the front end of our -- what really is a pretty deep inventory to begin with.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Thomas for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nBill Thomas: In closing, first, we want to thank all EOG employees for the outstanding job you're doing to improve the company during this historic and challenging downturn. As we said, the company is improving very rapidly. And we're going to emerge from this downturn a better and stronger company. So we're eager to extend our leadership, and return on capital employed; discipline growth, free cash flow generation and sustainability. Thanks for listening and thanks for your support.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Timothy Driggers",
            "content": "Thank you and good morning. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing second quarter 2020 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions as well as reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and in the accompanying investor presentation slides may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential, not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday. Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Ezra Yacob, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor and Public Relations. Here's Bill Thomas. Thanks Bill. EOG proved to be exceptionally resilient during one of the most severe quarters for the industry in our memory. I'd like to review the high-level changes in EOG's cash position during the second quarter. EOG had $2.9 billion of cash at the end of the first quarter. During the second quarter, the company generated discretionary cash flow of $672 million and after deducting CapEx of $478 million, we generated $194 million of free cash flow that nearly covered dividend payments of $217 million. Overtime, EOG's working capital position tends to be fairly balanced between current assets and liabilities. However, the increase in market volatility, our working capital balance can fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter. Changes in working capital in the second quarter represented a net cash outflow of $1 billion, which was more than offset by net cash inflow from working capital in the first quarter of $1.2 billion. We expect changes in working capital will be approximately neutral for the full year 2020 based on the current outlook for commodity prices. Moving on to the financing side of the ledger; EOG issued $1.5 billion of new debt and paid off a total of $1 billion in maturing notes during the quarter. This left the company with $2.4 billion of cash on hand at the end of the second quarter. Considering total debt of $5.7 billion, this yields a net debt the total cap ratio of 14%. In addition to cash on hand, a very strong liquidity position is further supported by a $2 billion unsecured revolving line of credit which has no borrowings against it. Looking ahead, we expect discretionary cash flow to exceed CapEx and dividend payments for the remainder of 2020, and oil prices in the mid-30s. In late April and early May, we elected to close out most of our hedge positions for the remainder of the year, as the volatility and commodity markets had abated, and prices seem to have more upside than downside. We affected this primarily by entering into offsetting contracts for those hedge positions we elected to close. Therefore, the timing of cash received or paid for settlement of these closed out hedges remaining the periods for which they are effective. We expect to receive $360 million in net cash payments in the second half of 2020 from these hedge positions that have been closed. As 2021 comes into focus, we will be the opportunistic about hedge -- adding hedges, if prices look attractive relative to our assessment of market fundamentals. Next up is Billy to review our operational performance. Yes. So the reason we chose to keep the debt and long-term debt at June 30 was just the uncertainty of the market going forward between now and February when our next debt is due. Certainly, the goal has not changed. And that goal is to pay down debt. So if market conditions play out as such that we have the cash, sufficient cash then we will pay down that debt. But to be conservative, we left it in long-term, just because of the uncertainty in the market. And I guess, Bill, will address the capital allocation portion of your question."

            "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. EOG's second quarter results demonstrate the company's ability to quickly adapt to an unprecedented drop in commodity prices. We exceeded our own expectations by delivering more oil for less capital and lower operating costs, allowing the company to generate significant free cash flow during the quarter. In May, we published our revised plan which aggressively reduced our full-year capital more than 45% and LOE more than 20%. EOG's employees rose to the challenge, not only achieving the incredible reduction targets we said, but beating them. Compared to our aggressive plan and guidance for the second quarter, we produce 7% more oil spent a whopping 26% less capital. And our cash operating costs, which include LOE, transportation, and gathering and processing, were 10% lower. With a rapid reduction in capital and operating costs, the company generated nearly $200 million of free cash flow, while oil process average less than $28 a barrel. Our second quarter results are a testament to the return-focused culture of EOG employees and our ability to pivot quickly in response to the unprecedented level of market volatility and industry conditions. Last quarter, we laid out seven strategic focus points for the remainder of 2020. Here's a quick progress report. Our first strategic point is only to invest capital if it generates a premium right a return. Premium return is defined as a 30% or higher direct after-tax rate of return using a prospect of $40 flat oil. In this downturn, we have raised a return bar even higher by using $30 oil instead of $40 to calculate our 30% rate of return. Our second focus point this year is to exercise operational flexibility to quickly reduce costs, with capital 26 below target, and cash operating costs 10% below target. Our second quarter results demonstrate our ability to move quickly in a volatile environment. Our third focus point is to accelerate our technical innovation across the company. This is an area where we're most excited about. While we anticipated some additional opportunity for innovation because of the slowdown in our pace of development; our employees' ability to accelerate innovation even while working remotely has exceeded our expectations. We recently completed our yearly technical conferences across each discipline, all via video conferencing. We are amazed at the volume of new innovative ideas presented some creative ways to cut costs and new tools to identify and evaluate prospects. I am confident that the tremendous progress we've made this year will accelerate EOG's lead as the sustainable improvements start paying dividends in the future. By driving down the profitable required generating double digit returns and extending EOG's industry leadership and returning on capital employed. Our fourth focus point is to exit 2020 with momentum in the next year by increasing production into the price recovery. As Billy will cover in a few minutes, we've increased our quarterly and full-year production volume estimates. In addition, with the cost reduction for making this year, we have improved our maintenance capital outlook for 2021. We now expect we will be able to maintain higher volumes for the same capital and cover both capital and the dividend with cash flow and less than $40 oil. Our improvements in volume coupled with reductions in well and operating costs are setting us up for strong performance next year. Our fifth focal point this year is to remain hyper vigilant about maintaining our financial strength. Our goal each year is to spend within cash flow and maintain an impeccable balance sheet to support operations and protect our dividend. This downturn has demonstrated the value of the EOG's historically strong balance sheet more than ever. With this goal in mind, we reduced CapEx more than 45% to $3.5 billion so that full year cash flow funds CapEx in the low 30s. If oil prices average $40 for the year, full year cash flow also funds the dividend and generates free cash flow. Sixth, our focus is to continue to invest in the long-term value of the business. In fact, once again, this break in our pace of development has actually accelerated our progress by creating more time to fine tune our quality exploration work. We continue to drill on prospects that we believe will further improve company performance. You will hear from Ezra in a moment regarding recent exploration progress. The seventh focus on this year is the most important. Protecting and enhancing EOG's culture is the key to our continued success. We have highly skilled employees who are focused on constantly improving every area of the company; we remain committed to our employees as they are the ones who are making EOG, a much better company during this downtime. Armed with extensive data for proprietary apps and information technology, EOG employees are overcoming the challenging conditions by continuing not only to innovate, but to accelerate innovation. We believe we're in the process of making another significant improvement in EOG's performance, similar to the last downturn when we initiated our premium drilling program in 2016. As a reminder, with premium standards in place from 2017 through 2019, EOG delivered an industry leading average return on capital employed of 14%, generated $4.6 billion in free cash flow, increased the dividend by 72% and reduced net debt $2.2 billion, and increased proved reserves by 55%. The EOG culture is rising to the challenge again, with innovation that is significantly improving the company's current and future performance. EOG's long-term game plan has not changed. We remain focused on high return reinvestment disciplined organic growth and generating substantial free cash flow to fund a sustainable growing dividend and maintain a strong balance sheet. EOG will emerge from the downturn a much better company and our commitment to creating long-term value for our shareholders has never been stronger. Before, I turn it over to Tim and Billy; I want to note how excited we are to continue our progress towards reducing GHG emissions. We are near the start-up of our 8 megawatt solar and natural gas hybrid electric power compressor station. In addition, we recently formed a sustainable power group within the company. This group will support our innovative culture to bring return focused, low emissions technology and projects forward quickly. EOG is committed to being an innovative leader in sustainability and the long-term in our energy solution. Next up is Tim. Thanks Ezra. In conclusion, I would like to note the following important takeaways. First, our second quarter operational results were outstanding. We rapidly reduce capital and operating costs while increasing volumes. This resulted in significant free cash flow. Second, we have improved our full-year 2020 guidance by increasing volumes and further reducing costs. Third, our 2021 maintenance outlook has improved to include more oil with no increase in capital. We can maintain higher volumes and cover both capital and the dividend with cash flow at less than $40 oil. Fourth, as demonstrated by results, the EOG culture continues to rapidly and sustainably improve the company. During this downturn, we believe we're in the process of making another step change to improve further profitability. And finally, EOG's fundamentals have not changed. Our focus on returns, discipline; growth, and generation of significant free cash flow to fund a growing sustainable dividend; and strong balance sheet have not wavered. Our commitment to creating long term shareholder value has never been stronger. Thanks for listening. And now we'll go to Q&A. Yes, thank you, Leo. We're going to ask Billy to comment on that. Yes, Leo, this is Bill. We've got a lot of experience drilling on federal land for decades, and we've been able to successfully navigate all the changes in the past; we've had many changes over the years. And so I'm confident we're well positioned to continue to adapt and not let those changes significantly affect us. There are two reasons why I'm confident. And then I'll ask Billy to add some additional color. The first is we've got a large amount of premium quality drilling potential on non-federal land; we have a tremendous inventory. That's really not affected by the federal changes; that provides significant operational flexibility. On top of that our exploration program that Ezra mentioned, we believe is going to provide some outstanding opportunities to continue to improve our inventory with better rock. And most of that is located on non-federal lands. And we've got a lot of confidence that we can continue to generate and add non-federal potential. That's even better what we have. And then we've got a very strong growing backlog of approved drilling permits on federal land. And I think Billy's got some numbers on that. And then number two; our governments that have a system of checks and balance that allow the voices of many stakeholders to be heard. And as a part of these checks and balances, any changes would take time and have to consider all those stakeholder interests. And so the success of our responsible development is aligned with many important states and communities where we operate; for example, from federal lands, they're shared, the revenues are shared with the States and in 2019 over $2 billion or revenue was paid out over to 35 states. And so it's not an easy thing to change significantly the Federal drilling potential. So I'm going to ask Billy to add some more color. Billy, do you want to comment on that? Or Ken? Paul. Yes, that's an excellent, observation. And we are fundamentally a return focus company and that's what we've been doing for a number of years. If you look back at the last three years, we gave out these numbers. They're on our slide deck, and I've talked about it in the opening, we've been a leader in the industry return on capital employed, so we're focused on improving returns every year. And we've also been a leader in generating free cash flow; we generated over one and a $1.5 billion of free cash flow over the last three years every year and for $4.6 billion. And that funded a very sustainable growing dividend. We increased the dividend by 72%, and we reduced our debt; our net debt over $2 billion. So we've been a very disciplined company, and we did all that at a spending level that was our cash, our CapEx to cash flow ratio was about 80%. So really what you're hearing from really the rest of the industry is are now moving into the model that EOG has been working really for the last three years. And we're thrilled about that. That is fantastic. For the industry, for investors, and certainly, it's very positive for all processes, we move forward. So, we agree, they're doing the right thing. And that's the thing that we've been doing for a number of years, and we fully support their move. Billy, do you want to address that? Neil. Yes, our focus on GHG reductions is in this forming this sustainable power group within our company is to really focus on technology, bringing technology forward more quickly inside the company, and it's really another organic efforts like we do everything else inside the company to really improve our emissions, but also make sure that we can do it at a very high rate of return. And so it's really to facilitate our ongoing culture. We have tons of ideas that are coming from our divisions, and our folks involved in the field operations. And so we -- so we're really excited about the technology, and the innovations that's coming forward. And we're really excited about continuing to reduce our emissions. And certainly any kind of technology in this area, we believe will not only benefit EOG, but it could benefit the industry. And so we're open with that. It's not a proprietary thing. It's something we're doing to really continue to improve our environment. Yes, Phil. Yes, your observation is right. We believe a sustainable growing dividend backed by an impeccable balance sheet is certainly the best way to return cash to shareholders, and we're very committed to that. And we don't want to take anything away from that. Having said that, we're certainly open to consider other additional things options. And so when we certainly welcome any shareholder input on that, and we will remain open and flexible to do what's best for everybody. Well, I think the biggest one is it's kind of unknown and inconsistent. And the feedback we've received from many folks as they were -- they would really focus on a more consistent growing dividend. And certainly as you pointed out, we've never ever cut the dividend. And we want to make sure it's sustainable and certainly backing it up with an impeccable balance sheet. And so the mix we've had over the last several years as we talked about, we believe is a really good mix. And we believe that will create very, very significant shareholder value going forward. Yes, Doug. I think as we stated in the opening remarks; fundamentally, we believe we've got a very, very strong game plan. And we've got a tremendous track record to back that up, being the leader and return on capital employed in the industry, while generating very significant free cash flow; and giving it back in a very strong dividend increase, and strengthen our balance sheet. And we believe that was the right strategy before the downturn. It certainly has put the company in a tremendous position where we are right now. And going forward, we believe that's the right strategy going forward to continue to create significant shareholder value going forward. So we believe our game plan is really solid. Our growth is always been very disciplined. Again, we've only allocated about 80% of our cash to CapEx. And so we've been able to grow the company in a very disciplined pace. And as we go into 2021 and the future, obviously, we need to keep our eye on the macro view of oil. We need to be aware of the market conditions. We're not interested in growing all oil volumes at a strong pace and an oversupplied market. Certainly, that's not the right thing to do. But we want to continue when the time is right, we want to continue to grow the company at a disciplined pace, at the pace to where we can continue to improve our returns, and improve our performance. Yes, Doug, we are really committed to our employees; they are the ones that are making our company better. They're the most valuable asset we have in the company. And so we have a lane, we run lane, we actually peaked on employment about four or five years ago; even though we've gotten a much bigger company, our employee base has really not grown. And so they're very highly productive. They're highly motivated. And they're certainly the part of the company that we want to keep intact and take care of and encourage. So we believe we're at the right size to be effective, to be ready as the downturn is over; so we're focused on continuing to maintain and to actually increase our culture or ability as we go forward, so we're very committed to keeping the company in great shape going forward. Billy, do you want to answer that one? Ezra? Tim? Yes, the right level of free cash flow, Brian, is really a function of -- it's obviously variable every year, number one, based on the oil price. We normally we have -- and we will continue to kind of use a conservative view, our macro conservative view of what oil process will be that year. And then we certainly have a goal every year to generate significant amount of free cash flow; is example the last three years we've generated about $1.5 million a year on average free cash flow. And we want to use that to continue to, as Tim said, consider paying our debt now, our goal is to continue to paying our debt down more, and certainly continue to work on our dividends when the environment is healthy. And then after that we will allocate the capital, continue to allocate it at a very disciplined level just like we have in the past. And discipline means that we're not going to allocate the capital at a speed that's too fast to where we cannot learn and grow and get better. We want to always be increasing our capital efficiency and lower our funding costs. Continuing to lower our operating costs, and those kinds of things. And so you have to go at the proper speed to do that every year, and that's really the governor on allocating the capital. And whatever free cash flow is left over after all those things are done, obviously, it's that will be variable by year-by-year, according to the commodity process. We will continue to be committed to using that capital to continue to create shareholder value, and making sure we get the highest return possible avenues on using that cash. In closing, first, we want to thank all EOG employees for the outstanding job you're doing to improve the company during this historic and challenging downturn. As we said, the company is improving very rapidly. And we're going to emerge from this downturn a better and stronger company. So we're eager to extend our leadership, and return on capital employed; discipline growth, free cash flow generation and sustainability. Thanks for listening and thanks for your support."

            "content": "Yes. This is Ken, Bob. The majority of our worlds are single zone wells under primary depletion. So as we shut those wells in; they continue to build bottom hole pressure and then we turn them on those wells will show flush production until that bottom well pressure is has gone down to what it was prior to that. So it's a mechanism that's well understood for the horizontal wells that we have that are under that. We don't have any wells that are under water floods or multiple zones where you can have one zone damaging another. So it is well understood and it's following exactly what we expected on the flush production profiles. On the base decline; in terms of the base decline, we'll see the lower base decline was just that we saw those wells we had forecasted them conservatively, and the wells are performing better than what we thought they would."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Billy Helms",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. Last quarter, we made the decision to shut-in existing production and deploy our new wells rather than sell into an uncertain and low-price market. Our intent was that our lowest activity levels, lowest capital expenditures and lowest production volumes wouldn't coincide with the lowest point of the commodity price curve. And doing so, we enhanced the cash flow and margins for each barrel produced and maximize the rate of return for our investments. Our employees' execution of our challenging new plan during the second quarter was stellar. They answered the challenge by beating by wide margin; nearly ever capital expense and production goal we targeted under the new plan. After rapidly reducing our full year capital plan by nearly half, second quarter capital came in an additional 26% below target. We also reduced our cash operating expenses a total of 10% compared to the target. One of the hallmarks of EOG is striving for continuous improvements. But the downturn brought a new intensity to this effort. Our employees delivered even more by continuing to innovate capital and expense reductions that will benefit future operations. For example; we increased our full-year total well cost reduction target to 12% up from 8% just a few months ago. Our operating teams continue to drive efficiency in every aspect of our business. Drilling times are consistently improving, yet completion cost of seeing the most improvement during the quarter, down more than 15%. About half the capital savings can be attributed to cost efficiencies and the other half to service cost reductions. Our drilling rigs and frac fleet are largely under existing term contracts. So, service cost savings have been more from ancillary services. As rig and frac fleet contracts expire, we expect to see further cost reductions; therefore, we believe most of these savings to be sustainable. Our cash operating costs were down more than $50 million, or 10% relative to our second quarter guidance. Our operating teams went into high gear to identify opportunities to reduce expenses during the second quarter with a focus on every category. Some of the largest cost reductions are reduced work over expenses, water disposal and lease maintenance and repairs. These reduced expenses played a major role in helping to generate free cash flow during the second quarter. It is also important to note that we have reduced our full-year cash operating cost guidance by almost $20 million, or 6% on a per unit basis. On the production side; we also beat our forecast. This is mainly due to bringing the shut-in volumes back on sooner than anticipated. One observation from our production data revealed that almost every well exhibited some level of flush production before we returning to its previous decline profile; further evidence that the well sustained no damage from the shedding period. In addition, the decline observed from the base production was less than previously forecasted, also contributing to the production beat. As a result, we have raised our full-year oil production guidance by 16,000 barrels of oil per day or 4%. Our dramatically reduced activity and the temporary shut-in our production, combined with the expense reductions generated positive net cash flow, and deferred a large amount of production into a higher price quarter. Slide 12 of our presentation this quarter illustrates the updated shut-in volumes and the corresponding product price. While we have slowed our overall spending, we have maintained our commitment to reducing GHG emissions by continuing to invest in innovative new technologies and initiatives. Our focus on reducing flaring continues with our gas capture right now exceeding 99.5%. To further minimize flaring, particularly when caused by unpredictable downstream market interruptions; we tested a new EOG innovation we have named Closed-Loop Gas capture. Closed-Loop Gas capture is an automated process developed in-house to reroute natural gas back into existing wells when a downstream interruption occurs. Initial results were successful in indicate that our Closed-Loop Gas capture process has the potential to both reduce flaring and return a majority of the captured gas from the well back to production. In late 2019, we initiated a pilot project in New Mexico to combine solar and natural gas to power electric motor driven compressors. Compressors typically use natural gas to power the engines and our source of GHG emissions from stationary combustion. Since solar power is only available during the day, we designed a hybrid power plant to supplement daytime solar power generation with reliable natural gas generation at night. During the day, the solar panels should produce 8-megawatts of power with no combustion emissions. Compared to the traditional natural gas-powered compression; we believe our hybrid power compression will result in lower operating expenses and a meaningful reduction in emissions. This facility will become operational later this month. Both of these projects demonstrate that we approach GHG like every aspect of our business, focusing on sound economic decisions; and continuously improving our operations. EOG has a long history of adapting to changing industry conditions and using technology to improve the company. As Bill noted earlier, to further enhance our efforts to be a leader in GHG reduction, we recently announced a new strategic initiative to identify and implement returns focused, low emissions power generation within EOG. We are confident that this initiative led by our sustainable power group will be another area in which EOG will lead the way in finding more cost-effective methods to generate power while reducing our impact on the environment and generating a healthy rate of return. And finally, I am extremely proud of how all of our employees have responded to this year's challenges, and doing so while adapting to remote working conditions. Here's Ezra for an update on recent exploration success in Trinidad. Yes. Good morning, Leo. Yes, you're right at most of our CapEx is generally directed towards the Delaware Basin. So certainly on $1 basis that's where most of the savings are as well. Just to give you a little more color on the capital savings, about a third of the capital savings are from efficiency gains. A third from pricing improvements and a third is really just delaying facilities and infrastructure from the second quarter into the future third and fourth quarter of quarter. So from that we were able to see most of the cost savings probably on the completion side of our business, as I mentioned during the notes on the call, and you have to remember, we're still under some long-term contracts for drilling rigs and frac fleet. So, as that roll-off, we expect to be able to capture some of the market rate saving on those in the future, but we're seeing savings on some other ancillary services that I mentioned. Largely things like maybe chemicals being down 20% to 25%, some of the equipment rentals being down 20% to 30%. And things like that. So, you're seeing some savings on some of the other aspects of the business, not necessarily on the frac fleets and drilling rigs. Yes, thanks, Bill. As Bill mentioned, we're starting with a lot of flexibility with our decentralized culture, multi basin approach, we have the ability to move activity around quite extensively. On top of that, our exploration program, which is in basin really outside of our current operating areas, has the opportunity to further add to our non-federal drilling inventory. As Bill mentioned, we have quite a few premium locations that we've announced and about half of those are on non-federal lands. In addition, almost half of our premium locations that work at $30 are also non-federal lands and you can look at Slide 10 of our deck that illustrates that. So the part of that was to meet the rate of return hurdle at $30, about half of those are non-federal. So it's pretty good distribution of both federal and non-federal makeup, that entire inventory list. And the non-federal inventory is just as high quality as our federal. So the impact of our non-federal inventory it supports at least eight years of drilling with similar capital efficiency is we're experiencing in our 2020 plan. And Bill mentioned, we have quite a few federal permits, we have about 2,500 federal permits that are approved or in progress, and which is certainly more than four years of inventory. And also in the Permian Basin, over 90% of our federal acreage is held by production. Our government also provides, as Bill mentioned, an important system of checks and balances which provides for due process before any regulatory changes, and these changes have to consider the interests of all stakeholders, ultimately, regulatory and legislative changes that denies access to current property rights could amount to a government taking. So there certainly be some legal consequences of going through the process. And then, just to point out too, we have a very good close alignment with our stakeholders, including the communities we work in. And Mexico is a great example of that. We recently conducted a very successful partnership with a state control to complete our Closed-Loop Gas capture project and I mentioned earlier and on a day-to-day basis, I'm very proud of that close working relationship we have built with regulatory agencies really to have a responsible development, open communication, paying attention to their needs. It also enables us to meet our goals and operate in a timely and efficient manner. And our success in turn has helped support a better quality of life for the people of New Mexico, for example, in 2019; the state received nearly 40% of its overall revenue from the oil and gas industry. And that certainly supports the initiatives to increase funding for public health, education, and infrastructure improvements, and so on. On top of that, oil and gas development supports 100,000 jobs in Mexico along with the associated economic activity and benefits. A significant amount of that revenue from oil and gas activities on federal lands is also dispersed to the state governments to support local communities. And of course, the two states have benefited the most are New Mexico and Wyoming. New Mexico received $1.2 billion and Wyoming $641 million in 2019 alone. And the BLM estimates that oil and gas activity on federal lands provided about $70 billion economic uplift nationally, and supported about 300,000 jobs. So there are a lot of important considerations and stakeholders involved in any of these decisions to consider when changing the rules on federal land. So for these reasons, along with our diversion, and really growing inventory, we remained extremely confident that EOG will be able to continue to navigate through any changing regulatory landscape, just as we have in the past. Yes, Paul, thank you. The efficiencies we've seen a substantial amount of innovative ideas that have been generated and I think when people have more time to think, instead of doing things they think through and they are able to look at the data and analyze it. They are able to come-up with more ideas and a lot of creative ideas. One of the basis of our disciplined growth strategy is to grow at a pace that we can get better; we don't ever want to grow so fast and have so much activity that we cannot get to we cannot get better at the same time. So it's really is a balance you can only allocate capital in a certain speed; if you go too fast, you outrun your learning curve, et cetera, et cetera. So there is a benefit to a proper pace. And we have been able to benefit from this slowdown, every downtime that we are in. And we have experienced multiple ones over my 40-years. Every downturn, we make the biggest improvements in the company. It's a challenge, the times are challenging. This has been no different than any of the others; other than we're working more remotely than we ever have. And we're very fortunate to have in place our very extensive information technology system and our database, and all of our apps. In that we've leveraged all that technology to analyze and to make changes; and to come up with ideas how to kind of continue to improve the company. So we're super excited about where we're headed. I think we're going to exit this downturn a much, much better company; able to generate even higher returns than we have in the past, and really do all of our business better than we have in the past. So it's a very exciting time for us. Yes. Good morning, Neal, this is Billy. So on 2021 maintenance capital; previously, in previous quarter, we outlined the same capital number for about 420,000 barrels a day, which was believed to be at that time what our exit rate would be for the for 2020. Certainly bringing out a bunch of extra production this year, but also incorporating the cost savings we're achieving this year. We believe we can do this same capital dollar number $3.4 million, but maintain the exit rate we're seeing this year of 300 -- or 440,000 barrels a day, which is a significant improvement again in our capital efficiency number. So we believe we can maintain that as we go forward; that is not just meant to be a single snapshot. I think one thing it doesn't make into that and make sure everybody understands this is forecasting on what we're achieving today. It doesn't make in any improvements in, and well performance that we expect to be able to continue to see, as well as cost reductions that if things stay where they are, and we're saying in this environment; we're extremely confident we'll still continue to see cost improvements that will drive our maintenance capital number improvements in the future. So, yes, I'm extremely confident we can have ongoing maintenance capital program and this same kind of area that we're talking about today. Sure. Scott. This is Billy. So yes, you're right. We have actually 7 rigs counting to one in offshore Trinidad. So 6 domestically, 1 offshore. And our maintenance capital plan would require about 20 rigs and 10 frac fleets. And we're generally running as I mentioned 7 rigs and 5 or 6 frac fleet today. So we're well under it, when we pulled back our activity, we dropped to a level well below our maintenance capital level. And that's important to note. So the plan certainly going into the third and fourth quarter is be looking at whether or not we want to add a rig or two going into the next year to get to that maintenance level or not. Yes, sure, Scott. Yes, they are multiyear contracts. And I'd say they're various term-- various terms on the contracts. But in general, they're starting to roll off in the next 12 to 18 months. I think the one thing that's important to note is we build what we think are valuable relationships with our most trusted service providers. And we worked through this in partnership with them to make sure we retained not only the performance and the high performing equipment personnel, but the ability to ramp back up when we need to. So it gives us a lot of flexibility as we work through this. And I think, certainly, we build a lot by building that relationship. It's a very trusted relationship we have; it allows us to make to capture some cost savings just been able to capture rates at below market rates in current times, but also maintain the high performing levels of activity that we need to sustain our business. So we're very proud of our relationships we have with them. But, yes, they typically roll off in the next 12 or 18 months. And we'll kind of reassess where we need to be working with those trusted partners."

            "content": "Thanks, Billy. EOG has had very successful business in Trinidad for 27-years. About 20% of EOG's natural gas production comes from shallow water, offshore fields in the Columbus Basin of Trinidad. Most of the gas is sold as feedstock into a sizable petrochemical industry on the island, primarily producing ammonia and methanol. Trinidad has had a competitive financial profile within EOG due to our competitive advantages in the country as a low-cost operator, and our long track record of exploration success. While our capital investments in Trinidad typically make-up a small percentage of our overall CapEx budget, the returns on that capital are competitive with EOG's domestic portfolio, and consistently generate free cash flow and net income. The latest round of exploration and development in Trinidad kicked-off in the spring of 2018 with the acquisition of a set of modern seismic images; the combination of new seismic and updated geologic models provided a deep inventory of prospects to develop our exploration plan. This plan included farming into new acreage held by another operator, where we could apply our low-cost structure to improve the economics on these high potential exploration blocks. Drilling began in July 2019, and we have recorded 4 initial discoveries with estimated natural gas potential of 1 Tcf gross and 500 BcF net to EOG. The discoveries are located in shallow water off the Southeast Coast of Trinidad. Our 2 open-water exploration will support the installation of new production platforms beginning in 2021. The final two wells and the current drilling campaign are in process and should be completed by your end. Production from this drilling campaign will more than offset natural declines from existing wells and provide a foundation of growth EOG's total production in Trinidad. Lastly, the initial success of this latest Exploration Program sets up the potential for additional delineation, and exploration drilling in Trinidad in future years. I would also like to take a moment to discuss our own ongoing domestic exploration effort. We've made good progress moving multiple prospects forward during 2020 despite a reduction to our initial capital plan. Leasing across multiple basins is going well, and we are capturing contiguous positions and what we feel are the sweet spots of these plays. We have an initiated drilling in some projects and are currently incorporating modern well logs and core data into our geologic models. We look forward to providing updates regarding the testing of these prospects at an appropriate time. Next up is William to provide concluding remarks. Yes, thanks. Thanks Juan. This is Ezra. As you know, we've got -- you mentioned our Trinidad exploration effort, and then our domestic exploration effort. And so when we think about anything else outside of the Lower 48; it really comes down to how competitive can it be with our pre-existing domestic portfolio? And that's the main driver on it. When we talk about any of our new exploration ideas, whether it's Trinidad or the new domestic portfolio; we're exploring for prospects and rock quality that will be additive to the front end of our pre-existing inventory. At 10,500 premium locations, I'm not sure if we necessarily just need more to continue to backfill that deep inventory; what we're really trying to do is add to the front end of it. And that's what the exploration efforts focused on. Yes, Brian, this is Ezra. Let me try to unpack that one-by-one here. First, I'd say our -- as we've talked about in the past, our domestic exploration effort; these aren't really in Frontier or Wildcat basins. These are in basins where there is an established legacy, oil and gas production. And so if these prospects work out the way that we think they will, and they're additive to the front-end quality of our inventory, we should be able to move them into active development basis pretty quickly, obviously, pending results. The second part of that going back to just the quality of what we're looking for; this is -- it's a better rock quality as we've talked about before, a lot of what we're looking at is tied to what we think we can develop with our horizontal completions technology. And what I mean by that is just exactly how does the rock -- how's it going to respond. How is it going to actually be stimulated and fracture in combination with our stimulation designs? And so those are the two things that we think are really we're focused on; it is definitely not traditional, unconventional types of rocks that have been focused on in the past. And so as we continue to kind of push these prospects forward and get data on them, we will update you guys with our results on the testing. But we're feeling very confident. Everything that we're seeing today that they are going to continue to be, as I said earlier, additive to the front end of our -- what really is a pretty deep inventory to begin with."

Please note this event is being recorded.  At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir.\nTimothy Driggers: Thanks, and good morning. Thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing first quarter 2020 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call.

Definitions as well as reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and in the accompanying investor presentation slides may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential, not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday. Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Ezra Yacob, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor and Public Relations.  Here's Bill Thomas.\nWilliam Thomas: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I first want to acknowledge those responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, the health care workers, first responders and other dedicated professionals addressing this crisis on the frontlines. Some of you are part of the EOG family, and we thank you for your dedicated and courageous service. EOG is a resilient company. And we believe the severity of this process will demonstrate just how resilient we are. The COVID-19 pandemic compounded what started as an oil price war, which drove oil prices to levels we have not seen in more than 20 years. While this shock to the market is unprecedented, and it's difficult to predict exactly how long it will take demand to recover and inventories to decline, like every other downturn, EOG will emerge a stronger global competitor, uniquely positioned to capture the upside of the oil market recovery. There are two reasons we're confident in our resiliency. First is the EOG culture and second is our premium drilling strategy. Times like these are when the EOG culture shines and becomes even more valuable because downturns supercharge our ability to improve. Our culture has responded quickly by aggressively reducing capital spending to a level that will allow EOG to generate free cash flow this year, assuming current commodity strip prices. We continue to be innovative and entrepreneurial by identifying creative ways to rapidly reduce operating expenses and develop new technical improvements that we can sustain into the oil price recovery. EOG is decentralized, driven by interdisciplinary teams that are empowered to make real-time data decisions based on basin-specific market conditions. Most importantly, we are rate of return-driven, and we will not invest the dollar unless it earns a good return, even in this price environment. The EOG culture is rising to the challenge and making a difference at every level and in every area of the company. Our super-talented EOG employees, armed with our advanced information technology analytics, are at the heart of this culture, and I am incredibly grateful for the way they have responded to this unique downturn. I can't thank our employees enough. The second reason we're confident that EOG will weather the severe downturn is our premium drilling strategy. We believe it's the most strict investment hurdle rate in the industry. Premium requires that all investments earn a 30% direct after-tax rate of return using an oil price of $40 flat. We initiated our premium strategy in 2016 during the last downturn. Since then, we have continued to improve the quality of our drilling inventory with substantial and sustainable well cost reductions.  The improvement in our returns and cost structure has made EOG more resilient to low oil prices and positioned us to respond quickly to this unprecedented downturn and manage our business efficiently should the downturn be prolonged. As a result, we have a significant amount of premium inventory, more than 4,500 identified locations, in fact, that earn at least a 30% direct after-tax rate of return with $30 oil, which is even lower than the $40 used to meet the premium hurdle. Armed with this high-return inventory, EOG is well positioned to continue to be a leader in returns. We entered this downturn in a position of operational and financial strength, and the reason for this is our consistent approach to the fundamentals of our business: return-focused capital allocation, supported by a strong balance sheet.  Rest assured that EOG's priorities will remain the same throughout the duration of this crisis. First, only invest capital if it generates premium rates of return. Our disciplined approach to reinvestment does not change. We invest to make a return, even with low oil prices. We will not drill a well if it doesn't earn at least a 30% direct after-tax rate of return. Second, utilize our operational flexibility to cut expenditures quickly. We exercised the operational flexibility allowed by our contracts with service providers to revise our development plan to be consistent with our outlook for oil prices over the next three quarters. Third, accelerate technical innovation across the company. Lower activity does not hamper our innovation. In fact, true to the EOG culture, each of our divisions have already started to implement multiple initiatives to further reduce our cost structure, improve well productivity and advance our exploration program. Fourth, exit 2020 with momentum by increasing production and to the price recovery. While we remain flexible and responsive to the pace of the price recovery, we have a large inventory of newly completed wells waiting to be put online. We plan to bring those to sales as prices begin to recover during the second half of 2020 and exit the year with momentum heading into 2021. Fifth, protect the financial strength of the company. Our goal each year is to spend within cash flow and maintain an impeccable balance sheet to support operations and protect our dividend through challenging times.  Sixth, continue to strategically invest in the long-term value of our business. Through each of the prior downturns, EOG has emerged a stronger business because we continue to invest in the long-term value of the company. Whether it was leasing exploration acreage in the Eagle Ford to jump-start our transition to oil or the Yates acquisition in 2016. Challenging times for the industry often offer the best opportunities to invest. And finally and most importantly, maintain our unique culture. Our culture is the key to our success, and we put a priority on protecting our unique ability to sustainably reduce costs, improve our inventory and strategically adjust to market conditions. Our ultimate goal has not changed: to be one of the best companies in the S&P 500. We believe the company will make tremendous progress towards this goal in 2020. By making EOG more cost efficient, by fostering innovation, by sharpening our technical edge and progressing new exploration potential, we will emerge a stronger global competitor, uniquely positioned to capture the upside when all markets recover and continue creating long-term value for our shareholders. Next up is Tim to review our current financial position.\nTimothy Driggers: Thanks, Bill. A conservative approach to our capital structure has been a cornerstone of EOG's financial strategy throughout our history. This is borne out of a recognition that oil and gas business has always been capital-intensive and cyclical. These cycles are as inevitable as they are unpredictable, and so a business must be built not just to withstand them, but to have the financial strength at the right times to be able to take advantage of them. EOG entered the downturn in very good shape. Cash at the end of the first quarter was $2.9 billion, which included roughly $760 million of collateral from hedge contracts. This compares to total debt of $5.2 billion for a net debt to total capital ratio of less than 10%. This is down from 13% at the end of last year and a recent peak of 34% in 2016. We reduced net debt by $4 billion in the last 4 years. Our liquidity position is further supported by a $2 billion unsecured revolving line of credit, which has no borrowings against it. Our long-term debt ratings, which were recently reaffirmed by S&P and Moody's, stand 4 notches into investment grade.  Furthermore, on April 14, EOG issued 10- and 30-year bonds totaling $1.5 billion, enhancing our already strong liquidity position. Last month, we also repaid a maturing $500 million bond, and we plan to repay with cash on hand, the $500 million bond maturing on June 1. Given the outlook for oil prices for the remainder of the year, EOG has also added additional hedges for 2020. We now have hedged more than 95% of our second quarter oil production at an average price of $48 and more than 50% of our third quarter production at $47. This mirrors how we view the periods of greatest price risk and adds another dimension to our approach to maintaining a resilient business by securing that portion of our cash flow. We will begin to look at adding additional '21 hedges later in the year if prices look attractive relative to our assessment of the market fundamentals. Maintaining and growing the dividend remains a top priority as it is the most tangible output of EOG's high-return premium business model. We have never cut the dividend, never issued equity to support the dividend and have not relied on asset sales at fire-sale prices to make it through a downturn. The Board yesterday declared a quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share or $1.50 per share annualized rate, which maintains the rate from the 30% increase declared last quarter. The dividend is designed to be sustainable through low price cycles without straining the balance sheet or sacrificing other priorities. We test these priorities against numerous down cycle scenarios so we can be confident these goals are achievable even under extremely stressed conditions. This resilience reflects EOG's strong returns, low-cost structure and financial flexibility. EOG's financial strength also gives our operations teams to be able to take necessary actions with a focus on long-term benefits to the company instead of making forced short-term decisions. Next up is Billy to review our operational performance.\nLloyd Helms: Thanks, Tim. I want to highlight the major steps taken to adjust our operating plan by providing some detail. First, on our capital and operating cost-reduction efforts. And second, the steps taken to reduce production during the low points in the oil price curve. Our swift response to the current environment is evident in our first quarter performance. We reduced capital by $265 million or 14%, while essentially hitting the midpoint of the guidance for oil volumes. For the entire year, we reduced our capital plan to $3.5 billion, more than 45% lower than the original plan. Demonstrating the flexibility in our operational plan, we reduced our drilling rig fleet 78% from a peak of 36 rigs down to 8 in the span of just 6 weeks. On the completion side, we reduced activity 69% from 16 frac fleets to just five. Our flexible contracting strategy, combined with our established reputation as a consistent operator that values strategic vendor relationships, have allowed us to make these adjustments without incurring significant costs. The goal is to generate high rates of return for the capital we choose to invest along with free cash flow while maintaining our leverage to the up cycle as demand recovers. Our ability to reposition the company to achieve that goal in a few short weeks is a testament to EOG's strong culture and decentralized organization, and most of all, our fast-acting innovative employees. I'm incredibly proud of them. We also reduced exploration and infrastructure capital without sacrificing projects with the highest long-term benefit to the company. Exploration capital has been focused on the prospects with the most promise to add future shareholder value. On the infrastructure side, the concentration of our activity in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford, where we have existing well-developed assets in place, naturally reduces infrastructure needs. And we are also maintaining our commitment to reducing our environmental footprint by retaining investment in high-impact projects. On the operating cost side, we reduced lease operating expense by more than $300 million or approximately 20% compared to the original plan. Our operations teams are highly engaged in cost reduction, and we are realizing savings from many areas, including fewer expense workovers, reduced maintenance and repairs, water disposal and compression expense and contract labor. While reducing activity has driven significant initial cost reductions, we are maintaining a level of activity that allows us to accelerate technical innovation. The biggest opportunity from the downturn will be to identify a step-change efficiencies and operational improvements that lead to sustainable cost reductions. For example, our drilling and completion teams continue to establish new performance records in each area as illustrated on Slides 39 and 43 of our investor presentation. Across all our operations, we believe we will be able to lower well cost another 8% this year, most of which will be sustainable as a result of the improved efficiencies. This is a testament to the continued drive and innovation to raise the performance bar in the spirit of continuous improvement that allows us to consistently reduce well cost in each of our plays. The cadence of our new capital plan is heavily front-end-loaded. Most of the $1.7 billion of first quarter capital was spent before the downturn began. As a result of rapidly reducing activity, we expect to spend about $650 million in the second quarter and decline sequentially in the third and fourth to total just $3.5 billion for the year, nearly half of our original plan. Our 2020 production profile reflects a rate of return decision. Even though 90% of our shut-in production is cash flow positive at $10 per barrel and we have access to multiple markets, rather than produce at potentially the lowest price point of the year, we elected to shut in existing and deferred additional production by delaying the start-up of new wells. We plan to continue to defer production through the first half of the year. This deferred inventory of new wells has been completed and is simply waiting to produce. This allows us to exert more control over the cash margins of every barrel we produce and provides us the ability to quickly increase oil volumes into an improving oil price environment. We began deferring production during the first quarter. And even after delaying initial production from new wells and shutting in 8,000 barrels a day in March from existing wells, we achieved the midpoint of our guidance. First quarter and second quarter represent the peak and the trough, respectively, of our U-shaped production profile in 2020. Between deferred start-ups and new wells drilled and completed, we anticipate turning online approximately 300 additional wells in the second half of the year, for a total of 485 by the end of 2020. Volumes are currently forecasted to increase in the second half of 2020, with fourth quarter production averaging about 420,000 barrels of oil per day, establishing momentum going into next year. The capital required to maintain this level of production going forward would be approximately $3.4 billion per year. Our production profile corresponds to the current outlook for oil prices. However, we will remain flexible to make further adjustments if the operating plan as conditioned -- to the operating plan as conditions change. If prices stay lower for longer, we can make additional reductions to our capital and operating costs and further defer bringing new wells online. To be clear, we would rather shut in production than sell in to an uncertain low-price market. Ultimately, the decision to begin increasing production will be based on a more sustainable and constructive outlook for oil prices in the second half of the year. For the oil that we do choose to sell, we have secured favorable prices through various contracts providing exposure to Brent, Gulf Coast, WTI and fixed prices. The marketing strategy provides flexibility to pivot each of our producing areas to multiple markets to capture the highest margin. In conclusion, I am proud of how decisively and thoughtfully our employees responded to this downturn. We exercised our flexibility to quickly cut capital and operating costs. And the decision to reduce volumes at the lowest point of the price curve supports our intent to accomplish 2 primary objectives: one, enhance the margins from each barrel that is produced; and two, maximize our rate of return for any investment. While EOG is not immune from the effects of low oil prices, we have the tools and the information to make real-time adjustments to maximize our profitability. We will remain disciplined, invest wisely and constantly evaluate market conditions to generate the most shareholder value. Now here is Bill to wrap up.\nWilliam Thomas: Thanks, Billy. EOG is a resilient company. And while we aren't completely immune to the level of demand disruption caused by the pandemic [Technical Difficulty].\nOperator: Pardon me, this is the operator. It appears the main speaker line does not produce an audio. Please stand by for one moment [Technical Difficulty].\nWilliam Thomas: Yes, this is Bill.\nOperator: Thank you, Bill. We missed the last part of your presentation, sir.\nWilliam Thomas: All right. In conclusion, EOG is a resilient company. And while we aren't completely immune to the level of demand destruction caused by the pandemic, we are prepared for it. Our financial structure is very conservative, and our capital-allocation process is hyper-disciplined.  This is an unprecedented downturn. U.S. oil production is in severe decline, and it could take years for domestic production to turn around. We believe that the historic and prolific oil production growth by U.S. shale may have been forever altered. And while the timing and level remains uncertain, we are confident demand will improve. Therefore, current prices are not sustainable. In the inevitable price recovery ahead, there is tremendous opportunity for EOG. With a strong balance sheet in hand, a culture that drives continuous improvement and our commitment to generate strong returns with free cash flow, EOG will be ready to provide much-needed supply when prices show sustainable improvement. We don't believe there's a better company positioned to capture the upside as the oil market recovers. EOG will not only survive this downturn, but emerge as a stronger competitor in the global market. Thank you for joining us this morning. Our thoughts are with you as we navigate this pandemic together. We sincerely hope your family, friends and colleagues are healthy and safe. Operator, that concludes our remarks, so please open up the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And today's first comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc.\nLeo Mariani: Just wanted to ask in terms of the budget this year. Obviously, you cut it a couple of times here, clearly prudent response to oil prices. I, too, agree that oil prices are unsustainable at these levels on a global basis. If we were to see just a rapid increase, say, in oil prices as we got later in the third quarter and fourth quarter, would you guys consider adding more capital back late this year to get you guys a little bit more ready for growth mode in '21?\nWilliam Thomas: Yes. Leo, this is Bill. And I think we're going to be very cautious before we add capital this year. And it's unlikely that we would add any more additional capital until -- we want to get into 2021 and see how demand continues to recover. And so we wouldn't -- I don't think we're going to be adding any capital in the remaining of the year.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. That's helpful. And Bill, you certainly talked about emerging stronger from this pandemic. You kind of referenced potential M&A is an option. What do you think sort of other than kind of continuing to lower the cost structure of what you guys are doing, what are the other keys to kind of emerging stronger? And you think maybe there could be some likely M&A late this year, if there are opportunities?\nWilliam Thomas: Yes. I want to be -- I think we've been pretty clear over the years about M&A. We're not really interested at all in any, certainly, low-return M&A or acquisitions. It's really difficult. It has been historically as everybody knows M&A market. It's very difficult to make a good acquisition and generate a strong return at the same time. And everything we do, as you know, EOG, we're totally focused on returns. And so every dollar we spend, every deal we do has to be competitive on a return basis. And it's very difficult to compete with organic exploration effort. We're adding a lot of very low-cost acreage that we believe contains drilling inventory that will be better accretive to the quality that we have now. So it's very unlikely we'll do certainly a large M&A. We do small bolt-on acquisitions to supplement our exploration efforts just to get low-cost acreage. But large M&As are really not, in our view, competitive. Other than the cost reductions that we're making, obviously, we've spelled out a lot of those here, Billy has, we continue to be very innovative all over the company. We continue to see excellent technical work and a focus on innovation and new ideas. And those are just coming out in multiple areas of the company, completion technology, a lot of great geotechnical work going on in the company. And we haven't taken our eye off of our exploration effort, and I'm going to ask Ezra Yacob to maybe comment on that a little bit.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Bill. As everyone knows, we entered the year with a pretty exciting exploration program. We're focused on capturing positions in basins where we capture the Tier 1 position, and we're working plays that we think will be improving the inventory quality with low decline and certainly low-cost plays. And we're -- we entered this year with a plan of testing and leasing in 10 different prospects. And we've obviously reduced our exploration budget this year, commensurate with reductions across other categories. But we're still planning to progress each of those prospects a little bit this year. We'll remain flexible as we do. But really, the purpose, as Bill said, is that these all have the potential to add significant long-term value creation for the business and for our shareholders. And as Bill pointed out, we've all seen here, over the past, say, 6 or 8 weeks since our employees have been working from home, is really just an amazing effort from all of them on the development side and the exploration side to come up with and generate new ideas. And we just couldn't be more impressed or commend the employees for their efforts on that.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.\nBrian Singer: We appreciate the specificity on guidance for production for the remainder of the year and the quantification of the expected shut-in. When we look at the production, excluding the shut-ins, second quarter's oil production is implied down about 19% from the first quarter. Can you just talk to the drivers of that and whether to use that 19% as indicative of an annualized natural decline, whether there are other factors that are influencing that?\nWilliam Thomas: Brian, I'm going to ask Billy to comment on that.\nLloyd Helms: Yes. Good morning, Brian. The way I would look at that, we're still -- I would still like to emphasize that our annual decline rate that we've provided in previous guidance of 32% is still accurate and true. The shape of that on a quarter-to-quarter basis depends a lot on the nature and the timing of when you bring on wells prior to that. So it can be a little bit -- it can fluctuate quite a bit. It can be a little bit lumpy as you might think of it. It's strictly depending on the timing of bringing on wells in a quarter or two prior to that. So naturally, it's a little steeper at the first part of the life of a well and then flattens out later in the life. So that's kind of what you're seeing in the second quarter. I wouldn't take the decline you're calculating there. That 19% is an indication of a change in our quarterly or annual decline that we've given you in the past.\nBrian Singer: Great. And then my follow-up is both an EOG and then a broader question with regards to maintenance capital and shale supply cost. How much of the $3.4 billion of the maintenance capital do you think includes cost reductions you believe are secular versus cyclical? You talked about, I think, 8% cost reductions coming from here to well cost and wondering whether that was factored into the $3.4 billion. And then I guess that the lower maintenance capital, you and other companies are highlighting reflect another large step down in the supply cost for EOG and shale generally? Or is it just a function of the market and the low oil price environment that we're in?\nWilliam Thomas: I'm going to ask Billy to talk about the first part of the question.\nLloyd Helms: Yes, Brian. So just to be clear, our $3.4 billion maintenance capital we talked about is to maintain the 420,000 barrels a day we plan to exit the fourth quarter at. And to give you a little more color on how we calculate that, that does not anticipate the cost savings that we've talked about here today. We are -- our capital programs are based on the kind of a backward-looking actual well costs that we've been able to attain to date and doesn't bake in costs, anticipated cost savings on a go-forward basis. So in light of that, I think there's -- we always think about that as potential upside to achieve better results. So our capital plan this year and our capital plan or the maintenance cost that we've quoted here, the $3.4 billion, doesn't bake into the 8% cost savings that we're talking about in this call. In addition to that, I think it's important to know that the $3.4 billion, just to go back to that, it's maintained the 420,000 barrels a day that we're exiting the year-end.\nWilliam Thomas: On the second part of that question, Brian, as we look at the whole industry, there certainly are companies that are doing a good job continuing to lower costs, but we believe there's a really small set of those because it really takes scale. It's probably one of the biggest drivers to be able to continue to lower cost. A lot of the cost reductions are certainly in infrastructure in a very continuous drilling program and completion program, et cetera, et cetera. I think really -- so I think a few companies, as I kind of commented in the opening remarks, we believe there will be less companies after this downturn than there were before. We think they'll be more disciplined. Certainly, there'll be more -- there'll be less capital employed in the shale business. But we believe, as we said, that EOG is going to emerge as a leader. And most of our cost reduction, nearly all of our cost reduction, is driven internally through the technical innovation in the company and the efficiencies. We just -- there's a lot of data in our IRR chart that shows the amount of stages per day. Certainly, the feet per day on drilling, et cetera, et cetera, as well as -- I want to note, maybe there's a slide in the Powder River Basin, on our recent completions in the Mowry, in the Niobrara, where our completion technology is certainly making a huge difference in the well productivity. So most of the improvements in EOG are driven from our internal culture and our innovation and our just desire to always continue to get better. We have a very sustainable model and culture, and we do not see any end in sight in EOG getting better.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.\nCharles Meade: I appreciate the sentiments you expressed there at the end of your prepared remarks, and I just reflect that back to you and everyone there at EOG. One question, I was a little bit surprised to see that you guys still are forecasting some shut-ins to go into 4Q. And I'm curious if you could kind of characterize what sort of production that is that's still shut in 4Q. I could see an argument for it being the last sort of legacy vertical wells to come back on, but I could also see an argument for it being high-rate wells that you want to deliver to the strongest market. So I wonder if you could add some color there.\nWilliam Thomas: Charles, I'll ask Billy to comment on that.\nLloyd Helms: Yes. Charles, so that's a good question. I'm glad you asked it. It's -- the 20,000 barrels a day that we referenced that would likely still be shut in, in the fourth quarter, is simply wells that have some form of expense that's required to bring them back on production. For instance, you have a lot of reasons why production goes down. These are wells that might have to replace gas lift valve in downhole or maybe a hole in the tubing or things that require some expense work-over to bring back to production. And we just haven't made the decision yet to expend the capital or the expense dollars to bring those wells back to production until we see the margins improve to a point where we would do that. So for the sake of the plan, we just assume those wouldn't be brought back on until next year.\nCharles Meade: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe perhaps related to that, it's interesting to me that, Bill, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you guys have gone ahead and completed wells but are waiting to turn them to sales. And that's a little different from what we're -- what I've heard from a number of other companies that are maybe just electing to build DUCs and not complete. And I'm wondering if that's just a function of you guys wanting to honor your commitments to frac crews or if that's actually expression of some other view about the best way to leave your well or the response time that you want to have when you do see a price signal?\nLloyd Helms: Yes, Charles, this is Billy, again. So the way I would think about that is 2 things. I guess, we started -- as the downturn started to happen, we were in the process, of course, of completing several wells. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we dropped our frac fleet count quite considerably there at the start of the year. But we still had wells that were in the process of being completed or just being completed. We elected to not bring those on production at a time when prices were falling so steeply. And likewise, as we continue to cut our frac count down, I think we're running about 5 today, then, those wells, as they're finishing up to completions, we're not bringing those wells on either. So it's just built up, I'd say, an inventory of wells that are in that category that we're waiting on the right timing as to when we view the market fundamentals improving and being constructive going forward to bring those wells on production.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Two questions. One is either for Bill or Billy. I think one of the silver lining of the COVID-19 is that it triggered a lot of creativity, and you guys certainly have done a lot of that, as you mentioned. So what have we learned from this whole episode? And what is the -- some of the best practice that may impact your future how you run your operation?\nWilliam Thomas: Yes, Paul. This is Bill. Every situation -- I've been with the company over 40 years, and I've been through a number of these downturns. This is certainly the most unique one that we've ever experienced. What it is really -- what we've really seen inside the company is the tremendous value that our information systems and technology has allowed EOG to make a very granular evaluation of everything we do. Every well in the company, we know about it. We have all the data. And through our decentralized organization, we've been able to analyze down to a very granular level everything we're doing. And so we've learned how important it is to have a great information systems and technology and how effective our employees have been to perform -- and most of them are working from their homes, like everybody else in the world. So that's been a great experience for us on a learning curve. And we see areas in that we can continue to improve and get better in. I think on the technical side of it, we just do not see any end in the advancements coming from the company because, as you all know, EOG, all the ideas all the creativity, all the improvements in the company are from every -- really, every person in the company. It's not from the top down, it's really from the bottom up. And everybody is engaged. And the communications have been really good. We're using Microsoft Teams to have big meetings, divisional meetings and department meetings and meetings between different groups in the company, and that's working out really well. And so it's been a learning experience, but I think we're fortunate to have a lot of that in place, but it's -- we can see some areas in that process that we can continue to improve in.\nPaul Cheng: Bill, you said a couple of examples, you can say that in the post-COVID world -- I mean, at some point that we will come out from that, that you think it will fundamentally change because of the experience that you learned will be fundamentally changing how you manage your business? Any process or any example that you can cite?\nWilliam Thomas: I think the fundamentals of the company, return-driven, certainly committed to generating strong free cash flow, maintaining the balance sheet, a strong balance sheet, spending within our means and then focus on returns--we are so focused on returns--those things are not going to change. Those are the fundamentals that drive our business. I think the changes that you see in EOG are just the organic changes that are happening every day as we continue to just gather data and analyze it and apply it.  And I think those are the things that make EOG who we are. So I don't see those things changing. We're focused on totally getting better literally every day. And we believe the opportunity in front of us, because we believe this unique downturn has been so severe, we believe our opportunities will be greater in the future than they've been in the past.\nPaul Cheng: A final question for me, a short one. On the curtailment, can you tell us that maybe how is the regional or basin split? And also that whether all the curtailment is essentially shut-in or you're moving some of the well production?\nWilliam Thomas: Paul, I'll ask Billy to comment on that.\nLloyd Helms: Yes, Paul. So the way we go about analyzing our business to shut-in wells is at a very granular level. All of our areas are operating in the same manner. We have the tools, as Bill described, the information technology to gather the information, analyze it and push that decision down to the lowest level in our organization to understand the profit margins on every well throughout the company. So with that information, we can make decisions on when and where best to shut-in wells to maximize our cash flow at any given time. So the shut-ins occur on economics based on that way. We also analyze things from a market perspective in the same manner. We have the same information to understand the markets we can take the products to, how to maximize our netbacks for every product on a well level. And so we can do the same kind of analysis from a marketing perspective. And simply part of that decision is making a larger rate-of-return decision that helps us think about, is it better to produce most of that volume into a more volatile and lower-priced environment or based on a macro outlook for the product? Is it best to wait a month or two or potentially longer to bring that production back on? And so I'd say most of the production falls into that realm. And it's made pretty much on every basin across the company in every area. So that's how we analyze it. It's a very granular look across the company. It takes a lot of effort. All of our -- it goes back to the culture of the company, though. And we have so many engaged employees that are really committed to the company and making sure we all do the best thing we can to continue to make the company better. So we couldn't be more proud of the people that we have to make it all work.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.\nNeal Dingmann: My first question is just around your return requirements. I'm wondering, you all took certainly some major steps this quarter in curtailing existing production suspending D&C. I'm just wondering, are your margin -- Bill, are your margin requirements different when you look at bringing those curtailments back versus thinking about ramping up the D&C activity?\nWilliam Thomas: When we look at when we're going to bring wells to shut-in or new wells on, we're really just looking at the strip. And we obviously stay very engaged really daily, weekly basis on the world events and the macro view of oil. And so when that becomes more positive and we get more firm that that's sustainable recovery, that's when we'll begin opening things up. We don't have an exact number on the margin. We're just looking for the trends. And then certainly, we're not, as Billy has talked about what we've done, we're not interested in selling our oil at the lowest part of the market. When there's a steep contango in the prices, there's no use selling it now when we can get double in a few months. So that's really -- that's all we're doing on that in that area.\nNeal Dingmann: Very good. And then just one last question. You definitely hit this quite a bit, but just on activity. I was looking back in '16, it looked like, I think you all had gotten down to, I think, 9 or 10 rigs during that time when we were around $26. And I'm just wondering, does some of that decision on sort of D&C activity and all and just pure, I guess, activity and all, come to how many of these premium locations you have? Or is it simply, Bill, what you had just mentioned, just not wanting to produce into sort of this environment? I guess I was just sort of comparing today versus 2016 maybe and maybe you could just tell us a little color on how you're looking differently at these two periods at this point?\nWilliam Thomas: Well, certainly, we're not limited by inventory. That -- we have a tremendous inventory. Like we said, we've got 4,500 locations already identified that will do a 30% rate of return at $30, and I'm sure that will grow over time. So that's not the issue at all. Really, our investment pace every year is set on a very conservative price deck in our view of the macro. And the limitations on that are we want to generate free cash flow. We want to spend within our means and generate free cash flow and maintain an impeccable balance sheet, and also, obviously, generate very, very high rates of return. So those are the things that guide us. And so in this particular instance, we're just looking for a bit of better view of the future and what the recovery is going to look like, not only in the price but what's U.S. shale going to look like and then where is our spot in there. We think we'll continue to be the leader in returns and continue to be the company that continue to add very, very significant value.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: My first question is probably a follow-up to Charles' and Neal's question. It seems to us that EOG is just taking a more aggressive approach on production shut-in than others. And I know it all depends on your macro view and whatever contracts or lease stuff you have or any related shutdown or start-up costs, but do you have an estimate on the NPV uplift for the year for doing the shut-ins and the well deferral versus maybe the business-as-usual case with no shut-ins and no deferrals?\nWilliam Thomas: Jeanine, I don't -- no, we don't have a number. We can certainly calculate that, but it's more just common sense. We just don't like giving our oil away. We want to make money. We're focused on returns, and we believe just waiting a few months or a quarter that we could get twice as much for oil than we are today. And so it's really just a common sense approach and a return focus and our view on a market that's improving.\nJeanine Wai: Okay. And then my second question is, I know we're in the middle of an oil rally here, but we're still only at, call it, $25 WTI. If we see a pullback in oil prices, to what extent are you willing to lean on the balance sheet to support long-term value? I know you're not trying to maximize dollars today or tomorrow, but in terms of the long term, if we see the pullback, is there a point where it becomes just too detrimental to long-term value to keep cutting CapEx? And if so, kind of, what is that level?\nWilliam Thomas: Yes, Jeanine, we certainly have a lot of flexibility to continue to cut capital. I'm going to ask Billy to comment a bit on that.\nLloyd Helms: Yes, Jeanine. So we cut back to the level we did to basically be able to do the things Bill talked about, make sure we generate a rate of return and generate free cash flow and while we see the commodity price outlook today. If that changes and we feel like that we need to cut more, certainly, we have that flexibility to do so and would continue to push that lever down throughout the end of the year, depending on the outlook. So we could still try to manage within cash flow, even with prices stay lower for longer.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.\nArun Jayaram: Bill, we've seen a lot of different approaches to shut-ins with EOG, Conoco, Exxon and Chevron announcing significant shut-ins. I was wondering how clear is this the decision to shut-in versus not? And I'd also just want to see if you could address one of the questions that came in last night, was just the execution risk in shutting down hundreds, maybe thousands of wells and then restarting those consistent with what you've guided to in the deck.\nWilliam Thomas: Yes, Arun. I'm going to ask Billy to comment on the execution part.\nLloyd Helms: Yes. Arun, thanks for the question. Yes, I think, as we talked before, one of the unique things that we built the company around is our ability to gather data and analyze it very quickly and have that information basically in the hands of every employee in the company, including at the field level. So the actual execution of being able to shut-in and bring back the wells on is fairly painless. It's very simple exercise by communicating that data down to the people out there in the field to be able to make those actions happen. So that effort is very easy to do.  As far as any risk of shut-ins, there's really not any risk in our part. I think the cost of shutting in the wells is very minimal, if not 0. The cost of bringing the wells back on is kind of the same thing. And we could actually have all the wells back on production in just a matter of days because, you have to remember, we are a decentralized organization. We have these assets across the country, we have people managing those assets that are very capable and committed to making sure that we do the best things we can, as quick as we can, safely. So the effort is very easy to attain with the culture of the company that we have and the operations we have set up.\nWilliam Thomas: And I would just -- this is Bill. Just one more comment on that. I think we have multiple years and years of experience of shutting in wells for different lengths of time. And we've got a chart in the IR deck that shows, on these shale wells, there's absolutely no damage when you shut them in and bring them back on for -- whether it's two weeks or two months, we feel very confident about that. So we just view shutting-in as just well-cost storage. That's the lowest-cost storage that we can come up with. And it's a great way to manage your business, especially in a price environment like we're in.\nArun Jayaram: Yes, that's a clever way to think about it. Just a quick follow-up. You guys cited the $3.4 billion sustaining capital for the 4Q exit rate at $4.20. How fully loaded, Billy, is that $3.4 billion? I know you talked a little bit about the ability to even maybe push that down based on incremental cost savings, but how fully loaded is that CapEx number?\nLloyd Helms: It's in keeping with how we would run our business. So it's -- the way I would think about it is maybe a little more high-graded than it was in the $4.1 billion capital plan that we announced some time ago that people might remember. In that previous maintenance capital plan, it was pretty much designed to keep each division kind of operating flat. This one is truly -- we're going to go to the wells that have the highest return at today's prices. And so it is a little bit more high graded you might think of. It's still spread across multiple basins, though. So I wouldn't jump to the conclusion as just one area. It's still spread across multiple areas. And it includes the infrastructure and facility costs and ESG spending and those kind of things that we typically would include in a normal budget, just maybe at a little bit lesser scale.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDouglas Leggate: I hope everyone is doing well out there. Bill, you made a number of comments, if I could read them back to you. U.S. shale is forever altered. This is a unique downturn, and there's been a price war. So my question is, can you share with us what that means for your go-forward strategy? And you kind of know what I'm getting at here as the U.S. is doing 50% and Saudi removed the lowest-cost barrels off the market. So it sounds like there's a little bit of a pivot here, and I'm just wondering if you -- if I'm reading that right, if you can walk us through how you see the right mix of reinvestment, growth, cash flow. And I've got a follow-up, please.\nWilliam Thomas: Yes, Doug. I think, looking into the future, as we said, we believe there's going to be a structural change in U.S. shale. There's going to be less players. I think, certainly, the industry is becoming more disciplined, and it will be even hyper-disciplined coming out of this downturn. So we believe there's going to be significant less capital invested in growth in the U.S.. And so -- and certainly, there will be substantially less growth. We have a hard time seeing that the U.S. production will be able to, certainly, in the next several years, get back up to the levels we've been just a few months ago. So in that lies a tremendous opportunities for the companies that survive, and it's an enormous opportunity for EOG. If you look back on our last 3 years, we've generated an industry-leading return on capital employed of 14%. We generated $5.6 billion of free cash flow, and we returned $3.3 billion back in shareholder-friendly ways with substantial dividend growth and debt reduction. And over that last 3-year period, we've increased our proven reserves by 55%. And we've accomplished this all with an average WTI oil price, WTI oil price of $58. So fundamentally, we're not going to change. We're -- as we've been talking about, we're return-driven and believe in a strong balance sheet. And we believe we're improving at a rate much faster than we have in the past and that we're going to emerge a much better company in the next recovery. So we're going to continue to stick with our fundamentals, evaluate the market conditions and continue to create value.\nDouglas Leggate: I appreciate the answer. My follow-up is going to be a related question because I'd just like to press you a little bit on this. Because the $58 oil price, Bill, was subsidized by Saudi. And the U.S. growth rate, in my opinion, is no longer going to be tolerated, and obviously, you've been a larger part of that growth. So everything -- there's no issue around the operational capability of the company. You are clearly the leader, if not one of the leaders, in the industry. The issue is whether the business model continues to reinvest 90% of its cash flow and grow, in the words of the Texas Railroad Commission, at a wasteful level in excess of reasonable demand. So the question is really not about your capability, it's about the behavior coming out the other side of this. Going from 36 rigs to 6, do we see you go back to that level of growth? Or do we see you rightsize the organization to pivot more to [indiscernible] what I'm getting at? Because that $58 you referred to was Saudi taking the lowest-cost barrels off the market.\nWilliam Thomas: Well, I mean, let me make one correction there right off the bat. We've invested about 80% of our cash flow, which is about a really good level. We've been very committed to generating substantial amount of free cash flow. We paid off all that debt, increased our dividend, end of the year last year with $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. So we haven't been spending all our cash. We've been very disciplined in generating tremendous value with that. As we go ahead and we look to the future, again, we think it's going to be different. So we'll certainly -- we'll be continuing to evaluate that and continue to stick with our fundamentals and see what's the best way for EOG to continue to generate significant value.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Bill Thomas for any final remarks.\nWilliam Thomas: Thank you. In closing, I just want to say, we've never been so proud of the employees of EOG. The way you have responded to this historic COVID-19 crisis has been outstanding and heroic. During every downturn in my over 40 years with EOG, the company responds with record-breaking improvements. Sooner or later, this crisis will be over and oil will recover. We believe EOG will emerge with the ability to be a stronger and a higher-return company than ever before. Thanks for listening, and thanks for your support.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "William Thomas",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I first want to acknowledge those responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, the health care workers, first responders and other dedicated professionals addressing this crisis on the frontlines. Some of you are part of the EOG family, and we thank you for your dedicated and courageous service. EOG is a resilient company. And we believe the severity of this process will demonstrate just how resilient we are. The COVID-19 pandemic compounded what started as an oil price war, which drove oil prices to levels we have not seen in more than 20 years. While this shock to the market is unprecedented, and it's difficult to predict exactly how long it will take demand to recover and inventories to decline, like every other downturn, EOG will emerge a stronger global competitor, uniquely positioned to capture the upside of the oil market recovery. There are two reasons we're confident in our resiliency. First is the EOG culture and second is our premium drilling strategy. Times like these are when the EOG culture shines and becomes even more valuable because downturns supercharge our ability to improve. Our culture has responded quickly by aggressively reducing capital spending to a level that will allow EOG to generate free cash flow this year, assuming current commodity strip prices. We continue to be innovative and entrepreneurial by identifying creative ways to rapidly reduce operating expenses and develop new technical improvements that we can sustain into the oil price recovery. EOG is decentralized, driven by interdisciplinary teams that are empowered to make real-time data decisions based on basin-specific market conditions. Most importantly, we are rate of return-driven, and we will not invest the dollar unless it earns a good return, even in this price environment. The EOG culture is rising to the challenge and making a difference at every level and in every area of the company. Our super-talented EOG employees, armed with our advanced information technology analytics, are at the heart of this culture, and I am incredibly grateful for the way they have responded to this unique downturn. I can't thank our employees enough. The second reason we're confident that EOG will weather the severe downturn is our premium drilling strategy. We believe it's the most strict investment hurdle rate in the industry. Premium requires that all investments earn a 30% direct after-tax rate of return using an oil price of $40 flat. We initiated our premium strategy in 2016 during the last downturn. Since then, we have continued to improve the quality of our drilling inventory with substantial and sustainable well cost reductions.  The improvement in our returns and cost structure has made EOG more resilient to low oil prices and positioned us to respond quickly to this unprecedented downturn and manage our business efficiently should the downturn be prolonged. As a result, we have a significant amount of premium inventory, more than 4,500 identified locations, in fact, that earn at least a 30% direct after-tax rate of return with $30 oil, which is even lower than the $40 used to meet the premium hurdle. Armed with this high-return inventory, EOG is well positioned to continue to be a leader in returns. We entered this downturn in a position of operational and financial strength, and the reason for this is our consistent approach to the fundamentals of our business: return-focused capital allocation, supported by a strong balance sheet.  Rest assured that EOG's priorities will remain the same throughout the duration of this crisis. First, only invest capital if it generates premium rates of return. Our disciplined approach to reinvestment does not change. We invest to make a return, even with low oil prices. We will not drill a well if it doesn't earn at least a 30% direct after-tax rate of return. Second, utilize our operational flexibility to cut expenditures quickly. We exercised the operational flexibility allowed by our contracts with service providers to revise our development plan to be consistent with our outlook for oil prices over the next three quarters. Third, accelerate technical innovation across the company. Lower activity does not hamper our innovation. In fact, true to the EOG culture, each of our divisions have already started to implement multiple initiatives to further reduce our cost structure, improve well productivity and advance our exploration program. Fourth, exit 2020 with momentum by increasing production and to the price recovery. While we remain flexible and responsive to the pace of the price recovery, we have a large inventory of newly completed wells waiting to be put online. We plan to bring those to sales as prices begin to recover during the second half of 2020 and exit the year with momentum heading into 2021. Fifth, protect the financial strength of the company. Our goal each year is to spend within cash flow and maintain an impeccable balance sheet to support operations and protect our dividend through challenging times.  Sixth, continue to strategically invest in the long-term value of our business. Through each of the prior downturns, EOG has emerged a stronger business because we continue to invest in the long-term value of the company. Whether it was leasing exploration acreage in the Eagle Ford to jump-start our transition to oil or the Yates acquisition in 2016. Challenging times for the industry often offer the best opportunities to invest. And finally and most importantly, maintain our unique culture. Our culture is the key to our success, and we put a priority on protecting our unique ability to sustainably reduce costs, improve our inventory and strategically adjust to market conditions. Our ultimate goal has not changed: to be one of the best companies in the S&P 500. We believe the company will make tremendous progress towards this goal in 2020. By making EOG more cost efficient, by fostering innovation, by sharpening our technical edge and progressing new exploration potential, we will emerge a stronger global competitor, uniquely positioned to capture the upside when all markets recover and continue creating long-term value for our shareholders. Next up is Tim to review our current financial position. Thanks, Billy. EOG is a resilient company. And while we aren't completely immune to the level of demand disruption caused by the pandemic [Technical Difficulty]. Yes, this is Bill. All right. In conclusion, EOG is a resilient company. And while we aren't completely immune to the level of demand destruction caused by the pandemic, we are prepared for it. Our financial structure is very conservative, and our capital-allocation process is hyper-disciplined.  This is an unprecedented downturn. U.S. oil production is in severe decline, and it could take years for domestic production to turn around. We believe that the historic and prolific oil production growth by U.S. shale may have been forever altered. And while the timing and level remains uncertain, we are confident demand will improve. Therefore, current prices are not sustainable. In the inevitable price recovery ahead, there is tremendous opportunity for EOG. With a strong balance sheet in hand, a culture that drives continuous improvement and our commitment to generate strong returns with free cash flow, EOG will be ready to provide much-needed supply when prices show sustainable improvement. We don't believe there's a better company positioned to capture the upside as the oil market recovers. EOG will not only survive this downturn, but emerge as a stronger competitor in the global market. Thank you for joining us this morning. Our thoughts are with you as we navigate this pandemic together. We sincerely hope your family, friends and colleagues are healthy and safe. Operator, that concludes our remarks, so please open up the lines for questions. Yes. Leo, this is Bill. And I think we're going to be very cautious before we add capital this year. And it's unlikely that we would add any more additional capital until -- we want to get into 2021 and see how demand continues to recover. And so we wouldn't -- I don't think we're going to be adding any capital in the remaining of the year. Yes. I want to be -- I think we've been pretty clear over the years about M&A. We're not really interested at all in any, certainly, low-return M&A or acquisitions. It's really difficult. It has been historically as everybody knows M&A market. It's very difficult to make a good acquisition and generate a strong return at the same time. And everything we do, as you know, EOG, we're totally focused on returns. And so every dollar we spend, every deal we do has to be competitive on a return basis. And it's very difficult to compete with organic exploration effort. We're adding a lot of very low-cost acreage that we believe contains drilling inventory that will be better accretive to the quality that we have now. So it's very unlikely we'll do certainly a large M&A. We do small bolt-on acquisitions to supplement our exploration efforts just to get low-cost acreage. But large M&As are really not, in our view, competitive. Other than the cost reductions that we're making, obviously, we've spelled out a lot of those here, Billy has, we continue to be very innovative all over the company. We continue to see excellent technical work and a focus on innovation and new ideas. And those are just coming out in multiple areas of the company, completion technology, a lot of great geotechnical work going on in the company. And we haven't taken our eye off of our exploration effort, and I'm going to ask Ezra Yacob to maybe comment on that a little bit. Brian, I'm going to ask Billy to comment on that. I'm going to ask Billy to talk about the first part of the question. On the second part of that question, Brian, as we look at the whole industry, there certainly are companies that are doing a good job continuing to lower costs, but we believe there's a really small set of those because it really takes scale. It's probably one of the biggest drivers to be able to continue to lower cost. A lot of the cost reductions are certainly in infrastructure in a very continuous drilling program and completion program, et cetera, et cetera. I think really -- so I think a few companies, as I kind of commented in the opening remarks, we believe there will be less companies after this downturn than there were before. We think they'll be more disciplined. Certainly, there'll be more -- there'll be less capital employed in the shale business. But we believe, as we said, that EOG is going to emerge as a leader. And most of our cost reduction, nearly all of our cost reduction, is driven internally through the technical innovation in the company and the efficiencies. We just -- there's a lot of data in our IRR chart that shows the amount of stages per day. Certainly, the feet per day on drilling, et cetera, et cetera, as well as -- I want to note, maybe there's a slide in the Powder River Basin, on our recent completions in the Mowry, in the Niobrara, where our completion technology is certainly making a huge difference in the well productivity. So most of the improvements in EOG are driven from our internal culture and our innovation and our just desire to always continue to get better. We have a very sustainable model and culture, and we do not see any end in sight in EOG getting better. Charles, I'll ask Billy to comment on that. Yes, Paul. This is Bill. Every situation -- I've been with the company over 40 years, and I've been through a number of these downturns. This is certainly the most unique one that we've ever experienced. What it is really -- what we've really seen inside the company is the tremendous value that our information systems and technology has allowed EOG to make a very granular evaluation of everything we do. Every well in the company, we know about it. We have all the data. And through our decentralized organization, we've been able to analyze down to a very granular level everything we're doing. And so we've learned how important it is to have a great information systems and technology and how effective our employees have been to perform -- and most of them are working from their homes, like everybody else in the world. So that's been a great experience for us on a learning curve. And we see areas in that we can continue to improve and get better in. I think on the technical side of it, we just do not see any end in the advancements coming from the company because, as you all know, EOG, all the ideas all the creativity, all the improvements in the company are from every -- really, every person in the company. It's not from the top down, it's really from the bottom up. And everybody is engaged. And the communications have been really good. We're using Microsoft Teams to have big meetings, divisional meetings and department meetings and meetings between different groups in the company, and that's working out really well. And so it's been a learning experience, but I think we're fortunate to have a lot of that in place, but it's -- we can see some areas in that process that we can continue to improve in. I think the fundamentals of the company, return-driven, certainly committed to generating strong free cash flow, maintaining the balance sheet, a strong balance sheet, spending within our means and then focus on returns--we are so focused on returns--those things are not going to change. Those are the fundamentals that drive our business. I think the changes that you see in EOG are just the organic changes that are happening every day as we continue to just gather data and analyze it and apply it.  And I think those are the things that make EOG who we are. So I don't see those things changing. We're focused on totally getting better literally every day. And we believe the opportunity in front of us, because we believe this unique downturn has been so severe, we believe our opportunities will be greater in the future than they've been in the past. Paul, I'll ask Billy to comment on that. When we look at when we're going to bring wells to shut-in or new wells on, we're really just looking at the strip. And we obviously stay very engaged really daily, weekly basis on the world events and the macro view of oil. And so when that becomes more positive and we get more firm that that's sustainable recovery, that's when we'll begin opening things up. We don't have an exact number on the margin. We're just looking for the trends. And then certainly, we're not, as Billy has talked about what we've done, we're not interested in selling our oil at the lowest part of the market. When there's a steep contango in the prices, there's no use selling it now when we can get double in a few months. So that's really -- that's all we're doing on that in that area. Well, certainly, we're not limited by inventory. That -- we have a tremendous inventory. Like we said, we've got 4,500 locations already identified that will do a 30% rate of return at $30, and I'm sure that will grow over time. So that's not the issue at all. Really, our investment pace every year is set on a very conservative price deck in our view of the macro. And the limitations on that are we want to generate free cash flow. We want to spend within our means and generate free cash flow and maintain an impeccable balance sheet, and also, obviously, generate very, very high rates of return. So those are the things that guide us. And so in this particular instance, we're just looking for a bit of better view of the future and what the recovery is going to look like, not only in the price but what's U.S. shale going to look like and then where is our spot in there. We think we'll continue to be the leader in returns and continue to be the company that continue to add very, very significant value. Jeanine, I don't -- no, we don't have a number. We can certainly calculate that, but it's more just common sense. We just don't like giving our oil away. We want to make money. We're focused on returns, and we believe just waiting a few months or a quarter that we could get twice as much for oil than we are today. And so it's really just a common sense approach and a return focus and our view on a market that's improving. Yes, Jeanine, we certainly have a lot of flexibility to continue to cut capital. I'm going to ask Billy to comment a bit on that. Yes, Arun. I'm going to ask Billy to comment on the execution part. And I would just -- this is Bill. Just one more comment on that. I think we have multiple years and years of experience of shutting in wells for different lengths of time. And we've got a chart in the IR deck that shows, on these shale wells, there's absolutely no damage when you shut them in and bring them back on for -- whether it's two weeks or two months, we feel very confident about that. So we just view shutting-in as just well-cost storage. That's the lowest-cost storage that we can come up with. And it's a great way to manage your business, especially in a price environment like we're in. Yes, Doug. I think, looking into the future, as we said, we believe there's going to be a structural change in U.S. shale. There's going to be less players. I think, certainly, the industry is becoming more disciplined, and it will be even hyper-disciplined coming out of this downturn. So we believe there's going to be significant less capital invested in growth in the U.S.. And so -- and certainly, there will be substantially less growth. We have a hard time seeing that the U.S. production will be able to, certainly, in the next several years, get back up to the levels we've been just a few months ago. So in that lies a tremendous opportunities for the companies that survive, and it's an enormous opportunity for EOG. If you look back on our last 3 years, we've generated an industry-leading return on capital employed of 14%. We generated $5.6 billion of free cash flow, and we returned $3.3 billion back in shareholder-friendly ways with substantial dividend growth and debt reduction. And over that last 3-year period, we've increased our proven reserves by 55%. And we've accomplished this all with an average WTI oil price, WTI oil price of $58. So fundamentally, we're not going to change. We're -- as we've been talking about, we're return-driven and believe in a strong balance sheet. And we believe we're improving at a rate much faster than we have in the past and that we're going to emerge a much better company in the next recovery. So we're going to continue to stick with our fundamentals, evaluate the market conditions and continue to create value. Well, I mean, let me make one correction there right off the bat. We've invested about 80% of our cash flow, which is about a really good level. We've been very committed to generating substantial amount of free cash flow. We paid off all that debt, increased our dividend, end of the year last year with $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. So we haven't been spending all our cash. We've been very disciplined in generating tremendous value with that. As we go ahead and we look to the future, again, we think it's going to be different. So we'll certainly -- we'll be continuing to evaluate that and continue to stick with our fundamentals and see what's the best way for EOG to continue to generate significant value. Thank you. In closing, I just want to say, we've never been so proud of the employees of EOG. The way you have responded to this historic COVID-19 crisis has been outstanding and heroic. During every downturn in my over 40 years with EOG, the company responds with record-breaking improvements. Sooner or later, this crisis will be over and oil will recover. We believe EOG will emerge with the ability to be a stronger and a higher-return company than ever before. Thanks for listening, and thanks for your support."

            "content": "Thanks, Tim. I want to highlight the major steps taken to adjust our operating plan by providing some detail. First, on our capital and operating cost-reduction efforts. And second, the steps taken to reduce production during the low points in the oil price curve. Our swift response to the current environment is evident in our first quarter performance. We reduced capital by $265 million or 14%, while essentially hitting the midpoint of the guidance for oil volumes. For the entire year, we reduced our capital plan to $3.5 billion, more than 45% lower than the original plan. Demonstrating the flexibility in our operational plan, we reduced our drilling rig fleet 78% from a peak of 36 rigs down to 8 in the span of just 6 weeks. On the completion side, we reduced activity 69% from 16 frac fleets to just five. Our flexible contracting strategy, combined with our established reputation as a consistent operator that values strategic vendor relationships, have allowed us to make these adjustments without incurring significant costs. The goal is to generate high rates of return for the capital we choose to invest along with free cash flow while maintaining our leverage to the up cycle as demand recovers. Our ability to reposition the company to achieve that goal in a few short weeks is a testament to EOG's strong culture and decentralized organization, and most of all, our fast-acting innovative employees. I'm incredibly proud of them. We also reduced exploration and infrastructure capital without sacrificing projects with the highest long-term benefit to the company. Exploration capital has been focused on the prospects with the most promise to add future shareholder value. On the infrastructure side, the concentration of our activity in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford, where we have existing well-developed assets in place, naturally reduces infrastructure needs. And we are also maintaining our commitment to reducing our environmental footprint by retaining investment in high-impact projects. On the operating cost side, we reduced lease operating expense by more than $300 million or approximately 20% compared to the original plan. Our operations teams are highly engaged in cost reduction, and we are realizing savings from many areas, including fewer expense workovers, reduced maintenance and repairs, water disposal and compression expense and contract labor. While reducing activity has driven significant initial cost reductions, we are maintaining a level of activity that allows us to accelerate technical innovation. The biggest opportunity from the downturn will be to identify a step-change efficiencies and operational improvements that lead to sustainable cost reductions. For example, our drilling and completion teams continue to establish new performance records in each area as illustrated on Slides 39 and 43 of our investor presentation. Across all our operations, we believe we will be able to lower well cost another 8% this year, most of which will be sustainable as a result of the improved efficiencies. This is a testament to the continued drive and innovation to raise the performance bar in the spirit of continuous improvement that allows us to consistently reduce well cost in each of our plays. The cadence of our new capital plan is heavily front-end-loaded. Most of the $1.7 billion of first quarter capital was spent before the downturn began. As a result of rapidly reducing activity, we expect to spend about $650 million in the second quarter and decline sequentially in the third and fourth to total just $3.5 billion for the year, nearly half of our original plan. Our 2020 production profile reflects a rate of return decision. Even though 90% of our shut-in production is cash flow positive at $10 per barrel and we have access to multiple markets, rather than produce at potentially the lowest price point of the year, we elected to shut in existing and deferred additional production by delaying the start-up of new wells. We plan to continue to defer production through the first half of the year. This deferred inventory of new wells has been completed and is simply waiting to produce. This allows us to exert more control over the cash margins of every barrel we produce and provides us the ability to quickly increase oil volumes into an improving oil price environment. We began deferring production during the first quarter. And even after delaying initial production from new wells and shutting in 8,000 barrels a day in March from existing wells, we achieved the midpoint of our guidance. First quarter and second quarter represent the peak and the trough, respectively, of our U-shaped production profile in 2020. Between deferred start-ups and new wells drilled and completed, we anticipate turning online approximately 300 additional wells in the second half of the year, for a total of 485 by the end of 2020. Volumes are currently forecasted to increase in the second half of 2020, with fourth quarter production averaging about 420,000 barrels of oil per day, establishing momentum going into next year. The capital required to maintain this level of production going forward would be approximately $3.4 billion per year. Our production profile corresponds to the current outlook for oil prices. However, we will remain flexible to make further adjustments if the operating plan as conditioned -- to the operating plan as conditions change. If prices stay lower for longer, we can make additional reductions to our capital and operating costs and further defer bringing new wells online. To be clear, we would rather shut in production than sell in to an uncertain low-price market. Ultimately, the decision to begin increasing production will be based on a more sustainable and constructive outlook for oil prices in the second half of the year. For the oil that we do choose to sell, we have secured favorable prices through various contracts providing exposure to Brent, Gulf Coast, WTI and fixed prices. The marketing strategy provides flexibility to pivot each of our producing areas to multiple markets to capture the highest margin. In conclusion, I am proud of how decisively and thoughtfully our employees responded to this downturn. We exercised our flexibility to quickly cut capital and operating costs. And the decision to reduce volumes at the lowest point of the price curve supports our intent to accomplish 2 primary objectives: one, enhance the margins from each barrel that is produced; and two, maximize our rate of return for any investment. While EOG is not immune from the effects of low oil prices, we have the tools and the information to make real-time adjustments to maximize our profitability. We will remain disciplined, invest wisely and constantly evaluate market conditions to generate the most shareholder value. Now here is Bill to wrap up. Yes. Good morning, Brian. The way I would look at that, we're still -- I would still like to emphasize that our annual decline rate that we've provided in previous guidance of 32% is still accurate and true. The shape of that on a quarter-to-quarter basis depends a lot on the nature and the timing of when you bring on wells prior to that. So it can be a little bit -- it can fluctuate quite a bit. It can be a little bit lumpy as you might think of it. It's strictly depending on the timing of bringing on wells in a quarter or two prior to that. So naturally, it's a little steeper at the first part of the life of a well and then flattens out later in the life. So that's kind of what you're seeing in the second quarter. I wouldn't take the decline you're calculating there. That 19% is an indication of a change in our quarterly or annual decline that we've given you in the past. Yes, Brian. So just to be clear, our $3.4 billion maintenance capital we talked about is to maintain the 420,000 barrels a day we plan to exit the fourth quarter at. And to give you a little more color on how we calculate that, that does not anticipate the cost savings that we've talked about here today. We are -- our capital programs are based on the kind of a backward-looking actual well costs that we've been able to attain to date and doesn't bake in costs, anticipated cost savings on a go-forward basis. So in light of that, I think there's -- we always think about that as potential upside to achieve better results. So our capital plan this year and our capital plan or the maintenance cost that we've quoted here, the $3.4 billion, doesn't bake into the 8% cost savings that we're talking about in this call. In addition to that, I think it's important to know that the $3.4 billion, just to go back to that, it's maintained the 420,000 barrels a day that we're exiting the year-end. Yes. Charles, so that's a good question. I'm glad you asked it. It's -- the 20,000 barrels a day that we referenced that would likely still be shut in, in the fourth quarter, is simply wells that have some form of expense that's required to bring them back on production. For instance, you have a lot of reasons why production goes down. These are wells that might have to replace gas lift valve in downhole or maybe a hole in the tubing or things that require some expense work-over to bring back to production. And we just haven't made the decision yet to expend the capital or the expense dollars to bring those wells back to production until we see the margins improve to a point where we would do that. So for the sake of the plan, we just assume those wouldn't be brought back on until next year. Yes, Charles, this is Billy, again. So the way I would think about that is 2 things. I guess, we started -- as the downturn started to happen, we were in the process, of course, of completing several wells. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we dropped our frac fleet count quite considerably there at the start of the year. But we still had wells that were in the process of being completed or just being completed. We elected to not bring those on production at a time when prices were falling so steeply. And likewise, as we continue to cut our frac count down, I think we're running about 5 today, then, those wells, as they're finishing up to completions, we're not bringing those wells on either. So it's just built up, I'd say, an inventory of wells that are in that category that we're waiting on the right timing as to when we view the market fundamentals improving and being constructive going forward to bring those wells on production. Yes, Paul. So the way we go about analyzing our business to shut-in wells is at a very granular level. All of our areas are operating in the same manner. We have the tools, as Bill described, the information technology to gather the information, analyze it and push that decision down to the lowest level in our organization to understand the profit margins on every well throughout the company. So with that information, we can make decisions on when and where best to shut-in wells to maximize our cash flow at any given time. So the shut-ins occur on economics based on that way. We also analyze things from a market perspective in the same manner. We have the same information to understand the markets we can take the products to, how to maximize our netbacks for every product on a well level. And so we can do the same kind of analysis from a marketing perspective. And simply part of that decision is making a larger rate-of-return decision that helps us think about, is it better to produce most of that volume into a more volatile and lower-priced environment or based on a macro outlook for the product? Is it best to wait a month or two or potentially longer to bring that production back on? And so I'd say most of the production falls into that realm. And it's made pretty much on every basin across the company in every area. So that's how we analyze it. It's a very granular look across the company. It takes a lot of effort. All of our -- it goes back to the culture of the company, though. And we have so many engaged employees that are really committed to the company and making sure we all do the best thing we can to continue to make the company better. So we couldn't be more proud of the people that we have to make it all work. Yes, Jeanine. So we cut back to the level we did to basically be able to do the things Bill talked about, make sure we generate a rate of return and generate free cash flow and while we see the commodity price outlook today. If that changes and we feel like that we need to cut more, certainly, we have that flexibility to do so and would continue to push that lever down throughout the end of the year, depending on the outlook. So we could still try to manage within cash flow, even with prices stay lower for longer. Yes. Arun, thanks for the question. Yes, I think, as we talked before, one of the unique things that we built the company around is our ability to gather data and analyze it very quickly and have that information basically in the hands of every employee in the company, including at the field level. So the actual execution of being able to shut-in and bring back the wells on is fairly painless. It's very simple exercise by communicating that data down to the people out there in the field to be able to make those actions happen. So that effort is very easy to do.  As far as any risk of shut-ins, there's really not any risk in our part. I think the cost of shutting in the wells is very minimal, if not 0. The cost of bringing the wells back on is kind of the same thing. And we could actually have all the wells back on production in just a matter of days because, you have to remember, we are a decentralized organization. We have these assets across the country, we have people managing those assets that are very capable and committed to making sure that we do the best things we can, as quick as we can, safely. So the effort is very easy to attain with the culture of the company that we have and the operations we have set up. It's in keeping with how we would run our business. So it's -- the way I would think about it is maybe a little more high-graded than it was in the $4.1 billion capital plan that we announced some time ago that people might remember. In that previous maintenance capital plan, it was pretty much designed to keep each division kind of operating flat. This one is truly -- we're going to go to the wells that have the highest return at today's prices. And so it is a little bit more high graded you might think of. It's still spread across multiple basins, though. So I wouldn't jump to the conclusion as just one area. It's still spread across multiple areas. And it includes the infrastructure and facility costs and ESG spending and those kind of things that we typically would include in a normal budget, just maybe at a little bit lesser scale."

            "content": "Thanks, Bill. As everyone knows, we entered the year with a pretty exciting exploration program. We're focused on capturing positions in basins where we capture the Tier 1 position, and we're working plays that we think will be improving the inventory quality with low decline and certainly low-cost plays. And we're -- we entered this year with a plan of testing and leasing in 10 different prospects. And we've obviously reduced our exploration budget this year, commensurate with reductions across other categories. But we're still planning to progress each of those prospects a little bit this year. We'll remain flexible as we do. But really, the purpose, as Bill said, is that these all have the potential to add significant long-term value creation for the business and for our shareholders. And as Bill pointed out, we've all seen here, over the past, say, 6 or 8 weeks since our employees have been working from home, is really just an amazing effort from all of them on the development side and the exploration side to come up with and generate new ideas. And we just couldn't be more impressed or commend the employees for their efforts on that."

This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call.

Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and in the accompanying investor presentation slides may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential, not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday. Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Ezra Yacob, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor and Public Relations.  Here's Bill Thomas. Thanks, Bill. A conservative approach to our capital structure has been a cornerstone of EOG's financial strategy throughout our history. This is borne out of a recognition that oil and gas business has always been capital-intensive and cyclical. These cycles are as inevitable as they are unpredictable, and so a business must be built not just to withstand them, but to have the financial strength at the right times to be able to take advantage of them. EOG entered the downturn in very good shape. Cash at the end of the first quarter was $2.9 billion, which included roughly $760 million of collateral from hedge contracts. This compares to total debt of $5.2 billion for a net debt to total capital ratio of less than 10%. This is down from 13% at the end of last year and a recent peak of 34% in 2016. We reduced net debt by $4 billion in the last 4 years. Our liquidity position is further supported by a $2 billion unsecured revolving line of credit, which has no borrowings against it. Our long-term debt ratings, which were recently reaffirmed by S&P and Moody's, stand 4 notches into investment grade.  Furthermore, on April 14, EOG issued 10- and 30-year bonds totaling $1.5 billion, enhancing our already strong liquidity position. Last month, we also repaid a maturing $500 million bond, and we plan to repay with cash on hand, the $500 million bond maturing on June 1. Given the outlook for oil prices for the remainder of the year, EOG has also added additional hedges for 2020. We now have hedged more than 95% of our second quarter oil production at an average price of $48 and more than 50% of our third quarter production at $47. This mirrors how we view the periods of greatest price risk and adds another dimension to our approach to maintaining a resilient business by securing that portion of our cash flow. We will begin to look at adding additional '21 hedges later in the year if prices look attractive relative to our assessment of the market fundamentals. Maintaining and growing the dividend remains a top priority as it is the most tangible output of EOG's high-return premium business model. We have never cut the dividend, never issued equity to support the dividend and have not relied on asset sales at fire-sale prices to make it through a downturn. The Board yesterday declared a quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share or $1.50 per share annualized rate, which maintains the rate from the 30% increase declared last quarter. The dividend is designed to be sustainable through low price cycles without straining the balance sheet or sacrificing other priorities. We test these priorities against numerous down cycle scenarios so we can be confident these goals are achievable even under extremely stressed conditions. This resilience reflects EOG's strong returns, low-cost structure and financial flexibility. EOG's financial strength also gives our operations teams to be able to take necessary actions with a focus on long-term benefits to the company instead of making forced short-term decisions. Next up is Billy to review our operational performance."

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir.\nTim Driggers: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings.

Here's Ezra.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. 2021 was a record-setting year for EOG. We earned record net income of $4.7 billion, generated a record $5.5 billion of free cash flow, which funded record cash return of $2.7 billion to shareholders. We doubled our regular dividend rate and paid 2 special dividends, paying out about 30% of cash from operations. And we are continuing to deliver on our free cash flow priorities this year with an additional special dividend announced yesterday of $1 per share. The last time we set an earnings record was in 2014. We earned $5.32 per share while oil averaged $93. Last year, we shattered that record earning $7.09 per share with $68 oil. That's 50% higher earnings with a 27% lower oil price. The catalyst for that improvement was our shift to premium 6 years ago. Premium is our internal investment hurdle rate that uses low fixed commodity prices to calculate the returns that drive our capital allocation decisions, $40 and $2.50 natural gas for the life of the well. While our premium strategy ensures high well-level returns and quick payouts in any given year, the more significant and durable impact is to our full-cycle development costs. The benefit of making investment decisions using fixed low commodity prices has the enduring impact of steadily improving corporate level operating and cash margins over time. That impact is now directly observable on the face of our financial statements. And last year, we raised the bar again to double premium. Our hurdle rate increased from 30% to a minimum of 60% direct after-tax rate of return using the same low fixed prices of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. The switch promises to further improve financial performance in the years ahead and is what gives us great confidence in our ability to continue delivering shareholder value through commodity price cycles. We expect to look back on 2021 like we do on 2016 as the year we made a permanent increase to our return hurdle that drove another step change in the financial performance of EOG. We also delivered as we promised operationally in 2021 with production volumes, CapEx and operating costs in line or better than target set at the beginning of the year. We were able to successfully offset emerging inflationary pressures during the year to lower well costs by 7%. 2021 was also a big year for ESG performance. We reduced our methane emissions percentage and injury rates and increased water reuse. We announced our 2040 net-zero ambition and added our goal to eliminate routine flaring by 2025 to our existing near-term targets for greenhouse gas and methane emissions rates. We continue to develop creative solutions, leveraging existing technology to make progress on our path towards our net-zero ambition. There's growing recognition that oil and gas will have a role to play in the long-term energy solution. We know that to be part of that solution, we not only have to produce low-cost, high-return barrels, we also have to do it with one of the lowest environmental footprints. As we look into 2022, the global oil market is in a position to rebalance during the year. Our disciplined capital plan aims to increase long-term shareholder value through high-return reinvestment that optimizes both near-term and long-term free cash flow. The plan also funds exploration and infrastructure projects to improve the future cost structure of the business. With the improvements we made in the business last year, combined with a higher commodity price environment, EOG is positioned to once again generate significant free cash flow. We continue to follow through on our free cash flow priorities. Our stellar fourth quarter performance allowed us to further strengthen the balance sheet, and we are returning cash to shareholders with the $1 per share special dividend declared yesterday. Combined with our $3 per share regular dividend, we have already committed to return $2.3 billion of cash to shareholders in 2022. We remain firmly committed to our long-standing free cash flow and cash return priorities, and you can expect EOG to continue to deliver on them as the year unfolds. EOG has exited the downturn a much better company than when we entered it. Higher returns with the shift to double premium, a lower cost structure, more free cash flow, a smaller environmental footprint and a culture strengthened by the challenges we have overcome together. Our culture is the number one value driver of EOG's success. By remaining humble and intellectually honest, we sustained the cycle of constant improvement that drives our technology leadership. Of all the fundamentals that consistently create long-term value, none of them matter without the commitment, resiliency and execution from our employees. Now here's Tim to review our financial position.\nTim Driggers: Thanks, Ezra. EOG generated record financial results in the fourth quarter with adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion and free cash flow of $2 billion. Capital expenditures of $1.1 billion were right in line with our forecast while production volumes finished above target. For the full year, adjusted earnings were a record $5 billion or $8.61 per share. This yielded return on capital employed of 23%, while oil prices for the year averaged $68 per barrel. Perhaps most important than setting records is what drove our outperformance. 2021 illustrated EOG's success at driving down our cost structure. ROCE would have been 10% or better at oil prices as low as $44. Keep in mind that back in 2016, when the premium investment standard was introduced, the oil price required for 10% ROCE was in excess of $80 per barrel. The dramatic improvements will be made to the profitability of our business reflect the benefits of using the highest investment threshold in the industry. The bottom line financial impact of double premium is just beginning to show up. But like our original switch to premium, it will grow over the coming years. Our goal is to position the company to earn economic returns at the bottom of the cycle, less than $40 oil and generate returns that are better than the broader market on a full cycle basis. Free cash flow in 2021 was a record $5.5 billion, and we deployed this cash consistent with our long-standing free cash flow priorities. We doubled the regular dividend rate, which now stands at an annual $3 per share and represents a 2.7% yield at the current share price. We are confident in the sustainability of our high-return low cost business model to support a dividend that has never been cut or suspended in this more than 20-year history. We solidified our financial position, finishing the year with effectively 0 net debt. We were also able to address a dental cash return priorities. We paid 2 special dividends for a combined $3 per share. We also refreshed our buyback authorization, which now stands at $5 billion. We will look to utilize this on an opportunistic basis. In total, EOG returned $2.7 billion of cash to shareholders in 2021. This represents 28% of discretionary cash flow and 49% of free cash flow, putting EOG among E&P industry leaders for cash return in 2021. Looking ahead to 2022, our disciplined capital plan and regular dividend can be funded at $44 oil. At $80 oil, we expect to generate about $11 billion of cash flow from operations before working capital. The $4.5 billion capital plan represents about a 40%] reinvestment ratio, resulting in more than $6 billion in free cash flow. This, of course, is on an after-tax basis, as we expect to be a nearly full cash taxpayer in 2022 as we were last year. We are in an excellent position to continue to deliver on our free cash flow priorities in 2022. EOG declared a $0.75 regular dividend yesterday, which is our highest priority for returning cash to shareholders. The size of the regular dividend is evaluated every quarter. As the financial performance and cost structure of EOG continues to improve, we expect that will be reflected in continued growth of the dividend. Turning to our second priority. This period of high oil prices allows us to further bolster the balance sheet. To support our renewed $5 billion buyback authorization and prepare to take advantage of other countercyclical opportunities, we plan to build and carry a higher cash balance going forward. We expect there will be opportunities in the future to create significant shareholder value by deploying a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity at the right time. Finally, we also announced an additional cash return to shareholders yesterday with a $1 per share special dividend to be paid in March. Along with the regular dividend, EOG has already committed to return $2.3 billion of cash to shareholders in 2022. We are fully committed to continuing to deliver on all of our free cash flow priorities. Here's Billy.\nLloyd Helms: Thanks, Tim. First, I want to thank all of our employees for their outstanding accomplishments and stellar execution last year. I'm especially proud of their safety performance. In addition to outstanding operations and financial improvements, we achieved a record low innovate and find opportunities to increase efficiencies and lowered the average well cost by 7%, beating the 5% target we set at the start of the year. Our drilling teams are achieving targeted depths faster with lower cost by focusing on reliability of the tools and technical procedures that drive daily performance. For example, in our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp play, our teams have improved days to drill by 42% since 2018. In our Eagle Ford oil play, after drilling several thousand wells, our teams continue to refine the drilling operation to drive consistent performance for our rig fleet, resulting in a 21% reduction in the drilling costs since 2018. And with our decentralized organization and collaborative teamwork across operational areas, we continue to generate ideas for improvement through our innovative approach to areas such as improved bit design and drilling motor performance and share them throughout the company. On the completion side, we made great starts to expand the use of our Super Zipper or simo-frac technique to about one-third of our wells completed last year. Completion costs also benefited from reduced sand and water cost through our integrated self-sourcing efforts and water reuse infrastructure. Utilizing local sand and water pipelines includes the added benefit of removing trucks from the row of contributing to a safer oilfield with lower emissions. Cash operating costs were in line with forecast. And while delivering a higher level of total production, they were nearly equivalent to our cash operating cost pre-pandemic in 2019. The savings are a result of a focus on reducing workover expenses and improvements in produced water management. These efforts will expand in 2022 to help offset additional inflationary pressure. We also had another great year improving our ESG performance metrics. Preliminary calculations indicate that we reduced our methane emissions percentage by about 25% and our total recordable incident rate by 10%. We also achieved a 99.8% target for wellhead gas capture and increased water resource from reuse to 55%. Again, these are preliminary results as our final metrics will be published in our sustainability report later this year. As we enter 2022, EOG is not immune to the inflation that we're seeing across our industry. But we have line of sight to offset these inflationary pressures through innovation and technical advances, contracting for services, supply chain management and self-sourcing and materials. Over 90% of our drilling fleet and over 50% of our frac fleets needed to execute this year's program are covered under existing term agreements with multiple providers. Our vendor partnerships provide EOG the ability to secure longer-term high-performing teams at favorable prices while providing the vendors a predictable and reliable source of activity to run their business. EOG's technical teams take ownership of various aspects of the drilling and completion operations to drive performance, improvements and eliminate downtime. As a result, we will -- we still see opportunities to sustainably improve our performance. Some of the largest efficiency gains will be in our completion operations this year. For example, we expect to utilize our Super Zipper technique on about 60% of our wells, increasing the amount of treated lateral per day. We're also enhancing our self-sourced local sand efforts, which we expect to not only secure the material needed for the year, but also offset the effects of inflation. We continue to expand our water reuse capabilities that will assist in offsetting inflation in both our capital program and lease operating expense. We remain confident that we'll be able to keep well cost at least flat in 2022. EOG's capital efficiency continues to improve as a result of EOG's culture of continuous improvement. 2022 looks to be a year of challenges and inflationary headwinds. And I'm excited about the opportunity to bring our talented employees to further improve our business through innovation and improved operational execution. Here's Ken to review the year-end reserves and provide an inventory update.\nKenneth Boedeker: Thanks, Billy. Last year, we replaced more than 2x what we produced and reduced our finding and development costs by 17%. Our permanent shift to premium drilling and focus on efficiencies driven by innovation and our unique culture ease to why our capital efficiency continues to improve, and our corporate finding costs and DD&A rate continue to decline. Our 2021 reserve replacement was 208% for a finding and development cost of just $5.81 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding revisions due to commodity price changes. Since 2014, prior to the last downturn and the implementation of our premium strategy, we have reduced finding and development costs by more than 55%. With our double premium standard and the high grading of our future development schedule, we grew our reserve base in 2021 by over 500 million barrels of oil equivalent for total booked reserves of over 3.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This represents a 16% increase in reserves year-over-year. In terms of future well locations, we added over 700 net double premium locations across multiple basins to our inventory in 2021, replacing the 410 drilled last year by 170%. Our double premium inventory is growing faster than we drill it, and the quality of the locations we are adding to the inventory is improving. Innovation continues to drive sustainable cost improvements and operational efficiencies. And when you combine that with our focus on developing higher quality rock, we further improve the median return of the portfolio. We don't need more inventory. We are focused on improving our inventory quality. With this in mind, our double premium inventory now accounts for 6,000 of the 11,500 total premium locations in our inventory, representing more than 11 years of drilling at the current pace. Now let me turn the call back to Ezra.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Ken. In conclusion, I'd like to note the following important takeaways. First, investment decisions based on a low commodity price puts the emphasis on full cycle cost of development and demands efficient use of capital. While the benefits of such discipline are realized immediately, the larger impact builds over time. The seed to our stellar results in 2021 was the premium strategy established 6 years ago, and we have set the stage for the next step change in financial performance by instituting double premium last year. Second, we are confident EOG's innovative and technology-driven culture can offset inflationary pressures this year. Our disciplined capital plan is focused on high return reinvestment to continue improving our margins in not only 2022 but in future years as well. Third, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders. We demonstrated this through the return of nearly 50% of free cash flow last year, and this quarter's special dividend are third in less than a year. Doubling our regular dividend rate indicates our confidence in the durability of our future performance. The regular dividend is our preferred method to return cash to shareholders. And as we continue to increase the capital efficiency of EOG through low-cost operations and improved well performance, growth of the regular dividend will remain a priority. We truly believe the best is yet to come. Going forward as a company and an industry with a financial profile more competitive than ever with the broader market and a growing recognition of the value we bring to society, EOG has never been better positioned to generate significant long-term shareholder value. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. The line is yours.\nPaul Cheng: First, we have been asked by many that with your CapEx plan and your production profile, if the current commodity price hold by mid-year, will you change the pan or that under what circumstances that, that plan may get revised? That's the first question. The second question is that in your future capital allocation, is 2022 the way how you will be a reasonable proxy in the future? Or we will see the percentage in the new domestic drilling, which is about 10% this year and also that the facility and the gathering and processing, those percentage will go up as a total percent of your CapEx as you're trying to prove up more new resource area?\nEzra Yacob: Yes. Paul, this is Ezra. I'll answer the first question, and then I'll hand the second question over here to Billy to answer for you. With regards to our plan this year, as we've talked about, the way we're approaching our planning is not based on the oil price that we're seeing. We're really looking to see the broad market fundamentals that are underlying and supporting that oil price and other macroeconomic indicators. So when we look at our '22 plan, we think we've designed a very high-return capital program. It balances our free cash flow this year with increased free cash flow in future years. And it really starts with investing in the double premium wells. When we bring those low-cost reserves into the company's financials, it helps drive down the cost basis of the company and it continues to expand the margins. It's what allows us to continue delivering high corporate level returns as well as increase the cash flow potential of the company, and that further supports our free cash flow priorities. So the program this year is at a pace that allowed us to capture and incorporate technical learnings to continue to improve each of our assets. And that's the most important thing that we look to do every year, not only in 2022, but to go forward into future years as well. And I'll turn it over to Billy to answer the second part of the question.\nLloyd Helms: Yes, Paul. On the second part of the question, going forward beyond 2022 and the percent we have allocated to new domestic drilling potential or really our exploration plays and infrastructure spend, it's been fairly consistent in the past and I expect it to be fairly consistent going forward. The largest amount of our CapEx spend will always be dedicated to our more developing -- development plays like the Delaware Basin play. And then going forward, we remain excited about the exploration potential we see in many of our new emerging plays. And we'll continue to fund those at a pace where we can continue to learn and get better just as Ezra mentioned. The infrastructure spend has always been about the same percentage each year, and I expect that will continue to be managed in the same way. We want to make sure that we get too far out in front with the infrastructure spending, but it's done at a pace commensurate with the development activity in a given area. So I expect that will continue to be the case.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nArun Jayaram: Yes. Global gas is clearly in focus right now. So I wanted to get your thoughts on the revamped agreement with which will provide you more linkage to JKM. I think today, you're selling about 140,000 MMBtu, and that increases to 420 over time. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of timing and shed some light on the type of realizations you get from marketing the gas to LNG? And how is the economic rent shared amongst you and\nLance Terveen: Arun, this is Lance. I was just saying good morning. We're very excited about the new amendment that we have with And you're exactly right. I mean, we've got thousands that started in 2020. And I think that just really speaks to being really a first move or 2 because as you can see right now, you can look at the price realizations, you can see JKM spot prices are near $40, having that first-mover capability, moving quickly there to get that exposure is exactly right. As you mentioned in your question, it's been very impactful in a positive way as we think about our price realizations. We're very excited about the commitment. You're right, it ramps up. So we've got the 140 today that will ramp to 420 as they go into service. That's estimated to be probably with the first -- for Stage 3 in 2026. But if you remember there, we ramp up. We kind of go to the $140 today we started into the 420 as Stage 3 goes into service. And we still will maintain and we extended the 300,000 MMBtu a day sell that we have that's linked to Henry Hub. So we're excited about it. It's a brownfield facility. They've demonstrated being early on many of their projects. So we're excited to see our relationship grow from that standpoint and expect to see the price realizations materialize as well.\nArun Jayaram: And my follow-up is just on the 2022 program. Ezra, you guided to 570 net wells, we want to get a bit more color on the decision to allocate more capital to the Delaware versus Eagle Ford? It looks like your Eagle Ford activity will be down, call it, more than 50% year-over-year, while your Delaware will be up 30% more, including a little bit more second bone activity. So I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color there.\nLloyd Helms: Yes. Arun, this is Billy Helms. So yes, we're allocating a little bit more money to the Delaware Basin. And it's really just a function of the maturity of the Eagle Ford at this point. The Eagle Ford has been an active play for more than, I guess, 12 years and certainly has been a highly economic play for the company and continues to be. I would remind everybody that last year was the single best returns we've ever generated in the Eagle Ford play since its inception 12 years ago. And so it's still a very valuable play, but it is more mature. The Delaware Basin on the other hand is still a lot earlier in its maturity in this life cycle and still has a lot of opportunity to grow and test new horizons and expand our development capabilities over time. So it's just a lot younger in its maturity phase. So I think it naturally will command a little bit more activity on that side.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead. The line is yours.\nDoug Leggate: Last time I spoke to you, you were talking about the mix of the double premium wells in the production profile and of course the impact on sustaining capital and breakeven oil prices. So I wonder if you could just walk us through how you see that? The 32 breakeven you've given us today obviously comes with a, I guess, some element of growth in the capital. So how do you see the sustaining capital? How do you see that breakeven trending? That's my first question.\nEzra Yacob: Yes. Doug, this is Ezra. Thanks for the question. Yes, our maintenance capital on the back of a 7% well cost reduction last year and then additional well improvement, combined with increasing the percentage of double premium wells. And what I mean by that is a lower cost of the reserves, bringing those into the company's financials. Our maintenance capital continues to decrease, which is fantastic for us. You're right, the $32 breakeven that we provided today is actually with our commensurate with the CapEx program that we have for this year. But the double premium wells, we can't stress enough. Not only is it -- does the impact show out on very rapid payout and a high rate of return, but really by bringing those lower-cost reserves and a lower decline into the base of the company, over time, it really does start to show up an impact the full cycle returns and free cash flow generation potential of the company in the future.\nDoug Leggate: So where do you think those 2 numbers are today, the sustaining capital and the ex-growth breakeven?\nEzra Yacob: Yes. So we didn't release a maintenance capital this earnings call due to the fact that we've started to allocate some additional capital into the Dorado play. And so it starts to get a little bit messy as you start going from oil into a BOE equivalent as we are starting to see the phenomenal results there with the Dorado play as we dedicate additional capital to it. Nevertheless, I think what we've outlined is with the 7% well cost reduction and slight improvements on the well mix year-over-year, we've continued to drive down that breakeven. And for the full cycle return, we have a slide in our deck that shows the one way that we like to present it is the price required for a 10% return on capital employed. And you can see we made a big step change last year as we drove that price down to $44.\nDoug Leggate: My follow-up is a capital allocation question, and it's really -- maybe it's for Tim. The free cash flow you're showing in your slide deck of north of $4 billion a year after the special could essentially wipe out the majority of your share buyback authorization. I'm just wondering why you still feel no need to offer some kind of capital return framework? Because clearly, with the transparency of that breakeven level with the duration of your inventory and so on, valuation becomes a little bit more transparent. Therefore, buybacks could perhaps be more justifiable. So I'm just curious why you've been reluctant now to go down that route? I'll leave it there.\nEzra Yacob: Yes. Doug, this is Ezra again. Just to reiterate our free cash flow priorities, first, the commitment begins with the sustainable dividend growth of our regular dividend. In '21, we doubled that regular dividend. And to us, that regular dividend is really indicative of what we're trying to accomplish. It reflects the continuing increase in the go-forward capital efficiency of the company. And it's also focused on creating through-the-cycle value and free cash flow, and that's ultimately what we're trying to do. Again, going back to what we were just talking about with the investment in the double premium wells and lowering the cost base of the company, trying to take at least a small step away from the inevitable commodity price cycles of our industry. The second free cash flow priority for us is a pristine balance sheet, which obviously provides tremendous competitive advantage in a cyclical industry. And then the third, what we're talking about right now is the additional cash return in the form of specials or opportunistic repurchases. And as we talked about, last year, we demonstrated the commitment with $2.7 billion in cash return through the form of $3 per share special dividends and are regular. And then we also retired that $750 million bond early in the year. In general, what we've talked about is we're going to use our -- reserve our repurchase opportunities to be more opportunistic than programmatic. So in times one way to think is that in times of rising share or oil price, you can expect us to prefer to do special dividends. And really, the way that we think about the share repurchase is, we measure it as an investment the same as we measure any investments across our business. So we want to make sure that it competes on a returns basis. And that's why we still prefer in an environment like this to stick with the special dividend as the priority for additional cash return.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nScott Gruber: Just following on that line of questioning, given that your net debt negative here at the start of the year, should we think about the cash build is largely being over This is Tim. No. First of all, we are excited to have to be in a position where we are to have a cash balance going -- our net cash balance going forward. So we will continue, as I said in my opening remarks, we'll continue to build cash on the balance sheet during these high oil price scenarios and look to -- for opportunities in the countercyclical times to deploy that cash in a meaningful way in the form of more specials or stock buybacks or just opportunistic things that come along in the countercyclical environment. So the answer, again, is no, we will be -- in these high price environment, we will be building more cash on the balance sheet.\nScott Gruber: Got you. I appreciate the clarification. And then congrats on the expanded export agreement. Just thinking about the broader backdrop here, there's likely another round of LNG project sanctioning along the Gulf Coast. It seems like the industry is in an advantaged position there. How aggressive EOG on entering additional agreements, thinking kind of similar terms? Do you guys foresee and expanded JKM to Henry Hub spread that you'd want to capture? Do you think that's sustainable and you want to capture that spread? Or do you kind of look at additional agreements more through traditional diversification lens?\nLance Terveen: Yes, Scott. Thanks for your question. This is Lance. I think what I can really point you to is like you think about each of our operating areas and you think about our transportation positions that we have, it really puts us: one, we're in close proximity; but two, we have the capability that we can transact very quickly. So I think first, I would point you to that. And then I'd say secondly, yes, we're always interested in new opportunities. So we'll be continuing to look at that from like a business development standpoint. And it's really going to be commensurate like you heard from Billy as you talk about -- as you think about growth, our volumes. And then as we move forward, we will be looking at new opportunities, but that will be definitely commensurate with our plans on a go forward as we look at our plan.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Neal Dingmann from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. The line is yours.\nNeal Dingmann: Maybe for you or Tim, maybe just ask one more on the shareholder return. I know most popular question. But you guys continue now to pay out over 50% of your free cash flow. And I'm just wondering on a go forward, I know there were some out there thinking you all would even have potentially a higher payout, is that something that you're targeting? I know you're not going to have the exact metrics on how you want to pay out up to a certain amount. But is that something internally you're always continuing to sort of look at paying out over 50% or 60% or something like that on a go forward, given your strong free cash flow?\nEzra Yacob: Yes. This is Ezra. We continue to evaluate our cash position with respect to dividends on a quarterly basis. And what I would say is that, you're correct, we're thrilled to be in the position where we are, where we can offer to the shareholders such a competitive regular base dividend that again, I think, is our number one priority as a way to create value through the cycles. But on top of that, we are in a great position to offer continued strength of our balance sheet to support that dividend and then continue to offer cash return -- additional cash return of excess free cash flow in the form of these specials and buybacks. We don't have a specific target that we do. We stay away from providing a formula because we want to be able to have the flexibility to do the right thing at the right time to really maximize the shareholder value in a way that is protected through the cycles. Said another way, I think we've demonstrated that over the past year. We've taken the opportunity to both strengthen the balance sheet last year. And again, last year pay out a significant amount, $2.7 billion in cash returns. And we've doubled down on that basically with this first quarter announcement with the $1.75 per share cash return this quarter. And essentially, that reflects the evaluation, the positive commodity price environment that we were experiencing in and the strength of the underlying business and our confidence in it going forward.\nNeal Dingmann: I notice a nice bump on the NGL guide. Maybe could you talk about it -- I've seen you obviously now have a number of wells up in the sort of liquids area. Is that what's driving the growth there? Or can you could talk about sort of plans in the Marcellus side area or area, I would say,\nEzra Yacob: Yes. We actually divested of our Marcellus position a couple of years ago that was in a dry gas part of the Marcellus acreage there in Pennsylvania. With respect to some of the other opportunities that we haven't really discussed publicly, that's really exploration, as you guys know. First and foremost, we're an exploration company. We're always striving to be a first mover and organically improve the quality of our inventory. So I will provide you a little bit of color on that. Domestically, we continue to explore across the U.S., our exploration program that we've talked about for the last year or so has been progressing. We finished last year drilling 12 wells across multiple opportunities, all dominantly oil-focused and we'll be slightly increasing that number this year to about 20 as we're encouraged with some of the results that we had last year. In general, though, like I said, we don't discuss the details of the exploration other than just to say that the opportunities are low-cost entry, they're oil focused, they're reservoirs that we think can exploit with our horizontal drilling and completions expertise. And this year, we look forward to doing some more delineation and appraisal drilling. And as we've said in the past, the goal of our exploration program is not just to find oil or find reserves. It's really to add to the quality of our inventory from a lower finding cost and higher returns perspective. And so it takes time to be able to evaluate that we can actually discover these opportunities and bring them into the mix where they're really going to help lower the cost base of the company and be a significant contributor to our portfolio going forward.\nNeal Dingmann: And I guess just a follow-up on that. As far as the NGL guide going up, that's simply a function of the fact that we have opportunity to make an election as to how much we recover or reject going forward on several of our processing contracts -- and with the strength of much of the NGL pricing, we're simply assuming we'll be in recovery mode more than rejection mode in several of those contracts this year.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. The line is yours.\nScott Hanold: And maybe just since you talked a little bit about the exploration opportunities in the U.S. Can you give us a sense of how you think about international exploration opportunities? I know you all were doing some work in Oman in offshore Australia. Is there any update there? And how do you think about international versus onshore or U.S. opportunities?\nEzra Yacob: Yes. Scott, in general, as we've talked about, the international opportunities have -- they have a higher hurdle to really be considered additive to the quality of our inventory simply because we need to have access to services there. We need to have access to contracts, and we need to find the subsurface geology that actually makes it, not just competitive, but really superior to much of what we're drilling here. In Australia, to start with that one, we still have that opportunity. We plan -- we're in the permitting phase currently, and we plan to initiate drilling in that one early next year. And then in Oman, we did announce, as you recall, we had a low cost of entry into Oman. It included a 2-well commitment. And during the second half of '21, we drilled those 2 exploratory wells, one of which was a short horizontal. We completed that horizontal, made a natural gas discovery there. But ultimately, as I was just saying the prospect, we decided is not going to compete with our existing portfolio. So we won't be moving forward with that project. In general, we do feel encouraged with the international opportunities out there because we see really kind of a lack of exploration competition out there. And we see that many times, national oil companies or ministries, the owners of those lands have really started to realize that they can't rely on traditional conventional term contracts to be able to get some unconventional type prospects drilled. And so we're seeing a little bit more flexibility on the negotiation side, which gives us some encouragement.\nScott Hanold: And I'm going to hit on the shareholder returns too because obviously, you all are in a very enviable position. But Ezra and Tim, you guys talk about being opportunistic and countercyclical ways with your balance sheet then -- during the fourth quarter, I guess, post things given there was a little bit of a disconnect there. Your stock was a lot lower than it is today. Why not take that opportunity then to buy back stock? Can you -- so just trying to frame for us like when you think the right opportunities to buy back stock are.\nEzra Yacob: Yes. In general, Scott, we didn't see that as one of the opportunities that we're looking for there in the fourth quarter. When we talk about the significant dislocation, we're talking about something more so than that. Like I said, we consider share repurchase in the same way that we do any investment decision. It's how does it create the most long-term shareholder value. And we're in a cyclical industry, and that's why we prefer to use it opportunistically with a significant opportunity. The challenge, of course, is we recognize that being in a position to execute during the market dislocation is a challenging thing to do. However, we feel with the strength of our balance sheet and the low cash operating cost that we have, we'll be well positioned when we see the opportunity.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Leo Mariani from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. The line is yours.\nLeo Mariani: I wanted to see if there's any update on the PRB. Certainly noticed in the slide deck that activity there is going to be down a little bit in terms of a few less wells in '22 versus what you did in '21. So perhaps you could kind of speak to how well costs have trended and kind of where that opportunity is on your list amongst the different plays? Clearly, you described a significant increase in Delaware activity this year. So how does the PRB rank?\nJeffrey Leitzell: Leo, this is Jeff Leitzell. The PRB, we're really excited about where it's going. In 2021, we had a record year, both from a well performance and an economic standpoint. Last year, our team, they continue to really delineate our core areas. They completed about 50 wells and half of those exceeded our double premium threshold. So we're really encouraged by that. On top of that, we also brought on multiple record wells in the basin, both in the Niobrara and the Mowry formations, all doing this while reducing our cost year-over-year by about 10%. So the one thing that we really look at with the Powder River Basin is it's a little bit more geologically complex compared to our other basins. So it's really important that we operate at the right pace, and we don't outrun our learnings. So looking forward kind of to 2022, we plan on maintaining a similar amount of activity and as our team there really high grades our acreage, refines our well spacing and strategically build out our infrastructure, we really expect the Powder River Basin asset to be able to increase activity in 2023 and beyond.\nLeo Mariani: And then if I can just take another crack at the kind of exploration. So I certainly noticed that you guys are spending about by numbers of right around $100 million more on some of these U.S. plays here in '22, and you clearly talked about drilling more wells. I guess a common question I hear from investors out there is it's been a number of years since EOG has kind of announced the strategy, and I guess we'd kind of get to see a new significant U.S. oil play for the company. I know these things are hard to predict, but if I had to just kind of look at a high-level time line. I mean, do you think that's likely in '22 or maybe '23? I mean anything you can kind of say from a high level to get people some assurance that maybe these are progressing?\nEzra Yacob: Yes. Leo, what I'd say is it's just really hard to predict, and I'd hate to commit to something to lead you down the wrong path. I might point to historically, we did some early drilling in the Powder River Basin, and it was a number of years before we felt comfortable We gotten that to a point where we want to talk about it publicly in a big way. And then the same with Dorado. I know there was a lot of speculation as to our Austin Chalk exploration program for a number of years. And as you can see, we waited until we had some long-term production and felt confident as to what we had there before we started really talking about it publicly. The current exploration program was definitely slowed down, even maybe a little bit more than we anticipated during the pandemic. It was just a little more difficult even to get leasing done and things of that nature. As we talked about in 2021, the plays coming out of the pandemic had really started to move it kind of various paces or various rates. Some of the wells last year that we drilled were the initial wells in these plays. In other prospects, some of the wells, we're really testing a little more delineation, repeatability, more appraisal. Because again, like I said, almost more than an exploration program, what we're trying to find is not just oil. That's not necessarily the most difficult thing anymore. It's really, as you guys can appreciate, trying to find low-cost barrels, barrels that are additive to what not only we have already discovered but what the industry has really discovered, what the world wants is access to lower-cost barrels, and that's what we're searching for. And so it takes a little bit longer to be able to really get the appraisal on these and make sure that these opportunities are really going to be additive, again, to the quality of our inventory.\nOperator: The next question today comes from Jeannie Wai from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJeannie Wai: Our first question is maybe just back to the double premium. You added 700 new net double premium locations in 2021. And were these additions spread out across your plays? Or are they concentrated in maybe one or two of them? And where do you see the most runway for future conversions?\nKenneth Boedeker: Yes. Jeanine, thanks for the question. This is Ken. We added double premium locations over a number of our active premium plays, really in line with where we drilled our wells last year, mainly in the Permian and the Eagle Ford. And this is really just an example of our culture where we're working to get better, continuing to lower well costs while focusing on increasing the recovery is what leads to significant increases in returns and really allows us to convert wells to premium and double premium through time. And our goal is to always replace at least as many double premium locations as we drill every year.\nJeannie Wai: Maybe our second question, maybe 1 for Tim or Ezra. In the past, I think if memory serves me correctly, I think you've commented that after you pay off the 2023 notes that you don't really have a desire to pay down any further debt. I just wanted to check in if that was still the thinking? And I think we're just really looking for a little bit more color on how you decided that $1 per share for the special this time around was the optimal level?\nTim Driggers: Yes. This is Tim. No, we have not announced any intention of paying off more bonds as they become due. We'll continue to evaluate that as we go forward, but we -- that did not figure into the dollar was a way of giving back meaningful amount of cash to the shareholders in this period. And as we said, that's a backward-looking thing, not a forward-looking thing.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from Neil Mehta from Golman Sachs. Please go ahead. The line is yours.\nNeil Mehta: I know EOG has developed some more internal macro forecasting capability. And I'd just be curious on your views on U.S. shale production in the United States. How are you guys thinking about it entry to exit U.S. oil growth? And talk about the moving pieces ranging from what you're seeing from your competitors in the private market to services constraints such as pressure pumping, your thoughts on U.S. growth would be valuable.\nEzra Yacob: Yes. Neil, I'll add a bit of an overview, and then maybe I'll hand it off to Billy for some more details for you on the activity side. But in general, when we think about the growth forecasts that are out there and have been publicly discussed, we're probably a bit more on the lower end in general on the crude and condensate side. And the reason for that is I think you're seeing commitment from the North American E&P space to remain disciplined. And then you couple that with some of the inflationary and supply chain pressures. And we think the U.S. is definitely going to face some headwinds in growth on this year. And I think Billy can provide a bit more details on it.\nLloyd Helms: Yes. Neil, this is Billy. I'm sure you've heard the same comments from many of our peers about the supply chain constraints in the industry is seeing across all the sectors, certainly on the drilling rig side, there's certainly most of the active super-spec rigs are being -- are deployed and active today. There's not a lot of new pieces of equipment that can come into the market. The same is true on the frac side of the business, most of the good equipment is already under employment today. And then bringing in new fleets, both on the drilling side and on the frac side, is challenged also from the standpoint of attracting labor to the market. So there's a lot of headwinds to try to -- for the industry to try to ramp up activity and grow production this year. So it will be a probably viewed as maybe a transition year also in that light. And hopefully, the industry can strengthen and get better on a go-forward basis. But this year is going to be a challenging year from that side.\nNeil Mehta: And then the follow-up is around natural gas, both U.S. and global. A lot of moving pieces, obviously, right now from a geopolitical standpoint. But the most of the industry has been of a lower-for-longer U.S. natural gas view. Do you see that evolving as we have more LNG linkage into the global market? If you think about global gas, especially in light of your announcement with do you see a structural change in this market until Qatar supply comes on mid decade?\nEzra Yacob: Yes. Neil, this is Ezra. In general, what I would say is the U.S. has discovered a very vast supply of natural gas, and it's important that we get that gas offshore and into the global market for some of the reasons that you talked about now, not only geopolitical, but just developing nations, so on and so forth. And that's one of the reasons where we're so glad to partner and continue to take out some of our LNG. For us, the way we think about the natural gas globally is really it's going to be a cost of supply. And we say that we want to be the low-cost producer, and that might sound like we're talking about oil dominantly, but that goes for gas as well. And it's one reason we're very excited about our Dorado prospect. We think it competes in North America is basically the lowest cost of supply, especially because of its geographic location, close to so many marketing centers, including the Gulf Coast. So we're very excited and very fortunate to have it. And I think the U.S. is going to continue to be, in the long term, a significant player in the global gas supply.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A session. So I'll now hand the call back to Mr. Yacob.\nEzra Yacob: Yes. We want to thank everyone for participating on the call this morning, and we want to thank our shareholders for their support. As we said, EOG had an outstanding performance in 2021, and we're poised for an up great year in 2022. And it really comes down to our employees. Our employees are the keys to our success, and it's why I'm convinced are to being one of the lowest cost, highest return and lowest emissions energy suppliers that can play a significant role in the long-term future of energy. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Arun, this is Lance. I was just saying good morning. We're very excited about the new amendment that we have with And you're exactly right. I mean, we've got thousands that started in 2020. And I think that just really speaks to being really a first move or 2 because as you can see right now, you can look at the price realizations, you can see JKM spot prices are near $40, having that first-mover capability, moving quickly there to get that exposure is exactly right. As you mentioned in your question, it's been very impactful in a positive way as we think about our price realizations. We're very excited about the commitment. You're right, it ramps up. So we've got the 140 today that will ramp to 420 as they go into service. That's estimated to be probably with the first -- for Stage 3 in 2026. But if you remember there, we ramp up. We kind of go to the $140 today we started into the 420 as Stage 3 goes into service. And we still will maintain and we extended the 300,000 MMBtu a day sell that we have that's linked to Henry Hub. So we're excited about it. It's a brownfield facility. They've demonstrated being early on many of their projects. So we're excited to see our relationship grow from that standpoint and expect to see the price realizations materialize as well. Yes, Scott. Thanks for your question. This is Lance. I think what I can really point you to is like you think about each of our operating areas and you think about our transportation positions that we have, it really puts us: one, we're in close proximity; but two, we have the capability that we can transact very quickly. So I think first, I would point you to that. And then I'd say secondly, yes, we're always interested in new opportunities. So we'll be continuing to look at that from like a business development standpoint. And it's really going to be commensurate like you heard from Billy as you talk about -- as you think about growth, our volumes. And then as we move forward, we will be looking at new opportunities, but that will be definitely commensurate with our plans on a go forward as we look at our plan."

            "name": "Lloyd Helms",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. First, I want to thank all of our employees for their outstanding accomplishments and stellar execution last year. I'm especially proud of their safety performance. In addition to outstanding operations and financial improvements, we achieved a record low innovate and find opportunities to increase efficiencies and lowered the average well cost by 7%, beating the 5% target we set at the start of the year. Our drilling teams are achieving targeted depths faster with lower cost by focusing on reliability of the tools and technical procedures that drive daily performance. For example, in our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp play, our teams have improved days to drill by 42% since 2018. In our Eagle Ford oil play, after drilling several thousand wells, our teams continue to refine the drilling operation to drive consistent performance for our rig fleet, resulting in a 21% reduction in the drilling costs since 2018. And with our decentralized organization and collaborative teamwork across operational areas, we continue to generate ideas for improvement through our innovative approach to areas such as improved bit design and drilling motor performance and share them throughout the company. On the completion side, we made great starts to expand the use of our Super Zipper or simo-frac technique to about one-third of our wells completed last year. Completion costs also benefited from reduced sand and water cost through our integrated self-sourcing efforts and water reuse infrastructure. Utilizing local sand and water pipelines includes the added benefit of removing trucks from the row of contributing to a safer oilfield with lower emissions. Cash operating costs were in line with forecast. And while delivering a higher level of total production, they were nearly equivalent to our cash operating cost pre-pandemic in 2019. The savings are a result of a focus on reducing workover expenses and improvements in produced water management. These efforts will expand in 2022 to help offset additional inflationary pressure. We also had another great year improving our ESG performance metrics. Preliminary calculations indicate that we reduced our methane emissions percentage by about 25% and our total recordable incident rate by 10%. We also achieved a 99.8% target for wellhead gas capture and increased water resource from reuse to 55%. Again, these are preliminary results as our final metrics will be published in our sustainability report later this year. As we enter 2022, EOG is not immune to the inflation that we're seeing across our industry. But we have line of sight to offset these inflationary pressures through innovation and technical advances, contracting for services, supply chain management and self-sourcing and materials. Over 90% of our drilling fleet and over 50% of our frac fleets needed to execute this year's program are covered under existing term agreements with multiple providers. Our vendor partnerships provide EOG the ability to secure longer-term high-performing teams at favorable prices while providing the vendors a predictable and reliable source of activity to run their business. EOG's technical teams take ownership of various aspects of the drilling and completion operations to drive performance, improvements and eliminate downtime. As a result, we will -- we still see opportunities to sustainably improve our performance. Some of the largest efficiency gains will be in our completion operations this year. For example, we expect to utilize our Super Zipper technique on about 60% of our wells, increasing the amount of treated lateral per day. We're also enhancing our self-sourced local sand efforts, which we expect to not only secure the material needed for the year, but also offset the effects of inflation. We continue to expand our water reuse capabilities that will assist in offsetting inflation in both our capital program and lease operating expense. We remain confident that we'll be able to keep well cost at least flat in 2022. EOG's capital efficiency continues to improve as a result of EOG's culture of continuous improvement. 2022 looks to be a year of challenges and inflationary headwinds. And I'm excited about the opportunity to bring our talented employees to further improve our business through innovation and improved operational execution. Here's Ken to review the year-end reserves and provide an inventory update. Yes, Paul. On the second part of the question, going forward beyond 2022 and the percent we have allocated to new domestic drilling potential or really our exploration plays and infrastructure spend, it's been fairly consistent in the past and I expect it to be fairly consistent going forward. The largest amount of our CapEx spend will always be dedicated to our more developing -- development plays like the Delaware Basin play. And then going forward, we remain excited about the exploration potential we see in many of our new emerging plays. And we'll continue to fund those at a pace where we can continue to learn and get better just as Ezra mentioned. The infrastructure spend has always been about the same percentage each year, and I expect that will continue to be managed in the same way. We want to make sure that we get too far out in front with the infrastructure spending, but it's done at a pace commensurate with the development activity in a given area. So I expect that will continue to be the case. Yes. Arun, this is Billy Helms. So yes, we're allocating a little bit more money to the Delaware Basin. And it's really just a function of the maturity of the Eagle Ford at this point. The Eagle Ford has been an active play for more than, I guess, 12 years and certainly has been a highly economic play for the company and continues to be. I would remind everybody that last year was the single best returns we've ever generated in the Eagle Ford play since its inception 12 years ago. And so it's still a very valuable play, but it is more mature. The Delaware Basin on the other hand is still a lot earlier in its maturity in this life cycle and still has a lot of opportunity to grow and test new horizons and expand our development capabilities over time. So it's just a lot younger in its maturity phase. So I think it naturally will command a little bit more activity on that side. Yes. Neil, this is Billy. I'm sure you've heard the same comments from many of our peers about the supply chain constraints in the industry is seeing across all the sectors, certainly on the drilling rig side, there's certainly most of the active super-spec rigs are being -- are deployed and active today. There's not a lot of new pieces of equipment that can come into the market. The same is true on the frac side of the business, most of the good equipment is already under employment today. And then bringing in new fleets, both on the drilling side and on the frac side, is challenged also from the standpoint of attracting labor to the market. So there's a lot of headwinds to try to -- for the industry to try to ramp up activity and grow production this year. So it will be a probably viewed as maybe a transition year also in that light. And hopefully, the industry can strengthen and get better on a go-forward basis. But this year is going to be a challenging year from that side."

            "content": "Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliations schedules for those non-GAAP measures can be found on the EOG's website. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chief Executive Officer; Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Jeff Leitzell, EVB, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor & Public Relations. Here's Ezra. Thanks, Ezra. EOG generated record financial results in the fourth quarter with adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion and free cash flow of $2 billion. Capital expenditures of $1.1 billion were right in line with our forecast while production volumes finished above target. For the full year, adjusted earnings were a record $5 billion or $8.61 per share. This yielded return on capital employed of 23%, while oil prices for the year averaged $68 per barrel. Perhaps most important than setting records is what drove our outperformance. 2021 illustrated EOG's success at driving down our cost structure. ROCE would have been 10% or better at oil prices as low as $44. Keep in mind that back in 2016, when the premium investment standard was introduced, the oil price required for 10% ROCE was in excess of $80 per barrel. The dramatic improvements will be made to the profitability of our business reflect the benefits of using the highest investment threshold in the industry. The bottom line financial impact of double premium is just beginning to show up. But like our original switch to premium, it will grow over the coming years. Our goal is to position the company to earn economic returns at the bottom of the cycle, less than $40 oil and generate returns that are better than the broader market on a full cycle basis. Free cash flow in 2021 was a record $5.5 billion, and we deployed this cash consistent with our long-standing free cash flow priorities. We doubled the regular dividend rate, which now stands at an annual $3 per share and represents a 2.7% yield at the current share price. We are confident in the sustainability of our high-return low cost business model to support a dividend that has never been cut or suspended in this more than 20-year history. We solidified our financial position, finishing the year with effectively 0 net debt. We were also able to address a dental cash return priorities. We paid 2 special dividends for a combined $3 per share. We also refreshed our buyback authorization, which now stands at $5 billion. We will look to utilize this on an opportunistic basis. In total, EOG returned $2.7 billion of cash to shareholders in 2021. This represents 28% of discretionary cash flow and 49% of free cash flow, putting EOG among E&P industry leaders for cash return in 2021. Looking ahead to 2022, our disciplined capital plan and regular dividend can be funded at $44 oil. At $80 oil, we expect to generate about $11 billion of cash flow from operations before working capital. The $4.5 billion capital plan represents about a 40%] reinvestment ratio, resulting in more than $6 billion in free cash flow. This, of course, is on an after-tax basis, as we expect to be a nearly full cash taxpayer in 2022 as we were last year. We are in an excellent position to continue to deliver on our free cash flow priorities in 2022. EOG declared a $0.75 regular dividend yesterday, which is our highest priority for returning cash to shareholders. The size of the regular dividend is evaluated every quarter. As the financial performance and cost structure of EOG continues to improve, we expect that will be reflected in continued growth of the dividend. Turning to our second priority. This period of high oil prices allows us to further bolster the balance sheet. To support our renewed $5 billion buyback authorization and prepare to take advantage of other countercyclical opportunities, we plan to build and carry a higher cash balance going forward. We expect there will be opportunities in the future to create significant shareholder value by deploying a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity at the right time. Finally, we also announced an additional cash return to shareholders yesterday with a $1 per share special dividend to be paid in March. Along with the regular dividend, EOG has already committed to return $2.3 billion of cash to shareholders in 2022. We are fully committed to continuing to deliver on all of our free cash flow priorities. Here's Billy. Yes. This is Tim. No, we have not announced any intention of paying off more bonds as they become due. We'll continue to evaluate that as we go forward, but we -- that did not figure into the dollar was a way of giving back meaningful amount of cash to the shareholders in this period. And as we said, that's a backward-looking thing, not a forward-looking thing."

            "name": "Ezra Yacob",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. 2021 was a record-setting year for EOG. We earned record net income of $4.7 billion, generated a record $5.5 billion of free cash flow, which funded record cash return of $2.7 billion to shareholders. We doubled our regular dividend rate and paid 2 special dividends, paying out about 30% of cash from operations. And we are continuing to deliver on our free cash flow priorities this year with an additional special dividend announced yesterday of $1 per share. The last time we set an earnings record was in 2014. We earned $5.32 per share while oil averaged $93. Last year, we shattered that record earning $7.09 per share with $68 oil. That's 50% higher earnings with a 27% lower oil price. The catalyst for that improvement was our shift to premium 6 years ago. Premium is our internal investment hurdle rate that uses low fixed commodity prices to calculate the returns that drive our capital allocation decisions, $40 and $2.50 natural gas for the life of the well. While our premium strategy ensures high well-level returns and quick payouts in any given year, the more significant and durable impact is to our full-cycle development costs. The benefit of making investment decisions using fixed low commodity prices has the enduring impact of steadily improving corporate level operating and cash margins over time. That impact is now directly observable on the face of our financial statements. And last year, we raised the bar again to double premium. Our hurdle rate increased from 30% to a minimum of 60% direct after-tax rate of return using the same low fixed prices of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. The switch promises to further improve financial performance in the years ahead and is what gives us great confidence in our ability to continue delivering shareholder value through commodity price cycles. We expect to look back on 2021 like we do on 2016 as the year we made a permanent increase to our return hurdle that drove another step change in the financial performance of EOG. We also delivered as we promised operationally in 2021 with production volumes, CapEx and operating costs in line or better than target set at the beginning of the year. We were able to successfully offset emerging inflationary pressures during the year to lower well costs by 7%. 2021 was also a big year for ESG performance. We reduced our methane emissions percentage and injury rates and increased water reuse. We announced our 2040 net-zero ambition and added our goal to eliminate routine flaring by 2025 to our existing near-term targets for greenhouse gas and methane emissions rates. We continue to develop creative solutions, leveraging existing technology to make progress on our path towards our net-zero ambition. There's growing recognition that oil and gas will have a role to play in the long-term energy solution. We know that to be part of that solution, we not only have to produce low-cost, high-return barrels, we also have to do it with one of the lowest environmental footprints. As we look into 2022, the global oil market is in a position to rebalance during the year. Our disciplined capital plan aims to increase long-term shareholder value through high-return reinvestment that optimizes both near-term and long-term free cash flow. The plan also funds exploration and infrastructure projects to improve the future cost structure of the business. With the improvements we made in the business last year, combined with a higher commodity price environment, EOG is positioned to once again generate significant free cash flow. We continue to follow through on our free cash flow priorities. Our stellar fourth quarter performance allowed us to further strengthen the balance sheet, and we are returning cash to shareholders with the $1 per share special dividend declared yesterday. Combined with our $3 per share regular dividend, we have already committed to return $2.3 billion of cash to shareholders in 2022. We remain firmly committed to our long-standing free cash flow and cash return priorities, and you can expect EOG to continue to deliver on them as the year unfolds. EOG has exited the downturn a much better company than when we entered it. Higher returns with the shift to double premium, a lower cost structure, more free cash flow, a smaller environmental footprint and a culture strengthened by the challenges we have overcome together. Our culture is the number one value driver of EOG's success. By remaining humble and intellectually honest, we sustained the cycle of constant improvement that drives our technology leadership. Of all the fundamentals that consistently create long-term value, none of them matter without the commitment, resiliency and execution from our employees. Now here's Tim to review our financial position. Thanks, Ken. In conclusion, I'd like to note the following important takeaways. First, investment decisions based on a low commodity price puts the emphasis on full cycle cost of development and demands efficient use of capital. While the benefits of such discipline are realized immediately, the larger impact builds over time. The seed to our stellar results in 2021 was the premium strategy established 6 years ago, and we have set the stage for the next step change in financial performance by instituting double premium last year. Second, we are confident EOG's innovative and technology-driven culture can offset inflationary pressures this year. Our disciplined capital plan is focused on high return reinvestment to continue improving our margins in not only 2022 but in future years as well. Third, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders. We demonstrated this through the return of nearly 50% of free cash flow last year, and this quarter's special dividend are third in less than a year. Doubling our regular dividend rate indicates our confidence in the durability of our future performance. The regular dividend is our preferred method to return cash to shareholders. And as we continue to increase the capital efficiency of EOG through low-cost operations and improved well performance, growth of the regular dividend will remain a priority. We truly believe the best is yet to come. Going forward as a company and an industry with a financial profile more competitive than ever with the broader market and a growing recognition of the value we bring to society, EOG has never been better positioned to generate significant long-term shareholder value. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A. Yes. Paul, this is Ezra. I'll answer the first question, and then I'll hand the second question over here to Billy to answer for you. With regards to our plan this year, as we've talked about, the way we're approaching our planning is not based on the oil price that we're seeing. We're really looking to see the broad market fundamentals that are underlying and supporting that oil price and other macroeconomic indicators. So when we look at our '22 plan, we think we've designed a very high-return capital program. It balances our free cash flow this year with increased free cash flow in future years. And it really starts with investing in the double premium wells. When we bring those low-cost reserves into the company's financials, it helps drive down the cost basis of the company and it continues to expand the margins. It's what allows us to continue delivering high corporate level returns as well as increase the cash flow potential of the company, and that further supports our free cash flow priorities. So the program this year is at a pace that allowed us to capture and incorporate technical learnings to continue to improve each of our assets. And that's the most important thing that we look to do every year, not only in 2022, but to go forward into future years as well. And I'll turn it over to Billy to answer the second part of the question. Yes. Doug, this is Ezra. Thanks for the question. Yes, our maintenance capital on the back of a 7% well cost reduction last year and then additional well improvement, combined with increasing the percentage of double premium wells. And what I mean by that is a lower cost of the reserves, bringing those into the company's financials. Our maintenance capital continues to decrease, which is fantastic for us. You're right, the $32 breakeven that we provided today is actually with our commensurate with the CapEx program that we have for this year. But the double premium wells, we can't stress enough. Not only is it -- does the impact show out on very rapid payout and a high rate of return, but really by bringing those lower-cost reserves and a lower decline into the base of the company, over time, it really does start to show up an impact the full cycle returns and free cash flow generation potential of the company in the future. Yes. So we didn't release a maintenance capital this earnings call due to the fact that we've started to allocate some additional capital into the Dorado play. And so it starts to get a little bit messy as you start going from oil into a BOE equivalent as we are starting to see the phenomenal results there with the Dorado play as we dedicate additional capital to it. Nevertheless, I think what we've outlined is with the 7% well cost reduction and slight improvements on the well mix year-over-year, we've continued to drive down that breakeven. And for the full cycle return, we have a slide in our deck that shows the one way that we like to present it is the price required for a 10% return on capital employed. And you can see we made a big step change last year as we drove that price down to $44. Yes. Doug, this is Ezra again. Just to reiterate our free cash flow priorities, first, the commitment begins with the sustainable dividend growth of our regular dividend. In '21, we doubled that regular dividend. And to us, that regular dividend is really indicative of what we're trying to accomplish. It reflects the continuing increase in the go-forward capital efficiency of the company. And it's also focused on creating through-the-cycle value and free cash flow, and that's ultimately what we're trying to do. Again, going back to what we were just talking about with the investment in the double premium wells and lowering the cost base of the company, trying to take at least a small step away from the inevitable commodity price cycles of our industry. The second free cash flow priority for us is a pristine balance sheet, which obviously provides tremendous competitive advantage in a cyclical industry. And then the third, what we're talking about right now is the additional cash return in the form of specials or opportunistic repurchases. And as we talked about, last year, we demonstrated the commitment with $2.7 billion in cash return through the form of $3 per share special dividends and are regular. And then we also retired that $750 million bond early in the year. In general, what we've talked about is we're going to use our -- reserve our repurchase opportunities to be more opportunistic than programmatic. So in times one way to think is that in times of rising share or oil price, you can expect us to prefer to do special dividends. And really, the way that we think about the share repurchase is, we measure it as an investment the same as we measure any investments across our business. So we want to make sure that it competes on a returns basis. And that's why we still prefer in an environment like this to stick with the special dividend as the priority for additional cash return. Yes. This is Ezra. We continue to evaluate our cash position with respect to dividends on a quarterly basis. And what I would say is that, you're correct, we're thrilled to be in the position where we are, where we can offer to the shareholders such a competitive regular base dividend that again, I think, is our number one priority as a way to create value through the cycles. But on top of that, we are in a great position to offer continued strength of our balance sheet to support that dividend and then continue to offer cash return -- additional cash return of excess free cash flow in the form of these specials and buybacks. We don't have a specific target that we do. We stay away from providing a formula because we want to be able to have the flexibility to do the right thing at the right time to really maximize the shareholder value in a way that is protected through the cycles. Said another way, I think we've demonstrated that over the past year. We've taken the opportunity to both strengthen the balance sheet last year. And again, last year pay out a significant amount, $2.7 billion in cash returns. And we've doubled down on that basically with this first quarter announcement with the $1.75 per share cash return this quarter. And essentially, that reflects the evaluation, the positive commodity price environment that we were experiencing in and the strength of the underlying business and our confidence in it going forward. Yes. We actually divested of our Marcellus position a couple of years ago that was in a dry gas part of the Marcellus acreage there in Pennsylvania. With respect to some of the other opportunities that we haven't really discussed publicly, that's really exploration, as you guys know. First and foremost, we're an exploration company. We're always striving to be a first mover and organically improve the quality of our inventory. So I will provide you a little bit of color on that. Domestically, we continue to explore across the U.S., our exploration program that we've talked about for the last year or so has been progressing. We finished last year drilling 12 wells across multiple opportunities, all dominantly oil-focused and we'll be slightly increasing that number this year to about 20 as we're encouraged with some of the results that we had last year. In general, though, like I said, we don't discuss the details of the exploration other than just to say that the opportunities are low-cost entry, they're oil focused, they're reservoirs that we think can exploit with our horizontal drilling and completions expertise. And this year, we look forward to doing some more delineation and appraisal drilling. And as we've said in the past, the goal of our exploration program is not just to find oil or find reserves. It's really to add to the quality of our inventory from a lower finding cost and higher returns perspective. And so it takes time to be able to evaluate that we can actually discover these opportunities and bring them into the mix where they're really going to help lower the cost base of the company and be a significant contributor to our portfolio going forward. Yes. Scott, in general, as we've talked about, the international opportunities have -- they have a higher hurdle to really be considered additive to the quality of our inventory simply because we need to have access to services there. We need to have access to contracts, and we need to find the subsurface geology that actually makes it, not just competitive, but really superior to much of what we're drilling here. In Australia, to start with that one, we still have that opportunity. We plan -- we're in the permitting phase currently, and we plan to initiate drilling in that one early next year. And then in Oman, we did announce, as you recall, we had a low cost of entry into Oman. It included a 2-well commitment. And during the second half of '21, we drilled those 2 exploratory wells, one of which was a short horizontal. We completed that horizontal, made a natural gas discovery there. But ultimately, as I was just saying the prospect, we decided is not going to compete with our existing portfolio. So we won't be moving forward with that project. In general, we do feel encouraged with the international opportunities out there because we see really kind of a lack of exploration competition out there. And we see that many times, national oil companies or ministries, the owners of those lands have really started to realize that they can't rely on traditional conventional term contracts to be able to get some unconventional type prospects drilled. And so we're seeing a little bit more flexibility on the negotiation side, which gives us some encouragement. Yes. In general, Scott, we didn't see that as one of the opportunities that we're looking for there in the fourth quarter. When we talk about the significant dislocation, we're talking about something more so than that. Like I said, we consider share repurchase in the same way that we do any investment decision. It's how does it create the most long-term shareholder value. And we're in a cyclical industry, and that's why we prefer to use it opportunistically with a significant opportunity. The challenge, of course, is we recognize that being in a position to execute during the market dislocation is a challenging thing to do. However, we feel with the strength of our balance sheet and the low cash operating cost that we have, we'll be well positioned when we see the opportunity. Yes. Leo, what I'd say is it's just really hard to predict, and I'd hate to commit to something to lead you down the wrong path. I might point to historically, we did some early drilling in the Powder River Basin, and it was a number of years before we felt comfortable We gotten that to a point where we want to talk about it publicly in a big way. And then the same with Dorado. I know there was a lot of speculation as to our Austin Chalk exploration program for a number of years. And as you can see, we waited until we had some long-term production and felt confident as to what we had there before we started really talking about it publicly. The current exploration program was definitely slowed down, even maybe a little bit more than we anticipated during the pandemic. It was just a little more difficult even to get leasing done and things of that nature. As we talked about in 2021, the plays coming out of the pandemic had really started to move it kind of various paces or various rates. Some of the wells last year that we drilled were the initial wells in these plays. In other prospects, some of the wells, we're really testing a little more delineation, repeatability, more appraisal. Because again, like I said, almost more than an exploration program, what we're trying to find is not just oil. That's not necessarily the most difficult thing anymore. It's really, as you guys can appreciate, trying to find low-cost barrels, barrels that are additive to what not only we have already discovered but what the industry has really discovered, what the world wants is access to lower-cost barrels, and that's what we're searching for. And so it takes a little bit longer to be able to really get the appraisal on these and make sure that these opportunities are really going to be additive, again, to the quality of our inventory. Yes. Neil, I'll add a bit of an overview, and then maybe I'll hand it off to Billy for some more details for you on the activity side. But in general, when we think about the growth forecasts that are out there and have been publicly discussed, we're probably a bit more on the lower end in general on the crude and condensate side. And the reason for that is I think you're seeing commitment from the North American E&P space to remain disciplined. And then you couple that with some of the inflationary and supply chain pressures. And we think the U.S. is definitely going to face some headwinds in growth on this year. And I think Billy can provide a bit more details on it. Yes. Neil, this is Ezra. In general, what I would say is the U.S. has discovered a very vast supply of natural gas, and it's important that we get that gas offshore and into the global market for some of the reasons that you talked about now, not only geopolitical, but just developing nations, so on and so forth. And that's one of the reasons where we're so glad to partner and continue to take out some of our LNG. For us, the way we think about the natural gas globally is really it's going to be a cost of supply. And we say that we want to be the low-cost producer, and that might sound like we're talking about oil dominantly, but that goes for gas as well. And it's one reason we're very excited about our Dorado prospect. We think it competes in North America is basically the lowest cost of supply, especially because of its geographic location, close to so many marketing centers, including the Gulf Coast. So we're very excited and very fortunate to have it. And I think the U.S. is going to continue to be, in the long term, a significant player in the global gas supply. Yes. We want to thank everyone for participating on the call this morning, and we want to thank our shareholders for their support. As we said, EOG had an outstanding performance in 2021, and we're poised for an up great year in 2022. And it really comes down to our employees. Our employees are the keys to our success, and it's why I'm convinced are to being one of the lowest cost, highest return and lowest emissions energy suppliers that can play a significant role in the long-term future of energy. Thank you."

Last year, our team, they continue to really delineate our core areas. They completed about 50 wells and half of those exceeded our double premium threshold. So we're really encouraged by that. On top of that, we also brought on multiple record wells in the basin, both in the Niobrara and the Mowry formations, all doing this while reducing our cost year-over-year by about 10%. So the one thing that we really look at with the Powder River Basin is it's a little bit more geologically complex compared to our other basins. So it's really important that we operate at the right pace, and we don't outrun our learnings. So looking forward kind of to 2022, we plan on maintaining a similar amount of activity and as our team there really high grades our acreage, refines our well spacing and strategically build out our infrastructure, we really expect the Powder River Basin asset to be able to increase activity in 2023 and beyond."

            "content": "Thanks, Billy. Last year, we replaced more than 2x what we produced and reduced our finding and development costs by 17%. Our permanent shift to premium drilling and focus on efficiencies driven by innovation and our unique culture ease to why our capital efficiency continues to improve, and our corporate finding costs and DD&A rate continue to decline. Our 2021 reserve replacement was 208% for a finding and development cost of just $5.81 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding revisions due to commodity price changes. Since 2014, prior to the last downturn and the implementation of our premium strategy, we have reduced finding and development costs by more than 55%. With our double premium standard and the high grading of our future development schedule, we grew our reserve base in 2021 by over 500 million barrels of oil equivalent for total booked reserves of over 3.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This represents a 16% increase in reserves year-over-year. In terms of future well locations, we added over 700 net double premium locations across multiple basins to our inventory in 2021, replacing the 410 drilled last year by 170%. Our double premium inventory is growing faster than we drill it, and the quality of the locations we are adding to the inventory is improving. Innovation continues to drive sustainable cost improvements and operational efficiencies. And when you combine that with our focus on developing higher quality rock, we further improve the median return of the portfolio. We don't need more inventory. We are focused on improving our inventory quality. With this in mind, our double premium inventory now accounts for 6,000 of the 11,500 total premium locations in our inventory, representing more than 11 years of drilling at the current pace. Now let me turn the call back to Ezra. Yes. Jeanine, thanks for the question. This is Ken. We added double premium locations over a number of our active premium plays, really in line with where we drilled our wells last year, mainly in the Permian and the Eagle Ford. And this is really just an example of our culture where we're working to get better, continuing to lower well costs while focusing on increasing the recovery is what leads to significant increases in returns and really allows us to convert wells to premium and double premium through time. And our goal is to always replace at least as many double premium locations as we drill every year."

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir.\nTim Driggers: Good morning and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release in EOG's SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures can be found on EOG's website. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chief Executive Officer, Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer, [Indiscernible] EVP Exploration and Production. [Indiscernible], EVP Exploration and Production. [Indiscernible], Senior VP Marketing, and [Indiscernible], VP Investor and Public Relations. Here's Ezra Yacob.\nEzra Yacob: Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG is delivering on our free cash flow priorities. Yesterday, we announced an 82% increase to our regular dividend to an annual rate of $3 per share, a $2 per share special dividend, and an update to our share buyback authorization to $5 billion. These cash return announcements reflect EOG's consistent outstanding performance and are the direct result of our disciplined approach to high return investment. During the third quarter, we set new quarterly earnings in cash flow records, adjusted Net Income of $1.3 billion or $2.16 per share and free cash flow of $1.4 billion. The strength of our current and future earnings in cash flow that supports both dividend announcements can be traced back to 2016. Amid a potentially prolonged low commodity price environment, we made a permanent upgrade to our investment criteria.  Our premium hurdle rate was established, not only to protect the Company's profitability in 2016, but all future commodity cycles. The discipline to only invest in new wells that earn a minimum 30% direct after-tax rate of return, assuming a $40 oil price for the life of the well continues to improve our capital efficiency, profitability, and cash flow. Our employees immediately embraced the challenge of this new investment hurdle. And by the second half of 2016, EOG was reinvesting capital and paying the dividend within cash flow. We've generated free cash flow every year since. From 2017 to 2019, we generated enough free cash flow to significantly reduce net debt by $2.2 billion, while also increasing the dividend rate 72%. We also expanded our inventory of premium wells by more than 3 times.  While adding inventory that meets the minimum premium threshold increases quantity, our goal through technical innovation and organic exploration is to add higher quality inventory. Our employees empowered by EOG 's unique culture, applied innovation and efficiencies to raise the return of much of the existing inventory, while adding higher rate of return wells through exploration. The premium standard established in 2016, and the momentum that followed provided a step change in operational and by extension, financial performance, which set the stage for the second upgrade to our reinvestment hurdle rate, Double premium. Double premium, which is a minimum return hurdle of 60% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil was initiated during the depth of last year's unprecedented down-cycle. That capital discipline enabled EOG to deliver extraordinary results in a $39 oil price environment last year. Using such stringent hurdle rates prepared the Company, not only for 2020, but for our stellar results this year.  There is no clear indication of the impact premium, and now double premium has had on our confidence in EOG's future profitability than the 82% increase to our regular dividend announced yesterday. Combined with the 10% increase made in February of this year, we have doubled our annual dividend rate from a $1.50 per share to $3 per share. After weathering 2 downturns during which we did not cut nor dispend the dividend -- suspend the dividend, the new annual rate of $3 per share reflects the significant improvement in the EOG's capital efficiency since the transition to premium drilling. Going forward, we are confident the double premium will continue to improve the financial performance just like premium did, 5 years ago. We're also confident in our ability to continue adding to our double premium inventory without any need for expensive M&A by improving our existing assets and adding new players from our deep pipeline of organic exploration prospects, Developing high return, low cost reserves that meet our stringent double-premium hurdle rate expands our future free cash flow potential and supports EOG's commitment to sustainably growing our regular dividend. EOG's focus on returns, disciplined growth, strong free cash flow generation, and sustainability remain constant. Just as our free cash flow priorities are consistent, so remains our broader strategy and culture. EOG's competitive advantage is our people.  And today's announcements are a reflection of our culture of innovation and execution. Looking towards 2022, oil market supply and demand fundamentals are improving, but remain dynamic. While it's unlikely the market will be fully balanced by the end of 2021, we will continue to monitor macro fundamentals as we plan for next year. We are committed to maintaining production until the oil market needs additional barrels. Under any scenario, we remain focused on driving sustainable efficiency improvements. We are well positioned to offset inflationary price pressures to help keep our well costs flat next year. To summarize this quarter's earnings release and 3 points. First, our fundamental strategy of investing in high return projects consistently executed year-after-year is delivering outstanding financial results.  Second, we're still getting better. As we continue to expand our opportunity set to add double-premium inventory through sustainable well cost reductions in our organic exploration, EOG is set up to improve performance even further. And third, we are well-positioned to execute our high return reinvestment program in 2022 to deliver another year of outstanding returns. Here's Tim to review our capital allocation strategy and our free cash flow priorities.\nTim Driggers: Thanks, Ezra. As we have been progressing premium the last 5 years, our capital allocation decisions have been guided by a set of long-standing consistent priorities. First, is high return disciplined reinvestment. Our returns on capital investment have never been higher. Our market fundamentals remain the number 1 determinant of when to grow. Second is a regular dividend, which we believe is the best way to return cash to shareholders. We paid a dividend for 22 years without suspending or cutting it. At the new level of $3 per year, we can comfortably form both the dividend and maintenance CapEx at $40 WTI. The combination of our low-cost structure, high returns, and strong financial position will sustain this higher regular dividend. This resilient financial position is backstopped by our third priority, a pristine Balance Sheet with almost 0 net debt. We remain firmly committed to a strong Balance Sheet. It's not conservatism, it's a competitive advantage.  Fourth, we regularly review other cash return options, specifically special dividends and share buybacks. Yesterday we declared a special dividend for the second time in 2021 and updated our share buybacks authorization. Share buybacks have always been part of our playbook and will remain an opportunistic cash return alternative. We are cognizant of the challenges of successfully executing a share buybacks in a cyclical industry. We now expect there will be periods in the future when the stock will be impacted by macro factors, such as the commodity cycle, geopolitical events, and other unforeseen events like the COVID pandemic in 2020. The updated $5 billion authorization provides the flexibility to act and take advantage when the right opportunity presents itself.  We believe our strategy for the use of other cash return options is well designed to deliver value through the cycle. Finally, we're not in the market for expensive M&A in a simply a low return proposition. We can create much more value through organic reinvestment and our shareholders can do better with their excess cash our premium strategy generates back in their hands. Since our shift to premium in 2016, EOG has generated nearly $10 billion of free cash flow. With that cash flow, EOG has reduced debt $1.5 billion. Increased the cash balance by $3.6 billion. And we'll return more than $5 billion to shareholders by the end of 2021, this is a significant amount of shareholder value driven by premium.  Today, EOG is positioned to translate that value creation into even more cash returns to shareholders. In the third quarter, we generated a record $1.4 billion of free cash flow, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $3.5 billion, which is equal to the total return of capital paid and committed this year to our regular dividend, to special dividends, and debt repayment. You can expect us to continue returning cash going forward. There might be times when we strategically increased or decreased the cash balance, but over time, the cash will go back to our shareholders. Here's Billy.\nBilly Helms: Thanks, Tim. As a result of the -- to the consistency of our operating performance, we delivered another quarter of outstanding results. I couldn't be more proud of the engagement of our employees and their culture of continuous improvement. Their execution of our 2021 plan has been near perfect. For the third quarter in a row, we produced more oil for less capital. That is, we exceeded our production targets while spending less than our forecast for capital expenditures. Well, productivity driven by our double premium hurdle rate continues to out perform while our drilling and completion teams pushed the [Indiscernible], on new sustainable cost savings and expand those efficiencies throughout our active operating areas. Examples include in-sourcing and re-designing drilling equipment, adopting innovative techniques to reduce nonproductive time, expanding super zipper completion operations, and reducing sand and water-sourcing cost.  Our ability to continue to lower cost and deliver reliable execution quarter after quarter is tied to common set of operating practices that together form a sustainable competitive advantage for EOG. First, we are a multiplay Company, with activities spread across 4 different basins in the U.S. As conditions change, we have the flexibility to shift capital between place to optimize returns. Second, we are organized under a decentralized structure. Decisions are made by discrete focused teams, closer to the operation, rather than dictated by headquarters. Our culture is non-bureaucratic and entrepreneurial. We empower our front line employees to make decisions, bringing them to drive innovation and efficiency improvement. Third, we have established strategic vendor relationships with our preferred service providers.  We are typically -- we're not typically the biggest beneficiary of price reductions during downturns. We also tend to not be on the leading edge of price increases during inflationary periods. Fourth, we have taken ownership of the value-added parts of the drilling, completions, and production supply chain by applying our operational expertise, proprietary technology to improve efficiency and lower cost. Examples include sand, water, chemicals, drilling fluids, completion design, drilling motors, the marketing of our products, and much more. As a result, our operating teams have complete ownership of driving improvements in every step. And finally, we apply a world-class information technology to every part of our operations. Our data-gathering and analysis capabilities improve -- continue to improve, which we leveraged to better manage day-to-day field operations for more efficient use of resources, as well as discovering new innovations. As a result of these strategic advantages, we are confident in achieving our target of 7% well cost savings this year.  This is an incredible accomplishment given the state of inflation. As we move into next year, we're on track to lock in 50% of our total well cost by the end of this year. We have locked in 90% plus of our drilling rigs at rates that are flat to lower than 2020 and 2021. We've also secured more than 50% of our completion crews at favorable rates. While it is still early, the savings from these initiatives and other improvement efforts will continue to be realized next year, helping us offset the risk of additional inflation. And thus we remain confident that we will be able to keep well cost at least flat in 2022. Now, here's Kent.\nKen Boedeker: Thanks, Billy. Last month we published our 2020 sustainability report. As detailed in this report, we are focused on reducing emissions in the field. Our flaring intensity rate decreased 43% in 2020 compared to 2019, which drove an overall 9% reduction in greenhouse gas intensity. We continue to make progress toward our goal of zero routine flaring across all our operations by 2025, with our more immediate goal of 99.8% wellhead gas capture this year. We also made significant progress on methane last year, reducing our methane emissions percentage by 1/3 to less than 1/10 of 1% of our natural gas production. Since 2017, we've reduced our methane emission intensity percentage by 80%. Our sustainability report profiles that technology and innovation that contributed to these improvements and illustrates why we are optimistic about future performance on our path to net-zero by 2040. Examples of how we are addressing emissions in the field include closed loop gas capture, which helps us continue to reduce flaring.  We're leveraging information technology and our extensive data analysis capabilities from both mobile platforms and our central control rooms to better manage day-to-day operations. In addition, we're piloting technology in the field, such as sensors and control devices that complement our already robust leak detection program. These are just a few examples of the initiatives we have underway. Like all efforts to the EOG, our sustainability strides are bottom-up driven. Creative ideas to improve our ESG performance come from employees working in our operating areas every day. We have a long list of solutions we expect to pilot and profile in the future. Our record of significantly reducing our GHG intensity over the last several years speaks for itself, and we're committed to continuing to improve our emissions performance. Now here's Ezra, to wrap things up.\nEzra Yacob: Thank you, Ken. Our record-breaking operational and financial results throughout this year, and the cash returned announcements we made yesterday deserved to grab some headlines. However, the real story behind our performance is consistency of strategy supported by our unique culture. At the start of the call, I said there is no clear indication of the impact premium and now double premium has had on our confidence in EOG's future profitability than the annual $3 per share regular dividend. And while establishing the premium standard back in 2016 shifted us into a different year, culminating in the magnitude of our cash return this year. Our fundamental strategy executed year-after-year by employees united by unique culture dates back to the founding of the Company. That's ultimately what gives me confidence that EOG's best days are ahead.  We are a return-focused organic exploration Company that leverages technology and innovation to always get better. Decentralized, non-bureaucratic. Every employee is a business person first focused on creating value in the field at the asset level. Our financial strategy has always been and remains conservative, not just to offset the inherent risks in a cyclical business, but to take advantage of them. We're committed to the regular dividend and believe it is the best way to create consistent and dependable long-term value for shareholders. We have a proven track record that our strategy works and going forward, investors can expect more of the same consistent execution year after year. Thanks for listening. We'll now go to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]. Questions are limited to 1 question and 1 follow-up question. We will take as many questions as time permits. [Operator Instructions]. If you find your question has been answered, you may remove yourself by [Operator Instructions]. We'll pause for a moment to give everyone an opportunity signal for questions. Our first question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning. 2 questions, please. First, you have the authorization for the buyback, but quite frankly, I don't recall EOG ever done any buyback for the past 20 years. So can you talk about what is the condition or criteria to -- for you to actually act on it? And in theory, if you're going to buy it when the market is suffering the downturn, does that mean that you should have a really strong bond in circling into the downturn maybe at a net cash position, so -- in order for you to be able to afford it. My last [Indiscernible] saying that at the top the pandemic, your share pie as really attractive, but I'm not sure that you have the [Indiscernible] or that the will to do the buybacks at that point. That's the first question.  The second question is on the hedging, you have been quite aggressive, putting in a lot of natural gas hedges. Curious that with your low break-even requirement and very strong Balance Sheet, why put on hedges so aggressively onto some degree even though you have a physical barrel of [Indiscernible] that to support you. But is that the fundamental basic you said you could become a speculation on the direction of the commodity prices. When you're doing it that way? Thank you.\nEzra Yacob: Yes this is Ezra. Paul, thanks for the question. Let me start by outlining a little bit on the buyback and then I'll hand it to Tim Driggers for a little more detail on it. You're right, we're buyback authorization. We've had one previously and we haven't exercise that, in quite some time. What we've done right now as we've refreshed it to a size that's a little more commensurate with the scale of our Company today. And we plan to exercise the buybacks in more of an opportunistic way, rather than something problematic is how we expect to be able to use it and I'm going to ask Tim to provide you a little more details on exercising it.\nTim Driggers: Sure. Turn my microphone, I'm sorry. First of all, we will evaluate buybacks like any other investment decision, how does it creates long-term shareholder value? So that will be the first thing we'll have to look at every time we make this decision. Specifically to answer your question about could we have started during the pandemic but didn't have the financial wherewithal to do that, you're exactly right. At that point in time, oil was negative, the price oil was negative and we had two bonds coming to -- totaling $1 billion. So had we been in the shape we're in today, that would've been a perfect time to buy shares. But we weren't in that same position we are today. That's how -- that's why continuing to work on the balance sheet and positioning ourselves for the future has been so important to EOG. So we should not ever have that situation again. We have positioned the Company to be able to opportunistically take advantage of these situations.\nEzra Yacob: And following on the second question regarding our hedges, specifically gas, but really in general, our hedging strategy hasn't changed at all. As you know, we invest on a very, very stringent hurdle rate, our premium and now double-premium rate. That's based on a $40 oil price, but it's also based on a $2.50 natural gas price for the life of the well. And so when we can opportunistically look to lock in some hedges north of $3, we feel very good about the returns that we're generating going forward on the gas price. In general, we like to have a bit of hedges put on whether oil or gas, just give us a little bit of line of sight into our budgeting process as we enter into a new year. And so really that's the commentary on both the gas and the oil hedges.\nOperator: The next question will come from Arun Jayaram. Please go ahead.\nArun Jayaram: Good morning. Ezra, the 2021 cash return to equity holders as tally just under 30% of CFO, if you add in debt, it's around 36% of your CFO. I know there's no formal framework in place, but how should investors be thinking about cash returns on a go-forward basis and could this 30% be viewed at some sort of the benchmark?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Arun. This is Ezra. No, I wanted to -- I would not take that as any type of benchmark. I think we've been very clear for the last couple of years in talking about our framework for cash return, really just our free cash flow priorities. The emphasis -- the priority really is on a sustainable growing regular dividend. We think that's the hallmark. It's forward-looking and that's the hallmark of a very strong Company. Hopefully, it sends a signal to everybody the -- of our confidence in the growing capital efficiency of our Company. Obviously, we've talked about some low cost property bolt-on acquisitions. We've highlighted those on the last call and in the slide deck today. we've obviously covered a very strong, not just strong, but really a pristine Balance Sheet.  And then to the last part of -- really the other part of your question is our other cash returns options for excess-free cash flow, which is the special dividend, and then as Tim was just mentioning, some of the share repurchases. And as we've said, we're very committed to returning excess-free cash flow. We have stayed away from a specific formula because, we'd like to be able to -- we try not to run the Company on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We tried to take a longer view of things. We realized that there are times when potentially the cash on hand may need to move up or down. But regardless of it over the long term, I think we've demonstrated, especially this year, that we're very committed to returning that excess free cash flow.\nArun Jayaram: Great. And my follow-up, with the dividend increase to $3 on an annualized basis, as well that will represent just over $1.75 billion in annual outlays to equity holders for the dividend, how should investors be thinking about future growth? Does this temper how we should think about longer-term production growth given the higher mix of dividend payments?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Arun. The step-up this year in the regular dividend is really a reflection of what we've been doing for the last 5 years in reinvesting this -- in the premium wells. We've been seeing it slowly but surely show up in our financial performance as we've lowered the cost basis of the Company. And the confidence going forward really is what we're seeing with our change in focus over the past 18 months to these double -premium wells. We feel that it's providing another step change in operational performance that should filter through to a step change in financial performance as we've witnessed with that change to premium. And then our inventory, of course, is spread across multiple basins. We have 5,800 of these double -premium locations and over 11,000 of the premium locations, and we're adding to that every day.  Our employees are working through either low -- identifying low cost bolt-on acquisition opportunities, sustainable well-cost reductions, as we've highlighted this quarter's stronger well productivity, and then, of course, our low - cost entry into organic exploration opportunities to further expand both the quantity and the quality of that inventory. So I think as we continue moving forward and sticking to our game plan of investing in double premium, it has the potential to continue to expand the free cash flow potential of EOG and thereby continue to provide an opportunity for us to remain committed to sustainably growing our dividend.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJeanine Wai: Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. Our first question is on the special dividend. In terms of the timing and the process for that, when you looked at the potential to announce one, what did you see this time around that perhaps you didn't see last quarter when you decided to forego a special dividend?\nTim Driggers: Jeanine, this is Tim, so as already been stated, we are committed to our free cash flow parties and that has not changed. So we look at all the factors every quarter to determine when is the right time to do either special dividend, or nail the share buybacks, or increase the regular dividend. So when we looked at our cash balance at September 30, was sitting at $4.3 billion. That gives us -- that leaves us well-positioned to pay off our bond in 2023 and provide this $2 special dividend. So it's a combination of all those factors and we felt this was a meaningful amount of cash to return at this time.\nJeanine Wai: Okay, great. And then my second question, maybe following up on Arun 's question on the base dividend. The large increase in the base, it seems like it's a catch-up to close the gap between what the business can support given the premium and double premium wells like you just said, and what was actually getting paid out. So I guess in terms of the timing also on the base, we're just curious how much of a factor the potential that you now see in your exploration plays factored into the decision to increase the base.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Jeanine, this is Ezra again. It's not just the exploration plays, it's really just our confidence and being able to expand the overall inventory, the quality of the inventory into that double premium. And some of it comes from the announcements that you saw on this quarterly on the quarter results, the stronger well productivity supporting better than guidance volumes, the better than guidance capex driven by sustainable well cost reductions. When I think about that, I think about our existing inventory increasing in performance and quality. And then I think about converting some of our premium wells into double premium status. And then of course we have identified small bolt-on acquisitions where we can continue to grow and expand that inventory level for us. And then as you highlighted, we've got the organic exploration mix.  We're drilling 15 wells this year that we've talked about that are not in the publicly disclosed place. Those places are at various states of either initial drilling, collecting of data, or evaluating as we've talked about on other calls, repeatability production performance of those plays. And so we're very excited and confident in our ability to continue to expand. And as I said increased the quality of our double premium inventory. And ultimately that's what gives us the confidence to be able to see that we can continue to lower the cost base of the Company, increased the capital efficiency of EOG, and continue to support a sustainably growing base dividend, which is our commitment.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: Yes. Good morning. In your deck, you mentioned a carbon capture pilot project, which is interesting. Ezra, can you speak to your early ambitions in carbon capture? Are you looking strictly at the [Indiscernible] are you investigating pure storage? And what level of resources having committed internally to the initiative?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Scott. I appreciate the question. I'm going to ask Ken Boedeker to address it.\nKen Boedeker: Yes, Scott. We're continuing to make good progress on that initial carbon capture project that we've talked about. We've finalized many of the below-ground geologic studies and we're currently working on the engineering and regulatory portions of the project. As we work our way through these steps, we'll get more clarity on timing. But right now we hope to initiate CO2 injection in late 2022. In terms of capital that we're allocating towards it, it's roughly 2% to 3% of our budget is going to be allocated towards all of our ESG projects, is what we see.\nScott Gruber: Ken, and as you investigate the opportunity, how are you thinking about participating in the value chain, would you be interested in entering transports? Obviously, it's an exciting opportunity, but it gets more capital intensive where you kind of broaden participation. Just how are you thinking about the broader opportunity in participating across the value chain?\nKen Boedeker: Scott, we're really not going to change the business that we're in. We're looking at carbon capture right now to significantly reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions at this point. That business is a much lower return business than what we see with our development that we have. So we'll keep an eye on that but our real goal for carbon capture is just reducing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions which we've made significant progress on in the last several years.\nOperator: Our next question will come from [Indiscernible] with KeyBanc, please go ahead.\nLeo Mariani: Hey, guys. Just looking at the guidance here for fourth quarter, we can certainly see some pretty significant growth on U.S. gas. Obviously, looking at gas prices right now, we're at multi-year highs at this point in time. Should we see that as a bit of a signal that EOG is perhaps flexing up a little bit on the natural gas side to try to capture what it probably some fantastic returns at the current prices here.\nBilly Helms: Yes, Leo. This is Billy Helms. So on the capex side, certainly part of our program as we laid out earlier this year, was just advanced some of Dorado prospect in South Texas, as you know, it's a very competitive gas play with rest of the place in the U.S. And we've been very pleased with the results here. But we may -- we remain disciplined to only completes the 15 wells we targeted and laid out at the start of this year. It's really a little bit early to be talking about what we're going to look like next year. But obviously with the results we're seeing, we're very pleased with the results being -- meeting or exceeding the top curves we have laid out, that certainly gives us an option to look at increasing activity there.\nBilly Helms: It's a little bit early yet to be saying what we're going to do next year, but we're very pleased with what we're seeing.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. That's helpful. And obviously in your prepared comments, you still spoke about the fact that probably be challenging to meet all the necessary conditions at year-end '21 that you all have laid out to put any type of real oil growth back in the market at this point in time. But I guess we -- I've certainly heard some rumblings lately that perhaps we might already be in pre -pandemic demand levels here as we work our way into November. I think OPEC+ has a plan to reduce its spare capacity pretty dramatically by mid '22. Just wanted to get a sense if you think perhaps in the mid to second half part of '22, there's a good shot at hitting the conditions that EOG laid out to potentially put a little growth back in the market.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Leo. This is Ezra. As Billy said, typically we don't provide guidance for the following year on this call but in general, our focus on 2022, the potential for that and us, as you highlighted, the things that we're looking at, we're focused on remaining disciplined and that hasn't changed. As we look into 2022, they are the 3 items that you've referenced that should signal a bit of a balanced market. First is demand, which has probably surprised to the upside a bit with just how quickly we've approached pre-COVID levels. The second is going to be the inventory numbers, which for us we'd like to see at or below the 5-year average, which they're currently there right now. But that brings up that third item that you spoke to, which is the spare capacity. And we'd like to see that spare capacity back to low levels more in line with historic trends. So as we sit here today, 2022 is looking like a year of transition. Spare capacity is going to come back online at this scheduled rates. That should translate into rising inventory levels and if things move forward, we could be looking at a balanced market sometime in the first half of '22. For us, for EOG in a scenario like that, we could probably return to maybe, our pre \u2013 Covid levels of oil production around that 465,000 barrel a day mark. That would represent no more than 5% growth next year. But again, that's as we are sitting here today, we will be officially firming up that 2022 plan or watching how the market develops over the next couple of months.  But as we're witnessing, bringing spare capacity back online has hit some snags as we're watching to see if that more routine startup challenges or is that more structural in nature due to under investment and those 2 factors are going to be just as important as seen, how the continued demand recovery COVID really develops with any potential future lock down, so on and so forth. So ultimately, we continue to remain to be disciplined going forward.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Charles Meade with [Indiscernible], please go ahead.\nCharles Meade: Morning, Ezra, to you and the whole EOG team there. You actually anticipated a large part of my question with your answer to the last one. But maybe just to dial in on it a little more closely, how far out do you think your view holds or your ability to look at the balance or unbalance in the oil market? And then once you did see a call to increase your oil activity, how long would it be before we actually saw it in the public markets in your quarterly financials?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Charles. Thanks for the question. I'll answer the first part of it and then ask Billy to provide a little bit more color also. How far out we can see the balance or the imbalance? To be perfectly honest, we're watching a lot of the same things that all of you are. Those 3 things that we highlighted. Demand has recovered pretty aggressively, I would say. I think it's surprised everybody. And then the inventory numbers in concert with the spare capacity coming back online. And the spare capacity again, if you simply look at the schedules that have been laid out and everybody sticks to the schedules and the supply actually comes back online. That would contemplate sometime in the front half of the year. But as I highlighted, and everyone has been seeing, there are some challenges or hurdles to getting all that spare capacity back online. As far as the -- the color on what we would be looking at, perhaps Billy can speak to it.\nBilly Helms: Yeah, Charles. For as far as how long it would take before we would see any response basically showing up in our financials. If you just simply look at, when we see the signal and the time we deploy rigs and get the wells completed, non-production takes usually 3 to 4 months. So you'd start seeing it no earlier than that, but probably sometime a quarter or 2 after. So to have a meaningful difference in financial performance.\nCharles Meade: Got it. So, if I'm understanding you correctly, it's -- it would be 2 quarters, maybe you start to see it nearly 3 quarters before there was a real Delta.\nBilly Helms: That's correct.\nCharles Meade: Great. And then just one quick follow-up for Tim. And I think you partly address this in your earlier comments. In the past, I recall you guys have talked about a target of $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. With this new $5 billion share authorization in a slightly different posture about wanting to have some dry powder, does that mean that your target for $2 billion in cash, and I recognize you're not always going to be at the target, but does that mean that the target has gone north of that? And if so, has it gone to 3 or 4 or what's your thinking?\nTim Driggers: No, we haven't changed our target. We will continue to monitor that through the cycle and see there's all sorts of factors we have to take into consideration for the cash balance. As you know, working capital changes, for example, as prices swing up and down, so that's a big consideration. But no, it has not changed -- the authorization has not changed our philosophy on the cash balance.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning, all. I don't want to belabor this just on the growth and reinvestment. But Ezra just want to make sure I'm clear on this, you guys have been quite clear about returns. I just want to make sure that I'm certain around the priority about the moderating reinvestment rate in order to drive the cash returns. Is that what I'm hearing over growth?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Neil. When we think about moving forward, we've done a lot on reinvesting in building this Company to take a bit of a step away from the commodity price cycles by focusing in on the premium wells and now double premium strategy. The growth for us has always been an output of our ability to reinvest at high rates of return, through 2017 to 2019 during a period of rapid growth for the industry. In fact, we're reinvesting only at a rate of about 78% and still generating free cash flow every year, and putting that towards an aggressively growing base dividend. So the strategy for us hasn't really changed. I think we've talked about potentially watching the macro environment a little bit more to help formulate our plans year-to-year. And that's where it falls in line with what we've been discussing over the last couple of questions. We still remain very committed to that. We don't want to push barrels into a market that's oversupplied or doesn't need the barrels. And so we'll be looking for the right time to see if the market needs our barrels before contemplating any return to growth.\nNeal Dingmann: Very good, very clear. And then follow up on -- that earlier about you. It looks like you all had been added a little bit of gas hedges. Is that in relation to -- does that mean that you're you've been increasing the focus on the Dorado play given what natural gas prices are doing, so I guess I'm just wondering, is that are the 2 correlated or are you adding to that activity in the Dorado?\nBilly Helms: Yeah. Neil, this is Billy Helms. As far as the volume of gas hedges and then what we've been doing there, really it's not focused strictly on Dorado, it simply goes back to our premium strategy that as we just laid out, it's based on a $40 oil and a $2.50 gas price. We saw the opportunity to lock in gas prices is above $3. So it gave us encouragement of locking in returns over the next several years at those prices. We have gas production quite a bit as you know in Dorado, but also quite a bit in other places as well. So it just helps ensure locking in returns over a multi-year period.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Scott Hanold with RBC. Please go ahead.\nScott Hanold: Yes. Thanks. I'm going to try, Ezra, I know you'll probably give me the answer that you'll talk about the budget next year. But if I could talk about a more big picture, if we all think of just a base maintenance spending levels into 2022. Would -- has the capital changed too much from what you all did this year? Like what would be the puts and takes from that? Because it seems like your well-cost, you're going hold pretty steadily. So is your maintenance capex case this year somewhat similar to what it would be next year all else being equal or are there anything else to consider?\nEzra Yacob: Yeah, Scott. This is Ezra and we'll talk about next year's budget, next year. So that a little bit facetiously for you, but quite frankly, I think we haven't updated our maintenance capital number yet. We'll provide that number commensurate with our plans laid out next year. But I think what you can see is that our team continues to make great progress and sustainable well cost reductions through their efficiency gains on applying innovation and technology. And I think Billy highlighted pretty well that we feel very confident that we achieved our first initial goal, I should say 5% well cost reduction and were in line to reduce our cost 7% this year. And we feel that a lot of those costs are what's going to insulate us against some of the inflationary pressures out there.\nScott Hanold: And how about just on -- was there anything unusual you'd say this year that we should think about next year in terms of exploration play or ESG spending? Is that -- is there any reason for us to think about that any differently?\nEzra Yacob: No, Scott. Really over the last few years, a lot of our percentage dedicated towards exploration and ESG have been pretty consistent.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDoug Leggate: Good morning, everybody. Ezra, I think your share price reaction today, I think, you can see the market's response to be greater cash returns. I'm wondering, why is it reluctant, seemingly still from EOG to provide a framework around the proportion of cash returns. It seems to be a persistent body or perhaps the recognition of sustainable free cash flow, which at the end of the day is what defines the value. I'm just wondering why there is reluctance not to commit to at least lay out framework as to how you think about the go-forward cash returns as opposed to one of those special dividend?\nEzra Yacob: Yes. Doug, It's a question that we've been answering and we feel that we have provided a framework for our free cash flow priorities. It's as you mentioned, the sustainable growing base dividend to strengthen the Balance Sheet, these low-cost property acquisitions, and then more on point with your question, the other cash returns options which are special dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. And in a lot of ways, when we look back, I think we've shown our commitment to that. Not only this year with committing to $2.7 billion return in dividends over a year-to-date free cash flow generation of about 3.5 billion.  But I think we added a slide into the deck that shows longer-term what we've been able to do in providing just over $5 billion of free cash flow returns since 2016 on about $10.9 billion of free cash flow were generated. And so I think we've laid out a framework, I think our 2 announcements this year on special dividends totaling $3 per share on the specials, really demonstrates our commitment to it and as far as having the ability for our investors to see through and capitalize on that number. I think we've demonstrated our commitment to the point where the investors can capitalize on some of our excess free cash flow. To us, we still remain committed to delivering on those free cash flow priorities. We do want to continue to make decisions based on what we think will create the most significant long-term shareholder value. And that means sometimes not necessarily running the business on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but really taking a longer-term approach. And so locking ourselves into a formula that might have to change as conditions change, is really at the heart of our reluctance to do that.\nDoug Leggate: I understand that. I guess, it's a moving piece. Maybe my follow-up is related then. I want to talk specifically about the buybacks. There's been a lot of reference to the '16, '19 period. And you know the history; it was a subsidized environment. You doubled production. Saudi was taking oil off the market, and we will see how that ended. We know what the response to the industry has been, but I want to get specifically to your view of mid-cycle and how you think then about the relative priorities around mid-cycle. What is your definition of mid-cycle? And how should we think about growth versus growth per share, given the buyback commencement?\nEzra Yacob: Well, Doug, I don't think I'm comfortable getting into mid-cycle metrics on here. But what I would tell you is we continue to think of this buyback as opportunistic. We think, again, with our authorization in place, we want to use it in a way that we feel confident we're going to be generating long-term shareholder value. More often than not for us, that's going to tend towards special dividends. And we're going to reserve our buyback authorizations to be used really just in times of dislocations and use it opportunistically rather than a more programmatic method.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research, please go ahead.\nBob Brackett: Good morning. It looks like you turned a couple of pads on in Dorado in the third quarter. Any color or commentary there; hitting expectations, exceeding?\nKen Boedeker: Yeah. Bob, this is Ken. As Billy said earlier, we have turned on several wells in the last few months and the color is all of them are at or above our type curve and what our plans were, going into the year. We do have one-drilling rig act even in the play right now and we're really moving rapidly up the learning curve. Again, just to reiterate, this play has really double premium returns and it's competitive for capital with our oil plays.\nBob Brackett: Great. Thanks for that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, Tim. Ezra, every new CEO has an opportunity to put their own thumbprint on the business and recognize that you're part of the prior leadership team as well, but just talk about your early observations as the new leader of the organization. Any subtle changes that you're making and talking about your messages to your internal and external stakeholders that you want the market to be aware of?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Neil, appreciate the question and the opportunity. I think the bigger thing for our investors, our employees, everyone who is listening to the call is that EOG has got a proven track record. Our strategy works the shift to premium strategy has put us on a different trajectory and the shift to double premium is going to as well. The culture of EOG, the people that EOG has always been our competitive advantage, and that will continue to be that way. Honestly, Neil, the most important thing we can do as a leadership team, is put our employees in a position to succeed, where they can really contribute to the best of their abilities. And that's where we try to do every day and that's going to translate into not only our operational performance, that would you see the results of this quarter, but to our financial performance as well.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Ezra and the follow-up is I appreciated the slide that shows the breakdown of the well costs in how you guys are ahead of your competition in terms of managing and medicating some of these inflationary pressures. As you step back and think about the U.S. oil industry broadly, do you think this is ultimately going to be a challenge, these inflationary pressures, to restart the shale machine? And which of these bottlenecks or do you worry about the most in terms of being a constraint on the ability for the industry to grow again?\nBilly Helms: Yeah, Neil, this is Billy Helms. Certainly as industry is seeing, we're seeing quite a bit of an inflationary pressure mainly in three areas that would say steel process. So tubulars, labor which is certainly affects all industries. And then fuel, those are probably the three inflationary pressures that are throughout our industry and really throughout the all industries. The one thing that I think is going to be, or maybe two things, two top priorities would be probably steel. I think availability of tubulars is something that I think most companies are struggling with or dealing with, I guess. And then, the other one would be labor and just getting enough people to manage the activity levels. Just to maybe give you a little bit color then on where EOG sits. Each year we try to get ahead of the curve and lock in a certain amount of our services to secure activity. But in this case, also protect us from inflation.  For instance, in 2021 we protected about a 65% of our well costs going into the year. As a result of that, plus the improving efficiencies, we're able to reduce our average well costs by about 7%, as that stated earlier. During the year though, we also took advantage and renegotiated many of our services at lower rates and locked in through and through the end of next year. So going into 2022, we expect to have about 50% of our well cost secured and with over 90% of our drilling rigs secured at lower rates and also 50% of our frac fleets secured. We expect to see inflation certainly in arms of such as steel, labor, and fuel just like everybody else. But by doing that, we've given ourselves visibility into areas of also improving efficiencies that we expect to offset much of this inflation. So we're still confident, we can keep well cost. At least flat going into next year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Scialla with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMichael Scialla: Hi. Good morning. It's a high level question. Ezra, on your long-term outlook, as you think about the energy transition, how are you thinking about oil versus natural gas? Is there any preference there in or any of the exploration plays focused on gas or they all on oil?\nEzra Yacob: Yes. Thank you, Michael. Long term, we believe the hydrocarbons are going to have a -- be a significant part of the energy solution long term. Obviously, we need to do as an industry a better job with our emissions profile. But when you think about oil and natural gas, they both go to different markets dominantly, your natural gas essentially is more on your power side and potentially in direct competition with things such as coal and your renewables. And then your oil transportation. Your oil obviously is a little more focused on transportation. In general when I think longer-term, I think the energy transition is going to be significantly slower than often times you hear about. And we're very bullish on the prospects for both. As far as the exploration plays goes as we've said in the past, dominantly the exploration plays are all oil-focused.\nMichael Scialla: Okay, thanks for that. Ken, you had said on your CO2 pilot -- excuse me, your CCS pilot. I think you said you plan to inject in late '22, that seems to suggest you would not need a Class six permits. I'm wondering, is it fair to say you're reinjecting CO2 into an EOR project? And when you say it's not really economically competitive with your upstream business, are you planning on capturing 45 tax credits with any of your projects?\nKen Boedeker: Michael, this is Ken. To answer your question on the tax credit side, we are planning on capturing was 45Q tax credits. Our goal in terms of foot class or permit that we would secure. We believe that we will initially secure a class 2 permit that can be converted, will go through all of the regulatory requirements to be able to convert it to a class 6 later in its life. But that's what the plan is for our CCS project at this point.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Paul Sankey of Sankey Research. Please go ahead.\nPaul Sankey: Hi, guys. Just very quickly on -- can you talk about your LNG or what downstream natural gas strategy? Thanks.\nBilly Helms: Hey, good morning. This is Helms.\nPaul Sankey: Hey.\nBilly Helms: Thanks for your question. And good morning. We're -- the team is definitely executing. You've seen several of our slides that we've put back, talking a lot about our transportation position is so incredibly valuable. We can move gas from all our different basins, from the Permian Basin, from the Eagle Ford, we talked a lot about Dorado earlier. And then with that and it gets access as you look along the Golf Course and you look at the LNG demand, especially that's growing over time. Obviously, you know, we've got a position there that we started. And just really speaks to being a first mover, especially, when you think about LNG. We went through a whole BD effort, kind of 17 and 18, we got the contracts finalized in 2020. And in 2021, obviously, we're definitely seeing the value of that contract. So being a first-mover is absolutely important. And yes, we're going to continue to look at new opportunities from an LNG standpoint, very well-positioned. Again, it gets back to our transport, our export capacities, and just having that ability to transact, we can definitely be very nimble as we even think about new opportunities.\nPaul Sankey: Got it. And then a follow-up on the buybacks. I'm not clear. Are you saying that it's a shelf ability to buybacks shares when you want? Or are you actually going to try and get through this amount in the next 12 months?\nTim Driggers: Hi, Paul. This is Tim. We do not have a timeline on when we plan to buy back the $5 billion. When the opportunity presents itself, we will be in the market.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Yacob for any closing remark.\nEzra Yacob: We just want to thank each of you for participating in our call this morning and thank our shareholders for their support. As I highlighted at the start of the call, EOG's competitive advantage is our employees and they deserve all the credit for delivering another outstanding quarter. So thank you and enjoy the weekend.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ezra Yacob",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG is delivering on our free cash flow priorities. Yesterday, we announced an 82% increase to our regular dividend to an annual rate of $3 per share, a $2 per share special dividend, and an update to our share buyback authorization to $5 billion. These cash return announcements reflect EOG's consistent outstanding performance and are the direct result of our disciplined approach to high return investment. During the third quarter, we set new quarterly earnings in cash flow records, adjusted Net Income of $1.3 billion or $2.16 per share and free cash flow of $1.4 billion. The strength of our current and future earnings in cash flow that supports both dividend announcements can be traced back to 2016. Amid a potentially prolonged low commodity price environment, we made a permanent upgrade to our investment criteria.  Our premium hurdle rate was established, not only to protect the Company's profitability in 2016, but all future commodity cycles. The discipline to only invest in new wells that earn a minimum 30% direct after-tax rate of return, assuming a $40 oil price for the life of the well continues to improve our capital efficiency, profitability, and cash flow. Our employees immediately embraced the challenge of this new investment hurdle. And by the second half of 2016, EOG was reinvesting capital and paying the dividend within cash flow. We've generated free cash flow every year since. From 2017 to 2019, we generated enough free cash flow to significantly reduce net debt by $2.2 billion, while also increasing the dividend rate 72%. We also expanded our inventory of premium wells by more than 3 times.  While adding inventory that meets the minimum premium threshold increases quantity, our goal through technical innovation and organic exploration is to add higher quality inventory. Our employees empowered by EOG 's unique culture, applied innovation and efficiencies to raise the return of much of the existing inventory, while adding higher rate of return wells through exploration. The premium standard established in 2016, and the momentum that followed provided a step change in operational and by extension, financial performance, which set the stage for the second upgrade to our reinvestment hurdle rate, Double premium. Double premium, which is a minimum return hurdle of 60% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil was initiated during the depth of last year's unprecedented down-cycle. That capital discipline enabled EOG to deliver extraordinary results in a $39 oil price environment last year. Using such stringent hurdle rates prepared the Company, not only for 2020, but for our stellar results this year.  There is no clear indication of the impact premium, and now double premium has had on our confidence in EOG's future profitability than the 82% increase to our regular dividend announced yesterday. Combined with the 10% increase made in February of this year, we have doubled our annual dividend rate from a $1.50 per share to $3 per share. After weathering 2 downturns during which we did not cut nor dispend the dividend -- suspend the dividend, the new annual rate of $3 per share reflects the significant improvement in the EOG's capital efficiency since the transition to premium drilling. Going forward, we are confident the double premium will continue to improve the financial performance just like premium did, 5 years ago. We're also confident in our ability to continue adding to our double premium inventory without any need for expensive M&A by improving our existing assets and adding new players from our deep pipeline of organic exploration prospects, Developing high return, low cost reserves that meet our stringent double-premium hurdle rate expands our future free cash flow potential and supports EOG's commitment to sustainably growing our regular dividend. EOG's focus on returns, disciplined growth, strong free cash flow generation, and sustainability remain constant. Just as our free cash flow priorities are consistent, so remains our broader strategy and culture. EOG's competitive advantage is our people.  And today's announcements are a reflection of our culture of innovation and execution. Looking towards 2022, oil market supply and demand fundamentals are improving, but remain dynamic. While it's unlikely the market will be fully balanced by the end of 2021, we will continue to monitor macro fundamentals as we plan for next year. We are committed to maintaining production until the oil market needs additional barrels. Under any scenario, we remain focused on driving sustainable efficiency improvements. We are well positioned to offset inflationary price pressures to help keep our well costs flat next year. To summarize this quarter's earnings release and 3 points. First, our fundamental strategy of investing in high return projects consistently executed year-after-year is delivering outstanding financial results.  Second, we're still getting better. As we continue to expand our opportunity set to add double-premium inventory through sustainable well cost reductions in our organic exploration, EOG is set up to improve performance even further. And third, we are well-positioned to execute our high return reinvestment program in 2022 to deliver another year of outstanding returns. Here's Tim to review our capital allocation strategy and our free cash flow priorities. Thank you, Ken. Our record-breaking operational and financial results throughout this year, and the cash returned announcements we made yesterday deserved to grab some headlines. However, the real story behind our performance is consistency of strategy supported by our unique culture. At the start of the call, I said there is no clear indication of the impact premium and now double premium has had on our confidence in EOG's future profitability than the annual $3 per share regular dividend. And while establishing the premium standard back in 2016 shifted us into a different year, culminating in the magnitude of our cash return this year. Our fundamental strategy executed year-after-year by employees united by unique culture dates back to the founding of the Company. That's ultimately what gives me confidence that EOG's best days are ahead.  We are a return-focused organic exploration Company that leverages technology and innovation to always get better. Decentralized, non-bureaucratic. Every employee is a business person first focused on creating value in the field at the asset level. Our financial strategy has always been and remains conservative, not just to offset the inherent risks in a cyclical business, but to take advantage of them. We're committed to the regular dividend and believe it is the best way to create consistent and dependable long-term value for shareholders. We have a proven track record that our strategy works and going forward, investors can expect more of the same consistent execution year after year. Thanks for listening. We'll now go to Q&A. Yes this is Ezra. Paul, thanks for the question. Let me start by outlining a little bit on the buyback and then I'll hand it to Tim Driggers for a little more detail on it. You're right, we're buyback authorization. We've had one previously and we haven't exercise that, in quite some time. What we've done right now as we've refreshed it to a size that's a little more commensurate with the scale of our Company today. And we plan to exercise the buybacks in more of an opportunistic way, rather than something problematic is how we expect to be able to use it and I'm going to ask Tim to provide you a little more details on exercising it. And following on the second question regarding our hedges, specifically gas, but really in general, our hedging strategy hasn't changed at all. As you know, we invest on a very, very stringent hurdle rate, our premium and now double-premium rate. That's based on a $40 oil price, but it's also based on a $2.50 natural gas price for the life of the well. And so when we can opportunistically look to lock in some hedges north of $3, we feel very good about the returns that we're generating going forward on the gas price. In general, we like to have a bit of hedges put on whether oil or gas, just give us a little bit of line of sight into our budgeting process as we enter into a new year. And so really that's the commentary on both the gas and the oil hedges. Yes, Arun. This is Ezra. No, I wanted to -- I would not take that as any type of benchmark. I think we've been very clear for the last couple of years in talking about our framework for cash return, really just our free cash flow priorities. The emphasis -- the priority really is on a sustainable growing regular dividend. We think that's the hallmark. It's forward-looking and that's the hallmark of a very strong Company. Hopefully, it sends a signal to everybody the -- of our confidence in the growing capital efficiency of our Company. Obviously, we've talked about some low cost property bolt-on acquisitions. We've highlighted those on the last call and in the slide deck today. we've obviously covered a very strong, not just strong, but really a pristine Balance Sheet.  And then to the last part of -- really the other part of your question is our other cash returns options for excess-free cash flow, which is the special dividend, and then as Tim was just mentioning, some of the share repurchases. And as we've said, we're very committed to returning excess-free cash flow. We have stayed away from a specific formula because, we'd like to be able to -- we try not to run the Company on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We tried to take a longer view of things. We realized that there are times when potentially the cash on hand may need to move up or down. But regardless of it over the long term, I think we've demonstrated, especially this year, that we're very committed to returning that excess free cash flow. Yes, Arun. The step-up this year in the regular dividend is really a reflection of what we've been doing for the last 5 years in reinvesting this -- in the premium wells. We've been seeing it slowly but surely show up in our financial performance as we've lowered the cost basis of the Company. And the confidence going forward really is what we're seeing with our change in focus over the past 18 months to these double -premium wells. We feel that it's providing another step change in operational performance that should filter through to a step change in financial performance as we've witnessed with that change to premium. And then our inventory, of course, is spread across multiple basins. We have 5,800 of these double -premium locations and over 11,000 of the premium locations, and we're adding to that every day.  Our employees are working through either low -- identifying low cost bolt-on acquisition opportunities, sustainable well-cost reductions, as we've highlighted this quarter's stronger well productivity, and then, of course, our low - cost entry into organic exploration opportunities to further expand both the quantity and the quality of that inventory. So I think as we continue moving forward and sticking to our game plan of investing in double premium, it has the potential to continue to expand the free cash flow potential of EOG and thereby continue to provide an opportunity for us to remain committed to sustainably growing our dividend. Yes, Jeanine, this is Ezra again. It's not just the exploration plays, it's really just our confidence and being able to expand the overall inventory, the quality of the inventory into that double premium. And some of it comes from the announcements that you saw on this quarterly on the quarter results, the stronger well productivity supporting better than guidance volumes, the better than guidance capex driven by sustainable well cost reductions. When I think about that, I think about our existing inventory increasing in performance and quality. And then I think about converting some of our premium wells into double premium status. And then of course we have identified small bolt-on acquisitions where we can continue to grow and expand that inventory level for us. And then as you highlighted, we've got the organic exploration mix.  We're drilling 15 wells this year that we've talked about that are not in the publicly disclosed place. Those places are at various states of either initial drilling, collecting of data, or evaluating as we've talked about on other calls, repeatability production performance of those plays. And so we're very excited and confident in our ability to continue to expand. And as I said increased the quality of our double premium inventory. And ultimately that's what gives us the confidence to be able to see that we can continue to lower the cost base of the Company, increased the capital efficiency of EOG, and continue to support a sustainably growing base dividend, which is our commitment. Yes, Scott. I appreciate the question. I'm going to ask Ken Boedeker to address it. Yes, Leo. This is Ezra. As Billy said, typically we don't provide guidance for the following year on this call but in general, our focus on 2022, the potential for that and us, as you highlighted, the things that we're looking at, we're focused on remaining disciplined and that hasn't changed. As we look into 2022, they are the 3 items that you've referenced that should signal a bit of a balanced market. First is demand, which has probably surprised to the upside a bit with just how quickly we've approached pre-COVID levels. The second is going to be the inventory numbers, which for us we'd like to see at or below the 5-year average, which they're currently there right now. But that brings up that third item that you spoke to, which is the spare capacity. And we'd like to see that spare capacity back to low levels more in line with historic trends. So as we sit here today, 2022 is looking like a year of transition. Spare capacity is going to come back online at this scheduled rates. That should translate into rising inventory levels and if things move forward, we could be looking at a balanced market sometime in the first half of '22. For us, for EOG in a scenario like that, we could probably return to maybe, our pre \u2013 Covid levels of oil production around that 465,000 barrel a day mark. That would represent no more than 5% growth next year. But again, that's as we are sitting here today, we will be officially firming up that 2022 plan or watching how the market develops over the next couple of months.  But as we're witnessing, bringing spare capacity back online has hit some snags as we're watching to see if that more routine startup challenges or is that more structural in nature due to under investment and those 2 factors are going to be just as important as seen, how the continued demand recovery COVID really develops with any potential future lock down, so on and so forth. So ultimately, we continue to remain to be disciplined going forward. Yes, Charles. Thanks for the question. I'll answer the first part of it and then ask Billy to provide a little bit more color also. How far out we can see the balance or the imbalance? To be perfectly honest, we're watching a lot of the same things that all of you are. Those 3 things that we highlighted. Demand has recovered pretty aggressively, I would say. I think it's surprised everybody. And then the inventory numbers in concert with the spare capacity coming back online. And the spare capacity again, if you simply look at the schedules that have been laid out and everybody sticks to the schedules and the supply actually comes back online. That would contemplate sometime in the front half of the year. But as I highlighted, and everyone has been seeing, there are some challenges or hurdles to getting all that spare capacity back online. As far as the -- the color on what we would be looking at, perhaps Billy can speak to it. Yes, Neil. When we think about moving forward, we've done a lot on reinvesting in building this Company to take a bit of a step away from the commodity price cycles by focusing in on the premium wells and now double premium strategy. The growth for us has always been an output of our ability to reinvest at high rates of return, through 2017 to 2019 during a period of rapid growth for the industry. In fact, we're reinvesting only at a rate of about 78% and still generating free cash flow every year, and putting that towards an aggressively growing base dividend. So the strategy for us hasn't really changed. I think we've talked about potentially watching the macro environment a little bit more to help formulate our plans year-to-year. And that's where it falls in line with what we've been discussing over the last couple of questions. We still remain very committed to that. We don't want to push barrels into a market that's oversupplied or doesn't need the barrels. And so we'll be looking for the right time to see if the market needs our barrels before contemplating any return to growth. Yeah, Scott. This is Ezra and we'll talk about next year's budget, next year. So that a little bit facetiously for you, but quite frankly, I think we haven't updated our maintenance capital number yet. We'll provide that number commensurate with our plans laid out next year. But I think what you can see is that our team continues to make great progress and sustainable well cost reductions through their efficiency gains on applying innovation and technology. And I think Billy highlighted pretty well that we feel very confident that we achieved our first initial goal, I should say 5% well cost reduction and were in line to reduce our cost 7% this year. And we feel that a lot of those costs are what's going to insulate us against some of the inflationary pressures out there. No, Scott. Really over the last few years, a lot of our percentage dedicated towards exploration and ESG have been pretty consistent. Yes. Doug, It's a question that we've been answering and we feel that we have provided a framework for our free cash flow priorities. It's as you mentioned, the sustainable growing base dividend to strengthen the Balance Sheet, these low-cost property acquisitions, and then more on point with your question, the other cash returns options which are special dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. And in a lot of ways, when we look back, I think we've shown our commitment to that. Not only this year with committing to $2.7 billion return in dividends over a year-to-date free cash flow generation of about 3.5 billion.  But I think we added a slide into the deck that shows longer-term what we've been able to do in providing just over $5 billion of free cash flow returns since 2016 on about $10.9 billion of free cash flow were generated. And so I think we've laid out a framework, I think our 2 announcements this year on special dividends totaling $3 per share on the specials, really demonstrates our commitment to it and as far as having the ability for our investors to see through and capitalize on that number. I think we've demonstrated our commitment to the point where the investors can capitalize on some of our excess free cash flow. To us, we still remain committed to delivering on those free cash flow priorities. We do want to continue to make decisions based on what we think will create the most significant long-term shareholder value. And that means sometimes not necessarily running the business on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but really taking a longer-term approach. And so locking ourselves into a formula that might have to change as conditions change, is really at the heart of our reluctance to do that. Well, Doug, I don't think I'm comfortable getting into mid-cycle metrics on here. But what I would tell you is we continue to think of this buyback as opportunistic. We think, again, with our authorization in place, we want to use it in a way that we feel confident we're going to be generating long-term shareholder value. More often than not for us, that's going to tend towards special dividends. And we're going to reserve our buyback authorizations to be used really just in times of dislocations and use it opportunistically rather than a more programmatic method. Yes, Neil, appreciate the question and the opportunity. I think the bigger thing for our investors, our employees, everyone who is listening to the call is that EOG has got a proven track record. Our strategy works the shift to premium strategy has put us on a different trajectory and the shift to double premium is going to as well. The culture of EOG, the people that EOG has always been our competitive advantage, and that will continue to be that way. Honestly, Neil, the most important thing we can do as a leadership team, is put our employees in a position to succeed, where they can really contribute to the best of their abilities. And that's where we try to do every day and that's going to translate into not only our operational performance, that would you see the results of this quarter, but to our financial performance as well. Yes. Thank you, Michael. Long term, we believe the hydrocarbons are going to have a -- be a significant part of the energy solution long term. Obviously, we need to do as an industry a better job with our emissions profile. But when you think about oil and natural gas, they both go to different markets dominantly, your natural gas essentially is more on your power side and potentially in direct competition with things such as coal and your renewables. And then your oil transportation. Your oil obviously is a little more focused on transportation. In general when I think longer-term, I think the energy transition is going to be significantly slower than often times you hear about. And we're very bullish on the prospects for both. As far as the exploration plays goes as we've said in the past, dominantly the exploration plays are all oil-focused. We just want to thank each of you for participating in our call this morning and thank our shareholders for their support. As I highlighted at the start of the call, EOG's competitive advantage is our employees and they deserve all the credit for delivering another outstanding quarter. So thank you and enjoy the weekend."

            "name": "Ken Boedeker",
            "content": "Thanks, Billy. Last month we published our 2020 sustainability report. As detailed in this report, we are focused on reducing emissions in the field. Our flaring intensity rate decreased 43% in 2020 compared to 2019, which drove an overall 9% reduction in greenhouse gas intensity. We continue to make progress toward our goal of zero routine flaring across all our operations by 2025, with our more immediate goal of 99.8% wellhead gas capture this year. We also made significant progress on methane last year, reducing our methane emissions percentage by 1/3 to less than 1/10 of 1% of our natural gas production. Since 2017, we've reduced our methane emission intensity percentage by 80%. Our sustainability report profiles that technology and innovation that contributed to these improvements and illustrates why we are optimistic about future performance on our path to net-zero by 2040. Examples of how we are addressing emissions in the field include closed loop gas capture, which helps us continue to reduce flaring.  We're leveraging information technology and our extensive data analysis capabilities from both mobile platforms and our central control rooms to better manage day-to-day operations. In addition, we're piloting technology in the field, such as sensors and control devices that complement our already robust leak detection program. These are just a few examples of the initiatives we have underway. Like all efforts to the EOG, our sustainability strides are bottom-up driven. Creative ideas to improve our ESG performance come from employees working in our operating areas every day. We have a long list of solutions we expect to pilot and profile in the future. Our record of significantly reducing our GHG intensity over the last several years speaks for itself, and we're committed to continuing to improve our emissions performance. Now here's Ezra, to wrap things up. Yes, Scott. We're continuing to make good progress on that initial carbon capture project that we've talked about. We've finalized many of the below-ground geologic studies and we're currently working on the engineering and regulatory portions of the project. As we work our way through these steps, we'll get more clarity on timing. But right now we hope to initiate CO2 injection in late 2022. In terms of capital that we're allocating towards it, it's roughly 2% to 3% of our budget is going to be allocated towards all of our ESG projects, is what we see. Scott, we're really not going to change the business that we're in. We're looking at carbon capture right now to significantly reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions at this point. That business is a much lower return business than what we see with our development that we have. So we'll keep an eye on that but our real goal for carbon capture is just reducing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions which we've made significant progress on in the last several years. Yeah. Bob, this is Ken. As Billy said earlier, we have turned on several wells in the last few months and the color is all of them are at or above our type curve and what our plans were, going into the year. We do have one-drilling rig act even in the play right now and we're really moving rapidly up the learning curve. Again, just to reiterate, this play has really double premium returns and it's competitive for capital with our oil plays. Michael, this is Ken. To answer your question on the tax credit side, we are planning on capturing was 45Q tax credits. Our goal in terms of foot class or permit that we would secure. We believe that we will initially secure a class 2 permit that can be converted, will go through all of the regulatory requirements to be able to convert it to a class 6 later in its life. But that's what the plan is for our CCS project at this point."

            "name": "Billy Helms",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. As a result of the -- to the consistency of our operating performance, we delivered another quarter of outstanding results. I couldn't be more proud of the engagement of our employees and their culture of continuous improvement. Their execution of our 2021 plan has been near perfect. For the third quarter in a row, we produced more oil for less capital. That is, we exceeded our production targets while spending less than our forecast for capital expenditures. Well, productivity driven by our double premium hurdle rate continues to out perform while our drilling and completion teams pushed the [Indiscernible], on new sustainable cost savings and expand those efficiencies throughout our active operating areas. Examples include in-sourcing and re-designing drilling equipment, adopting innovative techniques to reduce nonproductive time, expanding super zipper completion operations, and reducing sand and water-sourcing cost.  Our ability to continue to lower cost and deliver reliable execution quarter after quarter is tied to common set of operating practices that together form a sustainable competitive advantage for EOG. First, we are a multiplay Company, with activities spread across 4 different basins in the U.S. As conditions change, we have the flexibility to shift capital between place to optimize returns. Second, we are organized under a decentralized structure. Decisions are made by discrete focused teams, closer to the operation, rather than dictated by headquarters. Our culture is non-bureaucratic and entrepreneurial. We empower our front line employees to make decisions, bringing them to drive innovation and efficiency improvement. Third, we have established strategic vendor relationships with our preferred service providers.  We are typically -- we're not typically the biggest beneficiary of price reductions during downturns. We also tend to not be on the leading edge of price increases during inflationary periods. Fourth, we have taken ownership of the value-added parts of the drilling, completions, and production supply chain by applying our operational expertise, proprietary technology to improve efficiency and lower cost. Examples include sand, water, chemicals, drilling fluids, completion design, drilling motors, the marketing of our products, and much more. As a result, our operating teams have complete ownership of driving improvements in every step. And finally, we apply a world-class information technology to every part of our operations. Our data-gathering and analysis capabilities improve -- continue to improve, which we leveraged to better manage day-to-day field operations for more efficient use of resources, as well as discovering new innovations. As a result of these strategic advantages, we are confident in achieving our target of 7% well cost savings this year.  This is an incredible accomplishment given the state of inflation. As we move into next year, we're on track to lock in 50% of our total well cost by the end of this year. We have locked in 90% plus of our drilling rigs at rates that are flat to lower than 2020 and 2021. We've also secured more than 50% of our completion crews at favorable rates. While it is still early, the savings from these initiatives and other improvement efforts will continue to be realized next year, helping us offset the risk of additional inflation. And thus we remain confident that we will be able to keep well cost at least flat in 2022. Now, here's Kent. Yes, Leo. This is Billy Helms. So on the capex side, certainly part of our program as we laid out earlier this year, was just advanced some of Dorado prospect in South Texas, as you know, it's a very competitive gas play with rest of the place in the U.S. And we've been very pleased with the results here. But we may -- we remain disciplined to only completes the 15 wells we targeted and laid out at the start of this year. It's really a little bit early to be talking about what we're going to look like next year. But obviously with the results we're seeing, we're very pleased with the results being -- meeting or exceeding the top curves we have laid out, that certainly gives us an option to look at increasing activity there. It's a little bit early yet to be saying what we're going to do next year, but we're very pleased with what we're seeing. Yeah, Charles. For as far as how long it would take before we would see any response basically showing up in our financials. If you just simply look at, when we see the signal and the time we deploy rigs and get the wells completed, non-production takes usually 3 to 4 months. So you'd start seeing it no earlier than that, but probably sometime a quarter or 2 after. So to have a meaningful difference in financial performance. That's correct. Yeah. Neil, this is Billy Helms. As far as the volume of gas hedges and then what we've been doing there, really it's not focused strictly on Dorado, it simply goes back to our premium strategy that as we just laid out, it's based on a $40 oil and a $2.50 gas price. We saw the opportunity to lock in gas prices is above $3. So it gave us encouragement of locking in returns over the next several years at those prices. We have gas production quite a bit as you know in Dorado, but also quite a bit in other places as well. So it just helps ensure locking in returns over a multi-year period. Yeah, Neil, this is Billy Helms. Certainly as industry is seeing, we're seeing quite a bit of an inflationary pressure mainly in three areas that would say steel process. So tubulars, labor which is certainly affects all industries. And then fuel, those are probably the three inflationary pressures that are throughout our industry and really throughout the all industries. The one thing that I think is going to be, or maybe two things, two top priorities would be probably steel. I think availability of tubulars is something that I think most companies are struggling with or dealing with, I guess. And then, the other one would be labor and just getting enough people to manage the activity levels. Just to maybe give you a little bit color then on where EOG sits. Each year we try to get ahead of the curve and lock in a certain amount of our services to secure activity. But in this case, also protect us from inflation.  For instance, in 2021 we protected about a 65% of our well costs going into the year. As a result of that, plus the improving efficiencies, we're able to reduce our average well costs by about 7%, as that stated earlier. During the year though, we also took advantage and renegotiated many of our services at lower rates and locked in through and through the end of next year. So going into 2022, we expect to have about 50% of our well cost secured and with over 90% of our drilling rigs secured at lower rates and also 50% of our frac fleets secured. We expect to see inflation certainly in arms of such as steel, labor, and fuel just like everybody else. But by doing that, we've given ourselves visibility into areas of also improving efficiencies that we expect to offset much of this inflation. So we're still confident, we can keep well cost. At least flat going into next year. Hey, good morning. This is Helms. Thanks for your question. And good morning. We're -- the team is definitely executing. You've seen several of our slides that we've put back, talking a lot about our transportation position is so incredibly valuable. We can move gas from all our different basins, from the Permian Basin, from the Eagle Ford, we talked a lot about Dorado earlier. And then with that and it gets access as you look along the Golf Course and you look at the LNG demand, especially that's growing over time. Obviously, you know, we've got a position there that we started. And just really speaks to being a first mover, especially, when you think about LNG. We went through a whole BD effort, kind of 17 and 18, we got the contracts finalized in 2020. And in 2021, obviously, we're definitely seeing the value of that contract. So being a first-mover is absolutely important. And yes, we're going to continue to look at new opportunities from an LNG standpoint, very well-positioned. Again, it gets back to our transport, our export capacities, and just having that ability to transact, we can definitely be very nimble as we even think about new opportunities."

            "name": "Tim Driggers",
            "content": "Good morning and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release in EOG's SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures can be found on EOG's website. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chief Executive Officer, Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer, [Indiscernible] EVP Exploration and Production. [Indiscernible], EVP Exploration and Production. [Indiscernible], Senior VP Marketing, and [Indiscernible], VP Investor and Public Relations. Here's Ezra Yacob. Thanks, Ezra. As we have been progressing premium the last 5 years, our capital allocation decisions have been guided by a set of long-standing consistent priorities. First, is high return disciplined reinvestment. Our returns on capital investment have never been higher. Our market fundamentals remain the number 1 determinant of when to grow. Second is a regular dividend, which we believe is the best way to return cash to shareholders. We paid a dividend for 22 years without suspending or cutting it. At the new level of $3 per year, we can comfortably form both the dividend and maintenance CapEx at $40 WTI. The combination of our low-cost structure, high returns, and strong financial position will sustain this higher regular dividend. This resilient financial position is backstopped by our third priority, a pristine Balance Sheet with almost 0 net debt. We remain firmly committed to a strong Balance Sheet. It's not conservatism, it's a competitive advantage.  Fourth, we regularly review other cash return options, specifically special dividends and share buybacks. Yesterday we declared a special dividend for the second time in 2021 and updated our share buybacks authorization. Share buybacks have always been part of our playbook and will remain an opportunistic cash return alternative. We are cognizant of the challenges of successfully executing a share buybacks in a cyclical industry. We now expect there will be periods in the future when the stock will be impacted by macro factors, such as the commodity cycle, geopolitical events, and other unforeseen events like the COVID pandemic in 2020. The updated $5 billion authorization provides the flexibility to act and take advantage when the right opportunity presents itself.  We believe our strategy for the use of other cash return options is well designed to deliver value through the cycle. Finally, we're not in the market for expensive M&A in a simply a low return proposition. We can create much more value through organic reinvestment and our shareholders can do better with their excess cash our premium strategy generates back in their hands. Since our shift to premium in 2016, EOG has generated nearly $10 billion of free cash flow. With that cash flow, EOG has reduced debt $1.5 billion. Increased the cash balance by $3.6 billion. And we'll return more than $5 billion to shareholders by the end of 2021, this is a significant amount of shareholder value driven by premium.  Today, EOG is positioned to translate that value creation into even more cash returns to shareholders. In the third quarter, we generated a record $1.4 billion of free cash flow, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $3.5 billion, which is equal to the total return of capital paid and committed this year to our regular dividend, to special dividends, and debt repayment. You can expect us to continue returning cash going forward. There might be times when we strategically increased or decreased the cash balance, but over time, the cash will go back to our shareholders. Here's Billy. Sure. Turn my microphone, I'm sorry. First of all, we will evaluate buybacks like any other investment decision, how does it creates long-term shareholder value? So that will be the first thing we'll have to look at every time we make this decision. Specifically to answer your question about could we have started during the pandemic but didn't have the financial wherewithal to do that, you're exactly right. At that point in time, oil was negative, the price oil was negative and we had two bonds coming to -- totaling $1 billion. So had we been in the shape we're in today, that would've been a perfect time to buy shares. But we weren't in that same position we are today. That's how -- that's why continuing to work on the balance sheet and positioning ourselves for the future has been so important to EOG. So we should not ever have that situation again. We have positioned the Company to be able to opportunistically take advantage of these situations. Jeanine, this is Tim, so as already been stated, we are committed to our free cash flow parties and that has not changed. So we look at all the factors every quarter to determine when is the right time to do either special dividend, or nail the share buybacks, or increase the regular dividend. So when we looked at our cash balance at September 30, was sitting at $4.3 billion. That gives us -- that leaves us well-positioned to pay off our bond in 2023 and provide this $2 special dividend. So it's a combination of all those factors and we felt this was a meaningful amount of cash to return at this time. No, we haven't changed our target. We will continue to monitor that through the cycle and see there's all sorts of factors we have to take into consideration for the cash balance. As you know, working capital changes, for example, as prices swing up and down, so that's a big consideration. But no, it has not changed -- the authorization has not changed our philosophy on the cash balance. Hi, Paul. This is Tim. We do not have a timeline on when we plan to buy back the $5 billion. When the opportunity presents itself, we will be in the market."

And it's time for opening remarks and introduction. I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers, please go ahead, sir.\nTim Driggers: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing second quarter 2021 Earnings and Operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements.  The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG 's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.  Definitions, as well as reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures, can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call or in the accompanying investor presentation slides may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential, not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines.  We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday.  Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman, and CEO; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; Ezra Yacob, President; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Jeff Leitzell, EVP, Exploration and Production. Lance Terveen, Senior VP Marketing, and David Streit, VP Investor and Public Relations. Here's Bill Thomas.\nBill Thomas: Thanks, Tim. And good morning, everyone. EOG is focused on improving returns. Results from the first half of the year are already reflecting the power of EOG shift to our double premium investment standard.  Once again, we posted outstanding results in the second quarter. We delivered adjusted Earnings of a $1.73 per share and nearly 1.1 billion of free cash flow repeating the record level of free cash flow we generated last Quarter.  Our outstanding operational performance included another beat of the high end of our oil production guidance, while capital expenditures and total per-unit operating costs were below expectations.  We're delivering the exceptional well productivity that continues to improve. In addition, even though the industry is in an inflationary environment, EOG continues to demonstrate the Company's unique ability to sustainably lower costs. Our performance clearly proves the power of doubling our reinvestment hurdle rate.  Double premium requires investments to earn a minimum of 60% direct after-tax rate of return using flat commodity prices of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. I'm confident our reinvestment hurdle is one of the most stringent in the industry and a powerful catalyst to drive future outperformance across key financial metrics, including a return on capital employed and free cash flow.  As double-premium improves our potential to generate free cash flow, we remain committed to using that cash to maximize shareholder value. The regular dividends, debt reduction, special dividends, opportunistic buybacks, and small high return bolt-on acquisitions are our priorities.  In the first half of this year, we reduced our long-term debt by 750 million and demonstrated our priority to returning cash, significant cash to shareholders with a commitment of 1.5 billion in regular and special dividends. We also closed on several low-cost, high potential bolt-on acquisitions, and the Delaware basin over the last 12 months.  Year-to-date, we have committed 2.3 billion to debt reduction in dividends, which is slightly more than a 2.1 billion of free cash flow we generated. Looking ahead to the second half of the year and beyond, our free cash flow priorities and framework have not changed.  As we generate additional free cash, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders in a meaningful way. We are focused on doing the right thing at the right time in order to maximize shareholder returns.  Over the last 4 years, we made huge progress, reducing our GHG and methane intensity rates, nearly eliminating routine flaring and increasing the use of recycled water in our operations. We're focused on continued progress towards reducing our GHG emissions in line with our targets and ambitions.  This quarter we announced the carbon capture and storage pilot project, which we believe will be our next step forward in the process of reaching our net 0 ambition. Ken will provide more color on this and other emission reduction projects in a few moments.  Driven by EOG's innovative culture, our goal is to be one of the lowest cost, highest return, and lowest emission producers, playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy. Now, here's Ezra to talk more about how our returns continue to improve.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Bill. While we announced our shift to the double premium investment standard at the start of this year the shift has been underway since 2016 when we first established our premium investments standard of 30% minimum direct after-tax rate of return using a conservative price deck of $40 Oil and $2.50 Natural gas for the life of the Well.  In the 3 years that followed, our premium drilling program drove 45% increase in earnings per share, a 40% increase in ROCE in an oil price environment, nearly 40% lower compared to the 3-year period prior to premium. This comparative financial performance can be reviewed on Slide 15 of our investor presentation.  In addition, premium enabled this remarkable step-change in our financial performance while reinvesting just 78% of our discretionary cash flow on average, resulting in $4.6 billion of cumulative free cash flow. The impact from doubling our investment hurdle rate from 30% to 60% using the same conservative premium price deck, is now positioning EOG for a similar step-change to our well productivity and costs, boosting returns, Capital efficiency, and cash flow.  Double Premium wells offer shallower production declines and significantly lower finding and development costs resulting in well payouts of approximately 6 months at current strip prices. The increase in capital efficiency resulting from reinvesting in these higher-return projects is increasing our potential to generate significant free cash flow.  This year, we're averaging less than $7 per barrel of oil equivalent finding cost. Adding these lower-cost reserves is continuing to drive down the cost basis of the company, and when combined with EOG's operating cost reductions, is driving higher full-cycle returns.  Looking back over the last 4 quarters, EOG has earned a 12% return on capital employed with oil averaging $52. We are well on our way to earning double-digit ROCE at less than $50 oil, and it begins with disciplined reinvestment, and higher return double premium drilling.  While EOG has 11,500 premium locations, approximately 5,700 are double premium wells located across each of our core assets. We're confident we can continue to grow our double premium inventory through organic exploration, improving well costs and well productivity, and small bolt-on acquisitions, just like we did with the premium over the last 5 years.  In the past 12 months, through 8 deals, we have added over 25,000 acres in the Delaware Basin through opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions at an approximate cost of $2500 per acre. These are low-cost opportunities within our core asset positions, which in some cases receive immediate benefit from our existing infrastructure.  Premium and now double premium established a new higher threshold for adding inventory. Exploration and bolt-on acquisitions are focused on improving the quality of the inventory by targeting returns in excess of the 60% after-tax rate of return hurdle.  EOG 's record for adding high-quality, low-cost inventory, predominantly through organic exploration, is why we do not need to pursue expensive large M&A deals. 2021 is turning into an outstanding year for EOG. Our exceptional well-level returns are translating into double-digit corporate returns. And our employees continue to position EOG for long-term shareholder value creation. Here's Billy with an update on our operational performance.\nBilly Helms: Thanks Ezra. Our operating teams continue to deliver strong results. Once again, we exceeded our oil production target, producing slightly more than the high end of our guidance, driven by strong well results. In addition, capital came in below the low end of our guidance as a result of sustainable well cost reductions.  We have already exceeded our targeted 5% well cost reduction in the first half of 2021. We now expect that our average well cost will be more than 7% lower than last year. As a reminder, this is in addition to the 15% well cost savings achieved in 2020.  We continue to see operational improvements outpace the inflationary pressure in the service sector. Average drilling days are down 11%, and the [treated] (ph) lateral completed in a single day increased more than 15%.  We are utilizing our recently discussed super-zipper completions on about a third of our well packages this year, and I expect that percentage to increase next year. In addition, our sand costs are flat to slightly down year-to-date.  We have a line of sight to reduce the cost of sand sourcing and processing and expect to start realizing savings in the second half of 2021, and into 2022. Water re-use is another source of significant savings, and we continue to expand and re-use infrastructure throughout our development areas.  Finally, we have renegotiated several of the expiring higher-price contracts for drilling rigs, and expect to see additional savings the remainder of this year and next. We also used the strength of our balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities to reduce future costs in several areas.  As an example, last summer we pre-purchased the tubulars needed for our 2021 drilling program when process were at their lowest point. EOG is not immune to the inflationary pressures we're seeing across our industry.  But this forward-looking approach helps EOG mitigate anticipated cost increases. As a reminder, 65% of our well cost are locked in for the year and the remaining cost, we're actively working down through operational efficiencies.  As usual, we have begun to secure services and products ahead of next year's activity with a goal of keeping well cost at least flat in 2022. But as you can rest assured that with our talented and focused operational teams, our ultimate goal is to always push well cost down each year.  The same amount of effort is being placed on reducing our per-unit operating cost with the results showing up in reduced LOE, driven mainly by lower workover expense, reduced water handling expense, and lower maintenance expenses.  Savings are also being realized from our new technology being developed internally to optimize our artificial lift. We have several new tools that help us reduce the amount of gas-lift volumes required to produce wells without reducing the overall production rate.  These optimizing tools not only reduce costs, but also help reduce the amount of compression horsepower needed, which ultimately reduces our greenhouse gas footprint as well. These and other continual improvements are great testament to our pleased, but not satisfied, culture.  This quarter, we can also update you on our final ESG performance results from last year. We reduced our greenhouse gas intensity rate 8% in 2020, driven by sustainable reductions to our flaring intensity.  Operational performance in the first half of this year indicates promise for future further improvements to our emission's performance in 2021, putting us comfortably ahead of pace to meet our 2025 intensity targets for GHG and methane, and our goal to eliminate routine flaring.  Achieving these targets is the first step on a path towards our ambition of net-zero emissions by 2040. Water infrastructure investments also continue to pay off. Nearly all water used in our Powder River Basin operations last year was sourced from reuse.  For Company-wide operations in the U.S., water supplied by reused sources last year increased to 46%, reducing freshwater to less than 1/5 of the total water used. These achievements and along with the insight into ongoing efforts to improve future performance, will be detailed in our sustainability report to be published in October.  We're starting to fill in the pieces on the roadmap to get to net-zero by 2040. Here's Ken with the details.\nKen Boedeker: Thanks, Billy. Earlier this year, we announced our net-zero ambition for our scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040. Our ambition is aggressive, but achievable and we expect it will be an iterative process requiring trial and error. This approach mirrors how we develop an oil and gas asset.  We pilot creative applications of existing and new technologies to determine the most effective solutions to optimize efficiencies by minimizing costs and maximizing recoveries of oil and natural gas. Here, we are aiming to maximize emissions reductions. We then apply the successful technologies and solutions across our operations where feasible.  Our net 0 strategy generally fall -- generally falls into three categories, reduce, capture, or offset. That is, we are focused on directly reducing emissions from our operations, capturing emissions from sources that can be concentrated for storage, and offsetting any remaining emissions.  Reducing emission's intensity from our operations is a direct and immediate path to reducing our carbon footprint. Our approach is to invest with returns in mind and seek achievable and scalable results.  We made excellent progress in the last four years through initiatives to upgrade equipment in the field, invest in pilots using existing and new technologies, and leverage our extensive big data platform to automate and redesign processes to improve emissions efficiencies.  As a result, since 2017, we have reduced our GHG intensity rate to 20%, our methane emissions percentage by 80%, and our flaring intensity rate by more than 50%. We recently obtained permits to expand the successful pilot of our closed-loop Gas Capture Project, which prevents flaring in the event of a downstream interruption.  We designed an automated system that redirects natural Gas back into our infrastructure system and inject the Gas temporarily back into existing Wells. The project requires a modest investment to capture a resource that would have otherwise been flared and stores it for further or for future production and beneficial use.  The result is a double-premium return investment that reduces flaring emissions. Our well-head gas capture rate was 99.6% in 2020 and rollout of additional closed-loop gas capture systems will hope capture more of the remaining 0.4%. Turning to our efforts to capture CO2, we're launching a project that will capture carbon emissions from our operations for long-term storage.  This project is designed to capture and store a concentrated source of EOG's direct CO2 emissions. We believe we can design solutions to generate returns from carbon capturing and storage by leveraging our competitive advantages in geology, facility design and field operations.  Our CCS efforts are directed at emissions from our operations, and we are not currently looking to expand those efforts into another line of business. We will provide updates on our pilot CCS Project as it progresses. EOG is also exploring other innovative solutions for GHG emissions reductions.  Over the past 18 months, we have deployed capital into several fuel substitution projects to power compressors used for natural gas pipeline operations and natural gas artificial lift. Compressors are the largest source of EOG 's stationary combustion emissions. By replacing NGL-rich field gas with lean residue gas.  EOG can reduce the carbon intensity of the fuel, which lowers CO2 emissions and improves engine efficiency. Using lean residue gas also earns a very favorable financial return by recovering the full value of the natural gas liquids versus using those components as fuel.  Another fuel substitution test we conducted recently was blending hydrogen with natural gas. While it is still in the early stages, we are analyzing the test data to evaluate the emissions reductions that would be possible from this blended fuel at an operational and economic scale.  We're very excited about this part of the business, just like cost reductions, well improvements, or exploration success. This is a bottom-up-driven initiative. EOG employees thrive on this type of challenge.  We create innovative solutions and applied technology to solve problems, improve processes, and optimize efficiencies while generating industry-leading returns. The EOG culture has embraced our 2040 net-zero ambition and we are focusing our efforts to minimize our carbon footprint as quickly as possible. Now, here's Bill to wrap up.\nBill Thomas: Thanks, Ken. In conclusion, I'd like to note the following important takeaways. First, by doubling our reinvestment standard, the future potential of our earnings and cash flow performance are the best they've ever been.  Results from the first half of this year demonstrate the power of double-premium and the beginning of another step change and performance. Second, EOG is not satisfied. We're committed to getting better. Sustainable Cost reduction and improving well performance are driving returns and free cash flow potential to another level.  At the same time, the same innovative culture that is driving higher returns is also improving our environmental performance Third, our commitment to returning cash to shareholders has not changed. As we have already demonstrated, returning meaningful cash to shareholders remains a priority.  And finally, as Ezra transitions into the CEO role, I could not be more excited about the future of the Company. The quality of our assets, and the quality of this leadership team are the best in Company history, all supported by EOG 's talented employees, and unique culture that continues to fire on all cylinders.  The Company is incredibly strong and our ability to get stronger has never been better. The future of EOG is in great hands. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A\nOperator: Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]. Questions are limited to one questions and one follow-up question.  We will take as many questions as time permits. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nLeo Mariani: Hey guys, you obviously -- you highlighted some success on the small bolt-on deals here. And I guess just from my perspective, it seemed like those were very, very economic, just very cheap per acre costs at around 2500 per acre.  It is - a lot of it's just a function of the fact that these are very small deals and in captive to EOG existing acreage and infrastructure, which just gives you the natural ability to buy things without a lot of competition. And I just wanted to get a sense of how repeatable these type of bolt-ons can be for you guys going forward.\nBill Thomas: Yes, thanks, Leo. I'm going to ask Ezra to comment on that.\nEzra Yacob: Leo, you described that very well. These are smaller deals, as I highlighted. It's 25,000 acres across 8 different deals that we've captured and put together over the past 12 months. And these are low-cost opportunities in our core positions within the Delaware Basin.  And typically, these are things that are either contiguous with our pre-existing acreage position or very, very close to our acreage position. And so there's not a lot of outside competition. A lot of times, by all regards, we're the partner that makes sense to go ahead and get these deals because like I said, we have the surrounding wells information, seismic, and oftentimes some of these deals can go immediately right into our existing infrastructure. We highlighted the last 12 months but we wanted to give a sense of the type of scale and the impact that these low-cost opportunities can have when we're focused on them. And these deals are pretty continuous throughout all of our plays and throughout the year.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. That's helpful. And I guess I also wanted to ask about your comment around seeing a less than $7 per BOE F&D year-to-date. Clearly, you attributed some of the factors there where you talked about how your well costs are coming down as part of it, and also the move to double-premium. But maybe you can provide just a little bit more color, I mean, I guess that less than $7 seems like a very low number out there. Are there any other just key factors where maybe there's more of a mix shift to certain plays where perhaps your higher concentration of certain zones in the Delaware this year, and I know you guys are also drilling some gas wells in South Texas that might be helping, just any color around some of the key drivers for getting it to under 7?\nBill Thomas: Hi Leo, Billy Helms will comment on that.\nBilly Helms: Yeah. Good morning, Leo. It's strictly a function of moving to our double premium strategy. We saw a similar change if you remember back when we shifted to premium a few years ago and we're seeing that same compounding effect as we shift to double premium. The quality of our wells improves.  And as you noted, we have a history of continuing to focus on lowering well cost and just our continued effort in those areas. So it's not really attributable to one basin or the other, it's just a function of the impact of shifting to double-premium across our portfolio.  And I might add, as we look to add wells to the inventory of double-premium wells, [they will all be] (ph) in that same category to compete on both returns and finding costs.\nLeo Mariani: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities, please go ahead.\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. My first question is really just around when you talked about shareholder return, obviously that seem to be the hot topic these days.  Billy, I'm glad you don't do this, but my thoughts about if you guys would ever -- there's been others out there that have guaranteed a type of return, or amount, or something like that you guys seemed to want to stay more flexible, but I would just love to hear more color on obviously, you guys have [Indiscernible] amount of free cash flow coming in, that's not the issue, I'm just wondering how you think about if you put any sort of guarantees on the type or amount going forward.\nBill Thomas: Yeah, Neal. We've outlined a very clear framework and we've consistently delivered on our priorities. And so maybe the best way to think about the future is to look at what we've done in the past. And I want to ask Ezra to give more color on that.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Neal. In our investor presentation there on slide 5 & 6, I think we can reference that. This year we've been very successful executing on all of our cash flow priorities in the framework that we've laid out.  We've been able to increase the regular dividend by 10%, which we feel is our primary motive of capital return. Secondly, we're able to reduce our debt earlier this year by $750 million by retiring a bond.  And then third, we just paid a $600 million special dividend on July 30th of this year, which we had announced during the last earnings call. So our year-to-date free cash flow commitment is $2.3 billion, which is slightly more than the 2.1 billion we generated. And going forward, our framework and priorities have not changed.  Lastly, we also highlighted in the opening remarks, as we just spoke about a little bit with Leo, some of the small bolt-on acquisitions we've done, which is one of the avenues to growing our inventory, and that's really the -- where the entire process begins, is having the depth in quality of inventory to continually improve the business.  And with our shift to drilling these double-premium wells, the free cash flow potential, the Company continues to expand and as it does, and as we realize the cash, we're well-positioned to continue executing on our priorities.  We're committed to creating the most shareholder value and our cash return strategy is really a reflection of that. So, as the Company continues to improve, we're excited about that potential.\nNeal Dingmann: Agree, guys. I really like the cash return strategy and then just one follow-up. Exploration, your opportunities is a really -- you guys continue to stick out there. You obviously continue to be the leaders. Mentioned a number of things that have you excited. Could you just remind us again, I think the last was it, I forget Bill, was it maybe 13 or 15?  Was it unique projects here in the U.S.? Could you tell us maybe or just talk about the upside potential you see for that business this year, going into 2022 for the exploration upside.\nBill Thomas: Neal I think what we've outlined is we've got about 15 exploration wells built into the CapEx this year in the U.S. So I am going to ask Ezra to give us some more color on that.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Neal. The exploration prospects are all moving forward. As we discussed on the last call, the prospect have all started to move at different phases, really as a result of some of the slow down during COVID and during 2020.  As Bill just mentioned, we're planning on drilling 15 wells outside of the publicly discussed assets. Some of these, in some of the prospects, our initial exploration wells. Some of them are more what we'd call appraisal wells, evaluating the repeatability of these plays.  We're still leasing across many of the plays as well. And as we've discussed, the opportunities are really targeting a higher quality rock and what's typically been drilled horizontally That's an outgrowth of a lot of technical work we've done across multiple basins to combine modern drilling and completions technologies, and apply those to reservoirs that have been traditionally overlooked.  And really, we're very happy with our progress to date and we look forward to sharing additional information at an appropriate time.\nNeal Dingmann: Great details. Thank you, all.\nOperator: The next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you, guys. I think this is the first time I've had a chance to see Bill. Congratulations on your retirement. And Ezra, excited to see what you -- how you move forward with the business. But I wonder, Bill if I could ask you just to maybe a little bit of a retrospective here as you walk out the door, so to speak. There has been a lot of changes in the business model, growth transitioning to free cash flow, and so on. So I'm just wondering if you can offer any thoughts as to how this business should look going forward, both at the sector level and that EOG level. As you look back on your tenure and the changes that have taken place [Indiscernible].\nBill Thomas: Yeah, Doug. Well, thank you very much. And you're right. I mean, the business has evolved over the last year since the shale business really started. And it's obviously it's moving in an incredibly great positive direction right now that the focus on returns, that we've always been I think a leader in focus on returns and we're super excited about that.  The capital discipline, spending well below cash flow and generating high returns, and giving a significant amount of cash back to shareholders, I think is certainly all very positive. And so I think really we're entering a super new era.  And I think it's more positive than it's ever been before. I think we, as an industry, are going to generate better returns and going to give more back to the shareholders. And I think we're in a more positive macro-environment than we've been in since really the shale business started. I think OPEC + is solid. I think the U.S. will remain disciplined. And so I think the industry is in for a long run of really good results.\nDoug Leggate: We've been bumping heads with you over the years, Bill, so congratulations again, and good luck. Ezra, my follow-up is maybe for you. EOG has obviously been an organic story for many, many years and you've touched on exploration again today, but Yates was one of the, I guess, the step-out acquisitions that you did and if you look at your portfolio position today. There's clearly a large asset potentially for sale right in your backyard and a very high-quality acreage position you could argue, why would M&A not be a feature of the business at some point, and maybe I go so far as to say would you rule yourself out of being interested in that shell package. Thank you.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Doug. No, we're not evaluating any large acquisition packages at this time. We're focused on these small high-return bolt-on acquisitions. And as discussed in opening remarks, the larger expense of M&A deals, the opportunity struggled to compete with the existing return profile that we have within the Company due to either high PDP costs, the high acreage costs, or both.  Oftentimes the acreage being marketed might be additive to the quantity of our inventory, but not additive to the quality. And as we've discussed we're always working to improve the quality of our assets.  We're having great success with the small bolt-on acquisitions. We're feeling very confident with our ability to increase the quality of our deep inventory through our organic exploration program. And so we're excited about our prospects there.\nDoug Leggate: Very clear. Thanks, Ezra.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank please go ahead.\nPaul Cheng: All right. Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions, please. First one, maybe that's -- Bill you can help us to frame it to understand that decision than maybe better.  If we look at last Quarter when you announced the specialty that they're making you set a number of key conditions and that's all being met such as in January, substantial free cash flow, you don't have much of the debt maturity in the near-term, and your cash is already in excess of what you think is a reasonable level which is to finite.  If we look in this Quarter, basically all those conditions are still being met. But do you decide not to pay the special dividend? So, we're just trying to understand that what is the additional consideration in that decision.  And also, if you can talk about between buyback and special dividend at this point of the cycle, which is more peak variable for you or how you look at the differences? So, that's the first question.  The second question, yes, relate to, I think that you guys question many of the basins, you are not interested in large-scale M&A which is understandable. But it makes sense, however, that to work with some of your peers to pull together the asset to form a really large joint venture.  So everyone still has their own equity ownership. You don't pay any premium, but you will be able to allow to use your technical know-how to apply to even a larger scale asset and drive even better efficiency gains. Do you think that it makes sense for EOG for that kind of structure? Thank you.\nEzra Yacob: Yeah, Paul. On the first question, I think it's super important and I think we've already shared this. Our -- we've got a very clear framework and we've consistently delivered, as you pointed out on that framework, and significantly given a lot of money back to shareholders.  And going forward, our framework and priorities are not changed at all. So, as we generate additional free cash flow, we're committed to returning cash to shareholders in a very meaningful way.  It's really all about doing the right thing at the right time. As the Company continues to improve, we're excited about our potential to increase total shareholder return. And in the framework, we do have the option for opportunistic buybacks as long as -- along with special dividends, and so we look at opportunistic buybacks as\nBill Thomas: being able to have the opportunity to consider buying back shares and counter-cyclic environments where the market is not well and our sought process is significantly undervalued. Well, that would be an opportunity to consider buybacks.  In good times we think the special dividend is the way to go and that's what we're executing on now, and that's what we're hoping to continue to execute in the future. On the second part of your question, on the large-scale M&A, I'm going to ask Billy to think through that question and give his ceiling from that. Thanks, Bill. On the large-scale M&A, as Ezra just talked about a minute ago, certainly we're not interested in adding quantity to our inventory, but it's more about the quality of the assets we have. And as we think about forming maybe a potential larger JV, that same approach needs to apply.  As we look across the fence, if our assets are in, what we consider the core acreage position in the play, adding in acreage outside of that ring-fence would dilute our efforts. We've also taken, as you know -- taken a lot of efforts to build out infrastructure to make our -- to lower our unit cost and continue to improve our returns, and we build out that infrastructure to meet the volume expectations that we have for developing our acreage.  That may or may not apply as you add in additional acreage outside of that. I think each Operator looks at how to make the most efficient use of the acreage and their capital as they can, and forming JVs doesn't necessarily improve overall Company metrics.  So I think while we've looked at bolt-on as a way to shore up a lot of our core area acreage, I think that is a very applicable part of maybe thinking about JV expansions. Continuing to come up in your base areas where it adds the same quality, doesn't dilute your quality of the assets, but just expanding in a basin may or may not do that.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nArun Jayaram: Yeah. Good morning. Tim, maybe starting with you. I just wanted to get maybe some of the order of operations around a potential incremental cash return beyond the dividend. Last quarter, you mentioned that EOG likes to keep a $2 billion minimum cash balance plus fund, the $1.25 billion bond maturity. So that suggests that you'd like to get to 3.25 billion of cash and anything beyond that is available for cash return beyond the dividend?\nTim Driggers: Certainly, you can do that math, but it's more than that with us. As Ezra and Bill talked about further, we have to look at all of our priorities and the timing of those priorities to determine when and if there is another special dividend, or share repurchases, or bolt-on acquisitions. All those things are in play at all times.  And the 2 billion is not the end of the month number, it's during the cycles, so cash can vary tremendously during a month. The 2 billion is the low point during the month, it's not necessarily the end of a month. So you have to keep that in mind as well but yes, you can do that math. But that's not all there is to it.  We have to look at all of our priorities and where we're at in the cycle. And as it has been pointed out on Slide 6, we've already distributed more cash than we brought in, in the first half of the year. So we're well on our way to achieving that. As we move through the second half of the year, we'll look at what other cash is generated and we'll evaluate how to use that cash at that time.\nArun Jayaram: Great. And maybe just a follow-up to Paul's question. Could you give us maybe some feedback you've gotten from some of the shareholders on the special dividend and your thoughts on the pros and cons of moving to a formulaic type of approach around cash return and even especially in terms of buyback?\nBill Thomas: Yeah, Arun. This is Bill. We've gotten enormously positive responses from every shareholder on the special dividend and that was a super hit. And they like our framework, when you really think through it, it's not really a complicated framework.  It's a framework where we want to be in a position to maximize total shareholder returns. And as I've said, be able to do the right thing at the right time. If you look at the history of what we've been doing really over the last several years, we've increased the regular dividend by 146%, and now we're working on special dividends.  As we go forward, it is certainly our goal to continue to return meaningful cash back to the shareholders through the process. So, really, it's a pretty straightforward process if you think through it and the framework is pretty simple. And it's just a matter of giving us the ability to have the options to do the right thing to maximize total shareholder return.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Bill, thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Scialla, with Stifel, please go ahead.\nMichael Scialla: Hey, good morning, everybody and Bill, I'd like to offer my congratulations on a great career as well. I know it's too early to give details on 2022, but want to see if you could speak to at least at a high level given your outlook for flat to lower well costs next year. If you still see barrels held off the market by OPEC +, would you just look to hold production flattish, and could you do that with equal to lower capital than you spent this year.\nBill Thomas: Well, thank you very much again we appreciate your comments. It's a team effort in EOG. I'd tell you what, we've got a lot of great employees and a super management team. It's a team effort and it's been an honor to be able to work with everybody.  About 2022, it's really too early to talk about growth. We need to watch the pace of demand and recovery on the spare capacity drawn down. So we don't want to really speculate on anything specific for 2022, but I want to ask Ezra to make some additional color on that.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Michael. As Bill said, it's pretty early on 2022. It's still pretty early to discuss any type of growth. EOG is -- we're committed. We're not going to grow until the market clearly needs the barrels, and we've outlined what we're looking for. We're committed to staying disciplined.  And currently, we want to see demand return to pre-COVID levels, low spare capacity, and we want to see inventory data below the five-year average. Every year, market factors are going to determine the plan for that year.  And we're going to remain flexible and modify our plans to fit the market conditions. That be said, we have made great progress this year on our total well cost reduction. And going forward, that's strengthening the underlying capital efficiency of the Company and continuing to lower the cost base of the Company.  And so as we move forward, regardless of any type of growth rates, we've set the Company up with this double-premium investment plan to continue to expand the free cash flow generation potential of EOG.\nMichael Scialla: Okay. And I guess, really just my question there was, if you were to hold the production flat, it looks like the capital required to do that is not going up, at least over the next 12 to 18 months as you see the world now, is that fair to say?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Mike. That's certainly fair to say. I mean, we're reducing costs all the time and improving well productivity. So, we're hopeful that our maintenance costs in the future will be lower than it is today. And that's certainly directionally what we've done in the past, and that's hopefully what we're going to do in the future.\nMichael Scialla: Okay, great. And then I just want to follow up with Ken on a -- you mentioned the CCS pilot you have there. Is there any more detail you can offer Ken in terms of -- it sounds like it's EOG specific, at least at this point?  Can you talk about what the source of emissions are? Where you're focused within your footprint. And are you looking at storing CO2 in depleted fields or tilling out partners just any more detail you can give us there?\nKen Boedeker: Sure. Thanks for that question. At this point in time, we really don't anticipate any partners on our pilot project, but with our geologic and operational expertise, we'll evaluate partnering on future projects on a case-by-case basis.  This project is really part of our broader strategy of reduced capture and offset. And it's focused on capturing our CO2 emissions in an area where we can generate a return via some tax incentives, and have a concentrated stream of CO2 that can be aggregated to an injection well for permanent and secured geologic storage, in an interval of thousands of feet below the surface. And that's pretty much what we're giving out at this time.\nMichael Scialla: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from [Indiscernible] Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst 2: Good morning. To put you on the spot a little bit. You highlighted the various well cost categories, tubular sticks out as being both significant and also exposed to inflation. You tackled the problem last year with pre-purchasing. Can you throw out some ideas that the organization has come up with to attack that cost category?\nEzra Yacob: Billy, do you want to comment on that?\nBilly Helms: Yeah, good morning, Bob. Obviously, yes, steel costs are going up, which is affecting tubular costs. This last year, we were very fortunate to take advantage of pre-purchasing the tubular we needed for this year's program and benefited greatly from that.  As costs go up in the future, we use the same approach and try to take an opportunistic look at when to secure tubular for the next coming drilling program. And so, we'll continue to look at that. Undoubtedly, it's likely that the costs for tubular will be higher next year than they are this year, which is why in that slide number 10, we tried to give you some color.  On other ways, we're trying to keep our well cost flat to down going into next year and those come from the efficiencies we're seeing across the operation from drilling times to the implementation of our Super-Zippers technology on the completion side to newer contracts at lower rates for some of the services we have. So it's a mixture of things we use to offset those inflationary pressures that we see in the different parts of our business.\nUnidentified Analyst 2: Okay, that's clear. And just as a quick follow-up, could you contrast Super-Zippers the way you think about them versus say, a traditional zipper frac that we might think of where even a dual frac?\nBilly Helms: Sure. So our Super-Zipper technique is very similar to what the industry calls [Indiscernible]. The differences would be in how we actually implement it on a well-to-well basis. We keep very close control over the injection rates and pressures of individual wells within the Super-Zipper operation.  So it's a very scripted and very detailed procedure that allows us to control the rates and pressures, just like we're doing a conventional frac with any other fleet. But the advantage is of course being able to double the amount of stages you get in a particular day by attacking the locations two at a time.  And we really are advancing that technology quite a bit. Last year, we probably did less than 10% of our wells, across the Company benefited from Super-Zipper, this year, it's probably directionally closer to a third of the wells. And we expect that percentage to increase going into next year. We think it's going to give us tremendous cost advantages next year as we go into the program.\nUnidentified Analyst 2: Great, thanks for that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets, please go ahead.\nScott Hanold: Thanks. And Bill again. I also want to give you congratulations on your tenure. Obviously, you all navigated a lot of ups and downs over the past few years fairly successfully. So congrats for that.  I just have one question, and you all seem to be doing better than expected. I mean, certainly, it seems like production, especially oil production on the upper end of your range. And can you just give us some general thoughts, I know you're not in a position where you're going to talk to 2022 and how you think about growth?  If you are running a little bit ahead based on the outperformance of your wells, would you think about tapering as you get into 2022 a little bit just to maintain the flattish kind of production you all expected this year?\nEzra Yacob: Yeah, Scott, again, thank you so much for your comments. I'm going to ask Billy to comment on the remainder of this year and particularly the Fourth Quarter.\nBilly Helms: Yeah. Good morning, Scott. So, certainly, we're very pleased with the progress we've made on both reducing our well cost and the performance we're seeing from the wells we are bringing to production this year.  It's a testament to the strategy of shifting to the double-premium standard again. So, as you go into the rest of the year, we started out the year with a little bit higher activity level, we had a little bit higher rig count start of the year and this tapered off and we're running at a pretty consistent rate now and expect that to continue through the end of the year.  And then next year as Bill elaborated, it's hard to anticipate what we'll need this year, but I think the performance that we're seeing this year will continue into next year, certainly. And the pace of activity will be dictated by what we see in the market conditions. So that's the color I could give you. But our performance will continue to at least stay flat or improve.\nScott Hanold: Understood. Thank you for that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs and Company.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, team. And congratulations, Ezra. Congratulations, Bill. Bill, last Quarter, you talked a little bit about the analytics that you are building around monitoring the oil macro. I would love your latest real-time thoughts, a lot of moving pieces here. OPEC, demand uncertainty, barrels, U.S. supply, how are each of these parameters evolving here as you guys are evaluating them?\nBill Thomas: Yeah, Neil, as we've all seen, where definitely demand is on a strong recovery, it's a bit lumpy, obviously due to the virus resurgent in a few areas, but we expect -- even with that, we expect pre-COVID demand to be reached by early '22. Inventories are already below the 5-year average, really in the U.S. and in the world.  So that has already been checked. And on the supply side, as I said before, we believe that the U.S. will stay disciplined and that there'll be small growth in the U.S. next year, but not much growth.  And we've seen OPEC +, they look to be very solid. So they will continue to bring back on their shut-in volumes since fair capacity as needed gradually. If the recovery continues, like we expect, we see the spare capacity to be very low by the Second Quarter or by the middle of next year. We'll just have to watch and see how it goes but overall, we see a very positive macro-environment.\nNeil Mehta: The follow-up is just, as you think about the U.S. production profile, maybe you can get a little bit more granular in terms of how you're thinking about those volumes. But the question we continue to get asked is, where are we in terms of resource maturity?  Has the best of efficiencies been driven out of the shales? And maybe you talk about the Permian, the Eagle Ford, and the Bakken. What are you seeing in each of those plays? Where are we in terms of efficiencies? And then is the slowdown in U.S. production being driven by resource maturity or is it really being driven by capital discipline?\nBill Thomas: Yeah. We see we run the numbers on all the different groups from the privates to the publics to the majors, and in general, particularly in the private, we see definitely well productivity is going down, not up.  So, it takes a lot more wells for that group to maintain production or even think about growing it. And overall, in the other groups, not specifically EOG, but we generally see well productive -- well production to be flat to not improving over time.  And then -- so I think that is a function of resource maturity. I think when you get in down-spacing, and spacing, and in timing and all that, I think it's going to subdue that the productivity.  And so literally, in the biggest factor, of course, is in the capital discipline where you're spending tremendous amount of less cash flow than we've been spending in the previous year. So when you put all that together, we did not see and we think that discipline will remain with a route. We not -- we did not see the U.S. growing significantly next year. So that's a very positive, I think, for shareholders and positive for the macro.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Bill.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Thomas for any closing remarks.\nBill Thomas: In closing, I'd like to say thank you to all the EOG employees who continue to make EOG so successful. It's truly a privilege and an honor to be on the same team with each one of you. As Ezra transitions into the CEO role and Billy steps up to President and Chief Operating Officer, along with the rest of the senior management team, I could not be more excited about the future of the Company.  So to all shareholders and future shareholders, we want to tell you thanks for listening and certainly thank you very much for your support.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Thomas",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. And good morning, everyone. EOG is focused on improving returns. Results from the first half of the year are already reflecting the power of EOG shift to our double premium investment standard.  Once again, we posted outstanding results in the second quarter. We delivered adjusted Earnings of a $1.73 per share and nearly 1.1 billion of free cash flow repeating the record level of free cash flow we generated last Quarter.  Our outstanding operational performance included another beat of the high end of our oil production guidance, while capital expenditures and total per-unit operating costs were below expectations.  We're delivering the exceptional well productivity that continues to improve. In addition, even though the industry is in an inflationary environment, EOG continues to demonstrate the Company's unique ability to sustainably lower costs. Our performance clearly proves the power of doubling our reinvestment hurdle rate.  Double premium requires investments to earn a minimum of 60% direct after-tax rate of return using flat commodity prices of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. I'm confident our reinvestment hurdle is one of the most stringent in the industry and a powerful catalyst to drive future outperformance across key financial metrics, including a return on capital employed and free cash flow.  As double-premium improves our potential to generate free cash flow, we remain committed to using that cash to maximize shareholder value. The regular dividends, debt reduction, special dividends, opportunistic buybacks, and small high return bolt-on acquisitions are our priorities.  In the first half of this year, we reduced our long-term debt by 750 million and demonstrated our priority to returning cash, significant cash to shareholders with a commitment of 1.5 billion in regular and special dividends. We also closed on several low-cost, high potential bolt-on acquisitions, and the Delaware basin over the last 12 months.  Year-to-date, we have committed 2.3 billion to debt reduction in dividends, which is slightly more than a 2.1 billion of free cash flow we generated. Looking ahead to the second half of the year and beyond, our free cash flow priorities and framework have not changed.  As we generate additional free cash, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders in a meaningful way. We are focused on doing the right thing at the right time in order to maximize shareholder returns.  Over the last 4 years, we made huge progress, reducing our GHG and methane intensity rates, nearly eliminating routine flaring and increasing the use of recycled water in our operations. We're focused on continued progress towards reducing our GHG emissions in line with our targets and ambitions.  This quarter we announced the carbon capture and storage pilot project, which we believe will be our next step forward in the process of reaching our net 0 ambition. Ken will provide more color on this and other emission reduction projects in a few moments.  Driven by EOG's innovative culture, our goal is to be one of the lowest cost, highest return, and lowest emission producers, playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy. Now, here's Ezra to talk more about how our returns continue to improve. Thanks, Ken. In conclusion, I'd like to note the following important takeaways. First, by doubling our reinvestment standard, the future potential of our earnings and cash flow performance are the best they've ever been.  Results from the first half of this year demonstrate the power of double-premium and the beginning of another step change and performance. Second, EOG is not satisfied. We're committed to getting better. Sustainable Cost reduction and improving well performance are driving returns and free cash flow potential to another level.  At the same time, the same innovative culture that is driving higher returns is also improving our environmental performance Third, our commitment to returning cash to shareholders has not changed. As we have already demonstrated, returning meaningful cash to shareholders remains a priority.  And finally, as Ezra transitions into the CEO role, I could not be more excited about the future of the Company. The quality of our assets, and the quality of this leadership team are the best in Company history, all supported by EOG 's talented employees, and unique culture that continues to fire on all cylinders.  The Company is incredibly strong and our ability to get stronger has never been better. The future of EOG is in great hands. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A Yes, thanks, Leo. I'm going to ask Ezra to comment on that. Hi Leo, Billy Helms will comment on that. Yeah, Neal. We've outlined a very clear framework and we've consistently delivered on our priorities. And so maybe the best way to think about the future is to look at what we've done in the past. And I want to ask Ezra to give more color on that. Neal I think what we've outlined is we've got about 15 exploration wells built into the CapEx this year in the U.S. So I am going to ask Ezra to give us some more color on that. Yeah, Doug. Well, thank you very much. And you're right. I mean, the business has evolved over the last year since the shale business really started. And it's obviously it's moving in an incredibly great positive direction right now that the focus on returns, that we've always been I think a leader in focus on returns and we're super excited about that.  The capital discipline, spending well below cash flow and generating high returns, and giving a significant amount of cash back to shareholders, I think is certainly all very positive. And so I think really we're entering a super new era.  And I think it's more positive than it's ever been before. I think we, as an industry, are going to generate better returns and going to give more back to the shareholders. And I think we're in a more positive macro-environment than we've been in since really the shale business started. I think OPEC + is solid. I think the U.S. will remain disciplined. And so I think the industry is in for a long run of really good results. being able to have the opportunity to consider buying back shares and counter-cyclic environments where the market is not well and our sought process is significantly undervalued. Well, that would be an opportunity to consider buybacks.  In good times we think the special dividend is the way to go and that's what we're executing on now, and that's what we're hoping to continue to execute in the future. On the second part of your question, on the large-scale M&A, I'm going to ask Billy to think through that question and give his ceiling from that. Thanks, Bill. On the large-scale M&A, as Ezra just talked about a minute ago, certainly we're not interested in adding quantity to our inventory, but it's more about the quality of the assets we have. And as we think about forming maybe a potential larger JV, that same approach needs to apply.  As we look across the fence, if our assets are in, what we consider the core acreage position in the play, adding in acreage outside of that ring-fence would dilute our efforts. We've also taken, as you know -- taken a lot of efforts to build out infrastructure to make our -- to lower our unit cost and continue to improve our returns, and we build out that infrastructure to meet the volume expectations that we have for developing our acreage.  That may or may not apply as you add in additional acreage outside of that. I think each Operator looks at how to make the most efficient use of the acreage and their capital as they can, and forming JVs doesn't necessarily improve overall Company metrics.  So I think while we've looked at bolt-on as a way to shore up a lot of our core area acreage, I think that is a very applicable part of maybe thinking about JV expansions. Continuing to come up in your base areas where it adds the same quality, doesn't dilute your quality of the assets, but just expanding in a basin may or may not do that. Yeah, Arun. This is Bill. We've gotten enormously positive responses from every shareholder on the special dividend and that was a super hit. And they like our framework, when you really think through it, it's not really a complicated framework.  It's a framework where we want to be in a position to maximize total shareholder returns. And as I've said, be able to do the right thing at the right time. If you look at the history of what we've been doing really over the last several years, we've increased the regular dividend by 146%, and now we're working on special dividends.  As we go forward, it is certainly our goal to continue to return meaningful cash back to the shareholders through the process. So, really, it's a pretty straightforward process if you think through it and the framework is pretty simple. And it's just a matter of giving us the ability to have the options to do the right thing to maximize total shareholder return. Well, thank you very much again we appreciate your comments. It's a team effort in EOG. I'd tell you what, we've got a lot of great employees and a super management team. It's a team effort and it's been an honor to be able to work with everybody.  About 2022, it's really too early to talk about growth. We need to watch the pace of demand and recovery on the spare capacity drawn down. So we don't want to really speculate on anything specific for 2022, but I want to ask Ezra to make some additional color on that. Yeah, Neil, as we've all seen, where definitely demand is on a strong recovery, it's a bit lumpy, obviously due to the virus resurgent in a few areas, but we expect -- even with that, we expect pre-COVID demand to be reached by early '22.

            "name": "Ken Boedeker",
            "content": "Thanks, Billy. Earlier this year, we announced our net-zero ambition for our scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040. Our ambition is aggressive, but achievable and we expect it will be an iterative process requiring trial and error. This approach mirrors how we develop an oil and gas asset.  We pilot creative applications of existing and new technologies to determine the most effective solutions to optimize efficiencies by minimizing costs and maximizing recoveries of oil and natural gas. Here, we are aiming to maximize emissions reductions. We then apply the successful technologies and solutions across our operations where feasible.  Our net 0 strategy generally fall -- generally falls into three categories, reduce, capture, or offset. That is, we are focused on directly reducing emissions from our operations, capturing emissions from sources that can be concentrated for storage, and offsetting any remaining emissions.  Reducing emission's intensity from our operations is a direct and immediate path to reducing our carbon footprint. Our approach is to invest with returns in mind and seek achievable and scalable results.  We made excellent progress in the last four years through initiatives to upgrade equipment in the field, invest in pilots using existing and new technologies, and leverage our extensive big data platform to automate and redesign processes to improve emissions efficiencies.  As a result, since 2017, we have reduced our GHG intensity rate to 20%, our methane emissions percentage by 80%, and our flaring intensity rate by more than 50%. We recently obtained permits to expand the successful pilot of our closed-loop Gas Capture Project, which prevents flaring in the event of a downstream interruption.  We designed an automated system that redirects natural Gas back into our infrastructure system and inject the Gas temporarily back into existing Wells. The project requires a modest investment to capture a resource that would have otherwise been flared and stores it for further or for future production and beneficial use.  The result is a double-premium return investment that reduces flaring emissions. Our well-head gas capture rate was 99.6% in 2020 and rollout of additional closed-loop gas capture systems will hope capture more of the remaining 0.4%. Turning to our efforts to capture CO2, we're launching a project that will capture carbon emissions from our operations for long-term storage.  This project is designed to capture and store a concentrated source of EOG's direct CO2 emissions. We believe we can design solutions to generate returns from carbon capturing and storage by leveraging our competitive advantages in geology, facility design and field operations.  Our CCS efforts are directed at emissions from our operations, and we are not currently looking to expand those efforts into another line of business. We will provide updates on our pilot CCS Project as it progresses. EOG is also exploring other innovative solutions for GHG emissions reductions.  Over the past 18 months, we have deployed capital into several fuel substitution projects to power compressors used for natural gas pipeline operations and natural gas artificial lift. Compressors are the largest source of EOG 's stationary combustion emissions. By replacing NGL-rich field gas with lean residue gas.  EOG can reduce the carbon intensity of the fuel, which lowers CO2 emissions and improves engine efficiency. Using lean residue gas also earns a very favorable financial return by recovering the full value of the natural gas liquids versus using those components as fuel.  Another fuel substitution test we conducted recently was blending hydrogen with natural gas. While it is still in the early stages, we are analyzing the test data to evaluate the emissions reductions that would be possible from this blended fuel at an operational and economic scale.  We're very excited about this part of the business, just like cost reductions, well improvements, or exploration success. This is a bottom-up-driven initiative. EOG employees thrive on this type of challenge.  We create innovative solutions and applied technology to solve problems, improve processes, and optimize efficiencies while generating industry-leading returns. The EOG culture has embraced our 2040 net-zero ambition and we are focusing our efforts to minimize our carbon footprint as quickly as possible. Now, here's Bill to wrap up. Sure. Thanks for that question. At this point in time, we really don't anticipate any partners on our pilot project, but with our geologic and operational expertise, we'll evaluate partnering on future projects on a case-by-case basis.  This project is really part of our broader strategy of reduced capture and offset. And it's focused on capturing our CO2 emissions in an area where we can generate a return via some tax incentives, and have a concentrated stream of CO2 that can be aggregated to an injection well for permanent and secured geologic storage, in an interval of thousands of feet below the surface. And that's pretty much what we're giving out at this time."

            "content": "Thanks Ezra. Our operating teams continue to deliver strong results. Once again, we exceeded our oil production target, producing slightly more than the high end of our guidance, driven by strong well results. In addition, capital came in below the low end of our guidance as a result of sustainable well cost reductions.  We have already exceeded our targeted 5% well cost reduction in the first half of 2021. We now expect that our average well cost will be more than 7% lower than last year. As a reminder, this is in addition to the 15% well cost savings achieved in 2020.  We continue to see operational improvements outpace the inflationary pressure in the service sector. Average drilling days are down 11%, and the [treated] (ph) lateral completed in a single day increased more than 15%.  We are utilizing our recently discussed super-zipper completions on about a third of our well packages this year, and I expect that percentage to increase next year. In addition, our sand costs are flat to slightly down year-to-date.  We have a line of sight to reduce the cost of sand sourcing and processing and expect to start realizing savings in the second half of 2021, and into 2022. Water re-use is another source of significant savings, and we continue to expand and re-use infrastructure throughout our development areas.  Finally, we have renegotiated several of the expiring higher-price contracts for drilling rigs, and expect to see additional savings the remainder of this year and next. We also used the strength of our balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities to reduce future costs in several areas.  As an example, last summer we pre-purchased the tubulars needed for our 2021 drilling program when process were at their lowest point. EOG is not immune to the inflationary pressures we're seeing across our industry.  But this forward-looking approach helps EOG mitigate anticipated cost increases. As a reminder, 65% of our well cost are locked in for the year and the remaining cost, we're actively working down through operational efficiencies.  As usual, we have begun to secure services and products ahead of next year's activity with a goal of keeping well cost at least flat in 2022. But as you can rest assured that with our talented and focused operational teams, our ultimate goal is to always push well cost down each year.  The same amount of effort is being placed on reducing our per-unit operating cost with the results showing up in reduced LOE, driven mainly by lower workover expense, reduced water handling expense, and lower maintenance expenses.  Savings are also being realized from our new technology being developed internally to optimize our artificial lift. We have several new tools that help us reduce the amount of gas-lift volumes required to produce wells without reducing the overall production rate.  These optimizing tools not only reduce costs, but also help reduce the amount of compression horsepower needed, which ultimately reduces our greenhouse gas footprint as well. These and other continual improvements are great testament to our pleased, but not satisfied, culture.  This quarter, we can also update you on our final ESG performance results from last year. We reduced our greenhouse gas intensity rate 8% in 2020, driven by sustainable reductions to our flaring intensity.  Operational performance in the first half of this year indicates promise for future further improvements to our emission's performance in 2021, putting us comfortably ahead of pace to meet our 2025 intensity targets for GHG and methane, and our goal to eliminate routine flaring.  Achieving these targets is the first step on a path towards our ambition of net-zero emissions by 2040. Water infrastructure investments also continue to pay off. Nearly all water used in our Powder River Basin operations last year was sourced from reuse.  For Company-wide operations in the U.S., water supplied by reused sources last year increased to 46%, reducing freshwater to less than 1/5 of the total water used. These achievements and along with the insight into ongoing efforts to improve future performance, will be detailed in our sustainability report to be published in October.  We're starting to fill in the pieces on the roadmap to get to net-zero by 2040. Here's Ken with the details. Yeah. Good morning, Leo. It's strictly a function of moving to our double premium strategy. We saw a similar change if you remember back when we shifted to premium a few years ago and we're seeing that same compounding effect as we shift to double premium. The quality of our wells improves.  And as you noted, we have a history of continuing to focus on lowering well cost and just our continued effort in those areas. So it's not really attributable to one basin or the other, it's just a function of the impact of shifting to double-premium across our portfolio.  And I might add, as we look to add wells to the inventory of double-premium wells, [they will all be] (ph) in that same category to compete on both returns and finding costs. Yeah, good morning, Bob. Obviously, yes, steel costs are going up, which is affecting tubular costs. This last year, we were very fortunate to take advantage of pre-purchasing the tubular we needed for this year's program and benefited greatly from that.  As costs go up in the future, we use the same approach and try to take an opportunistic look at when to secure tubular for the next coming drilling program. And so, we'll continue to look at that. Undoubtedly, it's likely that the costs for tubular will be higher next year than they are this year, which is why in that slide number 10, we tried to give you some color.  On other ways, we're trying to keep our well cost flat to down going into next year and those come from the efficiencies we're seeing across the operation from drilling times to the implementation of our Super-Zippers technology on the completion side to newer contracts at lower rates for some of the services we have. So it's a mixture of things we use to offset those inflationary pressures that we see in the different parts of our business. Sure. So our Super-Zipper technique is very similar to what the industry calls [Indiscernible]. The differences would be in how we actually implement it on a well-to-well basis. We keep very close control over the injection rates and pressures of individual wells within the Super-Zipper operation.  So it's a very scripted and very detailed procedure that allows us to control the rates and pressures, just like we're doing a conventional frac with any other fleet. But the advantage is of course being able to double the amount of stages you get in a particular day by attacking the locations two at a time.  And we really are advancing that technology quite a bit. Last year, we probably did less than 10% of our wells, across the Company benefited from Super-Zipper, this year, it's probably directionally closer to a third of the wells. And we expect that percentage to increase going into next year. We think it's going to give us tremendous cost advantages next year as we go into the program. Yeah. Good morning, Scott. So, certainly, we're very pleased with the progress we've made on both reducing our well cost and the performance we're seeing from the wells we are bringing to production this year.  It's a testament to the strategy of shifting to the double-premium standard again. So, as you go into the rest of the year, we started out the year with a little bit higher activity level, we had a little bit higher rig count start of the year and this tapered off and we're running at a pretty consistent rate now and expect that to continue through the end of the year.  And then next year as Bill elaborated, it's hard to anticipate what we'll need this year, but I think the performance that we're seeing this year will continue into next year, certainly. And the pace of activity will be dictated by what we see in the market conditions. So that's the color I could give you. But our performance will continue to at least stay flat or improve."

Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman, and CEO; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; Ezra Yacob, President; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Jeff Leitzell, EVP, Exploration and Production. Lance Terveen, Senior VP Marketing, and David Streit, VP Investor and Public Relations. Here's Bill Thomas. Certainly, you can do that math, but it's more than that with us. As Ezra and Bill talked about further, we have to look at all of our priorities and the timing of those priorities to determine when and if there is another special dividend, or share repurchases, or bolt-on acquisitions. All those things are in play at all times.  And the 2 billion is not the end of the month number, it's during the cycles, so cash can vary tremendously during a month. The 2 billion is the low point during the month, it's not necessarily the end of a month. So you have to keep that in mind as well but yes, you can do that math. But that's not all there is to it.  We have to look at all of our priorities and where we're at in the cycle. And as it has been pointed out on Slide 6, we've already distributed more cash than we brought in, in the first half of the year. So we're well on our way to achieving that. As we move through the second half of the year, we'll look at what other cash is generated and we'll evaluate how to use that cash at that time."

            "content": "Thanks, Bill. While we announced our shift to the double premium investment standard at the start of this year the shift has been underway since 2016 when we first established our premium investments standard of 30% minimum direct after-tax rate of return using a conservative price deck of $40 Oil and $2.50 Natural gas for the life of the Well.  In the 3 years that followed, our premium drilling program drove 45% increase in earnings per share, a 40% increase in ROCE in an oil price environment, nearly 40% lower compared to the 3-year period prior to premium. This comparative financial performance can be reviewed on Slide 15 of our investor presentation.  In addition, premium enabled this remarkable step-change in our financial performance while reinvesting just 78% of our discretionary cash flow on average, resulting in $4.6 billion of cumulative free cash flow. The impact from doubling our investment hurdle rate from 30% to 60% using the same conservative premium price deck, is now positioning EOG for a similar step-change to our well productivity and costs, boosting returns, Capital efficiency, and cash flow.  Double Premium wells offer shallower production declines and significantly lower finding and development costs resulting in well payouts of approximately 6 months at current strip prices. The increase in capital efficiency resulting from reinvesting in these higher-return projects is increasing our potential to generate significant free cash flow.  This year, we're averaging less than $7 per barrel of oil equivalent finding cost. Adding these lower-cost reserves is continuing to drive down the cost basis of the company, and when combined with EOG's operating cost reductions, is driving higher full-cycle returns.  Looking back over the last 4 quarters, EOG has earned a 12% return on capital employed with oil averaging $52. We are well on our way to earning double-digit ROCE at less than $50 oil, and it begins with disciplined reinvestment, and higher return double premium drilling.  While EOG has 11,500 premium locations, approximately 5,700 are double premium wells located across each of our core assets. We're confident we can continue to grow our double premium inventory through organic exploration, improving well costs and well productivity, and small bolt-on acquisitions, just like we did with the premium over the last 5 years.  In the past 12 months, through 8 deals, we have added over 25,000 acres in the Delaware Basin through opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions at an approximate cost of $2500 per acre. These are low-cost opportunities within our core asset positions, which in some cases receive immediate benefit from our existing infrastructure.  Premium and now double premium established a new higher threshold for adding inventory. Exploration and bolt-on acquisitions are focused on improving the quality of the inventory by targeting returns in excess of the 60% after-tax rate of return hurdle.  EOG 's record for adding high-quality, low-cost inventory, predominantly through organic exploration, is why we do not need to pursue expensive large M&A deals. 2021 is turning into an outstanding year for EOG. Our exceptional well-level returns are translating into double-digit corporate returns. And our employees continue to position EOG for long-term shareholder value creation. Here's Billy with an update on our operational performance. Leo, you described that very well. These are smaller deals, as I highlighted. It's 25,000 acres across 8 different deals that we've captured and put together over the past 12 months. And these are low-cost opportunities in our core positions within the Delaware Basin.  And typically, these are things that are either contiguous with our pre-existing acreage position or very, very close to our acreage position. And so there's not a lot of outside competition. A lot of times, by all regards, we're the partner that makes sense to go ahead and get these deals because like I said, we have the surrounding wells information, seismic, and oftentimes some of these deals can go immediately right into our existing infrastructure. We highlighted the last 12 months but we wanted to give a sense of the type of scale and the impact that these low-cost opportunities can have when we're focused on them. And these deals are pretty continuous throughout all of our plays and throughout the year. Yes, Neal. In our investor presentation there on slide 5 & 6, I think we can reference that. This year we've been very successful executing on all of our cash flow priorities in the framework that we've laid out.  We've been able to increase the regular dividend by 10%, which we feel is our primary motive of capital return. Secondly, we're able to reduce our debt earlier this year by $750 million by retiring a bond.  And then third, we just paid a $600 million special dividend on July 30th of this year, which we had announced during the last earnings call. So our year-to-date free cash flow commitment is $2.3 billion, which is slightly more than the 2.1 billion we generated. And going forward, our framework and priorities have not changed.  Lastly, we also highlighted in the opening remarks, as we just spoke about a little bit with Leo, some of the small bolt-on acquisitions we've done, which is one of the avenues to growing our inventory, and that's really the -- where the entire process begins, is having the depth in quality of inventory to continually improve the business.  And with our shift to drilling these double-premium wells, the free cash flow potential, the Company continues to expand and as it does, and as we realize the cash, we're well-positioned to continue executing on our priorities.  We're committed to creating the most shareholder value and our cash return strategy is really a reflection of that. So, as the Company continues to improve, we're excited about that potential. Yes, Neal. The exploration prospects are all moving forward. As we discussed on the last call, the prospect have all started to move at different phases, really as a result of some of the slow down during COVID and during 2020.  As Bill just mentioned, we're planning on drilling 15 wells outside of the publicly discussed assets. Some of these, in some of the prospects, our initial exploration wells. Some of them are more what we'd call appraisal wells, evaluating the repeatability of these plays.  We're still leasing across many of the plays as well. And as we've discussed, the opportunities are really targeting a higher quality rock and what's typically been drilled horizontally That's an outgrowth of a lot of technical work we've done across multiple basins to combine modern drilling and completions technologies, and apply those to reservoirs that have been traditionally overlooked.  And really, we're very happy with our progress to date and we look forward to sharing additional information at an appropriate time. Yes, Doug. No, we're not evaluating any large acquisition packages at this time. We're focused on these small high-return bolt-on acquisitions. And as discussed in opening remarks, the larger expense of M&A deals, the opportunity struggled to compete with the existing return profile that we have within the Company due to either high PDP costs, the high acreage costs, or both.  Oftentimes the acreage being marketed might be additive to the quantity of our inventory, but not additive to the quality. And as we've discussed we're always working to improve the quality of our assets.  We're having great success with the small bolt-on acquisitions. We're feeling very confident with our ability to increase the quality of our deep inventory through our organic exploration program. And so we're excited about our prospects there. Yeah, Paul. On the first question, I think it's super important and I think we've already shared this. Our -- we've got a very clear framework and we've consistently delivered, as you pointed out on that framework, and significantly given a lot of money back to shareholders.  And going forward, our framework and priorities are not changed at all. So, as we generate additional free cash flow, we're committed to returning cash to shareholders in a very meaningful way.  It's really all about doing the right thing at the right time. As the Company continues to improve, we're excited about our potential to increase total shareholder return. And in the framework, we do have the option for opportunistic buybacks as long as -- along with special dividends, and so we look at opportunistic buybacks as Yes, Michael. As Bill said, it's pretty early on 2022. It's still pretty early to discuss any type of growth. EOG is -- we're committed. We're not going to grow until the market clearly needs the barrels, and we've outlined what we're looking for. We're committed to staying disciplined.  And currently, we want to see demand return to pre-COVID levels, low spare capacity, and we want to see inventory data below the five-year average. Every year, market factors are going to determine the plan for that year.  And we're going to remain flexible and modify our plans to fit the market conditions. That be said, we have made great progress this year on our total well cost reduction. And going forward, that's strengthening the underlying capital efficiency of the Company and continuing to lower the cost base of the Company.  And so as we move forward, regardless of any type of growth rates, we've set the Company up with this double-premium investment plan to continue to expand the free cash flow generation potential of EOG. Yes, Mike. That's certainly fair to say. I mean, we're reducing costs all the time and improving well productivity. So, we're hopeful that our maintenance costs in the future will be lower than it is today. And that's certainly directionally what we've done in the past, and that's hopefully what we're going to do in the future. Billy, do you want to comment on that? Yeah, Scott, again, thank you so much for your comments. I'm going to ask Billy to comment on the remainder of this year and particularly the Fourth Quarter."

Here is Bill Thomas.\nBill Thomas: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. EOG is delivering on our free cash flow priorities and our strategy to maximize long-term shareholder value. Yesterday, we declared a $1 per share special dividend to demonstrate our commitment to returning cash to shareholders. Combined with the regular dividend, we expect to return $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends in 2021. Double-premium well productivity and cost reductions are substantially improving our returns and increasing our ability to generate significant free cash flow. In order to maximize long-term shareholder value, we will remain flexible as we carry out our free cash flow priorities in the future. By doubling our reinvestment standard, the future potential of our earnings and cash flow performance are the best they've ever been. This quarter, we generated a quarterly record $1.1 billion of free cash flow and earned $1.62 per share of adjusted net income, the second highest quarterly earnings in company history. In addition, our balance sheet is in superior site with a peer leading low net debt to cap ratio. Next, Ezra will review our capital allocation strategy in more detail. Billy will go over our operational performance, and Tim will cover our financial performance before I make a few closing remarks. And here is Ezra.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Bill. Yesterday, dividend announcement is just the latest in a long line of achievements that demonstrate the value of EOG's fundamental strategy of returns-driven capital allocation, including the impact of permanently raising our investment return hurdle rate for the second time in five years. In 2016, during the last downturn, we established our premium investment strategy, which requires a 30% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. The premium investment strategy drove a step-change in our capital efficiency and resulting financial performance. It is the reason we entered 2020 in a position of operational and financial strength, which enabled us to generate positive adjusted net income and free cash flow in a year of unprecedented oil volatility and prices that averaged just $39. This year, we increased the return hurdle once again, doubling it to 60% at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. Sustainable improvements in our inventory of drilling locations and continued progress in exploration have paved the transition to double-premium. The data driving our confidence to make this move is illustrated on Slide 6 of our investor presentation, which details the return profile of every drilling location. Half our current inventory earns at least two times the premium return hurdle rate we established back in 2016. 5,700 double-premium locations is more than 10 years' worth of inventory at our current pace of drilling and is more than we had when we made the transition of Premium five years ago. Just like we did with our Premium inventory, we are confident we can replace our double-premium locations faster than we drill them through line of sight into additional cost reductions that will increase the returns of existing inventory and through exploration. A number of innovations. which Billy will discuss in a moment, are being piloted across our operating areas, and will sustainably drive down both well costs and operating costs as we implement them throughout the company. Our exploration program is focused exclusively on prospects that will improve on that 60% median return. In fact, our anticipated return on the current slate of new exploration plays is more than 80%. To see the impact of our premium returns focused capital allocation strategy, a closer look at our corporate financial performance is required. As we replace our production base by drilling locations with higher well-level returns, the price required to earn 10% return on capital employed continues to fall. Prior to establishing Premium, EOG required oil prices upwards of $80 to earn a 10% ROCE. As the Premium strategy matured, the oil price needed to earn 10% ROCE came down and averaged just $58 the last four years. This trend is illustrated on Slide 9 of our investor presentation. For 2021 that price is just $50 and we're not stopping there. We expect it will continue to fall as our well-level returns improve. The impact of reinvesting at higher returns is also showing up in our free cash flow performance. We more than doubled the dividend over the last four years and improved our balance sheet, reducing net debt by nearly $3 billion. As a result, net debt to total capital at the end of last year was just 11%, but our future financial performance potential is the real prize. Our first quarter results are a preview of what we are aiming for. Over the coming years, we expect reinvesting in our current inventory of high-return wells will continue to lower the corporate decline rate and compound the value of our low-cost operating structure. The result leads to higher margins and generates even more free cash flow, providing us tremendous opportunity to create long-term shareholder value. We believe when we look back in a few years, it will be viewed as the catalyst for another step change improvement in EOG's financial performance. Our fundamental strategy of returns-driven capital allocation remains consistent, and consistency is key prioritizing reinvestment and high-return projects is the driver behind the steady improvements we've made year after year. As a result, we are now in a position to follow through on our commitment to return additional free cash flow to shareholders. Looking ahead, you can expect our priorities to remain consistent, investing in high returns, generating significant free cash flow to support a sustainable and growing dividend while maintaining a strong balance sheet followed by opportunistic return of additional free cash flow to investors and bolt-on acquisitions. Now here is Billy.\nBilly Helms: Thanks, Ezra. The first quarter of the year was about execution. We exceeded our oil target producing more than the high end of our guidance range because wells that were offline due to the winter storm, Uri, recovered a bit faster than expected. As a result, our first quarter daily production declined just 3% compared to the fourth quarter last year. Our capital for the quarter came in under our forecasted target by 6%, mainly due to improvements in well cost across the company. The savings realized during the first quarter are in addition to the tremendous 15% reduction last year. EOG is on track to reduce well cost another 5% this year, despite some potential inflationary pressure as the industry activity resumes. Similar to previous quarters, these results are driven through innovation and efficiency gains in each phase of our operation. A closer look at our operations will help explain why we are confident, we can once again lower well cost. Our drilling teams are consistently achieving targeted depths faster with lower cost. The constant focus on daily performance and reliability of the tools and technical procedures is creating this continual drive towards lower cost. Some of the benefits this year stemmed from larger groups of wells per pad simply requiring less rig move cost per well and increasing efficiencies locked offline cementing. The larger well pads also complement our completion operations through the increased ability to utilize the technique we call Super zipper. We began our initial experiments with this technique back in 2019, and it has since advanced to consistently deliver the expected well results at lower cost. We have also learned that super zipper is particularly well suited to optimize the efficiencies of our five electric frac fleets. However, conventional spreads gain efficiencies as well. This practice involves using a single spread of pressure pumping equipment to complete four more wells on a single pad. We split the equipment's capacity in half simultaneously pumping on two wells, while conducting wireline operations on the remaining wells. We piloted and perfected a super zipper logistics in our Eagle Ford play and the collaboration between operating areas has accelerated its adoption throughout the company. And in cases where a minimum of four wells cannot be physically be located on a single pad, the engineering teams are working to develop new techniques where we can still utilize this improved completion practice. Completion costs are also benefiting from reduced sand and water costs through our integrated self-sourcing efforts. The savings we realized by installing water reused pipelines and facilities saves about 7% of well cost compared to third-party sourcing and disposal. Longer-term, we expect water reuse and disposal infrastructure will continue to lower lease operating expense in each area as well. Lease operating expenses also benefited from lessons learned through the pandemic this last year. The number of wells one lease operator can maintain has increased by as much as 80% by optimizing the use of innovative software designed and built by EOG. The software prioritizes lease operator activity throughout the day using our mobile and real-time software infrastructure. Our experienced last year inspired a number of new ideas to further high grade at least operators work activity throughout the day, which we believe may continue to expand productivity in day-to-day field operations. Slide 35 of our investor presentation illustrates the consistent progress we have made year-after-year on productivity all powered by innovative ideas, generated bottom up by employees. Each of our operating - active operating areas functions as an individual incubator to test out new ideas, many of which have our homegrown innovation from EOG employees and rollout companywide, if successful. That's one of the primary reasons, our well cost improvements every year are never won silver bullet, but a list of small to medium-sized individual improvements across all elements of total well costs that results in sustainable cost reduction. As a result of the innovation spreading throughout the company to reduce capital and operating cost, I have strong confidence that the cost structure and capital efficiency of the company will continue to improve. Here's Tim to review our financial position.\nTim Driggers: Thanks, Billy. Yesterday's special dividend announcement marks another milestone in the growth of EOG's profitability and cash flow. We achieved this milestone through the disciplined execution of consistent long-term return focused strategy for capital allocation supported by a strong balance sheet. Over time, the strategy has produced increasing amounts of free cash flow. The top priorities for the allocation of that free cash flow remain sustainable dividend growth and debt reduction. The shift to Premium in 2016, drove a significant improvement in returns, profit margins, and cost enabling the significant increase in the dividend over the last four years. Since 2017, the dividend has grown from $0.67 per share to $1.65 per share, now an annual commitment of almost $1 billion. Going forward, our goal is to continue growing the regular dividend. We have never cut or suspended the dividend and we remain committed to its sustainability. With the shift to double-premium we're now focused on making another step-change improvement, and the results of those efforts will guide future common dividend increases, and the potential for special dividends. Since the shift to Premium we have also retired bond maturities totaling about $2 billion, with plans to retire another $1.25 billion in 2023 when the bond matures. Net debt to total capitalization was 8% at the end of the first quarter. A strong balance sheet with low debt has been as the heart of EOG's strategy throughout our existence. It's not just conservatism is about creating a strategic advantage. Our superior balance sheet enables us to acquire high-return assets at marvelous cycle prices where the exploration acreage like the Eagle Ford or for the new players we're working on today bolt-on acquisitions are companies like the Yates acquisition five years ago. A strong balance sheet also gives us the financial strength to be a partner of choice in our operations, whether it is with marketing or export agreements, service providers or even other companies and other countries in locking - unlocking new plays. Strong balance sheet extends to ensuring ample liquidity, which we have also secured with no near-term debt maturities, $3.4 billion of cash on hand and a $2 billion unsecured line of credit. Now, EOG is positioned to address other free cash flow priorities by returning additional cash to shareholders. The $1 per share special dividend follows through on these consistent long-tailed priorities. At $600 million this special dividend is a meaningful amount, while also aligning with our other priorities. After paying the special dividend we will have $2.8 billion of cash on hand, a full $800 million above our minimum cash target. This is a healthy down payment on the $1.25 billion bond maturing in two years. Going forward, our free cash flow priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to monitor the cash position of the company, oil and gas prices and of course our own financial performance. As the excess cash becomes available in the future, we will evaluate further special dividends or at the right time opportunistic share repurchases or low-cost bolt-on property acquisitions. I think it goes without saying you should expect us to avoid expensive corporate M&A. You can count on EOG to continue following our consistent strategy to maximize long-term shareholder value. Now here's Bill to wrap up.\nBill Thomas: Thanks, Tim. In conclusion, I would like to note the following important takeaways. First true to the EOG culture our employees have fully embraced doubling our investment hurdle rate. As we drill more double-premium wells, we expect our performance will continue to improve, our decline rate will flatten, our breakeven oil price will decline, our margins will expand and the potential for free cash flow will increase substantially. Second, while our new double-premium hurdle rate alone will drive significant improvement it represents just one source. We never quit coming up with new ways to increase productivity and lower costs. Innovative new ideas and improved technology are developing throughout the company at a rapid pace, and we will continue to result in even higher returns in the future. And finally our special dividend this quarter, we're demonstrating our commitment to generating significant free cash flow and using that free cash to improve total shareholder returns. We are more excited than ever about the future of EOG, and our ability to deliver and maximize long-term shareholder value. Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: Yes. Good morning.\nBill Thomas: Hello, Scott.\nScott Gruber: So, the most common question we received, I know you touched on it a bit in the prepared remarks which is the framework that you guys used to determine that the $1 special dividend was the right amount, now is the right time. Can you just elaborate on that a little bit more around the framework and the timing, obviously, folks are trying to get a sense of whether the special dividend can repeat in the future?\nBill Thomas: Yes, Scott. Certainly, we're demonstrating our commitment to our shareholders by returning significant amount of cash back to them. And the $1 per share, I think is a very significant number, and large enough to be very meaningful. And I'm going to ask Tim to kind of go through some of the numbers to give you a little bit of the background on the reason that we pick this number.\nTim Driggers: Thanks, Bill. So, going back to our priorities over time, it's consistent within our priorities. If you look back to our regular dividend has increased to 146%, since 2017, that's one of our highest priorities. We reduced debt by $2.1 billion. So that set us up to be in a position to now return more cash to the shareholders. When we looked at our cash position, we were sitting with $3.4 billion of cash. So returning $600 million at this point in time, as Bill pointed out, is a significant amount, and it follows through on our long-held plan to return cash to the shareholders. So it simply following through on what we've been committed to for a long time.\nBill Thomas: I want to add, Scott. Going forward, our free cash flow priorities and framework haven't changed. And so, you have to put the special dividend in context with our total framework. And just a reminder, we've already said this, but our first priority is a sustainable dividend growth. We believe the regular dividend is absolutely best way to give cash back to shareholders, and we certainly are working on that and have worked, we got a great history of doing that. And then the next one is debt reduction and we've got a little work left to do that as Tim noted in his opening remarks. Our next options are the special dividend and certainly and favorable times what we have right now those are the things that we are doing. And then we'll also - we want to keep in mind the potential for opportunistic share repurchases in downturns, counter cyclic opportunities and share repurchases. And then after that, we also want to be able to consider high return bolt-on acquisitions, and these are acquisitions that go in our best operating areas obviously where we've got a lot of synergy, and a lot of ability to move quickly and drill wells. And some of them could be in our new exploration plays where we can capture a very high potential acreage at very low cost. And so, we'll just continue to evaluate all these options and work with this framework, and we'll evaluate the best use of cash on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We have a dynamic business environment, all the time. So it's important to have the flexibility to use the cash in a way that creates the most shareholder value.\nScott Gruber: Got it. And then my follow-up relates to the growth strategy in 2022 and beyond. The oil markets have healed next year and you guys have been very explicit around the factors you're looking at, and you laid out the 8% to 10% growth case on your last call. But there seems to be some discussion around - now around the potential for a middle ground, if you will, maybe some growth case below that 8% to 10%. So I just wanted to hear your latest thoughts around 2022, if the oil markets have healed, and it's time to grow again. What is the right growth cadence? What factors are you looking at to determine that rate of growth if the markets have healed, is there a middle ground somewhere between 0% and 8% to 10%, or is it just if it's time to grow, we're going to grow at 8% to 10%?\nBill Thomas: Yes, thanks, Scott, for that question. We want to make sure we're really clear on that. And I think we have, we're not going to grow until demand is recovered to pre-COVID levels and which is it's on the way to do that. I think everybody can see that, and we want to make sure that obviously world inventories U.S. inventories are below the five-year average. And then we're looking for spare capacity to be certainly a lot lower than it is right now. And that just means, not a lot of oil shut into match supply and demand. And every year, the market factors that year going into that year will determine our plans. And so, we want to be flexible, and we want to be able to - and we will modify our growth plans to fit those market conditions. If we need to grow at a lower rate or no growth at all like we are doing this year, whatever that right growth plan is, whatever fits the market conditions that's what we want to do. Above all, everything else we are committed to staying very disciplined and not forcing oil into a market that's not ready.\nScott Gruber: Got it. Thank you. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: The next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nArun Jayaram: Yes, I guess my first question is kind of to dovetail on the special dividend talk. Bill, this year you've guided to $3.4 billion in free cash flow, $1.5 billion for dividends, another $750 million for debt you've already paid down? So that leave a little bit more than $1.1 billion of free cash flow, and I know you're above your minimal cash target. So I guess the question is, how are you gauging the market for bolt-ons versus potentially if the oil price holds up here in terms of looking at more cash return this year?\nBill Thomas: Yes, thanks, Arun. We take the - we evaluate where we are every quarter. I can't give you any specific on anything, but we evaluate where we are every quarter, and we're constantly looking at bolt-on potential and evaluating that. So we want to make sure we leave room to fully consider that something that would make a very significant difference in the future of the company, upgrade our high-quality premium, double-premium inventory, we want to do that. So, we're very fortunate we've got a lot of cash and we've got a lot of \u2013 hopefully, we believe a lot of cash coming. So that's a lot of great opportunities for us to consider additional special dividends, bolt-on acquisitions, et cetera. And we keep in mind, as Tim talked about, we want to keep in mind our debt reduction targets in a year and then and excuse me, in 2023, and also be able to continue to think about growing our regular dividend. So we'll just keep all those in the proper framework and you just need to know that we're committed to doing the right thing at the right time for the shareholders to be able to maximize the total shareholder value.\nArun Jayaram: Great and my follow-up, Bill you cited this is being the company's best free cash flow quarter in history. But I wanted to see if you could provide a little bit more detail on how the unique pricing conditions for natural gas given winter storm, Uri some of your leverage to JKM. How that contributed to the free cash flow? How would you call that out? I know there are some incremental costs, but what was the puts and take on the gas price this quarter?\nBill Thomas: I'm going to ask Tim to give some details on that. But just before turning it over to Tim, everybody needs to know the special dividend had nothing to do with the storm in the natural gas process. Well Tim, you'll give some detail?\nTim Driggers: Sure. When you boil everything down the effects of Uri was about $40 million to cash flow, and net income in the quarter. Obviously, they're a big component in there, but that's the bottom line. It was very immaterial to our cash flow, our net income.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nScott Hanold: Thanks. First and foremost, I want to - I appreciate you're very direct commentary on your desire not to grow, and what the plan is. So hopefully that does clear the air a bit. What I'm wondering is strategically if we do stay in sort of the current environment, whether it's '22, or even beyond you all do build a lot of free cash flow. I mean we're talking what something around $3 billion even after your base dividend annually. Do you all see if there is a benefit into setting up a more predictable return to cash, cash return to shareholders, like some of your other peers did. Do you think there is a benefit to that predictability? Or would you rather see that more opportunistic?\nBill Thomas: Yes, Scott. We were always in a very dynamic business environment. So it's important, we believe to have the flexibility to use of cash in a way that creates the most shareholder value. We are - one of the reasons we don't - the biggest reason we don't want to get into a strict formula because we don't want to be put in the position to where we're growing oil say at 5% when the market clearly does not need more oil. So we want to be in a position to where we can do the right thing at the right time and to maximize the use of the cash in our plan to maximize shareholder value.\nScott Hanold: Thank you for that. And my next question, maybe this one's for Ezra. You all talked about shifting to double-premium that's generated significant increases to EURs, that Page 8 shows just a massive uptick. Did you all have any color on how much of that is organic versus mix shift? I would assume the shift to relatively more Permian has relative to say, Eagle Ford has buys that upward. But do you have a sense on how much is mix shift versus organic?\nEzra Yacob: Yes Scott, thanks for the question. This is Ezra. Yes, definitely in the Permian we have a higher percentage of those 5,700 double-premium locations are located in the Permian, but part of that is simply just because we have so many targets that are capture there in the Delaware Basin. What I would say is we have a fairly wide variety and fairly distributed variety of double-premium wells across our entire portfolio, including the Eagle Ford, the recently announced Austin Chalk, Dorado play, and the Powder River Basin as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I apologize. I was just taking off my headset. Bill or Ezra, I wonder if I could press on Scott's point. I'm afraid I'm not quite where Scott isn't thinking this draws a line under the growth story. So my question is real simple. You currently have one of the lowest free cash flow yields in the sector arguably a reflection of your share price, but my point is that everyone has got the capacity to spend more money. What happens to your 10% return at $50 oil, if the whole industry follows, you're leading goes back to a 10% growth rate?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Doug. I want to make it really clear. We're not stuck on 10% growth rate, or 8% growth rate. We are totally focused on making sure we do the right thing at the right time. So we, the oil price does not guide how much we're going to grow. It's the market fundamentals. And so we're really focused on that we've laid out a - I think a strong set of fundamentals that we're focused on and we will adjust our plan each year, which means our growth plan each year to those market fundamentals, and maybe certainly and we - next year that we don't grow at all. We may grow at 4%, 5%. We'll just have to see what the market's fundamental show.\nDoug Leggate: That's actually great answer, Bill. It's not seven stone is kind of what I was really trying to get to. My follow-up is Ezra very quickly. 10 years of inventory double-premium at the current pace, if you do choose to go back to growth one assumes that 10 years shrink some. So can you talk about the sustainability, and how that hold up plays into again - how you think about that activity level? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nEzra Yacob: Yes. Doug. That's a good question. Similarly, as we've done over the past few years, we're consistently focused on getting better year-after-year. And so by driving down well costs through sustainable well cost reductions, some of which Billy spoke to in opening remarks, but also through applying technology and innovations to increase the well productivity gains, we're able to convert some of our existing inventory every year into that double-premium metric. In addition of that we have few other avenues. The first, which Bill has touched on is bolt-on acreage acquisition opportunities in areas of preexisting development, but then also our exploration effort. And as I talked about in the opening comments our exploration effort is really focused on, again making another step change to our current inventory. It's focused on adding low decline, high impact plays that really increase the overall return profile of the company. And again, regardless of any growth rate when you're reinvesting in higher return opportunities and adding lower-cost reserves to your company, you're really driving down the cost base to the company year-after-year and that's essentially what translates into our corporate financials and allows us to lower that price required for a double-digit ROCE every year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nNeal Dingmann: Guys, my first question is around how you look at your reinvestment rate? I'm just wondering, number one, could you talk about at sort of current strip, how you see the reinvestment, and again let's assume another $5 or so higher, what would that do to that?\nBill Thomas: Yes. Neal. Thanks for the question. We're going to ask Billy to comment on that.\nBilly Helms: Yes. Thanks, Neal. You know for the reinvestment rate, we're always looking at as Bill already mentioned earlier, what's the market look like and what is the need for all in. We're not - certainly not going to grow into a market that need the oil as he pointed out and just trying to make sure re-emphasize that point. And then in going forward each year, we will do the same thing, we always do. We kind of see where the market is, and what the prices are and what are opportunities are to develop our assets, and we balance that against the cash needs of the company. So, it's not really a straight formula, it's more about where the market is at that current time.\nNeal Dingmann: I'm glad to hear that. I wish more others would say the same. And then just a follow-up. Could you talk about, I would call this question more on sort of your regional allocation process. I know Bill, you talked about sort of the new hurdles, the Premium locations, but I'm just wondering, how does that factor in when you've got some exciting, but not quite as developed areas like in the PRB. But I think it have a high potential, but if you just strictly looking at maybe what they produce immediately might not compete. So I'm just wondering how do you factor in some of those high-potential wells with this plan?\nBilly Helms: Yes, Neal, this is Billy again. Let me take a stab at that. So as we look at all of our assets, that's the beauty of having a decentralized culture where we are focused on multiple plays across our portfolio. You have plays that are in different phases of their life cycle as you might think about it as you just said it like the Eagle Ford is a more mature play. It's had a growth for about 10 years. It's further down that maturity window than say that the Delaware Basin. And then the Powder River Basin is certainly in early maturing or early growth phase play. So each one of those we certainly go in with the idea of delineating the play first, putting in the infrastructure to drive down our cost over time, and then maximize returns. So each one of those have a different lifecycle that commands a different amount of investment and overall though, the company is able to maintain a very steady pace of activity and future value creation through that the way we operate the company.\nOperator: The next question is from Leo Mariani of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nLeo Mariani: I am spending here. So everything that just based on your guidance, your CapEx is picking up on here in the second quarter. I just wondered what was sort of driving that, I wasn't sure what was time causing up?\nBilly Helms: Yes, Leo, this is Billy. So the guidance on the CapEx, it's up a little bit in the second quarter relative to the first quarter is simply the timing of when wells are available to be completed. So we'll have a little bit more completion activity in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter. That's simply yes. I think in general will have about 50%, 52% of our CapEx spend in the first half. The remaining to be spent more ratably through the rest of the year and the volumes will be really pretty much keeping with that 440,000 barrels a day, per quarter average the rest of the year. So it's a - we will be maintaining 440,000 barrels a day each quarter going forward.\nLeo Mariani: Okay, that's helpful for sure. And just wanted to ask on the exploration plays. If I'm not wrong, I think you guys are certainly devoting more capital there particularly to the drill bit in 2021 here. I just wanted to confirm you guys kind of drilling out multiple plays at this point. I think you did a little bit of that in the last couple of years as well. And as a result maybe just can you kind of speak to high level, what your competences, and being able to prove some of these up in the next year?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Leo. This is Ezra. I appreciate the question. Yes, on our exploration plays, you're right, we're - we've allocated about $300 million to the exploration effort this year. Over the last few years, we've done a little bit of drilling, it was dominantly kind of leasing, putting some of the acreage together and then, of course, there was a pullback here in 2020 due to the reduction in capital allocation associated with the downturn in prices and COVID. But this year we are back to drilling multiple prospects. We're at a point where the prospects have started to move at different phases, I would say. We're drilling exploration wells across some of the prospects, across others we're into more of what I'd call appraisal wells, and we're feeling very confident with where we're at, the results that we're seeing, and we hope to be able to provide some results on that soon.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeanine Wai of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJeanine Wai: Maybe a question for Ezra, following up on exploration. You're in Oman now, and I believe we saw last month that you paid a nominal amount foreign interest in the Beehive oil prospects offshore Australia. So can you talk about what attracted you to Australia? And do you still have interest in other international plays?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Jeanine. That's a great question. This is Ezra. Yes, the opportunity there in Australia, as you mentioned, it's on the North West Shelf, obviously, everyone knows a very prolific hydrocarbon region. It's a shallow water opportunity that we've stepped into there, as you mentioned for a very low upfront cost. It's exposing us to a prospect that we think has the opportunity, the potential to be impactful to our company. It - we're forecasting it has the potential to really compete with our domestic returns, and what we have - the opportunity that we have here in Australia is really an outgrowth of our experience in Trinidad where for nearly 20 years, we've been operating in the shallow waters offshore of Trinidad, and really this is a geologic province, a type of play where the industry has really moved away from. And so we found ourselves as kind of a niche operator, and we've developed not only operational procedures but also some geologic techniques, where we think we can come into some of these shallow water prospects and make very, very good returns. The attractive thing about Australia again is not only does it fit into our experience level from the operations and technical perspective, but it has many off-take and oilfield service availability there. And of course the low cost of entry to an exciting amount of upside in the prospect.\nJeanine Wai: Okay. Interesting, while we looking for - my second question, and I apologize, and for beating the horse again on the - but on the special dividend the first section in the market is simply that net cash returns are consistent of formulaic. You can't capitalize on evaluation, you don't get credit for it, et cetera. With that in mind, you mentioned that you evaluate the health in the business every quarter, probably more frequently than that, and specifically when it comes to the special dividend can you just clarify, is it really a matter of just holding $2 billion minimum operating cash plus $800 million to $1.25 billion for this 2022 maturity? And then everything else kind of get paid out in due time, and it kind of needs to be meaningful. I know you also mentioned a couple of times having optionality for high return bolt-ons is also one of the priorities. So if you have any kind of commentary and a comfortable placeholder for that would be really helpful. Thank you.\nBill Thomas: Jeanine, Tim's given I think some answers for some of those on there. Yes, we want to keep ample cash on the balance sheet to run the business and that's around $2 billion. And then we have set aside, are looking at plans to reducing the $1.25 billion bond in 2023. So that's all fits in, and that's part of our evaluation of how we use the cash and when we use the cash. But really the special dividend just fits into the framework that we've already laid out in our commitment to giving back cash to shareholder. So we will look at our cash position, look at a bolt-on potential opportunities. They can truly be any size from a very small, we've done in the past $20 million - $30 million deal, but they could certainly be bigger than that, too. So we'll take all that, and working into our framework and evaluate where the company is, and the outlook for the business, and our goal is to continue to return cash to shareholders through that framework.\nOperator:\nQ - Charles Meade:\nCharles Meade: Yes, good morning Bill to you and your whole team there. I really just have one question, and it goes back to the some of your prepared comments Bill and more specifically share repurchases. Yes, I recognize that hasn't been your MO in the past, and they kind of have a bad reputation maybe because usually share repurchases wind up being pro-cyclical. In the way you talked about it you said for you, you would look at it in an opportunistic ways, the word I remember and you said in a downturn. And I guess my question is, it's easy to see a downturn in retrospect, right. Six months ago, you guys had a three handle on your stock. But it's hard to recognize when you're in it. So is there any guidepost that you can share about how you would recognize when you're in one of those downturns, so it's time to be opportunistic, or is it just one of the things, you know what, when you see it?\nBill Thomas: Yes Charles, I think you know, it goes right along with the supply-demand and market fundamentals analysis that we do. We can - we've gotten more sophisticated. We've got a very sophisticated model now developed through our information technology, and we're gaining a lot of confidence in it on being able to kind of be on top of the oil market and where it's headed and certainly the oil price that's the biggest indicator. But we, I think we'll be able to determine when is the right time, when is the opportunistic counter-cyclic time to maybe consider share about buybacks. And of course now we have a lot of cash on the balance sheet and we want to continue to watch that and keep that who will have an opportunity when we do have a downturn to have cash to do that, if that happens.\nOperator: The next question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, team and congrats on a good quarter here. The first question is Bill any updates on permitting on federal lands? And how that process has been to apply for new permits? And in general in your conversations with Washington does it seem like some of the risks around the federal lands exposure in the Delaware has diminished.\nBilly Helms: Yes, Neal, this is Billy Helms. So on the permits, the federal permit, certainly we were very active in obtaining permits prior to administration change just to protect our activity levels as since this moratorium has been lifted, we are receiving a steady stream of permits. The permit stream is coming very well. We're receiving permits in all of our areas too. So I think the working relationships we've been able to maintain with the regulators is, and working through the process with them has benefited, if it is real well. So we're not really seeing any restrictions there. And I think the Biden administration clearly as said that activity, he wants to maintain activity on valid leases. So we're very comforted by the fact that we'll be able to continue then.\nNeil Mehta: And the follow-up is just on the macro. You guys talked a little bit about the tools that you have to evaluate direction of oil price and the way things are trending. Bit curious if you could unpack what you're seeing real-time? And how you're thinking about the commodity price moving from here for both for oil and for natural gas?\nBilly Helms: Yes. Neil on oil and as we already talked about the fundamentals are definitely improving. It's been a little bouncy on the COVID recovery and oil demand, but we are seeing very, very steady improvements. I think we're up to maybe 95 million barrel a day. Demand right now we think maybe by the end of the year that we'll get to pre-COVID levels of somewhere around 100 million barrels a day. We'll just have to watch it and see. The inventories are dropping. And we think you know there'll be fairly consistent draws on inventory from here on out, especially during the summer pickup activity. And so that's all looking really good. And then the spare capacity you know is going fine. It's been extended in drawing out a little bit further than what it started out to be at the beginning of the year, but we believe again as demand picks up that's spare capacity will be put back online. I'm going to give you the data when everything is okay. We'll just have to watch and see it, but certainly everything is going in the right direction. And I think the market as oil prices have responded to that. I think it's that what we're saying, and seeing it's not different than what the consensus view is. On natural gas, we're mildly bullish. Inventories are low, and supply is less and demand is higher this year than the supply. So we're going to be entering the summer and particularly the fall of the year, and it was pretty low inventories. So depending obviously is always depends on the weather on gas. And so, we'll just have to see how all that turns out, but we're optimistic on gas also.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Scialla of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMichael Scialla: Yes, good morning, everybody. You highlighted for quite a long time, your ESG sustainability ambitions. Just wanted to see where you stand on the price on carbon, or carbon tax? And do you see any economic opportunities in the energy transition for EOG?\nBill Thomas: Yes, Michael I'm going to ask Ken Boedeker to talk on that. Just before he starts so - the carbon tax or issues like that we're going to leave those up to the legislatures and not come out with our opinions on that. We'll work with whatever transpires on that. So, Ken you want to talk about other opportunities?\nKen Boedeker: Yes, we really have no interest in lower - in our lower return business that this might lead to, but we've really made excellent progress in reducing our emissions over the last four years, and you can see that with our intensity rates coming down as indicated in the attached slides that we've got on the presentation there. We're focused on reducing our own emissions with projects that have competitive returns before we consider a second phase of applying technology such as carbon capture to reduce our emissions. And we do believe that we can use 1% to 2% of our capital budget every year to make a substantial progress towards our goals of no routine flaring by 2025, and it's been endorsed by the World Bank, and our ambition of Scope one and two net-zero by 2040.\nMichael Scialla: Okay, thank you. And Bill, you mentioned some of the things you're doing to lower well cost, the larger pads and the Super-Zippers. Some of your competitors have talked about three-mile laterals in the Permian. I think you guys have done some two-mile plus laterals in the Eagle Ford, but do you see a trend toward three-mile laterals, particularly in the Permian or if not, what are the issues that would prevent that?\nBill Thomas: Yes, thanks, Michael. So on the three-mile laterals, you're right. We've done several, I'd say between 2.5 and three-mile laterals and multiple plays where it makes sense. And we do own probably more predominantly in the Eagle Ford, and then we've had some in the Bakken and also in the DJ. So, but there are unique circumstances that allow that to happen for us, and they're more driven by geology in that particular area, but also the access issues on the surface. I think just as a general rule, I'm not sure that it always makes sense to go through a three-mile lateral. I think you have to take into account the efficiencies have been able to complete that last mile of lateral economically compared to two-mile lateral those kinds of things and a lot of it does depend on the geology. And we spend a lot of detail time working through the geology and how to best approach every single well location we have. So there are some limitations on where you can do that effectively, and so it's not a broad-brush approach.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vincent Lovaglio of Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nVincent Lovaglio: Thanks for having me on. I wanted to ask on the double-premium locations. You might have touched on it last quarter, but if there is anything unique to the geology across these plays that one's itself to higher productivity, but also the lower decline described in Slide 8? And if so, how that might affect your pursuit of new opportunities that are double-premium? Why you guys are differentiated in that pursuit, and also on the development of those opportunities?\nEzra Yacob: Yes Vin, this is Ezra Yacob. That's a great question. And yes, what we're highlighting there in the slide deck. It really comes down to what you touched on with the unique geology. These are the double-premium plays are usually in areas where we've really refined our target down to get - in our existing portfolio down to get rock quality that is higher, better permeability and really the big step change is, as we look forward into the exploration prospects as we've talked about before. We're looking for new plays that historically haven't really been drilled routinely with horizontals. We're looking for a higher quality of rocks that we can apply the horizontal drilling, and completions technology to, and really, it's the higher permeability, higher porosity that lends itself to the shallower declines. And we think that this is not only going to be a step change for our performance as a company going forward. But really potentially those are going to be the new reservoirs the industry eventually is looking at to apply horizontal drilling to in the future.\nVincent Lovaglio: Perfect. Thanks. And maybe second, any additional color that you can maybe give on unconventional EOR? Just where it stands in the Eagle Ford right now thoughts on flexibility across other plays? And then maybe how that could improve your environmental footprint going forward? Thanks.\nKen Boedeker: Yes, this is Ken. As far as EOR goes in the Eagle Ford right now we've high graded our EOR process, and we have some of our units that are in blow down and other units that were continuing to inject into. EOR is much more challenged in higher gas price environment with our double-premium return. So we are evaluating it for other areas based on that across the company.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nitin Kumar of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nNitin Kumar: Hi, good morning, gentlemen and first of all congratulations. The market is definitely receiving the special dividend very well. My question is perhaps a little different from some of the other ones that have been asked. Over time, I was looking at Slide 9 you've migrated to this double-premium strategy. With the macro environment is favorable as it is, what happens to the single premium or the lower half of your core inventory here? Ezra mentioned exploration pace is going to have returns as high as 80%. So just wondering, is there an opportunity to with A&D market opening to monetize some of those, or how should we think about that part of your inventory?\nBill Thomas: That's excellent question and we appreciate it, and I appreciate your compliments. Yes, we are always evaluating property sales, and I'm going to ask Ken Boedeker to comment on that in general for the company.\nKen Boedeker: Sure, thanks, Bill. We're always high grading our portfolio and divesting of those properties with minimal double-premium potential remaining. And we've actually sold about $7 billion in assets over the last 10 years, and we will continue to high grade our assets as we see the market giving them fair value.\nBill Thomas: And certainly you know in the last few years, it hasn't been a seller's market, but it is - it will turn as people get short of inventory and we think that the premium, the single premium assets that we have you know, even those are probably some of the best inventory in the industry. So those, certainly have a lot of value.\nNitin Kumar: Okay. And they don't - with $60 oil and cost where they are today, they don't compete for capital within your program?\nBill Thomas: Yes, that's correct. 30% rate of return at 40% doesn't compete in our program right now. It needs to be 60% rate of return at 40% flat. It's a definitely a huge shift in our returns. And that's what we've been talking about for the last several quarters in our script and in our slides detail a lot of really good information. But certainly, the shift to double-premium is, we believe by far the highest reinvestment standard in the industry, and it is a clear separator for EOG, and it will drive exceptional performance for the company going forward.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Thomas for any closing remarks.\nBill Thomas: In closing, our excellent first quarter results are a testament to EOG's ability to generate significant shareholder value. We're proud of all of EOG employees and their outstanding contributions to continuously improve the company. Our excitement about EOG's ability to improve returns and increase value has never been greater. So, thanks for listening, and thanks for your support.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. EOG is delivering on our free cash flow priorities and our strategy to maximize long-term shareholder value. Yesterday, we declared a $1 per share special dividend to demonstrate our commitment to returning cash to shareholders. Combined with the regular dividend, we expect to return $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends in 2021. Double-premium well productivity and cost reductions are substantially improving our returns and increasing our ability to generate significant free cash flow. In order to maximize long-term shareholder value, we will remain flexible as we carry out our free cash flow priorities in the future. By doubling our reinvestment standard, the future potential of our earnings and cash flow performance are the best they've ever been. This quarter, we generated a quarterly record $1.1 billion of free cash flow and earned $1.62 per share of adjusted net income, the second highest quarterly earnings in company history. In addition, our balance sheet is in superior site with a peer leading low net debt to cap ratio. Next, Ezra will review our capital allocation strategy in more detail. Billy will go over our operational performance, and Tim will cover our financial performance before I make a few closing remarks. And here is Ezra. Thanks, Tim. In conclusion, I would like to note the following important takeaways. First true to the EOG culture our employees have fully embraced doubling our investment hurdle rate. As we drill more double-premium wells, we expect our performance will continue to improve, our decline rate will flatten, our breakeven oil price will decline, our margins will expand and the potential for free cash flow will increase substantially. Second, while our new double-premium hurdle rate alone will drive significant improvement it represents just one source. We never quit coming up with new ways to increase productivity and lower costs. Innovative new ideas and improved technology are developing throughout the company at a rapid pace, and we will continue to result in even higher returns in the future. And finally our special dividend this quarter, we're demonstrating our commitment to generating significant free cash flow and using that free cash to improve total shareholder returns. We are more excited than ever about the future of EOG, and our ability to deliver and maximize long-term shareholder value. Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A. Hello, Scott. Yes, Scott. Certainly, we're demonstrating our commitment to our shareholders by returning significant amount of cash back to them. And the $1 per share, I think is a very significant number, and large enough to be very meaningful. And I'm going to ask Tim to kind of go through some of the numbers to give you a little bit of the background on the reason that we pick this number. I want to add, Scott. Going forward, our free cash flow priorities and framework haven't changed. And so, you have to put the special dividend in context with our total framework. And just a reminder, we've already said this, but our first priority is a sustainable dividend growth. We believe the regular dividend is absolutely best way to give cash back to shareholders, and we certainly are working on that and have worked, we got a great history of doing that. And then the next one is debt reduction and we've got a little work left to do that as Tim noted in his opening remarks. Our next options are the special dividend and certainly and favorable times what we have right now those are the things that we are doing. And then we'll also - we want to keep in mind the potential for opportunistic share repurchases in downturns, counter cyclic opportunities and share repurchases. And then after that, we also want to be able to consider high return bolt-on acquisitions, and these are acquisitions that go in our best operating areas obviously where we've got a lot of synergy, and a lot of ability to move quickly and drill wells. And some of them could be in our new exploration plays where we can capture a very high potential acreage at very low cost. And so, we'll just continue to evaluate all these options and work with this framework, and we'll evaluate the best use of cash on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We have a dynamic business environment, all the time. So it's important to have the flexibility to use the cash in a way that creates the most shareholder value. Yes, thanks, Scott, for that question. We want to make sure we're really clear on that. And I think we have, we're not going to grow until demand is recovered to pre-COVID levels and which is it's on the way to do that. I think everybody can see that, and we want to make sure that obviously world inventories U.S. inventories are below the five-year average. And then we're looking for spare capacity to be certainly a lot lower than it is right now. And that just means, not a lot of oil shut into match supply and demand. And every year, the market factors that year going into that year will determine our plans. And so, we want to be flexible, and we want to be able to - and we will modify our growth plans to fit those market conditions. If we need to grow at a lower rate or no growth at all like we are doing this year, whatever that right growth plan is, whatever fits the market conditions that's what we want to do. Above all, everything else we are committed to staying very disciplined and not forcing oil into a market that's not ready. Yes, thanks, Arun. We take the - we evaluate where we are every quarter. I can't give you any specific on anything, but we evaluate where we are every quarter, and we're constantly looking at bolt-on potential and evaluating that. So we want to make sure we leave room to fully consider that something that would make a very significant difference in the future of the company, upgrade our high-quality premium, double-premium inventory, we want to do that. So, we're very fortunate we've got a lot of cash and we've got a lot of \u2013 hopefully, we believe a lot of cash coming. So that's a lot of great opportunities for us to consider additional special dividends, bolt-on acquisitions, et cetera. And we keep in mind, as Tim talked about, we want to keep in mind our debt reduction targets in a year and then and excuse me, in 2023, and also be able to continue to think about growing our regular dividend. So we'll just keep all those in the proper framework and you just need to know that we're committed to doing the right thing at the right time for the shareholders to be able to maximize the total shareholder value. I'm going to ask Tim to give some details on that. But just before turning it over to Tim, everybody needs to know the special dividend had nothing to do with the storm in the natural gas process. Well Tim, you'll give some detail? Yes, Scott. We were always in a very dynamic business environment. So it's important, we believe to have the flexibility to use of cash in a way that creates the most shareholder value. We are - one of the reasons we don't - the biggest reason we don't want to get into a strict formula because we don't want to be put in the position to where we're growing oil say at 5% when the market clearly does not need more oil. So we want to be in a position to where we can do the right thing at the right time and to maximize the use of the cash in our plan to maximize shareholder value. Yes. Neal. Thanks for the question. We're going to ask Billy to comment on that. Jeanine, Tim's given I think some answers for some of those on there. Yes, we want to keep ample cash on the balance sheet to run the business and that's around $2 billion. And then we have set aside, are looking at plans to reducing the $1.25 billion bond in 2023. So that's all fits in, and that's part of our evaluation of how we use the cash and when we use the cash. But really the special dividend just fits into the framework that we've already laid out in our commitment to giving back cash to shareholder. So we will look at our cash position, look at a bolt-on potential opportunities. They can truly be any size from a very small, we've done in the past $20 million - $30 million deal, but they could certainly be bigger than that, too. So we'll take all that, and working into our framework and evaluate where the company is, and the outlook for the business, and our goal is to continue to return cash to shareholders through that framework. Yes Charles, I think you know, it goes right along with the supply-demand and market fundamentals analysis that we do. We can - we've gotten more sophisticated. We've got a very sophisticated model now developed through our information technology, and we're gaining a lot of confidence in it on being able to kind of be on top of the oil market and where it's headed and certainly the oil price that's the biggest indicator. But we, I think we'll be able to determine when is the right time, when is the opportunistic counter-cyclic time to maybe consider share about buybacks. And of course now we have a lot of cash on the balance sheet and we want to continue to watch that and keep that who will have an opportunity when we do have a downturn to have cash to do that, if that happens. Yes, Michael I'm going to ask Ken Boedeker to talk on that. Just before he starts so - the carbon tax or issues like that we're going to leave those up to the legislatures and not come out with our opinions on that. We'll work with whatever transpires on that. So, Ken you want to talk about other opportunities? Yes, thanks, Michael. So on the three-mile laterals, you're right. We've done several, I'd say between 2.5 and three-mile laterals and multiple plays where it makes sense. And we do own probably more predominantly in the Eagle Ford, and then we've had some in the Bakken and also in the DJ. So, but there are unique circumstances that allow that to happen for us, and they're more driven by geology in that particular area, but also the access issues on the surface. I think just as a general rule, I'm not sure that it always makes sense to go through a three-mile lateral. I think you have to take into account the efficiencies have been able to complete that last mile of lateral economically compared to two-mile lateral those kinds of things and a lot of it does depend on the geology. And we spend a lot of detail time working through the geology and how to best approach every single well location we have. So there are some limitations on where you can do that effectively, and so it's not a broad-brush approach. That's excellent question and we appreciate it, and I appreciate your compliments. Yes, we are always evaluating property sales, and I'm going to ask Ken Boedeker to comment on that in general for the company. And certainly you know in the last few years, it hasn't been a seller's market, but it is - it will turn as people get short of inventory and we think that the premium, the single premium assets that we have you know, even those are probably some of the best inventory in the industry. So those, certainly have a lot of value. Yes, that's correct. 30% rate of return at 40% doesn't compete in our program right now. It needs to be 60% rate of return at 40% flat. It's a definitely a huge shift in our returns. And that's what we've been talking about for the last several quarters in our script and in our slides detail a lot of really good information. But certainly, the shift to double-premium is, we believe by far the highest reinvestment standard in the industry, and it is a clear separator for EOG, and it will drive exceptional performance for the company going forward. In closing, our excellent first quarter results are a testament to EOG's ability to generate significant shareholder value. We're proud of all of EOG employees and their outstanding contributions to continuously improve the company. Our excitement about EOG's ability to improve returns and increase value has never been greater. So, thanks for listening, and thanks for your support."

            "content": "Yes, we really have no interest in lower - in our lower return business that this might lead to, but we've really made excellent progress in reducing our emissions over the last four years, and you can see that with our intensity rates coming down as indicated in the attached slides that we've got on the presentation there. We're focused on reducing our own emissions with projects that have competitive returns before we consider a second phase of applying technology such as carbon capture to reduce our emissions. And we do believe that we can use 1% to 2% of our capital budget every year to make a substantial progress towards our goals of no routine flaring by 2025, and it's been endorsed by the World Bank, and our ambition of Scope one and two net-zero by 2040. Yes, this is Ken. As far as EOR goes in the Eagle Ford right now we've high graded our EOR process, and we have some of our units that are in blow down and other units that were continuing to inject into. EOR is much more challenged in higher gas price environment with our double-premium return. So we are evaluating it for other areas based on that across the company. Sure, thanks, Bill. We're always high grading our portfolio and divesting of those properties with minimal double-premium potential remaining. And we've actually sold about $7 billion in assets over the last 10 years, and we will continue to high grade our assets as we see the market giving them fair value."

            "name": "Billy Helms",
            "content": "Thanks, Ezra. The first quarter of the year was about execution. We exceeded our oil target producing more than the high end of our guidance range because wells that were offline due to the winter storm, Uri, recovered a bit faster than expected. As a result, our first quarter daily production declined just 3% compared to the fourth quarter last year. Our capital for the quarter came in under our forecasted target by 6%, mainly due to improvements in well cost across the company. The savings realized during the first quarter are in addition to the tremendous 15% reduction last year. EOG is on track to reduce well cost another 5% this year, despite some potential inflationary pressure as the industry activity resumes. Similar to previous quarters, these results are driven through innovation and efficiency gains in each phase of our operation. A closer look at our operations will help explain why we are confident, we can once again lower well cost. Our drilling teams are consistently achieving targeted depths faster with lower cost. The constant focus on daily performance and reliability of the tools and technical procedures is creating this continual drive towards lower cost. Some of the benefits this year stemmed from larger groups of wells per pad simply requiring less rig move cost per well and increasing efficiencies locked offline cementing. The larger well pads also complement our completion operations through the increased ability to utilize the technique we call Super zipper. We began our initial experiments with this technique back in 2019, and it has since advanced to consistently deliver the expected well results at lower cost. We have also learned that super zipper is particularly well suited to optimize the efficiencies of our five electric frac fleets. However, conventional spreads gain efficiencies as well. This practice involves using a single spread of pressure pumping equipment to complete four more wells on a single pad. We split the equipment's capacity in half simultaneously pumping on two wells, while conducting wireline operations on the remaining wells. We piloted and perfected a super zipper logistics in our Eagle Ford play and the collaboration between operating areas has accelerated its adoption throughout the company. And in cases where a minimum of four wells cannot be physically be located on a single pad, the engineering teams are working to develop new techniques where we can still utilize this improved completion practice. Completion costs are also benefiting from reduced sand and water costs through our integrated self-sourcing efforts. The savings we realized by installing water reused pipelines and facilities saves about 7% of well cost compared to third-party sourcing and disposal. Longer-term, we expect water reuse and disposal infrastructure will continue to lower lease operating expense in each area as well. Lease operating expenses also benefited from lessons learned through the pandemic this last year. The number of wells one lease operator can maintain has increased by as much as 80% by optimizing the use of innovative software designed and built by EOG. The software prioritizes lease operator activity throughout the day using our mobile and real-time software infrastructure. Our experienced last year inspired a number of new ideas to further high grade at least operators work activity throughout the day, which we believe may continue to expand productivity in day-to-day field operations. Slide 35 of our investor presentation illustrates the consistent progress we have made year-after-year on productivity all powered by innovative ideas, generated bottom up by employees. Each of our operating - active operating areas functions as an individual incubator to test out new ideas, many of which have our homegrown innovation from EOG employees and rollout companywide, if successful. That's one of the primary reasons, our well cost improvements every year are never won silver bullet, but a list of small to medium-sized individual improvements across all elements of total well costs that results in sustainable cost reduction. As a result of the innovation spreading throughout the company to reduce capital and operating cost, I have strong confidence that the cost structure and capital efficiency of the company will continue to improve. Here's Tim to review our financial position. Yes. Thanks, Neal. You know for the reinvestment rate, we're always looking at as Bill already mentioned earlier, what's the market look like and what is the need for all in. We're not - certainly not going to grow into a market that need the oil as he pointed out and just trying to make sure re-emphasize that point. And then in going forward each year, we will do the same thing, we always do. We kind of see where the market is, and what the prices are and what are opportunities are to develop our assets, and we balance that against the cash needs of the company. So, it's not really a straight formula, it's more about where the market is at that current time. Yes, Neal, this is Billy again. Let me take a stab at that. So as we look at all of our assets, that's the beauty of having a decentralized culture where we are focused on multiple plays across our portfolio. You have plays that are in different phases of their life cycle as you might think about it as you just said it like the Eagle Ford is a more mature play. It's had a growth for about 10 years. It's further down that maturity window than say that the Delaware Basin. And then the Powder River Basin is certainly in early maturing or early growth phase play. So each one of those we certainly go in with the idea of delineating the play first, putting in the infrastructure to drive down our cost over time, and then maximize returns. So each one of those have a different lifecycle that commands a different amount of investment and overall though, the company is able to maintain a very steady pace of activity and future value creation through that the way we operate the company. Yes, Leo, this is Billy. So the guidance on the CapEx, it's up a little bit in the second quarter relative to the first quarter is simply the timing of when wells are available to be completed. So we'll have a little bit more completion activity in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter. That's simply yes. I think in general will have about 50%, 52% of our CapEx spend in the first half. The remaining to be spent more ratably through the rest of the year and the volumes will be really pretty much keeping with that 440,000 barrels a day, per quarter average the rest of the year. So it's a - we will be maintaining 440,000 barrels a day each quarter going forward. Yes, Neal, this is Billy Helms. So on the permits, the federal permit, certainly we were very active in obtaining permits prior to administration change just to protect our activity levels as since this moratorium has been lifted, we are receiving a steady stream of permits. The permit stream is coming very well. We're receiving permits in all of our areas too. So I think the working relationships we've been able to maintain with the regulators is, and working through the process with them has benefited, if it is real well. So we're not really seeing any restrictions there. And I think the Biden administration clearly as said that activity, he wants to maintain activity on valid leases. So we're very comforted by the fact that we'll be able to continue then. Yes. Neil on oil and as we already talked about the fundamentals are definitely improving. It's been a little bouncy on the COVID recovery and oil demand, but we are seeing very, very steady improvements. I think we're up to maybe 95 million barrel a day. Demand right now we think maybe by the end of the year that we'll get to pre-COVID levels of somewhere around 100 million barrels a day. We'll just have to watch it and see. The inventories are dropping. And we think you know there'll be fairly consistent draws on inventory from here on out, especially during the summer pickup activity. And so that's all looking really good. And then the spare capacity you know is going fine. It's been extended in drawing out a little bit further than what it started out to be at the beginning of the year, but we believe again as demand picks up that's spare capacity will be put back online. I'm going to give you the data when everything is okay. We'll just have to watch and see it, but certainly everything is going in the right direction. And I think the market as oil prices have responded to that. I think it's that what we're saying, and seeing it's not different than what the consensus view is. On natural gas, we're mildly bullish. Inventories are low, and supply is less and demand is higher this year than the supply. So we're going to be entering the summer and particularly the fall of the year, and it was pretty low inventories. So depending obviously is always depends on the weather on gas. And so, we'll just have to see how all that turns out, but we're optimistic on gas also."

This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release, and EOG's SEC filings and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions, as well as reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call, or in the accompanying investor presentation slides may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential, not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday. Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; Ezra Yacob, President; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor and Public Relations. Here is Bill Thomas. Thanks, Billy. Yesterday's special dividend announcement marks another milestone in the growth of EOG's profitability and cash flow. We achieved this milestone through the disciplined execution of consistent long-term return focused strategy for capital allocation supported by a strong balance sheet. Over time, the strategy has produced increasing amounts of free cash flow. The top priorities for the allocation of that free cash flow remain sustainable dividend growth and debt reduction. The shift to Premium in 2016, drove a significant improvement in returns, profit margins, and cost enabling the significant increase in the dividend over the last four years. Since 2017, the dividend has grown from $0.67 per share to $1.65 per share, now an annual commitment of almost $1 billion. Going forward, our goal is to continue growing the regular dividend. We have never cut or suspended the dividend and we remain committed to its sustainability. With the shift to double-premium we're now focused on making another step-change improvement, and the results of those efforts will guide future common dividend increases, and the potential for special dividends. Since the shift to Premium we have also retired bond maturities totaling about $2 billion, with plans to retire another $1.25 billion in 2023 when the bond matures. Net debt to total capitalization was 8% at the end of the first quarter. A strong balance sheet with low debt has been as the heart of EOG's strategy throughout our existence. It's not just conservatism is about creating a strategic advantage. Our superior balance sheet enables us to acquire high-return assets at marvelous cycle prices where the exploration acreage like the Eagle Ford or for the new players we're working on today bolt-on acquisitions are companies like the Yates acquisition five years ago. A strong balance sheet also gives us the financial strength to be a partner of choice in our operations, whether it is with marketing or export agreements, service providers or even other companies and other countries in locking - unlocking new plays. Strong balance sheet extends to ensuring ample liquidity, which we have also secured with no near-term debt maturities, $3.4 billion of cash on hand and a $2 billion unsecured line of credit. Now, EOG is positioned to address other free cash flow priorities by returning additional cash to shareholders. The $1 per share special dividend follows through on these consistent long-tailed priorities. At $600 million this special dividend is a meaningful amount, while also aligning with our other priorities. After paying the special dividend we will have $2.8 billion of cash on hand, a full $800 million above our minimum cash target. This is a healthy down payment on the $1.25 billion bond maturing in two years. Going forward, our free cash flow priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to monitor the cash position of the company, oil and gas prices and of course our own financial performance. As the excess cash becomes available in the future, we will evaluate further special dividends or at the right time opportunistic share repurchases or low-cost bolt-on property acquisitions. I think it goes without saying you should expect us to avoid expensive corporate M&A. You can count on EOG to continue following our consistent strategy to maximize long-term shareholder value. Now here's Bill to wrap up. Thanks, Bill. So, going back to our priorities over time, it's consistent within our priorities. If you look back to our regular dividend has increased to 146%, since 2017, that's one of our highest priorities. We reduced debt by $2.1 billion. So that set us up to be in a position to now return more cash to the shareholders. When we looked at our cash position, we were sitting with $3.4 billion of cash. So returning $600 million at this point in time, as Bill pointed out, is a significant amount, and it follows through on our long-held plan to return cash to the shareholders. So it simply following through on what we've been committed to for a long time. Sure. When you boil everything down the effects of Uri was about $40 million to cash flow, and net income in the quarter. Obviously, they're a big component in there, but that's the bottom line. It was very immaterial to our cash flow, our net income."

            "name": "Ezra Yacob",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill. Yesterday, dividend announcement is just the latest in a long line of achievements that demonstrate the value of EOG's fundamental strategy of returns-driven capital allocation, including the impact of permanently raising our investment return hurdle rate for the second time in five years. In 2016, during the last downturn, we established our premium investment strategy, which requires a 30% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. The premium investment strategy drove a step-change in our capital efficiency and resulting financial performance. It is the reason we entered 2020 in a position of operational and financial strength, which enabled us to generate positive adjusted net income and free cash flow in a year of unprecedented oil volatility and prices that averaged just $39. This year, we increased the return hurdle once again, doubling it to 60% at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. Sustainable improvements in our inventory of drilling locations and continued progress in exploration have paved the transition to double-premium. The data driving our confidence to make this move is illustrated on Slide 6 of our investor presentation, which details the return profile of every drilling location. Half our current inventory earns at least two times the premium return hurdle rate we established back in 2016. 5,700 double-premium locations is more than 10 years' worth of inventory at our current pace of drilling and is more than we had when we made the transition of Premium five years ago. Just like we did with our Premium inventory, we are confident we can replace our double-premium locations faster than we drill them through line of sight into additional cost reductions that will increase the returns of existing inventory and through exploration. A number of innovations. which Billy will discuss in a moment, are being piloted across our operating areas, and will sustainably drive down both well costs and operating costs as we implement them throughout the company. Our exploration program is focused exclusively on prospects that will improve on that 60% median return. In fact, our anticipated return on the current slate of new exploration plays is more than 80%. To see the impact of our premium returns focused capital allocation strategy, a closer look at our corporate financial performance is required. As we replace our production base by drilling locations with higher well-level returns, the price required to earn 10% return on capital employed continues to fall. Prior to establishing Premium, EOG required oil prices upwards of $80 to earn a 10% ROCE. As the Premium strategy matured, the oil price needed to earn 10% ROCE came down and averaged just $58 the last four years. This trend is illustrated on Slide 9 of our investor presentation. For 2021 that price is just $50 and we're not stopping there. We expect it will continue to fall as our well-level returns improve. The impact of reinvesting at higher returns is also showing up in our free cash flow performance. We more than doubled the dividend over the last four years and improved our balance sheet, reducing net debt by nearly $3 billion. As a result, net debt to total capital at the end of last year was just 11%, but our future financial performance potential is the real prize. Our first quarter results are a preview of what we are aiming for. Over the coming years, we expect reinvesting in our current inventory of high-return wells will continue to lower the corporate decline rate and compound the value of our low-cost operating structure. The result leads to higher margins and generates even more free cash flow, providing us tremendous opportunity to create long-term shareholder value. We believe when we look back in a few years, it will be viewed as the catalyst for another step change improvement in EOG's financial performance. Our fundamental strategy of returns-driven capital allocation remains consistent, and consistency is key prioritizing reinvestment and high-return projects is the driver behind the steady improvements we've made year after year. As a result, we are now in a position to follow through on our commitment to return additional free cash flow to shareholders. Looking ahead, you can expect our priorities to remain consistent, investing in high returns, generating significant free cash flow to support a sustainable and growing dividend while maintaining a strong balance sheet followed by opportunistic return of additional free cash flow to investors and bolt-on acquisitions. Now here is Billy. Yes Scott, thanks for the question. This is Ezra. Yes, definitely in the Permian we have a higher percentage of those 5,700 double-premium locations are located in the Permian, but part of that is simply just because we have so many targets that are capture there in the Delaware Basin. What I would say is we have a fairly wide variety and fairly distributed variety of double-premium wells across our entire portfolio, including the Eagle Ford, the recently announced Austin Chalk, Dorado play, and the Powder River Basin as well. Yes, Doug. I want to make it really clear. We're not stuck on 10% growth rate, or 8% growth rate. We are totally focused on making sure we do the right thing at the right time. So we, the oil price does not guide how much we're going to grow. It's the market fundamentals. And so we're really focused on that we've laid out a - I think a strong set of fundamentals that we're focused on and we will adjust our plan each year, which means our growth plan each year to those market fundamentals, and maybe certainly and we - next year that we don't grow at all. We may grow at 4%, 5%. We'll just have to see what the market's fundamental show. Yes. Doug. That's a good question. Similarly, as we've done over the past few years, we're consistently focused on getting better year-after-year. And so by driving down well costs through sustainable well cost reductions, some of which Billy spoke to in opening remarks, but also through applying technology and innovations to increase the well productivity gains, we're able to convert some of our existing inventory every year into that double-premium metric. In addition of that we have few other avenues. The first, which Bill has touched on is bolt-on acreage acquisition opportunities in areas of preexisting development, but then also our exploration effort. And as I talked about in the opening comments our exploration effort is really focused on, again making another step change to our current inventory. It's focused on adding low decline, high impact plays that really increase the overall return profile of the company. And again, regardless of any growth rate when you're reinvesting in higher return opportunities and adding lower-cost reserves to your company, you're really driving down the cost base to the company year-after-year and that's essentially what translates into our corporate financials and allows us to lower that price required for a double-digit ROCE every year. Yes, Leo. This is Ezra. I appreciate the question. Yes, on our exploration plays, you're right, we're - we've allocated about $300 million to the exploration effort this year. Over the last few years, we've done a little bit of drilling, it was dominantly kind of leasing, putting some of the acreage together and then, of course, there was a pullback here in 2020 due to the reduction in capital allocation associated with the downturn in prices and COVID. But this year we are back to drilling multiple prospects. We're at a point where the prospects have started to move at different phases, I would say. We're drilling exploration wells across some of the prospects, across others we're into more of what I'd call appraisal wells, and we're feeling very confident with where we're at, the results that we're seeing, and we hope to be able to provide some results on that soon. Yes, Jeanine. That's a great question. This is Ezra. Yes, the opportunity there in Australia, as you mentioned, it's on the North West Shelf, obviously, everyone knows a very prolific hydrocarbon region. It's a shallow water opportunity that we've stepped into there, as you mentioned for a very low upfront cost. It's exposing us to a prospect that we think has the opportunity, the potential to be impactful to our company. It - we're forecasting it has the potential to really compete with our domestic returns, and what we have - the opportunity that we have here in Australia is really an outgrowth of our experience in Trinidad where for nearly 20 years, we've been operating in the shallow waters offshore of Trinidad, and really this is a geologic province, a type of play where the industry has really moved away from. And so we found ourselves as kind of a niche operator, and we've developed not only operational procedures but also some geologic techniques, where we think we can come into some of these shallow water prospects and make very, very good returns. The attractive thing about Australia again is not only does it fit into our experience level from the operations and technical perspective, but it has many off-take and oilfield service availability there. And of course the low cost of entry to an exciting amount of upside in the prospect. Yes Vin, this is Ezra Yacob. That's a great question. And yes, what we're highlighting there in the slide deck. It really comes down to what you touched on with the unique geology. These are the double-premium plays are usually in areas where we've really refined our target down to get - in our existing portfolio down to get rock quality that is higher, better permeability and really the big step change is, as we look forward into the exploration prospects as we've talked about before. We're looking for new plays that historically haven't really been drilled routinely with horizontals. We're looking for a higher quality of rocks that we can apply the horizontal drilling, and completions technology to, and really, it's the higher permeability, higher porosity that lends itself to the shallower declines. And we think that this is not only going to be a step change for our performance as a company going forward. But really potentially those are going to be the new reservoirs the industry eventually is looking at to apply horizontal drilling to in the future."

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir.\nTim Driggers: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliation schedules for these GAAP measures can be found on EOG's website. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Jeff Leitzell, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor Relations. Here's Ezra.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG's growing portfolio of high-return assets delivered outstanding results in 2022. We earned record return on capital employed of 34% and record adjusted net income of $8.1 billion, generated a record $7.6 billion of free cash flow which funded record cash return to shareholders of $5.1 billion. We increased our regular dividend rate 10% and paid four special dividends, paying out 67% of free cash flow, beating our commitment to return a minimum of 60% of annual free cash flow to shareholders. And we strengthened what was already one of the best balance sheets in the industry, reducing net debt by nearly $800 million. We continue to deliver on our free cash flow priorities this year by declaring an additional special dividend of $1 per share yesterday. Outshining our financial results were achievements made by our operating teams working in a challenging inflationary environment. Credit goes to the innovative and entrepreneurial teams working collaboratively across our multi-basin portfolio. Together, we leveraged the flexibility provided by our decentralized structure to deliver exceptional operational performance. Production volumes, CapEx and per unit operating costs were within guidance set at the start of the year. We offset persistent inflationary pressures that exceeded 20% during the year to limit well cost increases to just 7%. Our exploration teams uncovered a new premium play, the Ohio Utica combo, and advanced two emerging plays, the South Texas Toronto and Southern Powder River Basin. We've progressed several exploration prospects including the Northern Powder River Basin. We expanded our LNG agreement, currently estimated to take effect in 2026 to 720,000 MMBtu per day, which will provide JKM-linked pricing optionality for 420,000 MMBtu per day. Last year, the revenue uplift from our current 140,000 MMBtu per day LNG exposure was more than $600 million net to EOG. Preliminary results indicate that we reduced our GHG intensity and methane emissions percentage, achieving our 2025 targets. And we initiated an expanded deployment of our new continuous methane leak detection system called iSense. Led by the tremendous performance in our Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford plays, our operating performance and financial results in 2022 are a reflection of our asset portfolio and the unique organizational structure in place to support it. Seven teams in North America and one international team operates 16 plays across nine basins. Our decentralized structure empowers each operating team to make decisions in real time at the asset level to maximize value. This differentiates EOG and enables us to consistently execute our strategy and produce outstanding results year after year. Our multi-basin portfolio provides numerous high-return investment opportunities and we remain focused on disciplined investment across each of our assets. In addition to our premium well strategy, in which wells must generate a minimum of 30% direct after-tax rate of return at a flat $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas price for the life of the well, we invest at a pace that allows each asset to improve year-over-year, lowering the cost and expanding the margins generated by each asset. Disciplined investment means more than just expanding margins at the top of the cycle. It means delivering value for the life of the resource and through the commodity price cycle. It's not only developing lower-cost reserves, but also investing strategically to lower the operating cost of these resources, which positions EOG to generate full cycle returns competitive with the broad market. Looking ahead to 2023, EOG is in a better position than ever to deliver value for our shareholders and play a significant role in the long-term future of energy. Our ability to reinvest in the business, deliver disciplined growth, lower our emissions intensity, earn high returns, raise the regular dividend and returned significant cash to shareholders, all while maintaining what we believe is the best balance sheet in the industry is due to our differentiated strategy executed consistently year after year. Now, here's Tim to review our financial position.\nTim Driggers: Thanks, Ezra. When we established our premium strategy back in 2016, our goal is to reset the cost base of the business to earn economic returns at the bottom of the price cycle. The impact premium has had on the cost basis of the Company and our financial performance has been dramatic. Since 2014, prior to establishing our premium strategy, our DD&A rate has declined 42% and cash operating cost by 23%. Also, in 2014, and under similar oil prices as last year, we earned 15% ROCE. With our lower cost structure, ROCE increased to a record 34% in 2022. We have also reduced net debt last year by $800 million to further strengthen the balance sheet. We view a strong balance sheet as a competitive advantage in a cyclical industry. Our current balance sheet is among the strongest in the energy industry and ranks near the top 20th percentile of the S&P 500 in terms of leverage and liquidity, measured as net debt to EBITDA and cash as a percentage of market cap. We have a $1.25 billion bond maturing in March and intend to pay that off with cash on hand. Our 2023 plan is positioned to generate another year of strong returns. We expect to grow oil volumes by 3% and total production on a BOE basis by 9%. At $80 WTI and $3.25 Henry Hub, we expect to generate about $5.5 billion of free cash flow for nearly 8% yield at the current stock price and produce an ROCE approaching 30%. This attractive financial outlook, along with our strong balance sheet, is what gave us the confidence to declare a $1 per share special dividend to start the year on top of our regular dividend of $0.825 per share. As a reminder, our commitment to return a minimum of 60% of free cash flow considers the full year, not a single quarter in isolation. The special dividend reflects the confidence in our plan and our constructive outlook on oil and gas prices. We will continue to evaluate the amount of cash return as we go through the year with an eye on, once again, meeting or exceeding our full year minimum cash return commitment of 60% of free cash flow. Here's Billy to discuss operations.\nBilly Helms: Thanks, Tim. I would like to first thank each of our employees for their accomplishments and execution last year. 2022 was a challenging year, and the commitment and dedication of our employees remain steadfast as they delivered outstanding results. Last year can be characterized as a year of heightened inflation where we witnessed increasing commodity prices, accompanied by higher levels of activity across the industry. The result was a much tighter market for services, labor and supplies. We were able to offset most of this inflation through efficiency gains and capital management across our portfolio to limit well cost increases to just 7%. For the full year, oil production was above the midpoint of guidance, while capital expenditures were $4.6 billion, were only 2% above the original guidance midpoint set at the beginning of the year. Our operating teams working throughout the Company leveraged efficiencies to help offset inflation. This is most evident in our core development plays, which sustain sufficient activities to support continued experimentation and innovation. In the Delaware Basin, we expanded use of our Super Zipper completion technique to increase treated lateral feet per day by 24%. In our Eagle Ford play, the completions team increased completed lateral feet per day by 14% and the amount of sand pump per day per fleet by 27%. Our decentralized operations teams are continually striving to improve performance and share learnings across our portfolio to limit well cost increases. These learnings are then deployed in our emerging opportunity plays. For instance, in the Southern Powder River Basin, Mowry play, the drilling team decreased drilling time by 10% with improved bid and drilling motor performance. In our South Texas Dorado gas play, the operations team reduced drilling time by 12%. Through technical and operational advancements, they promise to continue to drive improvements in 2023. Beyond cost reductions, a new completion design implemented last year in the Delaware Basin is realizing positive improvements in well performance in certain target reservoirs. This new design was tested in 26 wells last year and is yielding as much as an 18% uplift and estimated ultimate recovery. We're also making great progress towards our long-term ESG goals. Our wellhead gas capture rate exceeded 99.9% of the gross gas produced. And preliminary results indicate that we lowered GHG intensity and methane emissions percentages in 2022. We now have approximately 95% of our Delaware Basin production covered by iSense, our continuous methane monitoring technology. Now turning to the 2023 plan. We forecast a $6 billion capital program to deliver 3% oil volume growth and 9% total production growth. We expect total volumes on a Boe basis to grow each quarter through the year. First quarter will show more growth in gas versus oil due to the well mix and timing of several Dorado gas wells that were completed late in the fourth quarter of last year. The plan can be summarized in the following four points. First, drilling rig and frac fleet activity in our core development programs, specifically the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford, will be relatively consistent with the fourth quarter of last year. The longer-term outlook for the Eagle Ford is to maintain the current production base where we have over a decade of continued opportunities to generate high returns and cash flow. After a decade of stellar operational improvements in the Eagle Ford, it has become a highly efficient, high-margin play with existing infrastructure and access to favorable markets. In the Powder River Basin, the plan builds off last year's positive well results and infrastructure installation with an additional 20 Mowry completions. We expect to complete a few additional wells in our emerging Utica play in Ohio as we continue to delineate our acreage position and drill a few wells in the Bakken and DJ Basins. In Dorado, our plan is to achieve an activity level that creates economies of scale and develop a continuous program to allow for innovation that drives improved well performance and cost reductions. This results in a moderate increase in activity, completing about 10 additional wells versus last year. In Trinidad, a drilling rig is now scheduled to arrive in the third quarter, which is about a six-month delay. So, international volumes decreased 60 million cubic feet per day or 10,000 Boes per day versus our earlier estimates. Overall, we increased activity in our emerging plays. The average EOG rig count for the year is expected to increase by about two rigs and one additional frac fleet. Second, we have line of sight to efficiencies that we expect will limit additional inflation pressure on well cost to just 10% versus last year. Year-over-year increases in tubular costs as well as day rates for drilling rigs and frac fleets are the main drivers of the increase. As part of our contracting strategy, we stagger our agreements to secure a base line of services and secure consistent execution. For this year, we have locked in about 55% of our well cost, which is a similar level to previous years. Approximately 45% of our drilling rigs and 65% of our frac fleets needed for the year are covered under term agreements with multiple providers. By maintaining this consistent base of services, we expect to find additional opportunities to drive performance improvements and eliminate downtime, thus potentially providing an opportunity to offset some additional inflation. Third, our 2023 capital program includes additional infrastructure investment. Typically, funding for facilities and other infrastructure projects comprises 15% to 20% of the CapEx budget. And this year, we expect that number to be closer to 20%. In Dorado, we commenced construction late last year on a new 36-inch gas pipeline from the field to the Aqua Dolce sales point near Corpus Christi, Texas. This pipeline will help ensure a long-term takeaway, fully capture the value chain from the wellhead to the market center, help support expanded LNG export price exposures due to come online around 2026 and broaden our direct interstate pipeline capacity to reach markets along the entire Gulf Coast corridor. We're also undertaking smaller infrastructure projects in other areas, like the Utica to lower the long-term unit operating cost. Fourth, we plan -- the plan includes capital that represents the next steps towards our vision of being among the lowest emissions producers of oil and natural gas. Our first CCS project has begun injection and we will continue to explore opportunities to enhance our leadership position in environmentally prudent operations. These projects offer healthy returns while also providing reductions in long-life unit operating cost and lower emissions. EOG remains focused on running the business for the long term, generating high returns through disciplined growth, improving our resource base through organic exploration, improving our environmental footprint and investing in projects that will lower the future cost basis of the Company. I am excited about 2023 and the opportunity it brings for our employees to further improve the Company. Now here's Ken to review year-end reserves and provide an inventory update.\nKen Boedeker: Thanks, Billy. Our 2022 proved reserve replacement was 244% for finding and development cost of just $5.13 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding revisions due to commodity price changes. Our proved reserve base increased by 490 million barrels of oil equivalent and now totals over 4.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This represents a 13% increase in reserves year-over-year and was achieved organically. In 2022, we also reduced our finding and development costs by 8% compared to the previous year. In fact, over the past five years, we have reduced finding and development costs by nearly 40%. Our permanent shift to premium drilling, combined with our culture of continuous improvement focused on efficiencies driven by innovation, are why our corporate finding costs and DD&A rate continue to decline. We continue to focus on maximizing the long-term value of our acreage. For example, last year, we continued co-development of up to four Wolfcamp targets. The pursuit of secondary targets with wells developed in packages alongside traditional development benches generally have minimal production impact on the primary zone, however, carry a favorable investment profile because they require no additional leasehold investment, are drilled and completed on existing pads and produced into existing facilities and gathering systems. The goal is to deliver low risk, high returns that maximize the cash return potential of our assets. Looking out beyond our current proved reserves, we've identified over 10 billion-barrel equivalents of future resource potential in our existing premium plays with an expected finding cost -- finding and development costs less than our current DD&A rate. When we invest in finding and development costs less than our DD&A rate, we drive the cost basis of the Company down. When we invested high returns, combined with a low finding and development cost, it shows up in the financials as increased return on capital employed. Thanks to the benefits of our decentralized structure and multi-basin organic exploration strategy, our resource base is growing faster than we do it. More importantly, it is getting better. We have over 10 years of double-premium drilling at the current pace, and we are focused on improving the quality of our resource every year through operational innovation, technical improvements and expiration. Now let me turn the call back to Ezra.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Ken. In conclusion, I'd like to note the following important takeaways. EOG Resources offers a unique value proposition. First, it begins with our multi-basin portfolio of high-return investment opportunities anchored by the industry's most stringent investment hurdle rate or premium price deck. Second, our disciplined growth strategy optimizes investment to support continuous improvement across our portfolio. Our employees utilize technology and innovation to increase efficiencies and allow EOG to remain a low-cost operator. Third, we are focused on generating both near- and long-term free cash flow to fund a sustainably growing regular dividend, support our commitment to return additional free cash flow to shareholders and maintain a pristine balance sheet to provide optionality through the cycles. Fourth, we are focused on safe operations and improving our environmental footprint across each of our assets, utilizing both existing and internally developed technologies. And finally, it's the EOG employees that make it happen. Our culture is at the core of our value proposition and is our ultimate competitive advantage. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Your line is now open.\nPaul Cheng: Two questions, please. First, Ezra, with Dorado, how is your investment program changed in many of the changing landscape in the natural gas price? I would imagine, at this point, there's more economic to drill for the oil play than the gas play? How that changed your outlook for the next several years on that play? Second question is on the CapEx. Maybe that it seems like you are investing for the future. So what is the sustaining CapEx requirement to maintain a flat production at this point for your program? And also, if we're looking at, say, for the remainder of this year, is there any area that you think we will start to see some softening in the cost and which may not be reflected in your current budget?\nEzra Yacob: Thank you, Paul. This is Ezra. Those are both great questions. So let me start with the first one here on natural gas and what's it looking like right now. You're correct, we've been watching the recent volatility in natural gas, late 2022 and currently associated with the LNG outages and the warm winter that we're experiencing. Our gas growth this next year on the plan, you'll see is about -- at the midpoint is about 240 million cubic feet per day. About 50% of that is coming out of the -- as you mentioned, the associated gas from the Delaware Basin and the other half of it is basically coming out of our Dorado play. Our strategy at Dorado, I'd say, hasn't significantly changed yet. And at this point, we don't really see that it would, barring anything dramatic. And the reason for that is that Dorado always has been kind of a longer-term strategy for us. We've always focused on having moderate investment there to grow into the growing demand center along the Gulf Coast. It's never really been about chasing seasonal demand or aggressively ramping up activities in that play. The U.S., just this year, will have about two Bcf a day of LNG export back online after the disruption's clear. We've got an additional five Bcf a day coming online in kind of the '24, '25 time frame and then potentially another eight Bcf a day still working through financing. And we see this line of sight demand growth is also reflected with the strip price where you see currently, it's moved into contango. So our long-term strategy at Dorado really remains the same. It's investment at a pace where the asset improves each year giving us an ability to drive down both upfront well costs and long-term operating costs, where we can consistently deliver the low cost of supply. This year, as Billy stated, we'll be moving towards a one completion crew program to really capture those efficiencies at Dorado. The first part of your second question, I believe, is on sustaining CapEx. And what I'd say is the sustaining CapEx is a number that we don't necessarily focus on here as an organic growth company. And the reason for that is, even during 2020, we didn't maintain a maintenance capital type of program. We're very dynamic, and we'll grow and we see the ability to invest in our business and the market supports it. And when we don't need to, we can pull back at that time as well. So maintenance CapEx is not necessarily a number that we look at. Now as far as breakevens on our capital program this year, it definitely is up a little bit year-over-year. As Billy mentioned, there's some inflation in there. But also, we're obviously seeing the opportunity to invest in our multi-basin portfolio and increase the CapEx. So, our CapEx program this year is at $44 WTI price with a $3.25 gas price. And I'll maybe hand it over to Billy to give a little bit of color on inflation and where we see it going this year.\nBilly Helms: Yes, certainly. On the inflation front, I think it's safe to say that everybody has seen commodity prices falling. We've seen inflation rates have peaked and come down. And so we're seeing a lot of the service costs, at least, have plateaued going into this year. And so, as I mentioned on the call, we've got about 55% of our wealth costs secured through existing contracts with our event. And that leaves us the opportunity to capture any upside that we might see in lower rates going into the year. So we're sitting in a fairly good position. I think we're going to be poised and waiting to see what happens and take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves. But I think inflation, at least, is showing that we've plateaued. We baked in about a 10% inflation into our plan. And as we see opportunities, we'll continue to look for ways to improve that.\nPaul Cheng: Billy, do you see any particular area have the opportunity of softening?\nBilly Helms: I think what we've seen is one of the biggest drivers this last year on inflation was certainly tubulars casing cost. And I think we've seen different things and different parts of that make up. I think the ERW products is mostly the surface and intermediate casings, those have rolled over and are softening a little bit more than the production casing, which is your seamless products, which are still largely exposed to imports. And so you're seeing some opportunities on casing, but I think there's still yet to come on most of that. On the service side, I think we haven't really seen anything manifested yet, but I think we've all seen rig counts have largely been flat since September, and they're down off their peak of -- in November of probably 20 to 25 rigs. And with the drop in gas prices, I think everybody is expecting maybe we'll see some more softening on the rig activity level. So that may lead to some opportunities to capture some markets. The one advantage that we have, and I'll go ahead and throw this out, we may expand on it later, but the benefit we have is operating in multiple basins. And so we see certainly more service tightness and labor constraints in areas with the most activity, which would be the Permian. But we have the opportunity to shift activity to our other basins to enable those to take advantage of more available equipment, more available capacity to add services at favorable rates. So that's the advantage that we have as a company.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nArun Jayaram: Ezra, you have a net cash, a balance sheet and if we run through, call it, the $80 case, 55 -- or $5.5 billion in free cash, if you return 60% of that, you're looking at a balance sheet that would be, call it, $3 billion of net cash at year-end. So I wanted to get your views on uses of that cash that you have on the balance sheet and where your heads at in terms of thoughts of increasing cash return to shareholders versus looking at inorganic opportunities, including bolt-ons or M&A? And how do you prioritize some of those opportunities as we think about 2023?\nEzra Yacob: It's Ezra. That's a great question. I love talking about our balance sheet and the strength of it. It's something we take a lot of pride in. And the reason for that is because it gives us a lot of optionality at different times, whether it's to look at -- in 2020, we purchased -- strategically purchased a lot of casing. In 2021, we were able to purchase a decent amount of line pipe. And just last year, we were able to make a small acquisition in the Utica play, including purchasing some minerals there. So we're still not looking for any large, expensive, corporate M&As. We do continue to seek out opportunities where it makes sense to do bolt-ons, things that would be accretive, things that could move right into our existing infrastructure and extend some of our lateral lengths. In general, for our net cash position, I would say we don't have a specific target. We do like to have the optionality. The one thing you didn't mention is that we will be retiring a bond here in this first quarter at $1.2 billion. And then, in addition to that, I'd point out that last year, we did move beyond our minimum commitment of that 60% return of free cash flow to our shareholders. Last year, we returned approximately 67%. And so I think you can see -- you can take that as a data point that when appropriate and at the right time and obviously, it's evaluated at the Board level, depending on where we're at within the cycle, where we're at within the year and what our cash position looks like, we have proved that we're willing to move above and beyond the 60% minimum threshold.\nArun Jayaram: Great. My follow-up is Ezra, just given the size of the Company, you're approaching 1 million Boes per day in terms of overall output, and most of your activity is short cycle oriented. And I wanted to get your thoughts on exploring longer cycle opportunities. You've seen some of your peers invest in areas such as Alaska and LNG. And I wanted to get your thoughts on EOG looking at the long cycle and perhaps an update on where we stand for -- to drill Beehive in Australia?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Arun, we can start -- yes, maybe with some of our longer cycle stuff. We can start with Trinidad. As Billy mentioned, there has been a bit of a rig delay on our Trinidad drilling program. So that will start about midyear this year. We did set a platform there based -- this past year based on one of the discoveries that we made in 2020. We should start construction on another platform there named Momento later this year, also based on some of the work that we did in that drilling campaign that ended in 2020. So that's on the Trinidad side. In Beehive in Australia, it's our prospect on the Northwest shelf. That prospect has actually slid a little bit. It's now time to be spud in 2024. And then with some of the other projects that you had mentioned, as you can see, and it goes in line with what we were just talking about with the ability of our balance sheet to be strategic and opportunistic. And typically, we do these things counter-cyclically like our agreement on the LNG side, or the ability to put in some infrastructure like we are currently in Dorado to go ahead and lower our operating costs and expand our margins. Those are the type of opportunities that we really look for, things that are in concert with our core business, which is drilling and developing premium oil and natural gas wells.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nDoug Leggate: So Tim, I don't know if this one's for you or for Ezra, but your comments about being able to offset some of the inflation have been a fairly consistent part of your message over the last year. So, I think folks were a little surprised by the CapEx number. So I wonder if you could walk us through the moving parts of whether it be activity led or more specifically, infrastructure related to some of the newer places? There are disproportionate amount of takeaway spending has maybe lifting the CapEx issue. I'm just curious on the breakdown.\nBilly Helms: Yes, Doug, this is Billy Helms. Let me take a stab at that. So first, there's probably three buckets you can probably put the increase in. First of all, is inflation in our well cost. That's probably a good piece of it, 1/3 of it. It's about -- we're anticipating about a 10% well cost inflation in our program versus last year. And yes, that's maybe 10% over and above last year. But still last year, we achieved only a 7% well cost increase in spite of probably, arguably, 15% or 20% inflation. So I think our teams have done a great job on offsetting inflation with efficiency gains. We're expecting more of that this year, but we've baked in about a 10% cost increase. The second part of that is going to be infrastructure. We've talked about already our Dorado gas pipeline. That's been initiated. And we're also building out some infrastructure in some of our emerging plays, like the Utica to start the testing of those plays. And then we've also included some capital for our ESG projects that we're advancing. So those are kind of the buckets that we look at. And then obviously, we have some additional wells on top of that in these various plays. So as we pick up the two additional rigs and one extra frac fleet, of course, that's going to accompany some additional well count. So those are the three main buckets that I would characterize the increase in the capital versus last year.\nDoug Leggate: Okay. I appreciate the color, Billy. Thanks for picking that one up. My follow-up is probably for Ezra. And Ezra, forgive me for this one, but I want to take you back to pre-COVID when EOG was growing quickly and frankly, a market didn't need the oil. But you could make the case that today. We've got a market that doesn't need the gas. And I understand your point about maybe trying to take markets, some others are cutting back. But the fact is we still have a largely stranded market in the U.S. Why is this the right time to accelerate your gas production given what is a potentially very constructive outlook longer term?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Doug, that's a good question. Yes, I think the difference is between 2019 or pre-COVID with the oil versus what we're doing in Dorado right now. So like I said, the Dorado volumes are anticipated to support. It's basically the output of a single completion spread program this year. And the benefits that we see of running a consistent program there to learn about this asset, continue to drive down costs, support putting in some infrastructure, things like water takeaway and in-basin gathering, that outweighs the near-term volatility in the gas price because what we see is in a very not-too-distant future, we see a pretty dramatic increase in the offtake and the demand coming on along the Gulf Coast. Now we are backstopped and supported, obviously, with investing on the return side in these premium wells. So we measure the investment on here at a $2.50 natural gas price. And while at today's prices, that's below, we run that $2.50 all the way through the life of the asset. The rest of the gas that we're growing this year is, honestly, as we -- as I said at the top of the Q&A is really associated gas coming out of the Delaware Basin, where the returns there are dominantly driven obviously on the oil and liquids side. And we're really running a maintenance program or a flat activity level program to Q4 across the Delaware Basin.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Leo Mariani from MKM Partners. Your line is now open.\nLeo Mariani: I was hoping you could update us a little bit on maybe some new well results, if there are any from some of the emerging plays. Most interested in hearing about any recent Utica well performance or any Utica wells that may have come on? And then similar, just in the PRB, did get a sense if you've seen improving wells there as well. You've talked a lot about cutting costs in PRB, but just curious as to whether or not some of those wells have seen improvements as you guys have gotten more experience?\nKen Boedeker: Yes, Leo, this is Ken. I'll take the Utica portion of that. The four wells we drilled and completed in '22, really continue to deliver our expected performance. And just to give you a flavor on that, we anticipate starting our drilling program for '23 at the end of the first quarter here. One other thing, I would note in the Utica, not on the well side, but on the acreage side is we have added about 10,000 acres of low-cost acreage store position, and we'll continue to look for additional opportunities to add to that position. So we're really excited about the Utica plan for 2023. I'm going to go ahead and give it over to Jeff now for the Powder.\nJeff Leitzell: Yes, Leo, this is Jeff. Yes, just a quick update. In 2022, we continue to delineate our acreage there in the Southern Powder River Basin. We completed about 31 net wells across the four primary targets. And all of those, we had excellent results. And we've been shifting our primary focus there, as we've talked about previously to the Mowry. So in 2023, we're going to ramp up the activity a little bit there. We're going to run kind of a consistent two- to three-rig program with one frac fleet. So that will be about 55 net wells. And the majority of those, as we talked about, will be in the Mowry. It's about a 75% increase year-over-year there in the Mowry. And then we'll continue to focus on optimizing that Mowry program there in our Southern Powder River Basin core area. We'll collect a lot of valuable data, and then we'll look to utilize it in the future on our overlying Niobrara formation and then the North Powder River Basin position that we announced earlier on.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. That's helpful. And then just wanted to jump over to the Eagle Ford. If I look at the Eagle Ford, production has kind of been steadily dropping in the last few years. You guys have picked up activity pretty significantly in '23. It looks like roughly 50% more net completions this year versus last. In your prepared comments, you signaled basically trying to kind of keep Eagle Ford flattish for a number of years sort of going forward. Just wanted to get any additional color around that? Eagle Ford had kind of been in decline in favor of other plays, primarily Delaware. And now the plan is to kind of flatten it out. Are you kind of seeing new things there in terms of well productivity or lower costs that have got more encouraged about the play? Just wanted to get a sense because it seems like maybe it's risen slightly in the pecking order here.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Leo, this is Ezra. That's a great pickup. It's a good question because that's exactly what's happened is that it is raising up with respect to the returns and the way they compete for capital. Over the last couple of years, kind of coming out of the pandemic, we've reduced our -- there. And the result of that, we've been trying to right-size the investment. The result has been really back to back years of the highest drilling -- rate of return drilling programs that we've seen in the history of developing that asset. As everybody knows, it's a very high-margin oil play where we've got a lot of infrastructure and a tremendous amount of industry knowledge there. Simply, the asset now is commanding a lot more capital investment this year. We are looking to invest to maintain flat production, as you said. The production has decreased a bit over the last couple of years. And one advantage that we are seeing in the Eagle Ford, and Billy touched on this, and maybe I'll let him add a little more color on it, is really how the inflation and service availability has manifested itself across these different basins and why the Eagle Ford's a bit more attractive.\nBilly Helms: Sure. As I mentioned earlier in some of the questions, obviously, you see more levels of inflation and more constraints on services in certain fields versus the other, the Permian being the most active play. Certainly, there's a more constraints there on services and labor and those kind of things. So it allows us the opportunity to pick up activity in basins that are seeing less stress, you might say, and Eagle Ford certainly being one of those. On top of that, our team there in Eagle Ford has done just a tremendous job continuing to push innovation and striving for efficiencies such that we continue to make better and better returns in that play with time. And we've kind of reached a point, as Ezra mentioned there, that we want to maintain the constant level of production going forward in that play because we do see more than a decade of running room of continuing to maintain that production level with the opportunities we have in front of us. So we think it's just a good level of production to maintain going forward.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Neal Dingmann from Truist. Your line is now open.\nNeal Dingmann: My first question is on your play detail, specifically, was looking at some other side. I see a couple of years ago, you all suggested you had approximately about 11,000 premium undrilled locations with about, I think, it was nearly 55% of these in the Delaware. Of that Del, about 40% of these will be in Wolfcamp plays. I'm just wondering if that really, number one, total premium locations is still -- I forget what the last number you threw around the premium locations? And wonder if you'd still consider the majority of these in the Wolfcamp portion of the Del?\nKen Boedeker: Yes, Neal, this is Ken. I'll take a shot at that. We -- what we talked about earlier, and the way we really look at it, is we have 10 years of double-premium inventory at our current activity level. So locations really aren't a concern for us. What we're really trying to talk about and show is the value proposition of our 10-plus billion Boe resource base that has a finding cost less than our current DD&A rate. Investing in this inventory will use to DD&A and improve earnings and return on capital employed. Our well counts are really constantly changing as our development plans evolve, acreages swapped and laterals are extended. And all those changes improve our finding costs and returns and modify our location count. So what we're really focused on now is lowering our cost basis as we invest at high returns.\nNeal Dingmann: No, that makes sense. Then maybe Ken just follow up on that. I guess my follow-up is on play details, maybe specifically the Bakken. You all suggested, I think even a couple of years ago, it wasn't a ton of locations, as you said, maybe I don't know if you'd consider a ton of value there. So I'm just wondering how many -- how you'd kind of look at that play today? And would you all consider -- you certainly don't need it financially, but would you consider monetizing it given it appears to be one of your more mature areas?\nKen Boedeker: Sure, Neal. The Bakken creates significant returns, and it is one of our highest percentage plays that we have in the Company. So where it's appropriate and when it's appropriate for development, which is we're going to be putting some money into it this year, we'll try to run about a one-rig program there the foreseeable future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nScott Gruber: So I saw in your supplemental debt that you mentioned that continuous pumping operations are helping to drive completion efficiency in the Delaware. I believe that's one of the benefits you're seeing for running your frac fleet. Is that accurate? And just a bit more detail on how continuous fracking is having completion efficiency above and beyond doing zippers?\nBilly Helms: Yes, Scott, this is Billy. Yes, we're thrilled with the -- our efficiencies driven through our completion teams. The continuous pumping operation, you're right, is tied to mostly our electric frac fleets. Just a reminder, we've -- we're probably running 60% or 70% of our frac fleets today are electric. And we've been in that business really since about 2015. So, we've been operating more electric frac fleets probably than most of our peers or most of the industry for a long period of time. And through that, we've gained a tremendous amount of knowledge of how to continue to drive efficiencies in that operation. It really has started more in our San Antonio group in the Eagle Ford play, and that's why we're so excited about continuing our investment there. And certainly, we're transferring that information and that those techniques across the Company, including the Delaware Basin. But basically, the continuous pumping operation allows us to minimize any amount of downtime, so we can increase the amount of footage we complete every day, which drives the well cost down over time and allows us to approach some really highly efficient completion strategies. And so, part of that is also leading to improved completion designs, which is allowing us to make better well performance. So overall, it's just one thing that builds on another, and we're excited about the future and where that takes us.\nScott Gruber: Got it. And then you also mentioned taking advantage of any softening in -- frac rates if they do manifest this year. How is your contract coverage for both currently following the period of tightness? Would you be able to capture any deflation before year-end? Or would that really benefit more at '24 just given contract coverage?\nBilly Helms: Our contracts are really staggered, and they don't all roll off at any one given time. Certainly, our well cost is up this year as I mentioned earlier, because some of those contracts have rolled off last year and renewed on those higher day rates and pumping charges this year. But in general, we have about 45% of our drilling rigs secured under term agreements and about 65% of our frac fleets. So that leaves us ample opportunity to capture opportunities if they do present themselves as time moves on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJeanine Wai: My first question, maybe following up on Leo's question, on the Eagle Ford. In terms of the step-up in activity in the Eagle Ford this year, can you talk about how capital efficiency compared between the overall Delaware and South Texas Eagle Ford? I guess when you pull the well data, the difference in the well performance looks like the Eagle Ford is about 30% lower on a cumulative oil per foot basis over the past couple of years, but that's only one side of the equation, and we realize that. And I think your 3Q disclosure indicated that the Eagle Ford well cost is almost 30% lower on a per foot basis than in the Delaware. So I guess just putting it all together for us, can you just provide some color on how capital efficiency and returns compare between the Eagle Ford and the Delaware?\nBilly Helms: Yes. Jeanine, this is Billy. Happy to give you some color on that. The Delaware Basin is certainly one of our most capital-efficient plays, quickly followed by the Eagle Ford. The advantage we have in the Eagle Ford is, as I mentioned earlier, the tremendous efficiencies that have been driven in that play. You're right the cum per foot is probably a little bit lower in the Eagle Ford but the well cost is also significantly less. And so we can put a lot more wells to sales in a lot shorter time frame than we can in the Delaware Basin. And then going back to that also, we didn't really feel that we wanted to ramp up activity anymore in the Delaware Basin, but instead leverage on our multi-basin portfolio to increase activity in areas where equipment and crews are more available to leverage into our operation. And so that's what we've chosen to do. But I think the Eagle Ford is still one of our most capital-efficient plays we have in the Company, and we're excited about that opportunity to keep sustaining volume going forward.\nJeanine Wai: Okay. Great. Maybe moving to base declines. Can you provide an update on your current base declines given the 3% oil and the 9% Boe growth this year? Do you anticipate that your oil and corporate declines will remain flat or at least -- or maybe even decrease this year?\nBilly Helms: Yes, Jeanine, this is Billy again. The base declines have been fairly consistent, I would say, year-to-year. And we don't see a measurable change really in our base declines going forward. I think last year was a pretty good year as compared to this year, and I expect the declines would be similar.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Derrick Whitfield from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nDerrick Whitfield: With my first question, I'd like to lean into the new completion design you've implemented in Delaware that achieved an 18% AUR uplift. Could you perhaps elaborate on the nature of the enhancement and if it would to be across and outside of the basin?\nBilly Helms: Yes, Derrick, this is Billy Helms again. On the new completion design, certainly, we're always experimenting with new ideas and trying to innovate as to ways we can improve well performance over time. And we're excited about some of the new advancements and techniques we're experimenting with the Delaware Basin. And to be honest, that's just more color on why we like to get to a consistent program and where we can innovate and experiment and make these improvements. So I'm not going to go into detail about what this new completion design looks like. But certainly, as we continue to advance it, we will translate it to -- import that technology to other basins, and we're already doing so. We were excited about the 18% uplift we've seen, but it's only been done on 26 wells so far in the Delaware Basin. So you can see it's still early on. The amount of the improvement is tremendous though, and we fully expect to be able to transfer that knowledge to other plays.\nDerrick Whitfield: Perfect. And as my follow-up, perhaps shifting over to the Eagle Ford. We noticed the legacy wet gas position was seemingly reengaged in your supplement update. If I recall, that initial position was in the order of 26,000 acres. Could you perhaps comment on what has brought it back to life and the amount of activity you're expecting over the next couple of years?\nKen Boedeker: Yes, Derrick, this is Ken. Yes. Really, what's brought back to life is our people in our San Antonio division, have reviewed it and realized that they could invest at high returns in that area. So we've actually looked at three different zones within that area and drilled three wells last year that had significant returns, and we'll see additional activity this year. I don't know that we've given an exact well count, but it will definitely be stepped up. And really, it's just a matter of having legacy acreage and our people understanding where we think we can make those kind of returns.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.\nCharles Meade: I want to follow up on Derrick's question, which was a great question. I'd just like to push a little bit further on that Delaware Basin completion design. I understand you don't want to talk about what it is. But as I mentioned, some of the possibilities, I'm curious, is this something that you apply to whatever your maybe fringier intervals that's something that's bringing that -- bringing kind of a lesser interval up to the -- your double-premium threshold? Or alternatively, is this something that you're doing already on -- or is this a new design kind of a meat and potatoes interval that could maybe herald a broader shift hire in your whole Delaware Basin capital efficiency?\nBilly Helms: Yes. Charles, this is Billy Helms. Yes. The new design is -- really starts with an understanding of the rock we're applying it to. I think we've talked in the past about how all of our designs are tailor made to every wellbore and whatever the geology is telling us is the right application for that. So is it something that we could apply to all zones? I would say probably not, but it's certainly more attractive than other zones. But it is also being done in the core of the play. It's not just applying to the fringe intervals or the fringe of the plays, but some of our core plays or target intervals and we're seeing dramatic improvements. Now it's going to be -- continue to be tailored based on what the geology tells us is the right application, and we'll tweak it and be able to transfer that knowledge as we see it develop.\nCharles Meade: That's helpful color. And for my follow-up, and I recognize this is a simplification for a company like you guys and your number of rigs and the number of plays. But overall, you indicated that you're going to increase your -- you're going to add three new rig lines in '23. Can you give us a sense where you are in that process? Or when we should expect those in aggregate, the rig count to tick up over the course of '23?\nBilly Helms: Sure, Charles. The rigs are pretty much in operation today. We started kind of picking up rigs at the end of the fourth quarter going into this year. And as we mentioned, the fourth quarter run rates in the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford will be pretty consistent throughout the year. And so, we've also started drilling in some of the other plays, some of the new emerging plays, such as the Powder River Basin and Dorado. So those are kind of ongoing. We'll be picking up rigs at different times and some of the other plays, like the Bakken or the DJ or the Utica. And those will kind of come and go. Those aren't going to be really, yet full rig lines. They'll kind of ebb and flow based on the timing of each individual play. But the base program is pretty much going to be set, and I'd say the rig count is not going to fluctuate much beyond where it is today.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now hand back over to Mr. Yacob for closing remarks.\nEzra Yacob: I'd just like to thank everyone for participating in the call this morning and especially thank our employees for the outstanding results delivered in 2022. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's EOG Resources Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 results. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Ken Boedeker",
            "content": "Thanks, Billy. Our 2022 proved reserve replacement was 244% for finding and development cost of just $5.13 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding revisions due to commodity price changes. Our proved reserve base increased by 490 million barrels of oil equivalent and now totals over 4.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This represents a 13% increase in reserves year-over-year and was achieved organically. In 2022, we also reduced our finding and development costs by 8% compared to the previous year. In fact, over the past five years, we have reduced finding and development costs by nearly 40%. Our permanent shift to premium drilling, combined with our culture of continuous improvement focused on efficiencies driven by innovation, are why our corporate finding costs and DD&A rate continue to decline. We continue to focus on maximizing the long-term value of our acreage. For example, last year, we continued co-development of up to four Wolfcamp targets. The pursuit of secondary targets with wells developed in packages alongside traditional development benches generally have minimal production impact on the primary zone, however, carry a favorable investment profile because they require no additional leasehold investment, are drilled and completed on existing pads and produced into existing facilities and gathering systems. The goal is to deliver low risk, high returns that maximize the cash return potential of our assets. Looking out beyond our current proved reserves, we've identified over 10 billion-barrel equivalents of future resource potential in our existing premium plays with an expected finding cost -- finding and development costs less than our current DD&A rate. When we invest in finding and development costs less than our DD&A rate, we drive the cost basis of the Company down. When we invested high returns, combined with a low finding and development cost, it shows up in the financials as increased return on capital employed. Thanks to the benefits of our decentralized structure and multi-basin organic exploration strategy, our resource base is growing faster than we do it. More importantly, it is getting better. We have over 10 years of double-premium drilling at the current pace, and we are focused on improving the quality of our resource every year through operational innovation, technical improvements and expiration. Now let me turn the call back to Ezra. Yes, Leo, this is Ken. I'll take the Utica portion of that. The four wells we drilled and completed in '22, really continue to deliver our expected performance. And just to give you a flavor on that, we anticipate starting our drilling program for '23 at the end of the first quarter here. One other thing, I would note in the Utica, not on the well side, but on the acreage side is we have added about 10,000 acres of low-cost acreage store position, and we'll continue to look for additional opportunities to add to that position. So we're really excited about the Utica plan for 2023. I'm going to go ahead and give it over to Jeff now for the Powder. Yes, Neal, this is Ken. I'll take a shot at that. We -- what we talked about earlier, and the way we really look at it, is we have 10 years of double-premium inventory at our current activity level. So locations really aren't a concern for us.

            "name": "Billy Helms",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. I would like to first thank each of our employees for their accomplishments and execution last year. 2022 was a challenging year, and the commitment and dedication of our employees remain steadfast as they delivered outstanding results. Last year can be characterized as a year of heightened inflation where we witnessed increasing commodity prices, accompanied by higher levels of activity across the industry. The result was a much tighter market for services, labor and supplies. We were able to offset most of this inflation through efficiency gains and capital management across our portfolio to limit well cost increases to just 7%. For the full year, oil production was above the midpoint of guidance, while capital expenditures were $4.6 billion, were only 2% above the original guidance midpoint set at the beginning of the year. Our operating teams working throughout the Company leveraged efficiencies to help offset inflation. This is most evident in our core development plays, which sustain sufficient activities to support continued experimentation and innovation. In the Delaware Basin, we expanded use of our Super Zipper completion technique to increase treated lateral feet per day by 24%. In our Eagle Ford play, the completions team increased completed lateral feet per day by 14% and the amount of sand pump per day per fleet by 27%. Our decentralized operations teams are continually striving to improve performance and share learnings across our portfolio to limit well cost increases. These learnings are then deployed in our emerging opportunity plays. For instance, in the Southern Powder River Basin, Mowry play, the drilling team decreased drilling time by 10% with improved bid and drilling motor performance. In our South Texas Dorado gas play, the operations team reduced drilling time by 12%. Through technical and operational advancements, they promise to continue to drive improvements in 2023. Beyond cost reductions, a new completion design implemented last year in the Delaware Basin is realizing positive improvements in well performance in certain target reservoirs. This new design was tested in 26 wells last year and is yielding as much as an 18% uplift and estimated ultimate recovery. We're also making great progress towards our long-term ESG goals. Our wellhead gas capture rate exceeded 99.9% of the gross gas produced. And preliminary results indicate that we lowered GHG intensity and methane emissions percentages in 2022. We now have approximately 95% of our Delaware Basin production covered by iSense, our continuous methane monitoring technology. Now turning to the 2023 plan. We forecast a $6 billion capital program to deliver 3% oil volume growth and 9% total production growth. We expect total volumes on a Boe basis to grow each quarter through the year. First quarter will show more growth in gas versus oil due to the well mix and timing of several Dorado gas wells that were completed late in the fourth quarter of last year. The plan can be summarized in the following four points. First, drilling rig and frac fleet activity in our core development programs, specifically the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford, will be relatively consistent with the fourth quarter of last year. The longer-term outlook for the Eagle Ford is to maintain the current production base where we have over a decade of continued opportunities to generate high returns and cash flow. After a decade of stellar operational improvements in the Eagle Ford, it has become a highly efficient, high-margin play with existing infrastructure and access to favorable markets. In the Powder River Basin, the plan builds off last year's positive well results and infrastructure installation with an additional 20 Mowry completions. We expect to complete a few additional wells in our emerging Utica play in Ohio as we continue to delineate our acreage position and drill a few wells in the Bakken and DJ Basins. In Dorado, our plan is to achieve an activity level that creates economies of scale and develop a continuous program to allow for innovation that drives improved well performance and cost reductions. This results in a moderate increase in activity, completing about 10 additional wells versus last year. In Trinidad, a drilling rig is now scheduled to arrive in the third quarter, which is about a six-month delay. So, international volumes decreased 60 million cubic feet per day or 10,000 Boes per day versus our earlier estimates. Overall, we increased activity in our emerging plays. The average EOG rig count for the year is expected to increase by about two rigs and one additional frac fleet. Second, we have line of sight to efficiencies that we expect will limit additional inflation pressure on well cost to just 10% versus last year. Year-over-year increases in tubular costs as well as day rates for drilling rigs and frac fleets are the main drivers of the increase. As part of our contracting strategy, we stagger our agreements to secure a base line of services and secure consistent execution. For this year, we have locked in about 55% of our well cost, which is a similar level to previous years. Approximately 45% of our drilling rigs and 65% of our frac fleets needed for the year are covered under term agreements with multiple providers. By maintaining this consistent base of services, we expect to find additional opportunities to drive performance improvements and eliminate downtime, thus potentially providing an opportunity to offset some additional inflation. Third, our 2023 capital program includes additional infrastructure investment. Typically, funding for facilities and other infrastructure projects comprises 15% to 20% of the CapEx budget. And this year, we expect that number to be closer to 20%. In Dorado, we commenced construction late last year on a new 36-inch gas pipeline from the field to the Aqua Dolce sales point near Corpus Christi, Texas. This pipeline will help ensure a long-term takeaway, fully capture the value chain from the wellhead to the market center, help support expanded LNG export price exposures due to come online around 2026 and broaden our direct interstate pipeline capacity to reach markets along the entire Gulf Coast corridor. We're also undertaking smaller infrastructure projects in other areas, like the Utica to lower the long-term unit operating cost. Fourth, we plan -- the plan includes capital that represents the next steps towards our vision of being among the lowest emissions producers of oil and natural gas. Our first CCS project has begun injection and we will continue to explore opportunities to enhance our leadership position in environmentally prudent operations. These projects offer healthy returns while also providing reductions in long-life unit operating cost and lower emissions. EOG remains focused on running the business for the long term, generating high returns through disciplined growth, improving our resource base through organic exploration, improving our environmental footprint and investing in projects that will lower the future cost basis of the Company. I am excited about 2023 and the opportunity it brings for our employees to further improve the Company. Now here's Ken to review year-end reserves and provide an inventory update. Yes, certainly. On the inflation front, I think it's safe to say that everybody has seen commodity prices falling. We've seen inflation rates have peaked and come down. And so we're seeing a lot of the service costs, at least, have plateaued going into this year. And so, as I mentioned on the call, we've got about 55% of our wealth costs secured through existing contracts with our event. And that leaves us the opportunity to capture any upside that we might see in lower rates going into the year. So we're sitting in a fairly good position. I think we're going to be poised and waiting to see what happens and take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves. But I think inflation, at least, is showing that we've plateaued. We baked in about a 10% inflation into our plan. And as we see opportunities, we'll continue to look for ways to improve that. I think what we've seen is one of the biggest drivers this last year on inflation was certainly tubulars casing cost. And I think we've seen different things and different parts of that make up. I think the ERW products is mostly the surface and intermediate casings, those have rolled over and are softening a little bit more than the production casing, which is your seamless products, which are still largely exposed to imports. And so you're seeing some opportunities on casing, but I think there's still yet to come on most of that. On the service side, I think we haven't really seen anything manifested yet, but I think we've all seen rig counts have largely been flat since September, and they're down off their peak of -- in November of probably 20 to 25 rigs. And with the drop in gas prices, I think everybody is expecting maybe we'll see some more softening on the rig activity level. So that may lead to some opportunities to capture some markets. The one advantage that we have, and I'll go ahead and throw this out, we may expand on it later, but the benefit we have is operating in multiple basins. And so we see certainly more service tightness and labor constraints in areas with the most activity, which would be the Permian. But we have the opportunity to shift activity to our other basins to enable those to take advantage of more available equipment, more available capacity to add services at favorable rates. So that's the advantage that we have as a company. Yes, Doug, this is Billy Helms. Let me take a stab at that. So first, there's probably three buckets you can probably put the increase in. First of all, is inflation in our well cost. That's probably a good piece of it, 1/3 of it. It's about -- we're anticipating about a 10% well cost inflation in our program versus last year. And yes, that's maybe 10% over and above last year. But still last year, we achieved only a 7% well cost increase in spite of probably, arguably, 15% or 20% inflation. So I think our teams have done a great job on offsetting inflation with efficiency gains. We're expecting more of that this year, but we've baked in about a 10% cost increase. The second part of that is going to be infrastructure. We've talked about already our Dorado gas pipeline. That's been initiated. And we're also building out some infrastructure in some of our emerging plays, like the Utica to start the testing of those plays. And then we've also included some capital for our ESG projects that we're advancing. So those are kind of the buckets that we look at. And then obviously, we have some additional wells on top of that in these various plays. So as we pick up the two additional rigs and one extra frac fleet, of course, that's going to accompany some additional well count. So those are the three main buckets that I would characterize the increase in the capital versus last year. Sure. As I mentioned earlier in some of the questions, obviously, you see more levels of inflation and more constraints on services in certain fields versus the other, the Permian being the most active play. Certainly, there's a more constraints there on services and labor and those kind of things. So it allows us the opportunity to pick up activity in basins that are seeing less stress, you might say, and Eagle Ford certainly being one of those. On top of that, our team there in Eagle Ford has done just a tremendous job continuing to push innovation and striving for efficiencies such that we continue to make better and better returns in that play with time. And we've kind of reached a point, as Ezra mentioned there, that we want to maintain the constant level of production going forward in that play because we do see more than a decade of running room of continuing to maintain that production level with the opportunities we have in front of us. So we think it's just a good level of production to maintain going forward. Yes, Scott, this is Billy. Yes, we're thrilled with the -- our efficiencies driven through our completion teams. The continuous pumping operation, you're right, is tied to mostly our electric frac fleets. Just a reminder, we've -- we're probably running 60% or 70% of our frac fleets today are electric. And we've been in that business really since about 2015. So, we've been operating more electric frac fleets probably than most of our peers or most of the industry for a long period of time. And through that, we've gained a tremendous amount of knowledge of how to continue to drive efficiencies in that operation. It really has started more in our San Antonio group in the Eagle Ford play, and that's why we're so excited about continuing our investment there. And certainly, we're transferring that information and that those techniques across the Company, including the Delaware Basin. But basically, the continuous pumping operation allows us to minimize any amount of downtime, so we can increase the amount of footage we complete every day, which drives the well cost down over time and allows us to approach some really highly efficient completion strategies. And so, part of that is also leading to improved completion designs, which is allowing us to make better well performance. So overall, it's just one thing that builds on another, and we're excited about the future and where that takes us. Our contracts are really staggered, and they don't all roll off at any one given time. Certainly, our well cost is up this year as I mentioned earlier, because some of those contracts have rolled off last year and renewed on those higher day rates and pumping charges this year. But in general, we have about 45% of our drilling rigs secured under term agreements and about 65% of our frac fleets. So that leaves us ample opportunity to capture opportunities if they do present themselves as time moves on. Yes. Jeanine, this is Billy. Happy to give you some color on that. The Delaware Basin is certainly one of our most capital-efficient plays, quickly followed by the Eagle Ford. The advantage we have in the Eagle Ford is, as I mentioned earlier, the tremendous efficiencies that have been driven in that play. You're right the cum per foot is probably a little bit lower in the Eagle Ford but the well cost is also significantly less. And so we can put a lot more wells to sales in a lot shorter time frame than we can in the Delaware Basin. And then going back to that also, we didn't really feel that we wanted to ramp up activity anymore in the Delaware Basin, but instead leverage on our multi-basin portfolio to increase activity in areas where equipment and crews are more available to leverage into our operation. And so that's what we've chosen to do. But I think the Eagle Ford is still one of our most capital-efficient plays we have in the Company, and we're excited about that opportunity to keep sustaining volume going forward. Yes, Jeanine, this is Billy again. The base declines have been fairly consistent, I would say, year-to-year. And we don't see a measurable change really in our base declines going forward. I think last year was a pretty good year as compared to this year, and I expect the declines would be similar. Yes, Derrick, this is Billy Helms again. On the new completion design, certainly, we're always experimenting with new ideas and trying to innovate as to ways we can improve well performance over time. And we're excited about some of the new advancements and techniques we're experimenting with the Delaware Basin. And to be honest, that's just more color on why we like to get to a consistent program and where we can innovate and experiment and make these improvements. So I'm not going to go into detail about what this new completion design looks like. But certainly, as we continue to advance it, we will translate it to -- import that technology to other basins, and we're already doing so. We were excited about the 18% uplift we've seen, but it's only been done on 26 wells so far in the Delaware Basin. So you can see it's still early on. The amount of the improvement is tremendous though, and we fully expect to be able to transfer that knowledge to other plays. Yes. Charles, this is Billy Helms. Yes. The new design is -- really starts with an understanding of the rock we're applying it to. I think we've talked in the past about how all of our designs are tailor made to every wellbore and whatever the geology is telling us is the right application for that. So is it something that we could apply to all zones? I would say probably not, but it's certainly more attractive than other zones. But it is also being done in the core of the play. It's not just applying to the fringe intervals or the fringe of the plays, but some of our core plays or target intervals and we're seeing dramatic improvements. Now it's going to be -- continue to be tailored based on what the geology tells us is the right application, and we'll tweak it and be able to transfer that knowledge as we see it develop. Sure, Charles. The rigs are pretty much in operation today. We started kind of picking up rigs at the end of the fourth quarter going into this year. And as we mentioned, the fourth quarter run rates in the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford will be pretty consistent throughout the year. And so, we've also started drilling in some of the other plays, some of the new emerging plays, such as the Powder River Basin and Dorado. So those are kind of ongoing. We'll be picking up rigs at different times and some of the other plays, like the Bakken or the DJ or the Utica. And those will kind of come and go. Those aren't going to be really, yet full rig lines. They'll kind of ebb and flow based on the timing of each individual play. But the base program is pretty much going to be set, and I'd say the rig count is not going to fluctuate much beyond where it is today."

Factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliation schedules for these GAAP measures can be found on EOG's website. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Jeff Leitzell, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor Relations. Here's Ezra. Thanks, Ezra. When we established our premium strategy back in 2016, our goal is to reset the cost base of the business to earn economic returns at the bottom of the price cycle. The impact premium has had on the cost basis of the Company and our financial performance has been dramatic. Since 2014, prior to establishing our premium strategy, our DD&A rate has declined 42% and cash operating cost by 23%. Also, in 2014, and under similar oil prices as last year, we earned 15% ROCE. With our lower cost structure, ROCE increased to a record 34% in 2022. We have also reduced net debt last year by $800 million to further strengthen the balance sheet. We view a strong balance sheet as a competitive advantage in a cyclical industry. Our current balance sheet is among the strongest in the energy industry and ranks near the top 20th percentile of the S&P 500 in terms of leverage and liquidity, measured as net debt to EBITDA and cash as a percentage of market cap. We have a $1.25 billion bond maturing in March and intend to pay that off with cash on hand. Our 2023 plan is positioned to generate another year of strong returns. We expect to grow oil volumes by 3% and total production on a BOE basis by 9%. At $80 WTI and $3.25 Henry Hub, we expect to generate about $5.5 billion of free cash flow for nearly 8% yield at the current stock price and produce an ROCE approaching 30%. This attractive financial outlook, along with our strong balance sheet, is what gave us the confidence to declare a $1 per share special dividend to start the year on top of our regular dividend of $0.825 per share. As a reminder, our commitment to return a minimum of 60% of free cash flow considers the full year, not a single quarter in isolation. The special dividend reflects the confidence in our plan and our constructive outlook on oil and gas prices. We will continue to evaluate the amount of cash return as we go through the year with an eye on, once again, meeting or exceeding our full year minimum cash return commitment of 60% of free cash flow. Here's Billy to discuss operations."

            "name": "Ezra Yacob",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG's growing portfolio of high-return assets delivered outstanding results in 2022. We earned record return on capital employed of 34% and record adjusted net income of $8.1 billion, generated a record $7.6 billion of free cash flow which funded record cash return to shareholders of $5.1 billion. We increased our regular dividend rate 10% and paid four special dividends, paying out 67% of free cash flow, beating our commitment to return a minimum of 60% of annual free cash flow to shareholders. And we strengthened what was already one of the best balance sheets in the industry, reducing net debt by nearly $800 million. We continue to deliver on our free cash flow priorities this year by declaring an additional special dividend of $1 per share yesterday. Outshining our financial results were achievements made by our operating teams working in a challenging inflationary environment. Credit goes to the innovative and entrepreneurial teams working collaboratively across our multi-basin portfolio. Together, we leveraged the flexibility provided by our decentralized structure to deliver exceptional operational performance. Production volumes, CapEx and per unit operating costs were within guidance set at the start of the year. We offset persistent inflationary pressures that exceeded 20% during the year to limit well cost increases to just 7%. Our exploration teams uncovered a new premium play, the Ohio Utica combo, and advanced two emerging plays, the South Texas Toronto and Southern Powder River Basin. We've progressed several exploration prospects including the Northern Powder River Basin. We expanded our LNG agreement, currently estimated to take effect in 2026 to 720,000 MMBtu per day, which will provide JKM-linked pricing optionality for 420,000 MMBtu per day. Last year, the revenue uplift from our current 140,000 MMBtu per day LNG exposure was more than $600 million net to EOG. Preliminary results indicate that we reduced our GHG intensity and methane emissions percentage, achieving our 2025 targets. And we initiated an expanded deployment of our new continuous methane leak detection system called iSense. Led by the tremendous performance in our Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford plays, our operating performance and financial results in 2022 are a reflection of our asset portfolio and the unique organizational structure in place to support it. Seven teams in North America and one international team operates 16 plays across nine basins. Our decentralized structure empowers each operating team to make decisions in real time at the asset level to maximize value. This differentiates EOG and enables us to consistently execute our strategy and produce outstanding results year after year. Our multi-basin portfolio provides numerous high-return investment opportunities and we remain focused on disciplined investment across each of our assets. In addition to our premium well strategy, in which wells must generate a minimum of 30% direct after-tax rate of return at a flat $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas price for the life of the well, we invest at a pace that allows each asset to improve year-over-year, lowering the cost and expanding the margins generated by each asset. Disciplined investment means more than just expanding margins at the top of the cycle. It means delivering value for the life of the resource and through the commodity price cycle. It's not only developing lower-cost reserves, but also investing strategically to lower the operating cost of these resources, which positions EOG to generate full cycle returns competitive with the broad market. Looking ahead to 2023, EOG is in a better position than ever to deliver value for our shareholders and play a significant role in the long-term future of energy. Our ability to reinvest in the business, deliver disciplined growth, lower our emissions intensity, earn high returns, raise the regular dividend and returned significant cash to shareholders, all while maintaining what we believe is the best balance sheet in the industry is due to our differentiated strategy executed consistently year after year. Now, here's Tim to review our financial position. Thanks, Ken. In conclusion, I'd like to note the following important takeaways. EOG Resources offers a unique value proposition. First, it begins with our multi-basin portfolio of high-return investment opportunities anchored by the industry's most stringent investment hurdle rate or premium price deck. Second, our disciplined growth strategy optimizes investment to support continuous improvement across our portfolio. Our employees utilize technology and innovation to increase efficiencies and allow EOG to remain a low-cost operator. Third, we are focused on generating both near- and long-term free cash flow to fund a sustainably growing regular dividend, support our commitment to return additional free cash flow to shareholders and maintain a pristine balance sheet to provide optionality through the cycles. Fourth, we are focused on safe operations and improving our environmental footprint across each of our assets, utilizing both existing and internally developed technologies. And finally, it's the EOG employees that make it happen. Our culture is at the core of our value proposition and is our ultimate competitive advantage. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A. Thank you, Paul. This is Ezra. Those are both great questions. So let me start with the first one here on natural gas and what's it looking like right now. You're correct, we've been watching the recent volatility in natural gas, late 2022 and currently associated with the LNG outages and the warm winter that we're experiencing. Our gas growth this next year on the plan, you'll see is about -- at the midpoint is about 240 million cubic feet per day. About 50% of that is coming out of the -- as you mentioned, the associated gas from the Delaware Basin and the other half of it is basically coming out of our Dorado play. Our strategy at Dorado, I'd say, hasn't significantly changed yet. And at this point, we don't really see that it would, barring anything dramatic. And the reason for that is that Dorado always has been kind of a longer-term strategy for us. We've always focused on having moderate investment there to grow into the growing demand center along the Gulf Coast. It's never really been about chasing seasonal demand or aggressively ramping up activities in that play. The U.S., just this year, will have about two Bcf a day of LNG export back online after the disruption's clear. We've got an additional five Bcf a day coming online in kind of the '24, '25 time frame and then potentially another eight Bcf a day still working through financing. And we see this line of sight demand growth is also reflected with the strip price where you see currently, it's moved into contango. So our long-term strategy at Dorado really remains the same. It's investment at a pace where the asset improves each year giving us an ability to drive down both upfront well costs and long-term operating costs, where we can consistently deliver the low cost of supply. This year, as Billy stated, we'll be moving towards a one completion crew program to really capture those efficiencies at Dorado. The first part of your second question, I believe, is on sustaining CapEx. And what I'd say is the sustaining CapEx is a number that we don't necessarily focus on here as an organic growth company. And the reason for that is, even during 2020, we didn't maintain a maintenance capital type of program. We're very dynamic, and we'll grow and we see the ability to invest in our business and the market supports it. And when we don't need to, we can pull back at that time as well. So maintenance CapEx is not necessarily a number that we look at. Now as far as breakevens on our capital program this year, it definitely is up a little bit year-over-year. As Billy mentioned, there's some inflation in there. But also, we're obviously seeing the opportunity to invest in our multi-basin portfolio and increase the CapEx. So, our CapEx program this year is at $44 WTI price with a $3.25 gas price. And I'll maybe hand it over to Billy to give a little bit of color on inflation and where we see it going this year. It's Ezra. That's a great question. I love talking about our balance sheet and the strength of it. It's something we take a lot of pride in. And the reason for that is because it gives us a lot of optionality at different times, whether it's to look at -- in 2020, we purchased -- strategically purchased a lot of casing. In 2021, we were able to purchase a decent amount of line pipe. And just last year, we were able to make a small acquisition in the Utica play, including purchasing some minerals there. So we're still not looking for any large, expensive, corporate M&As. We do continue to seek out opportunities where it makes sense to do bolt-ons, things that would be accretive, things that could move right into our existing infrastructure and extend some of our lateral lengths. In general, for our net cash position, I would say we don't have a specific target. We do like to have the optionality. The one thing you didn't mention is that we will be retiring a bond here in this first quarter at $1.2 billion. And then, in addition to that, I'd point out that last year, we did move beyond our minimum commitment of that 60% return of free cash flow to our shareholders. Last year, we returned approximately 67%. And so I think you can see -- you can take that as a data point that when appropriate and at the right time and obviously, it's evaluated at the Board level, depending on where we're at within the cycle, where we're at within the year and what our cash position looks like, we have proved that we're willing to move above and beyond the 60% minimum threshold. Yes, Arun, we can start -- yes, maybe with some of our longer cycle stuff. We can start with Trinidad. As Billy mentioned, there has been a bit of a rig delay on our Trinidad drilling program. So that will start about midyear this year. We did set a platform there based -- this past year based on one of the discoveries that we made in 2020. We should start construction on another platform there named Momento later this year, also based on some of the work that we did in that drilling campaign that ended in 2020. So that's on the Trinidad side. In Beehive in Australia, it's our prospect on the Northwest shelf. That prospect has actually slid a little bit. It's now time to be spud in 2024. And then with some of the other projects that you had mentioned, as you can see, and it goes in line with what we were just talking about with the ability of our balance sheet to be strategic and opportunistic. And typically, we do these things counter-cyclically like our agreement on the LNG side, or the ability to put in some infrastructure like we are currently in Dorado to go ahead and lower our operating costs and expand our margins. Those are the type of opportunities that we really look for, things that are in concert with our core business, which is drilling and developing premium oil and natural gas wells. Yes, Doug, that's a good question. Yes, I think the difference is between 2019 or pre-COVID with the oil versus what we're doing in Dorado right now. So like I said, the Dorado volumes are anticipated to support. It's basically the output of a single completion spread program this year. And the benefits that we see of running a consistent program there to learn about this asset, continue to drive down costs, support putting in some infrastructure, things like water takeaway and in-basin gathering, that outweighs the near-term volatility in the gas price because what we see is in a very not-too-distant future, we see a pretty dramatic increase in the offtake and the demand coming on along the Gulf Coast. Now we are backstopped and supported, obviously, with investing on the return side in these premium wells. So we measure the investment on here at a $2.50 natural gas price. And while at today's prices, that's below, we run that $2.50 all the way through the life of the asset. The rest of the gas that we're growing this year is, honestly, as we -- as I said at the top of the Q&A is really associated gas coming out of the Delaware Basin, where the returns there are dominantly driven obviously on the oil and liquids side. And we're really running a maintenance program or a flat activity level program to Q4 across the Delaware Basin. Yes, Leo, this is Ezra. That's a great pickup. It's a good question because that's exactly what's happened is that it is raising up with respect to the returns and the way they compete for capital. Over the last couple of years, kind of coming out of the pandemic, we've reduced our -- there. And the result of that, we've been trying to right-size the investment. The result has been really back to back years of the highest drilling -- rate of return drilling programs that we've seen in the history of developing that asset. As everybody knows, it's a very high-margin oil play where we've got a lot of infrastructure and a tremendous amount of industry knowledge there. Simply, the asset now is commanding a lot more capital investment this year. We are looking to invest to maintain flat production, as you said. The production has decreased a bit over the last couple of years. And one advantage that we are seeing in the Eagle Ford, and Billy touched on this, and maybe I'll let him add a little more color on it, is really how the inflation and service availability has manifested itself across these different basins and why the Eagle Ford's a bit more attractive. I'd just like to thank everyone for participating in the call this morning and especially thank our employees for the outstanding results delivered in 2022. Thank you."

Here's Ezra.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. The quality of EOG's diverse multi-basin portfolio of high-return assets continues to grow and improve. Yesterday's announcement of the large position we captured in the Utica Combo play demonstrates yet again that EOG's robust exploration pipeline delivers results. Over the last two years, our organic exploration efforts have brought forth Dorado, our premium dry natural gas play in South Texas, the emerging Northern Powder River Basin oil play in Wyoming and now the emerging Utica Combo play in Ohio. The value of our multi-basin portfolio can't be overstated. With the addition of the Utica Combo, we are now positioned to operate 7 premium resource basins, which reinforces several of EOG's competitive advantages. First, our decentralized cross-functional operating teams innovate independently, but collaborate to compound the impact of learnings and efficiencies across the company. Second, our flexibility to allocate capital optimizes reinvestment across our portfolio, enabling us to develop each asset at the right pace to maximize returns. And third, our geographic and product diversity gives us the ability to plan around basin-level market dynamics. Our goal is to expand and improve the overall quality of our portfolio by identifying higher return inventory. Our approach is to build a diverse portfolio of premium assets predominantly through low-cost organic exploration, which adds reserves at lower finding and development costs and lowers the overall cost basis of the company. The end result is continuous improvement to EOG's company-wide capital efficiency. Our track record of successful exploration, coupled with strong operational execution, is how EOG has continued to improve over time and position the company to create shareholder value through industry cycles. We demonstrated our confidence in EOG's improving cost structure yesterday by increasing the regular dividend 10%. Our peer-leading annualized dividend is now $3.30 per share, competitive with the broad market. We also delivered on our commitment to return at least 60% of annual free cash flow to shareholders with our fourth special dividend of the year. By year-end, we will have returned $5.80 per share of special dividends. Combined with the regular dividend, we will return $8.80 per share or $5.1 billion in cash to shareholders, which exceeds our 60% cash return commitment using current forecasts. Looking forward, we expect 2023 will remain dynamic with respect to the supply chain, oil and gas prices and other global macro drivers. Our diverse low-cost asset base puts us in an excellent position to capitalize on opportunities no matter the environment. EOG continues to consistently execute, lower our cost structure through innovation and efficiencies and grow the quality of our portfolio to improve capital efficiency and free cash flow potential. Our transparent cash return strategy is anchored to a sustainable, growing regular dividend and backstopped by an impeccable balance sheet. EOG is in a better position than ever to deliver value for our shareholders through industry cycles and play a leading role in the long-term future of energy. Next up is Billy with an early look at our 2023 plan, followed by Tim, who will review our financial performance. Ken will then provide background and details on the Utica Combo play. Here's Billy.\nBilly Helms: Thanks, Ezra. Once again, EOG delivered outstanding results in the third quarter. We exceeded midpoint of production guidance, while capital expenditures beat forecasted targets. I'd like to thank our employees for their perseverance and execution to beat the expectations. Realized oil and natural gas prices also beat their target benchmarks in the third quarter. Our marketing teams are doing an excellent job executing our long-term strategy of diversifying across multiple transportation outlets and sales points. This strategy is also enabling the company to navigate the recent bottlenecks, transporting natural gas out of the Permian. We hold a significant transport position with the ability to move up to a Bcf a day out of the basin. In total, less than 5% of our domestic gas production is exposed to WAHA pricing in the Permian. In fact, we anticipate fourth quarter realized prices to remain strong for both natural gas and crude oil sales overall. Our crude oil and natural gas export capacity is serving us well in this regard. In the fourth quarter, we expect to sell over 250,000 barrels of crude oil per day at Brent length prices and 140,000 MMBtu per day of natural gas at JKM-linked prices, both on a gross basis. Year-to-date through September, export-based pricing of crude oil and natural gas has added nearly $700 million of revenue uplift compared to the alternative domestic sales. One of the major topics of the year continues to be the inflation story. The price pressure we are seeing on steel, fuel and labor continues to be persistent. Our employees are maintaining their focus on finding ways to mitigate inflation through innovation and efficiencies in our operations. Through their efforts, we now expect our average well cost to increase a modest 7% as compared to last year. As a result, we have narrowed our full year capital guidance to $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion. Given the elevated and persistent inflation pressures we have experienced this year, I am proud of our employees' efforts to mitigate a majority of this impact to our capital plan. We continue to evaluate and shape our plans for 2023. Production growth and infrastructure investments will remain guided by capital discipline. We expect low single-digit oil growth similar to this year. We currently forecast oil equivalent growth, including gas and liquids, at a low double-digit rate, somewhat higher than this year, largely driven by increased activity in our highly productive dry gas play. Once again, we plan to leverage our activity across multiple basins to secure services and manage cost pressures. Our initial plan includes a modest increase in activity, utilizing on the order of 28 to 30 drilling rigs, including one offshore rig in Trinidad. This would be accompanied by 8 to 10 frac fleets. This would represent a slight increase of 2 to 3 rigs and 1 to 2 frac fleets over 2022 activity levels. We are seeing opportunities in different basins to lock in services at favorable rates for next year and currently expect to secure 50% to 60% of our well cost by the start of the year. This is within our typical range and compares with 50% of costs incurred for the start of 2022. All in all, we expect higher CapEx in 2023, driven by four key factors. First, we are assuming that persistent inflation pressure continues. With the cost of materials and services increasing, our initial 2023 budget is likely to reflect another 10% well cost increase, on top of the 7% increase we expect this year. We will continue to work to identify additional savings and efficiency improvements to offset the impact of inflation, just as we did this year. Second, we see several opportunities to advance development of particular assets in our portfolio in areas that are less exposed to the most severe inflation and supply chain pressures. The increase in activity in emerging plays like Dorado, the Powder River Basin and the Utica Combo are examples. Third, we expect to accelerate some infrastructure projects to take advantage of market opportunities. In Dorado, we've begun construction of a new 36-inch gas pipeline from the field to the Agua Dolce sales point near Corpus Christi, Texas. This will ensure long-term takeaway, fully capture the value chain from the wellhead to the market center and aligns with our focus on being a low-cost operator. Fourth, we plan to continue to progress our investments in environmental projects, including expansion of our carbon capture and storage or CCS projects. Our first CCS project is progressing, and we expect to begin injecting CO2 early next year. This is yet another step toward our goal of being among the lowest-cost, highest-return and lowest-emission producers of oil and natural gas. We recently released our latest sustainability report for 2021, which highlights our progress. We achieved our near-term 2025 methane emissions percentage target of 0.06% last year, an 85% reduction from 2017 levels. We captured 99.8% of natural gas produced at the wellhead, meeting our 2021 gas capture target. We discussed our latest initiative to further reduce methane emissions through our continuous leak detection system named iSense. We improved our safety performance with lower total recordable and lost time incident rates, and we reduced our freshwater intensity rate by 55% since 2020. We are proud of our employees' progress on our sustainability goals, but we still see tremendous opportunities for continued improvements. Altogether, infrastructure spending, including environmental projects, typically amounts to 15% to 20% of our CapEx budget. This year is running right about the midpoint of that range; whereas next year, we expect it to be towards the higher end of that range. We continue to develop our 2023 plans as we approach the new year and provide a more detailed complete outlook in February. Now here's Tim to discuss our financials.\nTim Driggers: Thanks, Billy. We are very pleased to increase the regular dividend by 10% to $3.30 per share annual rate. This increase reflects two things. First, the improvements we've made to the cost structure. Efficiencies and technology continue to sustainably improve EOG's capital efficiency. Furthermore, we expect the advantages of operating in multiple basins will drive additional improvements to EOG's cost structure and returns in the year ahead, lower the cost of supply and lower the breakeven oil price to fund the dividend. Second, this dividend increase reflects our confidence in EOG's expanding portfolio of premium plays to grow the company's future income and free cash flow potential. Over the last several years, our success in organic exploration continues to add low-cost reserves and consistently drive down our DD&A rate, enabling EOG to create value through industry cycles. We also remain committed to returning at least 60% of free cash flow to shareholders each year. As a reminder, we look at this on an annual basis, not quarter-to-quarter. Based on current commodity prices, we estimate the $1.50 special dividend declared yesterday will bring free cash flow return to shareholders to about 67% for 2022. We will start 2023 in an exceptionally strong financial position. We ended the third quarter with $5.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet against $5.1 billion of debt. We generated $2.3 billion of free cash flow during the quarter, along with inflows of another $1.3 billion of cash from working capital, primarily from the drawdown of hedge collateral. Now here's Ken.\nKen Boedeker: Thanks, Tim. We're excited to announce our new oil and natural gas combo acreage position in Ohio's Utica Shale. We've accumulated 395,000 acres in this play, predominantly in the volatile oil window across a 140-mile trend running north to south. Our cost of entry was less than $600 per net acre for leasehold, demonstrating the benefit of organic exploration, one of our most distinct competitive advantages. Capturing highly productive rock through our organic exploration and leasing efforts is the primary way of improving the quality of our premium inventory at low cost, which leads to a lower company-wide cost basis. The Utica is a well-known and prolific gas resource to the east of our acreage. Several years ago, our exploration team operating out of the Oklahoma City office took a fresh look at the basin from a petroleum system perspective. We knew there was an oil rim with varying gas to oil ratios present. Using our experience in other basins and our technical workflows and proprietary reservoir engineering modeling tools, we anticipated that this could be an area that would be additive to our inventory. When we considered our advancements in precision targeting and simulation technology, along with our low-cost drilling and completion operations, it became clear that this area had the potential to compete with our premium and double-premium plays across the company. Through leasing and acquisitions, we acquired 18 legacy wells with varying geologic and production data, which supported our assessment of the area. Over the last 12 months, we've confirmed our model and the economic viability of this prospect by drilling 3 delineation wells in the northern part of our acreage and 1 in the South. These first 4 wells already earned premium and double-premium returns when normalized to our development plan, which assumes 3-mile laterals. As a reminder, our premium hurdle rate assumes $40 oil, $16 NGLs and $2.50 natural gas. These exceptional results are due primarily to the high productivity of the interval and the large amount of liquids in the product mix from the volatile oil window. In addition to the well performance, we also want to highlight our embedded mineral interest in the southern portion of the acreage. We've acquired 100% of the mineral rights across 135,000 acres of our leasehold for about $1,800 per acre, which is in addition to the $600 per net acre for the leases. This mineral interest significantly enhances the value of this play by adding 25% to our production and reserve strain from no additional well cost or operating expense. This area is also where we've drilled our most prolific well, which has initially produced over 2,500 barrels of oil per day and 3,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a 12,000-foot lateral. The total value of this mineral interest across our southern development area is significant, especially since EOG will dictate the pace of development as operator. Next year, we plan to drill approximately 20 wells in the northern and southern areas and utilize our multi-basin experience to climb the learning curve faster by leaning on the best targeting, drilling and completion techniques that apply to this area. We expect our 2023 Utica Combo plan will accomplish 2 goals: first, to deliver double premium returns; while second, further delineating the play to help assess resource and inventory. We will invest in incremental gathering infrastructure to prepare for a larger development program and anticipate being able to take advantage of existing processing infrastructure in the area for the foreseeable future. This is the advantage of the timing and economic efficiency of successfully unlocking potential in an existing basin. EOG's entry into the Utica Combo play is a textbook example of why our decentralized organization that operates in multiple basins with wide-ranging geology lends itself to successful additions to the upper end of our premium and double-premium inventory. We applied what we learned over the past decade in developing our portfolio to identify and unlock this overlooked resource. Now here's Ezra to wrap things up.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Ken. The takeaway from today's call are centered on EOG's fundamental value proposition. First, EOG's multi-basin organic exploration focus continues to improve the quality of our inventory, Capturing Tier 1 acreage across multiple high-return opportunities provides geographic diversity, product diversity and the flexibility to allocate capital across each asset at the correct pace to optimize returns. Second, EOG is a low-cost operator. We use technology to increase operational efficiency and capture select pieces of the value chain to keep both capital and operating costs low, thereby helping to reduce our breakevens and increase our free cash flow and income-generating potential. Third, Tim highlighted our financial performance and commitment to financial discipline that results in a 10% increase to our peer-leading regular dividend, a commitment to additional cash return with our announced special dividends and a best-in-class balance sheet. Fourth, our recently published sustainability report illustrates our progress to reach near-term greenhouse gas and methane emissions intensity goals and our commitment to develop new technologies and pilot new projects, such as our CCS project, to help reduce our environmental footprint. And fifth, it is EOG's employees and unique culture that continues to drive our success. Thanks for listening. We'll now go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann. You may proceed.\nNeal Dingmann: Congratulations for some nice results. My first question is on, to jump right to it, the Utica Combo play. Specifically, looking at that Slide 10 of years, it appears, and you talked about this -- some of you guys talked about this already, that the primary folks looks like it's on that volatile oil section or window. Just wondering, have you identified this is sort of how the economics look in this window and sort of why focus here? And secondly, maybe just talk about the takeaway situation for you all there.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Neal, this is Ezra. Thanks for the question. I'll maybe make a couple of comments and then hand it to Ken to shed a little more light on the economics and then Lance will provide a little more commentary on the takeaway. But when we think about this basin, it's been a bit of a sleepy basin. Everyone knew that there's a liquids window there, obviously, and it hasn't really been revisited in a number of years. As part of our recent exploration efforts, we went back in, really applied, as Ken said, some of our data from outside from other basins, some of the things that we've learned in the past few years. We really evaluated it from a geologic level, looking at the way that the process manifests itself between the north and the south, the mechanical stratigraphy that we've talked about before, how our completions interact with the rock. We had better data to better define the GOR and the phase across this area. And then really, we made a lot of progress modeling the overpressure across the play. And when you combine that, obviously, with technology on the operational side, that's what gets us so excited about the opportunity here. And it's really almost reminiscent of what we saw nearly a decade ago happening in the Delaware Basin, where it's a bit of a sleepy basin with a lot of show wells. It really required some industry and EOG technology and knowledge kind of brought in from the outside to really make things work. Ken, do you want to talk a little more about the wells?\nKen Boedeker: Sure. As Ezra mentioned, we are in the volatile oil window. And we do expect oil, gas and NGL production will vary some across that window both from north to south, but more so from east, which will have a higher gas cut to west, which is oilier. On an ultimate recovery basis, we expect that there will be 25% to 35% oil and similar percentages for natural gas liquids and residue gas. So when you think about that, this play is really focused on the 60% to 70% liquids development. And from that, as far as the economics go, it gives us premium and double-premium numbers. That's $40 oil, $16 NGL and $2.50 gas. The other thing to note on these wells is it's early, but we are expecting, depending on where we're at in the play, 2 million to 3 million barrels of oil equivalent for an EUR with a 3-mile lateral. So that type of performance really leads us to a low finding cost and it will definitely be additive to our cost basis.\nLance Terveen: Neal, this is Lance. I'll comment a little bit for you. I'll start at a high level, too, and maybe kind of drill down for you just as you think about kind of infrastructure and also take away. But really, when we think about our plan, it's going to follow the same strategy that we've done in all of our plays. And I mean, one, marketing is always aligned and integrated upfront in all of our exploration efforts. You've heard us many times talk about just multiple connections is critical. We want to have control to market. And then firm offtake, we're always disciplined in that matter that is going to be very commensurate with our plans. But when you think about the nat gas and especially like evacuating the nat gas, you got to remember like Ken just highlighted, the Utica wells will have less gas volumes in the oil window. It's a liquids-rich play, like Ken highlighted, 60% to 70% liquids. So when we look out here, we look upfront, there is significant available capacity that's just adjacent to our play. And also, if you remember, it's been built out for a long time. Much of it has been overbuilt, I would say, like in the last 10 years. So this also allows for opportunities. So we've really aligned ourselves with the current midstream operators that are in the area, very strong. We have great relationships with those. We've developed strategic relationships into the interstate pipelines, too, at the plant tail gates. And I can tell you the liquidity is very strong in this area. It's much different than you can look into the Marcellus. But when you get into this area, liquidity is very strong. And so we don't see any issues at this time with sales on a go-forward basis.\nNeal Dingmann: That's fantastic details, guys. It's great people to you coming back there. My second question, maybe just a bit on capital allocation, specifically, I realize you won't have detailed '23 guide for a few more months. I'm just wondering if you all have talked a bit -- I think, on the plan talked today about maybe a bit more activity next year. I'm just wondering, is that just to keep production stable? Or are you still kind of considering a maintenance plan next year? And I'm wondering if you would consider a bit more growth if prices continue to be as strong and maybe costs would back off a little bit?\nBilly Helms: Yes, Neal, this is Billy Helms. Like we had said in the prepared remarks there, it's still early to talk about what we think 2023 actual specifics will be. But in the prepared comments, I also mentioned the fact that we will have more activity. We do anticipate growing our oil production somewhere in the -- similar to this year, somewhere in the low single digits. And on the equivalent growth, it will be probably in the low double digits. So that's kind of how we see the plan shaping up as we -- as today with the macro environment we see today. That would company -- that would entail probably adding 2 to 3 rigs over and above this year's activity level in general with probably another 1 to 2 frac fleets. So it kind of gives you an outlook of what that might look like. So I guess maybe just to scale it up on the CapEx side, we kind of give you some guidance this quarter for what we think our CapEx burn rate will be. And if you kind of normalize that through next year and then add the cost of a little bit more activity and some infrastructure costs to kind of get you directionally where we're thinking.\nOperator: The next question comes from Leo Mariani. You may proceed.\nLeo Mariani: I wanted to dig a little bit more into the Utica. You all talked about a well that had a 2,500 barrel a day rate. I guess it was 3,500 on an equivalent basis to the south. I just wanted to clarify, is that like a 24-hour rate? Is that more of a 30-day rate? And then also, I guess that's 1 of the 4 wells. Can you perhaps provide a little bit of color around the other three in the basin there as well? And you talked about kind of 2 million to 3 million BOEs recoverable on a 3-mile lateral. Can you also help us out with maybe what you think the eventual targeted well cost would be there, that 3-mile lateral?\nKen Boedeker: Yes, Leo, this is Ken. As far as that 2,500 barrel a day rate that we highlighted there, we produced that for a couple of weeks. So we're very comfortable with that rate. As far as the other 4 wells go, they had varying lateral lengths. We can move those to a 3-mile -- when we move those to a 3-mile development plan, they're definitely double-premium-type economics. That 2,500 barrel a day well that's got the 12,000-foot lateral is the longest lateral we've drilled to date. The others do have a shorter lateral as we drilled them. One thing I really wanted to highlight on that 12,000-foot lateral well is the operations team that we have at Coloma City. It was the longest well that we've drilled. And once they got into the lateral, they drilled that 12,000 feet in a little over 6 days and stayed 99% in an 8-foot target. So just outstanding operational performance there. As far as well costs go, we've really just highlighted that we anticipate being less than $5 a barrel on the F&D cost.\nLeo Mariani: I wanted to follow up a little bit on Dorado. So you all mentioned that you're constructing a 36-inch pipe. That's obviously a pretty good-sized pipe. So it sounds like you've got some pretty grand plans for that play, and it sounds like it's driving a lot of growth in 2023. Just curious as to when you think that pipe is going to be ready and imagine it's going to take a little while to get constructed, and perhaps there's an even kind of larger wave of growth out of Dorado as we get towards mid-decade. And I'm assuming that maybe there's some LNG-type ambitions associated with that. So any color would be great.\nBilly Helms: Yes, Leo, this is Billy Helms. Let me maybe start with the answer, and then maybe Lance can give some more color on it. So the 36-inch pipeline, yes, it's an effort to try to not only get that gas to market, but also make sure we continued our focus on keeping our cost as an operator low. So that's part of our longer-term plan. We've recognized that the value of installing infrastructure is really helping lower the long-term cost basis of the company. And so this is just another step in that vein. The 36-inch pipe will be constructed over a couple of years, so it's not all being done in 1 single year. It's important to be taking it to the market center where we are. And then the LNG that we certainly recognize the value of having the gas in this area. It's in South Texas, where all the LNG demand is, so it's advantage from that standpoint. So that's kind of how this kind of works into the overall market dynamics with this play. So I'll let Lance maybe add a little bit more color on the pipeline itself and the market.\nLance Terveen: Yes, sure. Leo, it's Lance. I think ride add on to what Billy talked about as well. It's just it is very complementary and it's an integration of our operations. But again, like you heard in one of my answers earlier, the controllable market is very important. And so as we build out this infrastructure into the Agua Dulce market, we will have -- we're anticipating 4 downstream market connections. And I know you kind of asked a little bit about LNG, but I think the bigger point is just the demand pool that's anticipated out of South Texas. There could be up to 5 Bcf a day just from kind of the South Texas region when you think about power gen, industrial load and also in Mexico. And the demand pool is really real, right? You've heard us talk about Corpus Christi Stage 3. We're going to have a 720,000 MMBtu day sale once that's kind of in service. We got the 140,000, that's today. But you also have Golden Pass that's under construction and several other facilities that are getting very, very close to FID, which is excellent. And so maybe one other thing to add is that we've also contracted for a large transport position on an interstate pipeline expansion, allowing us to reach essentially all the LNG demand pool along the Gulf Coast from South Texas to Louisiana, and that will have a direct connection off of our 36-inch. So we're thinking very tactically, strategically and setting up Dorado for the long term.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate. You may proceed.\nDoug Leggate: I wonder if I could jump on the Utica as well. I'm just curious about, I guess, the back story as to how you accumulate this position because there's clearly a lot of players, I guess, a little east of you guys, some of which might have characterized their acreage as noncore. I know M&A is not your bailiwick typically, but a little background as to how you establish this position and whether you'd be looking to continue to expand it. And I've got a follow-up on that, please.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Doug, this is Ezra. Thanks for the question. Like anything, we allowed the -- our geologic model to kind of drive where we are interested in acquiring acreage. We were able to get in there and put it together in a variety of different ways. Probably the most noticeable one is that we were able to purchase the minerals down to the south that Ken highlighted earlier. It's about 135,000 acres of minerals that we purchased as part of transaction. But in general, I'd say it fell right in line with our strategy of identifying where we want to be in the basin, trying to capture Tier 1 and Tier 2 acreage countercyclically, if you will, so we can continue to have a low cost of entry which, of course, is critical is not only as you get out and delineate the plays, but also obviously, as you really think about full cycle economics in these resource plays.\nDoug Leggate: I know it's -- you guys have typically been organic in the way you report these things. But my follow-up is really about capital allocation. And I guess a follow-up to Leo's question about the Dorado, the pipeline you're building. Now you've obviously taken a, I guess, you could see another step back to gas with Utica. What is your thinking in terms of -- is this a pivot back to gas in terms of how you should think about capital allocation? I know you're typically agnostic on that. I'm just curious if we're seeing a bit of a pivot back here.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Doug. The short answer is that we're agnostic based on our premium price deck, the $40 and $2.50 natural gas pricing that we use to measure our investments. But in general, I'd say we do have a bullish view long term on natural gas and NGLs, obviously, on oil as well. But specific to Dorado and some of these combo plays, we're seeing natural gas. We think we'll continue to see increased demand from power gen, some of the coal switching that we've seen this year. And also, it's going to have, in the upcoming years, continued exposure to the international markets with LNG development there along the Gulf Coast. NGLs obviously span the entire broad spectrum of the economy, from plastics and rubber to heating to fuel blending and so on. And that's not to say those two won't experience volatility at times where supply is potentially outpacing demand. And likewise, demand is -- could be outpacing supply. But that comes back to our approach as a disciplined operator. First, we evaluate, like we just talked about, based on the premium price deck that we use internally, and that means that we're investing based on returns first and foremost. Second, we evaluate that macro supply and demand fundamentals for short-, medium- and long-term signals. And I'd say it's one reason we are excited about the way we enter some of these positions, especially the Utica, by owning the 135,000 acres with the minerals, we can control the pace of development. And the remaining leasehold in that play is dominantly held by production. And so that, again, is another lever that allows us to really optimize our pace of development and investment.\nDoug Leggate: We'll look for news at the end of the month.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber. You may proceed.\nScott Gruber: Congrats on the organic resource play addition. Generally, what's the rough split of the Utica acreage that's prospective for double premium versus single premium? And generally, what spacing assumption are you guys using across the acreage?\nKen Boedeker: Yes, Scott, this is Ken. As far as the split, it's really early in the development of the Utica. We have 4 wells in it. We want to do some additional drilling and testing across the acreage before we really come up with some kind of a resource or a well count or a well spacing estimate. As far as premium versus double premium, we actually think that we have double premium potential across the entire acreage position. So we're really just excited about the play and look forward to developing it next year.\nScott Gruber: And just ask on the capital allocation question, just over the medium to longer term, how are you thinking about ramping the Utica? It's a little bit further down on your kind of development curve. And obviously, you have optionality in Dorado and PRB, which just relative to the younger plays that you'll be ramping up, how do you think the Utica fits in?\nBilly Helms: Well, as Ken -- this is Billy. As Ken just mentioned, the Utica, we're very excited about the potential of the play to be double premium. And so it definitely competes on a capital allocation standpoint. But we are early in the play. So as we see things today, we'll plan on drilling somewhere in the order of 20 wells next year and then from that determine on how what the go-forward plan looks like. As far as capital allocation for next year, we're still early and still developing our plans. But as we see things today, the benefit of having these multiple basins is it gives us a lot of flexibility to move capital between the different basins. We don't have to leverage all of our activity in one basin. In particular, we're going to try to keep from seeing a lot of activity increases in areas where we're seeing the most inflation and supply chain constraints that exist mostly in the Permian Basin today. So I would expect our activity levels there to remain pretty consistent with what we're doing today. We can pull levers in the other plays to meet whatever objectives we set forth as we move towards the end of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade. You may proceed.\nCharles Meade: I'd like to ask about these 4 wells that you drilled in the Utica. Can you talk about what you did differently, perhaps, from previous operators, whether it's targeting of a zone or your completion design? And also perhaps, did you test different concepts across those 4 wells?\nKen Boedeker: Yes, Charles, this is Ken. As far as what we've done differently in this area, it really has to do with having a number of years of experience in all of our other basins that we can bring to bear here in the Utica. If you think about it, it boils down to 4 main things. One of them is targeting, being able to identify the target across the acreage position. The other one is understanding the phase, looking at that phase, not getting into the gas window and not getting too far into the black oil window. The third one is pressure and how that pressure varies across our acreage position. And then the other is the operational execution that we can bring. That's both the drilling and the completion's design that we see. That all rolls into what I would call the geomechanics. And when you roll all that together, it really gives us confidence in that area that we'll be able to develop that with that low finding cost and then double-premium returns basis.\nCharles Meade: And 20 wells next year, that looks like it's -- maybe should we be thinking about 2 rigs with -- since it might take a while to drill these 3-mile laterals in an overpressure setting?\nKen Boedeker: Yes, Charles. Really, right now, these wells aren't taking that long. The 20-well program would really be done with 1 rig at this point in time. We may end up having 2 rigs if they're available at some point and then not at another time, but the average would be 1 rig for next year. .\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett You may proceed.\nBob Brackett: Had a higher-level question, and then I'll get to nitty-gritty on the Utica. The higher-level question is you all, versus your peers, have run a fairly aggressive exploration budget this year, call it, $450 million or so. What are your thoughts for 2023 and beyond at keeping the scale of that exploration budget given that it's yielding results?\nEzra Yacob: Bob, this is Ezra. Yes, this year, you're right, we've -- as we talked at the beginning of this year, we had a number of different exploration plays at a number of different places and evaluation. This year, we're drilling some initial wells, kind of wild cats in the play. Some of the plays are a bit further along and we're trying to delineate because remember, our exploration program, it's not really about producers and dry holes. It's really about how or if these prospects are going to be additive to the quality of our existing inventory. That's what we're really looking for here. Depending on how you bucketize the 20 wells we're talking about here in Point Pleasant is probably the most important thing. It's -- it will basically be another delineation type of year for us across the 400,000-acre position that we've put together. Outside of those 20 wells, that will be the biggest part of next year's kind of exploration delineation type of program, if I'd put it there. We have some ongoing prospects in other areas that we've talked about in the past. Some of those other ones, again, extend similar types of areas, places that have been sleepy in the past, places that are in known oil and natural gas producing areas, places where we're trying to bring modern technology, our advancement of horizontal drilling and completions technologies and combining them with our rock, the understanding of the geologic environment and seen if we can turn those into premium and double premium types of plays, it would be additive to us. And we'll just continue to evaluate as they go. To give you a hard number right now, though, it's just a little bit early, as Billy said, but we'll break that out in February.\nBob Brackett: Very clear. And then kind of a bit nitty-gritty. You mentioned the importance of targeting. You mentioned staying in an 8-foot zone. Is it a stretch to say the secret sauce here is staying in the Point Pleasant?\nKen Boedeker: No, I mean, Bob, this is Ken. We do stay in the Point Pleasant. I think the secret sauce here is really a combination of everything. It's a combination of what we've learned in our other plays and then being able to operationally perform on that. So getting the right petrophysical model to understand that targeting and understand how that targeting varies across the area, and then looking at the 8-foot window that we've kept it in really speaks to being able to perform. This really goes back to just our culture. It really is about the people, and it's about our ability to always attempt to get better, to work on getting better and try to make the next well better than the last. So you put all that together, and that really is the secret sauce for our entire company, let alone our exploration effort.\nBob Brackett: It's clear. And I'll just sneak in a third one, and I apologize. You mentioned the importance of pressure. In the old days, reservoir energy in the Utica was always something that was a challenge. How have you overcome that? And is there maybe a different artificial lift strategy out there to keep that tail producing?\nKen Boedeker: Yes, Bob, I think that's why we're in the volatile oil window. We have enough gas in the volatile oil window to help us lift our wells. At this point in time, we don't see that we'll need much artificial lift through the life of these wells. It's being right on that the right portion of that phase window.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai. You may proceed.\nJeanine Wai: Our first question, maybe just following up on Bob's question here. You've disclosed 7 premium operating basins, which is fantastic. The decentralized model has worked very well for EOG so far. But from an organizational perspective, how many basins would be considered too many basins because you're clearly still evaluating other opportunities?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Jeanine, this is Ezra. That's a fantastic question here. It really speaks to what we think is one of our core competitive advantages, and that's the fact that we run a decentralized organization. That's what allows us to kind of cross-pollinate ideas between divisions. In any industry, the success of running a decentralized organization is being able to push decision-making and accountability down to the employees who are kind of touching the wells and closest to the value creation every single day. When you break it up that way and you think about it that way, we have 8 operating teams, and each of those has -- operates as kind of a fully functioning oil company in a lot of ways, if you will. They have a full complement of geologists, engineers, accountants, land mens, marketing people, so on and so forth. Each of these individual asset teams can really handle working across multiple basins. And in fact, to a different type of scale, you see the same type of leverage and benefits that we see at the corporate level is that by exploring in different basins really adds to kind of their understanding. I'll go back to how Ken started this, the Point Pleasant or the Utica play is actually being looked at currently by members of our Oklahoma City team who are quite familiar with the Woodford, the overpressured oil window in the Woodford play. And that play really lended a lot of expertise to our understanding of mechanical stratigraphy. Again, to reference what Ken was talking about on how the rocks actually break and interact with our completion strategy, and that's some of the key characteristics that have helped unlock in a number of our unconventional plays.\nJeanine Wai: And then for our second question, in terms of operational momentum, are you able to provide any color on what activity looks like heading into year-end and early '23? We noticed that 4Q oil guidance is flat at the midpoint quarter-over-quarter. CapEx is up, but that sounds to us like it could be timing-related.\nBilly Helms: Yes, Jeanine, this is Billy Helms. You're exactly right, it's just a timing factor. We're currently running all the rigs that we plan to carry into next year. And we'll start looking at adding rigs in different plays. As we go into next year, based on our outlook for the '23 budget, which will firm up as we get closer to that time. The quarter-over-quarter volume growth is pretty flat, and that's just a function of completing wells late in the quarter that will really roll into next year. And that's going to happen in several different plays, the Permian, probably the Dorado play and a little bit in the Eagle Ford as well. So that's just a function of timing of those completions.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of [Kevin MacCurdy]. You may proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: And just getting back to the Utica. Trying to do some back-of-the-envelope math on spending there next year. Would a 3-mile lateral cost in the ballpark of around $15 million? And I guess if you did 20 wells, that would kind of put you at around a $300 million spend rate in the Utica next year. And is that kind of the right assumption for rig add next year?\nKen Boedeker: Yes, this -- Kevin, this is Ken. What we're talking about now is those are 2 million to 3 million-barrel wells that we've talked about and less than a $5 F&D cost. We really haven't given out a number as far as what our development costs will be because we have some additional testing, and we really do want to drill some of our wells on pads and drill them in packages to see what that ultimate development cost will be. So you can use the $5 F&D in the 2 million to 3 million barrels to get a reasonable estimate for well cost.\nUnidentified Analyst: And digging in the marketing strategy a little bit in the Utica, I mean, you mentioned that you had plenty of gas takeaway locally. But do you guys have a plan to get that gas out of basin? Just kind of thinking about the knock-on effect if the Utica grows, that might have an impact to Southwest PA basis? And is that of concern for your returns?\nLance Terveen: Yes, Kevin, this is Lance Terveen. Thanks for your question. I'd say even like I talked about earlier, like the marketing component of it is integrated very early on. So I mean we recognize the nat gas like realizations are weaker, but still when we look at our overall portfolio and then how the Utica Combo competes, it's very competitive. And so your earlier question was just as it relates when you think about just kind of downstream takeaway in that. Again, it comes to just the liquids focus that we have in anticipation. I think there's some misconception on kind of the gas rates that those are going to look very similar to like the dry gas wells to the east and other competitors that are in the region when we're going to see lower gas rates that are going to come out of our development. And so when we look at that on a go forward and with the relationships that we have with the capacity that we see on the processing side, the gas sales and the takeaway, we're not foreseeing an issue right now.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Anan Naryanin.\nNeil Mehta: This is Neil Mehta. Can you hear me okay?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Neil, we've got you.\nNeil Mehta: Okay. I'm sorry about that. Yes, it's Neil Mehta here from Goldman Sachs. So as I had more of a macro question here, which is we haven't seen U.S. oil production, at least in the weekly, move since April of 2022. They've been kind of hanging around this plus/minus 12 million-barrel a day range. And are you surprised that we haven't seen the pickup in U.S. production that a lot of people were anticipating? And I want to tie that into Slide 9 of your deck, which is showing relative maturity of some of the oil plays like the Bakken and increasingly the Eagle Ford and even the Delaware. Are we getting to the point where shale is going to have a tougher time growing and we should be thinking about peak shale production in the United States in the foreseeable future?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Neil, that's a good question. Let me take it one piece at a time here. Since earlier in the year, we've been talking about how we were anticipating a little bit less U.S. growth this year than what many people were forecasting. The reason for that clearly, there's a little bit of inventory exhaustion going on. These basins have been drilled for a number of years. But the biggest thing we based our models on this year was really what we were seeing with again, what's turned into inflationary pressures throughout the year. It's the rig counts, the frac spreads and really the people side of it. There's definitely North American discipline from the E&P sector out here, but there is also a supply chain constraints that have continued to kind of be felt throughout the entire year this year. I do think coming out of the pandemic, we've had a consolidation across the industry, what you've been left. And this is something we've talked about quite a bit, too, is you've been left with less companies and those companies that have the size, the scale, balance sheet, things of that nature to be able to continue to drill and operate. And the majority of those companies are drilling and investing in a way that's more disciplined than what was in favor prior to the pandemic. So I think it's really 3 or 4 different things that have kind of come together to limit U.S. growth. And quite frankly, a lot of those things that I've talked about are not necessarily transitory in nature. Some of these things will really continue into 2023 as well. And so that's why I'd say entering 2023, again, I suspect our forecast on the oil side will probably be a little bit to the low end of many of the numbers that you're seeing out there.\nNeil Mehta: Yes, that's helpful. And then a follow-up just on the balance sheet. You guys are clearly have a fortress balance sheet position in a net cash position now. Just talk -- remind us again how you're thinking about minimum cash balances? And what is the Pareto optimal capital structure as you think about your leverage profile?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Neil, thank you for bringing that up. It's something that we're exceptionally proud of. We've always said that in a cyclical industry such as ours, the best thing you can have is not just a strong but a real pristine balance sheet. There's never really been a cash target for us, and there's not one now. We're thrilled to be, as you kind of said, in a unique position where we're able to strengthen the balance sheet this year, but at the same time, return just over $5 billion, $5.1 billion to our shareholders. We've -- as far as the ultimate balance sheet, we have a couple of strategic things. We do have a $5 billion buyback authorization. We've talked about using that opportunistically. That's a compelling strategy to go ahead and carry a little more cash on the balance sheet than what we've done historically. But really, the strategy overall for the company is aimed at creating value in the long run and managing the balance sheet to make counter-cyclic investments is a big piece of that. We've talked about having operational and reserve cash just to stay out of commercial paper. But at the end of the day, when we think about it in a cyclical industry, like I said, the balance sheet provides a lot of optionality to create value. We're committed to delivering on our free cash flow priorities, and that's -- it's founded in growing a sustainable regular dividend, but it also contemplates the minimum commitment of 60% of free cash flow. And both of those are supported by having a very strong balance sheet and, just in general, being focused on doing the right thing at the right time to maximize long-term shareholder returns.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now pass the call back over to Mr. Yacob for final remarks.\nEzra Yacob: Thank you. We want to thank everyone for participating in the call this morning. And we especially want to thank our employees. They've delivered another outstanding quarter for all of EOG's shareholders. Thank you for listening.\nOperator: That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Lance Terveen",
            "content": "Neal, this is Lance. I'll comment a little bit for you. I'll start at a high level, too, and maybe kind of drill down for you just as you think about kind of infrastructure and also take away. But really, when we think about our plan, it's going to follow the same strategy that we've done in all of our plays. And I mean, one, marketing is always aligned and integrated upfront in all of our exploration efforts. You've heard us many times talk about just multiple connections is critical. We want to have control to market. And then firm offtake, we're always disciplined in that matter that is going to be very commensurate with our plans. But when you think about the nat gas and especially like evacuating the nat gas, you got to remember like Ken just highlighted, the Utica wells will have less gas volumes in the oil window. It's a liquids-rich play, like Ken highlighted, 60% to 70% liquids. So when we look out here, we look upfront, there is significant available capacity that's just adjacent to our play. And also, if you remember, it's been built out for a long time. Much of it has been overbuilt, I would say, like in the last 10 years. So this also allows for opportunities. So we've really aligned ourselves with the current midstream operators that are in the area, very strong. We have great relationships with those. We've developed strategic relationships into the interstate pipelines, too, at the plant tail gates. And I can tell you the liquidity is very strong in this area. It's much different than you can look into the Marcellus. But when you get into this area, liquidity is very strong. And so we don't see any issues at this time with sales on a go-forward basis. Yes, sure. Leo, it's Lance. I think ride add on to what Billy talked about as well. It's just it is very complementary and it's an integration of our operations. But again, like you heard in one of my answers earlier, the controllable market is very important. And so as we build out this infrastructure into the Agua Dulce market, we will have -- we're anticipating 4 downstream market connections. And I know you kind of asked a little bit about LNG, but I think the bigger point is just the demand pool that's anticipated out of South Texas. There could be up to 5 Bcf a day just from kind of the South Texas region when you think about power gen, industrial load and also in Mexico. And the demand pool is really real, right? You've heard us talk about Corpus Christi Stage 3. We're going to have a 720,000 MMBtu day sale once that's kind of in service. We got the 140,000, that's today. But you also have Golden Pass that's under construction and several other facilities that are getting very, very close to FID, which is excellent. And so maybe one other thing to add is that we've also contracted for a large transport position on an interstate pipeline expansion, allowing us to reach essentially all the LNG demand pool along the Gulf Coast from South Texas to Louisiana, and that will have a direct connection off of our 36-inch. So we're thinking very tactically, strategically and setting up Dorado for the long term. Yes, Kevin, this is Lance Terveen. Thanks for your question. I'd say even like I talked about earlier, like the marketing component of it is integrated very early on. So I mean we recognize the nat gas like realizations are weaker, but still when we look at our overall portfolio and then how the Utica Combo competes, it's very competitive. And so your earlier question was just as it relates when you think about just kind of downstream takeaway in that. Again, it comes to just the liquids focus that we have in anticipation. I think there's some misconception on kind of the gas rates that those are going to look very similar to like the dry gas wells to the east and other competitors that are in the region when we're going to see lower gas rates that are going to come out of our development.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ken Boedeker",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. We're excited to announce our new oil and natural gas combo acreage position in Ohio's Utica Shale. We've accumulated 395,000 acres in this play, predominantly in the volatile oil window across a 140-mile trend running north to south. Our cost of entry was less than $600 per net acre for leasehold, demonstrating the benefit of organic exploration, one of our most distinct competitive advantages. Capturing highly productive rock through our organic exploration and leasing efforts is the primary way of improving the quality of our premium inventory at low cost, which leads to a lower company-wide cost basis. The Utica is a well-known and prolific gas resource to the east of our acreage. Several years ago, our exploration team operating out of the Oklahoma City office took a fresh look at the basin from a petroleum system perspective. We knew there was an oil rim with varying gas to oil ratios present. Using our experience in other basins and our technical workflows and proprietary reservoir engineering modeling tools, we anticipated that this could be an area that would be additive to our inventory. When we considered our advancements in precision targeting and simulation technology, along with our low-cost drilling and completion operations, it became clear that this area had the potential to compete with our premium and double-premium plays across the company. Through leasing and acquisitions, we acquired 18 legacy wells with varying geologic and production data, which supported our assessment of the area. Over the last 12 months, we've confirmed our model and the economic viability of this prospect by drilling 3 delineation wells in the northern part of our acreage and 1 in the South. These first 4 wells already earned premium and double-premium returns when normalized to our development plan, which assumes 3-mile laterals. As a reminder, our premium hurdle rate assumes $40 oil, $16 NGLs and $2.50 natural gas. These exceptional results are due primarily to the high productivity of the interval and the large amount of liquids in the product mix from the volatile oil window. In addition to the well performance, we also want to highlight our embedded mineral interest in the southern portion of the acreage. We've acquired 100% of the mineral rights across 135,000 acres of our leasehold for about $1,800 per acre, which is in addition to the $600 per net acre for the leases. This mineral interest significantly enhances the value of this play by adding 25% to our production and reserve strain from no additional well cost or operating expense. This area is also where we've drilled our most prolific well, which has initially produced over 2,500 barrels of oil per day and 3,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a 12,000-foot lateral. The total value of this mineral interest across our southern development area is significant, especially since EOG will dictate the pace of development as operator. Next year, we plan to drill approximately 20 wells in the northern and southern areas and utilize our multi-basin experience to climb the learning curve faster by leaning on the best targeting, drilling and completion techniques that apply to this area. We expect our 2023 Utica Combo plan will accomplish 2 goals: first, to deliver double premium returns; while second, further delineating the play to help assess resource and inventory. We will invest in incremental gathering infrastructure to prepare for a larger development program and anticipate being able to take advantage of existing processing infrastructure in the area for the foreseeable future. This is the advantage of the timing and economic efficiency of successfully unlocking potential in an existing basin. EOG's entry into the Utica Combo play is a textbook example of why our decentralized organization that operates in multiple basins with wide-ranging geology lends itself to successful additions to the upper end of our premium and double-premium inventory. We applied what we learned over the past decade in developing our portfolio to identify and unlock this overlooked resource. Now here's Ezra to wrap things up. Sure. As Ezra mentioned, we are in the volatile oil window. And we do expect oil, gas and NGL production will vary some across that window both from north to south, but more so from east, which will have a higher gas cut to west, which is oilier. On an ultimate recovery basis, we expect that there will be 25% to 35% oil and similar percentages for natural gas liquids and residue gas. So when you think about that, this play is really focused on the 60% to 70% liquids development. And from that, as far as the economics go, it gives us premium and double-premium numbers. That's $40 oil, $16 NGL and $2.50 gas. The other thing to note on these wells is it's early, but we are expecting, depending on where we're at in the play, 2 million to 3 million barrels of oil equivalent for an EUR with a 3-mile lateral. So that type of performance really leads us to a low finding cost and it will definitely be additive to our cost basis. Yes, Leo, this is Ken. As far as that 2,500 barrel a day rate that we highlighted there, we produced that for a couple of weeks. So we're very comfortable with that rate. As far as the other 4 wells go, they had varying lateral lengths. We can move those to a 3-mile -- when we move those to a 3-mile development plan, they're definitely double-premium-type economics. That 2,500 barrel a day well that's got the 12,000-foot lateral is the longest lateral we've drilled to date. The others do have a shorter lateral as we drilled them. One thing I really wanted to highlight on that 12,000-foot lateral well is the operations team that we have at Coloma City. It was the longest well that we've drilled. And once they got into the lateral, they drilled that 12,000 feet in a little over 6 days and stayed 99% in an 8-foot target. So just outstanding operational performance there. As far as well costs go, we've really just highlighted that we anticipate being less than $5 a barrel on the F&D cost. Yes, Scott, this is Ken. As far as the split, it's really early in the development of the Utica. We have 4 wells in it. We want to do some additional drilling and testing across the acreage before we really come up with some kind of a resource or a well count or a well spacing estimate. As far as premium versus double premium, we actually think that we have double premium potential across the entire acreage position. So we're really just excited about the play and look forward to developing it next year. Yes, Charles, this is Ken. As far as what we've done differently in this area, it really has to do with having a number of years of experience in all of our other basins that we can bring to bear here in the Utica. If you think about it, it boils down to 4 main things. One of them is targeting, being able to identify the target across the acreage position. The other one is understanding the phase, looking at that phase, not getting into the gas window and not getting too far into the black oil window. The third one is pressure and how that pressure varies across our acreage position. And then the other is the operational execution that we can bring. That's both the drilling and the completion's design that we see. That all rolls into what I would call the geomechanics. And when you roll all that together, it really gives us confidence in that area that we'll be able to develop that with that low finding cost and then double-premium returns basis. Yes, Charles. Really, right now, these wells aren't taking that long. The 20-well program would really be done with 1 rig at this point in time. We may end up having 2 rigs if they're available at some point and then not at another time, but the average would be 1 rig for next year. . No, I mean, Bob, this is Ken. We do stay in the Point Pleasant. I think the secret sauce here is really a combination of everything. It's a combination of what we've learned in our other plays and then being able to operationally perform on that. So getting the right petrophysical model to understand that targeting and understand how that targeting varies across the area, and then looking at the 8-foot window that we've kept it in really speaks to being able to perform. This really goes back to just our culture. It really is about the people, and it's about our ability to always attempt to get better, to work on getting better and try to make the next well better than the last. So you put all that together, and that really is the secret sauce for our entire company, let alone our exploration effort. Yes, Bob, I think that's why we're in the volatile oil window. We have enough gas in the volatile oil window to help us lift our wells. At this point in time, we don't see that we'll need much artificial lift through the life of these wells. It's being right on that the right portion of that phase window. Yes, this -- Kevin, this is Ken. What we're talking about now is those are 2 million to 3 million-barrel wells that we've talked about and less than a $5 F&D cost. We really haven't given out a number as far as what our development costs will be because we have some additional testing, and we really do want to drill some of our wells on pads and drill them in packages to see what that ultimate development cost will be. So you can use the $5 F&D in the 2 million to 3 million barrels to get a reasonable estimate for well cost."

            "name": "Billy Helms",
            "content": "Thanks, Ezra. Once again, EOG delivered outstanding results in the third quarter. We exceeded midpoint of production guidance, while capital expenditures beat forecasted targets. I'd like to thank our employees for their perseverance and execution to beat the expectations. Realized oil and natural gas prices also beat their target benchmarks in the third quarter. Our marketing teams are doing an excellent job executing our long-term strategy of diversifying across multiple transportation outlets and sales points. This strategy is also enabling the company to navigate the recent bottlenecks, transporting natural gas out of the Permian. We hold a significant transport position with the ability to move up to a Bcf a day out of the basin. In total, less than 5% of our domestic gas production is exposed to WAHA pricing in the Permian. In fact, we anticipate fourth quarter realized prices to remain strong for both natural gas and crude oil sales overall. Our crude oil and natural gas export capacity is serving us well in this regard. In the fourth quarter, we expect to sell over 250,000 barrels of crude oil per day at Brent length prices and 140,000 MMBtu per day of natural gas at JKM-linked prices, both on a gross basis. Year-to-date through September, export-based pricing of crude oil and natural gas has added nearly $700 million of revenue uplift compared to the alternative domestic sales. One of the major topics of the year continues to be the inflation story. The price pressure we are seeing on steel, fuel and labor continues to be persistent. Our employees are maintaining their focus on finding ways to mitigate inflation through innovation and efficiencies in our operations. Through their efforts, we now expect our average well cost to increase a modest 7% as compared to last year. As a result, we have narrowed our full year capital guidance to $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion. Given the elevated and persistent inflation pressures we have experienced this year, I am proud of our employees' efforts to mitigate a majority of this impact to our capital plan. We continue to evaluate and shape our plans for 2023. Production growth and infrastructure investments will remain guided by capital discipline. We expect low single-digit oil growth similar to this year. We currently forecast oil equivalent growth, including gas and liquids, at a low double-digit rate, somewhat higher than this year, largely driven by increased activity in our highly productive dry gas play. Once again, we plan to leverage our activity across multiple basins to secure services and manage cost pressures. Our initial plan includes a modest increase in activity, utilizing on the order of 28 to 30 drilling rigs, including one offshore rig in Trinidad. This would be accompanied by 8 to 10 frac fleets. This would represent a slight increase of 2 to 3 rigs and 1 to 2 frac fleets over 2022 activity levels. We are seeing opportunities in different basins to lock in services at favorable rates for next year and currently expect to secure 50% to 60% of our well cost by the start of the year. This is within our typical range and compares with 50% of costs incurred for the start of 2022. All in all, we expect higher CapEx in 2023, driven by four key factors. First, we are assuming that persistent inflation pressure continues. With the cost of materials and services increasing, our initial 2023 budget is likely to reflect another 10% well cost increase, on top of the 7% increase we expect this year. We will continue to work to identify additional savings and efficiency improvements to offset the impact of inflation, just as we did this year. Second, we see several opportunities to advance development of particular assets in our portfolio in areas that are less exposed to the most severe inflation and supply chain pressures. The increase in activity in emerging plays like Dorado, the Powder River Basin and the Utica Combo are examples. Third, we expect to accelerate some infrastructure projects to take advantage of market opportunities. In Dorado, we've begun construction of a new 36-inch gas pipeline from the field to the Agua Dolce sales point near Corpus Christi, Texas. This will ensure long-term takeaway, fully capture the value chain from the wellhead to the market center and aligns with our focus on being a low-cost operator. Fourth, we plan to continue to progress our investments in environmental projects, including expansion of our carbon capture and storage or CCS projects. Our first CCS project is progressing, and we expect to begin injecting CO2 early next year. This is yet another step toward our goal of being among the lowest-cost, highest-return and lowest-emission producers of oil and natural gas. We recently released our latest sustainability report for 2021, which highlights our progress. We achieved our near-term 2025 methane emissions percentage target of 0.06% last year, an 85% reduction from 2017 levels. We captured 99.8% of natural gas produced at the wellhead, meeting our 2021 gas capture target. We discussed our latest initiative to further reduce methane emissions through our continuous leak detection system named iSense. We improved our safety performance with lower total recordable and lost time incident rates, and we reduced our freshwater intensity rate by 55% since 2020. We are proud of our employees' progress on our sustainability goals, but we still see tremendous opportunities for continued improvements. Altogether, infrastructure spending, including environmental projects, typically amounts to 15% to 20% of our CapEx budget. This year is running right about the midpoint of that range; whereas next year, we expect it to be towards the higher end of that range. We continue to develop our 2023 plans as we approach the new year and provide a more detailed complete outlook in February. Now here's Tim to discuss our financials. Yes, Neal, this is Billy Helms. Like we had said in the prepared remarks there, it's still early to talk about what we think 2023 actual specifics will be. But in the prepared comments, I also mentioned the fact that we will have more activity. We do anticipate growing our oil production somewhere in the -- similar to this year, somewhere in the low single digits. And on the equivalent growth, it will be probably in the low double digits. So that's kind of how we see the plan shaping up as we -- as today with the macro environment we see today. That would company -- that would entail probably adding 2 to 3 rigs over and above this year's activity level in general with probably another 1 to 2 frac fleets. So it kind of gives you an outlook of what that might look like. So I guess maybe just to scale it up on the CapEx side, we kind of give you some guidance this quarter for what we think our CapEx burn rate will be. And if you kind of normalize that through next year and then add the cost of a little bit more activity and some infrastructure costs to kind of get you directionally where we're thinking. Yes, Leo, this is Billy Helms. Let me maybe start with the answer, and then maybe Lance can give some more color on it. So the 36-inch pipeline, yes, it's an effort to try to not only get that gas to market, but also make sure we continued our focus on keeping our cost as an operator low. So that's part of our longer-term plan. We've recognized that the value of installing infrastructure is really helping lower the long-term cost basis of the company. And so this is just another step in that vein. The 36-inch pipe will be constructed over a couple of years, so it's not all being done in 1 single year. It's important to be taking it to the market center where we are. And then the LNG that we certainly recognize the value of having the gas in this area. It's in South Texas, where all the LNG demand is, so it's advantage from that standpoint. So that's kind of how this kind of works into the overall market dynamics with this play. So I'll let Lance maybe add a little bit more color on the pipeline itself and the market. Well, as Ken -- this is Billy. As Ken just mentioned, the Utica, we're very excited about the potential of the play to be double premium. And so it definitely competes on a capital allocation standpoint. But we are early in the play. So as we see things today, we'll plan on drilling somewhere in the order of 20 wells next year and then from that determine on how what the go-forward plan looks like. As far as capital allocation for next year, we're still early and still developing our plans. But as we see things today, the benefit of having these multiple basins is it gives us a lot of flexibility to move capital between the different basins. We don't have to leverage all of our activity in one basin. In particular, we're going to try to keep from seeing a lot of activity increases in areas where we're seeing the most inflation and supply chain constraints that exist mostly in the Permian Basin today. So I would expect our activity levels there to remain pretty consistent with what we're doing today. We can pull levers in the other plays to meet whatever objectives we set forth as we move towards the end of the year. Yes, Jeanine, this is Billy Helms. You're exactly right, it's just a timing factor. We're currently running all the rigs that we plan to carry into next year. And we'll start looking at adding rigs in different plays. As we go into next year, based on our outlook for the '23 budget, which will firm up as we get closer to that time. The quarter-over-quarter volume growth is pretty flat, and that's just a function of completing wells late in the quarter that will really roll into next year. And that's going to happen in several different plays, the Permian, probably the Dorado play and a little bit in the Eagle Ford as well. So that's just a function of timing of those completions."

Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures can be found on EOG's website. This conference call also may include estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Jeff Leitzell, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor Relations. Here's Ezra. Thanks, Billy. We are very pleased to increase the regular dividend by 10% to $3.30 per share annual rate. This increase reflects two things. First, the improvements we've made to the cost structure. Efficiencies and technology continue to sustainably improve EOG's capital efficiency. Furthermore, we expect the advantages of operating in multiple basins will drive additional improvements to EOG's cost structure and returns in the year ahead, lower the cost of supply and lower the breakeven oil price to fund the dividend. Second, this dividend increase reflects our confidence in EOG's expanding portfolio of premium plays to grow the company's future income and free cash flow potential. Over the last several years, our success in organic exploration continues to add low-cost reserves and consistently drive down our DD&A rate, enabling EOG to create value through industry cycles. We also remain committed to returning at least 60% of free cash flow to shareholders each year. As a reminder, we look at this on an annual basis, not quarter-to-quarter. Based on current commodity prices, we estimate the $1.50 special dividend declared yesterday will bring free cash flow return to shareholders to about 67% for 2022. We will start 2023 in an exceptionally strong financial position. We ended the third quarter with $5.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet against $5.1 billion of debt. We generated $2.3 billion of free cash flow during the quarter, along with inflows of another $1.3 billion of cash from working capital, primarily from the drawdown of hedge collateral. Now here's Ken."

            "content": "Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. The quality of EOG's diverse multi-basin portfolio of high-return assets continues to grow and improve. Yesterday's announcement of the large position we captured in the Utica Combo play demonstrates yet again that EOG's robust exploration pipeline delivers results. Over the last two years, our organic exploration efforts have brought forth Dorado, our premium dry natural gas play in South Texas, the emerging Northern Powder River Basin oil play in Wyoming and now the emerging Utica Combo play in Ohio. The value of our multi-basin portfolio can't be overstated. With the addition of the Utica Combo, we are now positioned to operate 7 premium resource basins, which reinforces several of EOG's competitive advantages. First, our decentralized cross-functional operating teams innovate independently, but collaborate to compound the impact of learnings and efficiencies across the company. Second, our flexibility to allocate capital optimizes reinvestment across our portfolio, enabling us to develop each asset at the right pace to maximize returns. And third, our geographic and product diversity gives us the ability to plan around basin-level market dynamics. Our goal is to expand and improve the overall quality of our portfolio by identifying higher return inventory. Our approach is to build a diverse portfolio of premium assets predominantly through low-cost organic exploration, which adds reserves at lower finding and development costs and lowers the overall cost basis of the company. The end result is continuous improvement to EOG's company-wide capital efficiency. Our track record of successful exploration, coupled with strong operational execution, is how EOG has continued to improve over time and position the company to create shareholder value through industry cycles. We demonstrated our confidence in EOG's improving cost structure yesterday by increasing the regular dividend 10%. Our peer-leading annualized dividend is now $3.30 per share, competitive with the broad market. We also delivered on our commitment to return at least 60% of annual free cash flow to shareholders with our fourth special dividend of the year. By year-end, we will have returned $5.80 per share of special dividends. Combined with the regular dividend, we will return $8.80 per share or $5.1 billion in cash to shareholders, which exceeds our 60% cash return commitment using current forecasts. Looking forward, we expect 2023 will remain dynamic with respect to the supply chain, oil and gas prices and other global macro drivers. Our diverse low-cost asset base puts us in an excellent position to capitalize on opportunities no matter the environment. EOG continues to consistently execute, lower our cost structure through innovation and efficiencies and grow the quality of our portfolio to improve capital efficiency and free cash flow potential. Our transparent cash return strategy is anchored to a sustainable, growing regular dividend and backstopped by an impeccable balance sheet. EOG is in a better position than ever to deliver value for our shareholders through industry cycles and play a leading role in the long-term future of energy. Next up is Billy with an early look at our 2023 plan, followed by Tim, who will review our financial performance. Ken will then provide background and details on the Utica Combo play. Here's Billy. Thanks, Ken. The takeaway from today's call are centered on EOG's fundamental value proposition. First, EOG's multi-basin organic exploration focus continues to improve the quality of our inventory, Capturing Tier 1 acreage across multiple high-return opportunities provides geographic diversity, product diversity and the flexibility to allocate capital across each asset at the correct pace to optimize returns. Second, EOG is a low-cost operator. We use technology to increase operational efficiency and capture select pieces of the value chain to keep both capital and operating costs low, thereby helping to reduce our breakevens and increase our free cash flow and income-generating potential. Third, Tim highlighted our financial performance and commitment to financial discipline that results in a 10% increase to our peer-leading regular dividend, a commitment to additional cash return with our announced special dividends and a best-in-class balance sheet. Fourth, our recently published sustainability report illustrates our progress to reach near-term greenhouse gas and methane emissions intensity goals and our commitment to develop new technologies and pilot new projects, such as our CCS project, to help reduce our environmental footprint. And fifth, it is EOG's employees and unique culture that continues to drive our success. Thanks for listening. We'll now go to Q&A. Yes, Neal, this is Ezra. Thanks for the question. I'll maybe make a couple of comments and then hand it to Ken to shed a little more light on the economics and then Lance will provide a little more commentary on the takeaway. But when we think about this basin, it's been a bit of a sleepy basin. Everyone knew that there's a liquids window there, obviously, and it hasn't really been revisited in a number of years. As part of our recent exploration efforts, we went back in, really applied, as Ken said, some of our data from outside from other basins, some of the things that we've learned in the past few years. We really evaluated it from a geologic level, looking at the way that the process manifests itself between the north and the south, the mechanical stratigraphy that we've talked about before, how our completions interact with the rock. We had better data to better define the GOR and the phase across this area. And then really, we made a lot of progress modeling the overpressure across the play. And when you combine that, obviously, with technology on the operational side, that's what gets us so excited about the opportunity here. And it's really almost reminiscent of what we saw nearly a decade ago happening in the Delaware Basin, where it's a bit of a sleepy basin with a lot of show wells. It really required some industry and EOG technology and knowledge kind of brought in from the outside to really make things work. Ken, do you want to talk a little more about the wells? Yes, Doug, this is Ezra. Thanks for the question. Like anything, we allowed the -- our geologic model to kind of drive where we are interested in acquiring acreage. We were able to get in there and put it together in a variety of different ways. Probably the most noticeable one is that we were able to purchase the minerals down to the south that Ken highlighted earlier. It's about 135,000 acres of minerals that we purchased as part of transaction. But in general, I'd say it fell right in line with our strategy of identifying where we want to be in the basin, trying to capture Tier 1 and Tier 2 acreage countercyclically, if you will, so we can continue to have a low cost of entry which, of course, is critical is not only as you get out and delineate the plays, but also obviously, as you really think about full cycle economics in these resource plays. Yes, Doug. The short answer is that we're agnostic based on our premium price deck, the $40 and $2.50 natural gas pricing that we use to measure our investments. But in general, I'd say we do have a bullish view long term on natural gas and NGLs, obviously, on oil as well. But specific to Dorado and some of these combo plays, we're seeing natural gas. We think we'll continue to see increased demand from power gen, some of the coal switching that we've seen this year. And also, it's going to have, in the upcoming years, continued exposure to the international markets with LNG development there along the Gulf Coast. NGLs obviously span the entire broad spectrum of the economy, from plastics and rubber to heating to fuel blending and so on. And that's not to say those two won't experience volatility at times where supply is potentially outpacing demand. And likewise, demand is -- could be outpacing supply. But that comes back to our approach as a disciplined operator. First, we evaluate, like we just talked about, based on the premium price deck that we use internally, and that means that we're investing based on returns first and foremost. Second, we evaluate that macro supply and demand fundamentals for short-, medium- and long-term signals. And I'd say it's one reason we are excited about the way we enter some of these positions, especially the Utica, by owning the 135,000 acres with the minerals, we can control the pace of development. And the remaining leasehold in that play is dominantly held by production. And so that, again, is another lever that allows us to really optimize our pace of development and investment. Bob, this is Ezra. Yes, this year, you're right, we've -- as we talked at the beginning of this year, we had a number of different exploration plays at a number of different places and evaluation. This year, we're drilling some initial wells, kind of wild cats in the play. Some of the plays are a bit further along and we're trying to delineate because remember, our exploration program, it's not really about producers and dry holes. It's really about how or if these prospects are going to be additive to the quality of our existing inventory. That's what we're really looking for here. Depending on how you bucketize the 20 wells we're talking about here in Point Pleasant is probably the most important thing. It's -- it will basically be another delineation type of year for us across the 400,000-acre position that we've put together. Outside of those 20 wells, that will be the biggest part of next year's kind of exploration delineation type of program, if I'd put it there. We have some ongoing prospects in other areas that we've talked about in the past. Some of those other ones, again, extend similar types of areas, places that have been sleepy in the past, places that are in known oil and natural gas producing areas, places where we're trying to bring modern technology, our advancement of horizontal drilling and completions technologies and combining them with our rock, the understanding of the geologic environment and seen if we can turn those into premium and double premium types of plays, it would be additive to us. And we'll just continue to evaluate as they go. To give you a hard number right now, though, it's just a little bit early, as Billy said, but we'll break that out in February. Yes, Jeanine, this is Ezra. That's a fantastic question here. It really speaks to what we think is one of our core competitive advantages, and that's the fact that we run a decentralized organization. That's what allows us to kind of cross-pollinate ideas between divisions. In any industry, the success of running a decentralized organization is being able to push decision-making and accountability down to the employees who are kind of touching the wells and closest to the value creation every single day. When you break it up that way and you think about it that way, we have 8 operating teams, and each of those has -- operates as kind of a fully functioning oil company in a lot of ways, if you will. They have a full complement of geologists, engineers, accountants, land mens, marketing people, so on and so forth. Each of these individual asset teams can really handle working across multiple basins. And in fact, to a different type of scale, you see the same type of leverage and benefits that we see at the corporate level is that by exploring in different basins really adds to kind of their understanding. I'll go back to how Ken started this, the Point Pleasant or the Utica play is actually being looked at currently by members of our Oklahoma City team who are quite familiar with the Woodford, the overpressured oil window in the Woodford play. And that play really lended a lot of expertise to our understanding of mechanical stratigraphy. Again, to reference what Ken was talking about on how the rocks actually break and interact with our completion strategy, and that's some of the key characteristics that have helped unlock in a number of our unconventional plays. Yes, Neil, we've got you. Yes, Neil, that's a good question. Let me take it one piece at a time here. Since earlier in the year, we've been talking about how we were anticipating a little bit less U.S. growth this year than what many people were forecasting. The reason for that clearly, there's a little bit of inventory exhaustion going on. These basins have been drilled for a number of years. But the biggest thing we based our models on this year was really what we were seeing with again, what's turned into inflationary pressures throughout the year. It's the rig counts, the frac spreads and really the people side of it. There's definitely North American discipline from the E&P sector out here, but there is also a supply chain constraints that have continued to kind of be felt throughout the entire year this year. I do think coming out of the pandemic, we've had a consolidation across the industry, what you've been left. And this is something we've talked about quite a bit, too, is you've been left with less companies and those companies that have the size, the scale, balance sheet, things of that nature to be able to continue to drill and operate. And the majority of those companies are drilling and investing in a way that's more disciplined than what was in favor prior to the pandemic. So I think it's really 3 or 4 different things that have kind of come together to limit U.S. growth. And quite frankly, a lot of those things that I've talked about are not necessarily transitory in nature. Some of these things will really continue into 2023 as well. And so that's why I'd say entering 2023, again, I suspect our forecast on the oil side will probably be a little bit to the low end of many of the numbers that you're seeing out there. Yes, Neil, thank you for bringing that up. It's something that we're exceptionally proud of. We've always said that in a cyclical industry such as ours, the best thing you can have is not just a strong but a real pristine balance sheet. There's never really been a cash target for us, and there's not one now. We're thrilled to be, as you kind of said, in a unique position where we're able to strengthen the balance sheet this year, but at the same time, return just over $5 billion, $5.1 billion to our shareholders. We've -- as far as the ultimate balance sheet, we have a couple of strategic things. We do have a $5 billion buyback authorization. We've talked about using that opportunistically. That's a compelling strategy to go ahead and carry a little more cash on the balance sheet than what we've done historically. But really, the strategy overall for the company is aimed at creating value in the long run and managing the balance sheet to make counter-cyclic investments is a big piece of that. We've talked about having operational and reserve cash just to stay out of commercial paper. But at the end of the day, when we think about it in a cyclical industry, like I said, the balance sheet provides a lot of optionality to create value. We're committed to delivering on our free cash flow priorities, and that's -- it's founded in growing a sustainable regular dividend, but it also contemplates the minimum commitment of 60% of free cash flow. And both of those are supported by having a very strong balance sheet and, just in general, being focused on doing the right thing at the right time to maximize long-term shareholder returns. Thank you. We want to thank everyone for participating in the call this morning. And we especially want to thank our employees. They've delivered another outstanding quarter for all of EOG's shareholders. Thank you for listening."

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer, EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir.\nTim Driggers: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG\u2019s SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures can be found on EOG\u2019s website. This conference call also include estimated resource potential, not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC\u2019s reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chief Executive Officer; Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Jeff Leitzell, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor Relations. Here is Ezra.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday we declared a third special dividend for the year, demonstrating our commitment to deliver long-term shareholder value through our cash return strategy. The $1.50 dividend is supported by another outstanding quarter. We posted adjusted earnings of $2.74 per share and nearly $1.3 billion of free cash flow. So far this year, we have declared $4.30 per share of special dividends. Combined with our peer-leading annualized regular dividend of $3 per share, we are on pace to pay out a minimum of 60% of annual free cash flow. What continues to differentiate EOG is our people and our assets. We have cultivated an inventory of premium and double premium wells that provide a 20-year runway for the company through our focus on organic exploration, supported by a decentralized organizational structure. Our multi-basin portfolio is predominantly the result of having seven North American and one international cross-functional exploration teams that work independently, but collaborate on shared learnings. Our role here in Houston beyond capital allocation is to facilitate those shared learnings across all eight teams. The result is a robust exploration pipeline that continues to both improve the quality of and expand our more than 20-year inventory of premium and double premium wells. Our portfolio includes the Delaware Basin, which remains the largest area of activity in the company and is delivering exceptional returns. After more than a decade of high return drilling, our Eagle Ford asset continues to deliver top tier results while operating at a steady pace. And our emerging South Texas Dorado dry natural gas play and Powder River Basin Mowry and Niobrara combo plays are contributing to EOG\u2019s success today and laying the groundwork for years of future high return investment. In addition, we have tested our Mowry and Niobrara plays in the northern Powder River Basin. Our initial results have demonstrated the untapped potential of this oilier part of the basin as a compliment to the outstanding performance in the southern part of the basin. EOG\u2019s current multi-basin portfolio, offering exposure to both geographic and product diversity alongside several other prospects in our exploration pipeline will continue to expand EOG\u2019s premium inventory and provide through the cycle value creation. Disciplined reinvestment within any given play depends on where we are in the development life cycle of that play. Our multi-basin and portfolio of high return assets, all competitive against our premium hurdle rate, provides invaluable flexibility to invest at the pace that allows each play to get better. It also allows us to plan around basin level market dynamics, impacting services and infrastructure to minimize inflation and bottlenecks. We are able to optimize reinvestment across our total portfolio to add reserves at low refining costs, lower the overall cost base of the company, and continue to improve EOG\u2019s company-wide capital efficiency. This quarter, we are highlighting, iSense, our continuous methane monitoring system that we piloted in the Delaware Basin and are now deploying in our most active development areas. iSense is yet another example of how EOG\u2019s decentralized model, not only fosters innovation across eight teams, but also compounds the impact of innovation by taking ideas born in one operating area and expanding them across multiple basins. From the latest information technology-driven solutions to reduce emissions, to innovation focused on drilling and completions operations, to procurement of casing and sand EOG is unique in its ability to leverage its culture and operating structure to get incrementally better every year. The tremendous inventory and cost improvements we have made over the last several years, provides high confidence in the low breakevens and operational flexibility of our business. This confidence in our business, along with the strength of our industry-leading balance sheet, [indiscernible] this quarter to terminate a significant portion of our oil and natural gas hedges. Going forward, we expect to hedge significantly less than the 20% to 30% of volumes we typically hedged in prior years. The current operating environment is challenging given the volatility of commodity prices and inflation headwinds. Through it all our employees have remained focused on execution and have improved the business. Our second quarter performance is proof of that. We delivered more oil for less capital and in the face of a unique inflationary environment, our forecast for capital expenditure this year remains unchanged. EOG\u2019s, consistent execution, low cost structure, reduced hedge position and transparent cash return strategy based on a regular dividend that we have never suspended or cut that has grown 21 of the last 24 years and is now competitive with the broader market, puts EOG in its strongest position ever to deliver significant value to shareholders through the cycle. Here is Billy with an operational update and early look at 2023.\nBilly Helms: Thanks Ezra. We posted outstanding results in the second quarter. Our performance included exceeding the midpoints of our production guidance while capital expenditures and total per unit operating cost beat forecasted targets. So once again, more oil for less capital. I\u2019d like to thank our employees for their dedication and persistence to execute and deliver such outstanding results. As we have guided to all year, our oil growth year-over-year will be about 4% to return our production to pre-COVID levels. Halfway through the year, we\u2019re on track to deliver that objective and have done so against a challenging supply chain backdrop. The upper price pressure on steel, fuel and labor continues due to ongoing supply constraints initiated by COVID and extended by the war in Ukraine. The impact of this has resulted in inflationary headwinds that have meaningfully exceeded our initial expectations earlier this year, making it increasingly challenging to maintain flat well cost. However, our employees continue to innovate and deliver efficiencies that offset a significant portion of this inflationary pressure. For example, in our Delaware Basin drilling operation, our down-hole drilling motor program is providing solid performance improvements, generating a 13% year-over-year increase in the foots drilled promoter run. The motor program and other improvements, are reducing drilling times versus last year. In the Eagle Ford, our drilling teams have improved the footage drilled per day by 11% versus last year, while also managing drilling parameters to reduce the cost of drilling fluids by 10%. In our completion operations, we had previously discussed the company\u2019s plans to increase the use of super-zipper completions, which are 40% faster than normal zipper operations. We have now utilized this technique on about 65% of EOG\u2019s completed wells year-to-date, which is yielding an 11% improvement in the lateral footage completed per day. Super-zipper completions combined with our focus on more efficient operational practices, has increased the amount of pumping hours per day by 24%. In addition, we continue to progress our self-sourced sand program and expect to further reduce sand cost in the second half of the year and extend those savings into 2023. All in all, we now expect our well cost to see a modest, single digit increase over last year. And most of this increase will be seen in the second half of the year. However, we\u2019re able to leverage our operational flexibility within our multi-basin portfolio, such that our capital and volume plan remains unchanged. Now turning to the macro backdrop, oil field service capacity remains extremely tight and is further constrained by the limited availability of materials and experienced labor, driving uncertainty in the cost of services, not only for this year, but also for 2023. These constraints are more concentrated in areas with the highest activities such as the Permian Basin. EOG\u2019s multi-basin portfolio provides us the flexibility to manage these constraints by optimizing activity between our multiple plays to maximize our return on investment. Just as in the past EOG will play to its strengths to mitigate where possible the inflationary pressure and operational constraints facing us. We\u2019re currently taking steps to secure services for next year, and we\u2019ll know more about the 2023 outlook next quarter. Regarding production growth, it\u2019s too early to discuss next year\u2019s plans with any degree of precision. However, it is important to recognize we will maintain our discipline. And as we see things today, would expect low, single digit oil growth similar to this year. On the natural gas side, we\u2019re excited about the results of our South Texas Dorado play and its ability to play an increasing role in supplying the growing demand of petrochemical and LNG markets along the Gulf Coast. As we allocate future capital based on returns, this play will command additional investment, not only to meet the growing demand, but also for infrastructure needed to capture the value chain from the wellhead to the market center. These investments not only generate healthy returns, but ultimately lead to lower well cost and lower long-term unit operating cost. We also expect to fund our emerging and promising exploration plays as we improve the company for the future. Now here is Ken to give you an update on our emissions reductions effort.\nKen Boedeker: Thanks, Billy. This quarter, we are providing details on our continuous methane monitoring project, which is an example of the progress we\u2019re making in our emission reduction efforts. Over the last several years, our leak detection and repair program, or LDAR has advanced from sound, sight, smell surveys to surveys using more accurate optical gas imaging, to today\u2019s deployment of scalable solutions of the latest technology, continuous methane monitoring. This technology detects potential leaks and provides real-time alerts to help accelerate repairs and will provide data and trend analysis to potentially prevent future methane releases. We\u2019ve been evaluating continuous methane monitoring technology for a few years. There are several third-party systems and technologies available to monitor and detect potential methane leaks, which use intermittent or continuous monitoring technology. About 18 months ago, we began a pilot project using a solution we built in-house named iSense, which is a fence-line monitoring solution that uses methane sensing technology to continuously monitor facilities and provide real-time alerts of potential leaks to a central control room. We tested iSense against monitoring solutions in use and available in the market today and confirmed that our sensor detected methane release events consistent with these third-party systems. The results from these tests confirmed that iSense is the most effective solution for EOG to use, to detect and accelerate leak repairs while also being scalable and economic. Like so many of our innovations, this technology is being spearheaded by our employees across the company. Since the pilot, our employees are rapidly deploying iSense in the field, prioritizing areas of highest potential impact. The initial installations are focused in the Delaware basin and currently cover about 60% of our production. We expect that most of the remaining Delaware basin production will be monitored by iSense by year-end. We\u2019ll continue to roll out iSense in other operating areas next year. Using our proprietary system allows us to own the data creation, flow and storage, which is a priority with all our information systems, owning the iSense data and retaining direct control of its collection provides invaluable flexibility to improve both data quality, as well as the tools to analyze and integrate iSense data with existing operational data from our production facilities. This data, along with our ability to monitor our operations for many of our four control rooms will enhance the 24/7 capability to continuously identify, prioritize and repair leaks. In the future, when data from iSense is paired with other real-time production data, we expect to be able to make improvements in the design of facilities to minimize releases. We\u2019re also optimistic that we will be able to more readily predict the likely size and source of a methane release. Leveraging technology to enhance our methane leak detection and repair program is another great example of EOG\u2019s culture of continuous improvement throughout all our operations. Our employees have embraced the company\u2019s a mission reduction efforts and I\u2019m excited to see how EOG\u2019s culture of innovation and technology will continue to drive creative solutions. Now here\u2019s Jeff to discuss the progress we\u2019ve made in our premium combo play in the Southern Powder River Basin.\nJeff Leitzell: Thanks Ken, our emerging Mowry and Niobrara plays in the Southern Powder River Basin have made significant progress recently. The powder returned to steady development last year, after a pullback in 2020, driven by the pandemic. Results in 2021 were stellar with respect to both well performance and well cost reduction. Strong results to-date combined with the benefit of infrastructure investments have positioned the Mowry and Niobrara plays to command more capital in 2023 and beyond. The Powder River Basin is an established operating area for both EOG and the industry that has experienced several chapters of development over its history. The latest chapter for EOG kicked off in 2018 when we moved the Mowry and Niobrara plays into commercial development, we identified nearly 1,500 net premium locations between both targets over our 130,000 net acre position in the Southern part of the basin. Since 2018, we have made great strides in fine tuning our technical model to improve the predictability and performance of the wells. We\u2019ve delineated the different parts of the basin, hydrating the specific landing zones. The basin has stacked potential similar to the Permian with two widespread well-known, very robust source rocks in the Mowry and Niobrara. Amongst those two source rocks are hybrid opportunities, such as silt zones and sand zones, a whole section of reservoir that really lends itself to horizontal drilling and completions. We have also made targeted infrastructure investments in recent years, which have helped lower the cost structure in each play. We have added nearly 40 miles of water pipeline in 2.5 million barrels of water storage capacity. Our water infrastructure investment in the PRB has allowed us to source about 90% of our water used in our operations from reuse, reducing costs for both water sourcing and disposal. We have also invested in infrastructure to enable local sand sourcing, the installation of a high pressure gas gathering system has been instrumental in achieving a 99.8% gas capture rate. The infrastructure is also benefiting our operating costs, per unit lease, operating expense in the powder is among the lowest in the company. The PRB is farther from market than some of our other premium plays. However, the Mowry and Niobrara have several advantages that more than make up for it. First and foremost, the wells have some of the largest per well reserves in the company on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. In the Southern PRB, the Niobrara and Mowry formations are more combo that is they produce a mix of oil and natural gas. While the laterals are also longer at 9,500 feet, which contributes to the higher recoveries while performance is mostly due to the quality of the reservoir and composition of the products with a large component of natural gas that supports higher recoveries. To-date, EOG has completed about 40 net Mowry and Niobrara wells in the Southern PRB. This year, we anticipate completing 15 net Mowry and Niobrara wells and expect to significantly increase that activity next year. As a result of our exploration work on the entire Powder River Basin hydrocarbon system over the last few years, we have also built an additional 110 net acre block in the north, extending our acreage in the productive fairway to 90 miles. The Northern area is a historically underexplored part of the basin. And after recognizing the potential in the area, we corded up acreage adjacent to our legacy 8 acreage through a series of trades and small bolt-on transactions, utilizing reservoir data for multiple plays. We identified landing zones in the Mowry and Niobrara formation with favorable petrophysical and geomechanical properties and began testing. We drilled four successful delineation wells, which we believe are industry first in the area. While it is still early in the delineation, we\u2019ve confirmed the development potential of our Northern Powder River Basin acreage to add to our future premium inventory. The Mowry and Niobrara combo plays in the Southern Powder River Basin stand today, well positioned to compete for capital within the portfolio and combined with our position to the north, the basin has significant investment potential for years to come. Next up is Lance to provide some color on our marketing position in the Powder.\nLance Terveen: Thanks Jeff. As we look further downstream, the investment in infrastructure that has lowered the cost structure in the Southern Powder River Basin also allows us to apply our time tested marketing strategy of establishing multiple connections to provide market pricing diversification. Today, we hold sufficient processing, transportation and fractionation capacity for natural gas liquids out of the PRB. We have access to both the Mid-Continent at Conway, Kansas, and the Gulf Coast at Mount Bellevue, Texas, and underappreciated aspect of the Mowry and Niobrara wells is the prolific NGL production and the heavier post-processing mix of NGLs they produce. After processing to minimize ethane extraction, our Powder River Basin in NGL barrel contains approximately 10% ethane, 45% propane, and the remainder being butanes and more of a heavier NGLs resulting in an NGL to WTI price ratio of over 50%. In the first half of this year, our NGL price realization was $53.01, which is a $7.17 premium to the Mount Bellevue typical barrel. In addition, the quality of the Powder River Basin oil has an average API gravity of 44 to 47 and remains in high demand. During the first half of this year, realized prices for our oil production out of the PRB were WTI plus $1.63 with access to both Wyoming and Cushing, Oklahoma markets. Stepping back, I\u2019d like to review our marketing strategy for the company as a whole and all our active development areas we want to retain control of our products and establish multiple sales points, which adds significant value. For example, in the first half of this year, we transported an average of 188,000 barrels of oil per day for export, which represents about 30% of gross production with optionality to sell based on a WTI or a Brent Index with the widening of the Brent WTI spread, we have the opportunity to take advantage of our capacity to deliver up to 250,000 barrels of oil per day for export. For propane, we have delivered 19,000 barrels per day for export at premium prices to Mount Bellevue. We also continue to see strong uplift in our natural gas price realizations due to our early mover advantage, securing 140,000 MMBtus per day, linked to JKM through Cheniere LNG facility in Corpus Christi. Cheniere recently announced FID or final investment decision on Stage 3 in Corpus Christi. When Stage 3 goes in service, EOG will triple its exposure to JKM to 420,000 MMBtus per day. We continue to see constructive long-term demand for all our products, both domestically along the Gulf Coast and internationally. To unlock that value, you need control of your products, transportation capacity, and an early mover advantage to capture spreads quickly. As we look down the road, EOG is well positioned to capture the strength of prices in these export markets to generate additional cash flow and value to shareholders. Next up is Ezra for concluding remarks.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Lance. We believe EOG is differentiated for the following reasons. We have a diverse portfolio of assets across multiple basins providing geographic and product diversity. We are a reliable and consistent high performing operator. We have among the lowest cost structures. We are committed to sustainability. We maintain an exceptional balance sheet. Our cash return strategy is transparent. Our regular dividend is competitive with the broader market. And finally, the EOG culture is one of a kind and it\u2019s at the core of our differentiated performance. We believe there are only a handful of North American E&P companies that have the asset quality, the size, the scale to compete globally on oil and gas cost of supply. And on top of that, produce the barrels with a lower environmental footprint. In the future, those are the companies that the world is going to want to deliver additional barrels. And we firmly believe that EOG is a leader in that group of North American E&Ps. Thanks for listening. We\u2019ll now go to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Leo Mariani of MKM Partners. Leo, please go ahead.\nLeo Mariani: Hey guys, totally realize that it\u2019s obviously way too early for 2023 guidance at this point. You guys did have some prepared comments, which kind of said as things stand today. You would look to grow oil kind of low-single digits next year. I guess it feels like a bit of a pivot from what you all had said in the past, which was kind of this 8% to 10% oil growth would kind of be optimal sort of operating speed for EOG as kind of something changed in terms of how you look at kind of optimizing the operations versus the growth of the company.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Leo, this is Ezra. I appreciate your question. Really, what we\u2019ve always talked about is that our growth is really the output of our ability to generate high returns from a disciplined reinvestment strategy. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve tried to describe today is as you pointed out, first of all, it is early to talk about 2023. But ultimately, we\u2019re committed to remaining disciplined. We want to focus investment in each of our assets at a level where they can continue to improve every year. Directionally, as we see it today, how the supply and demand balances look, the constraints on services, the associated inflationary pressures, oil growth will likely be similar to this year. And as Billy highlighted, we\u2019d expect to direct additional investment towards our Dorado natural gas play based on the positive results that we\u2019re seeing there.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I just wanted to ask on the capital. Obviously, you\u2019re one of the few companies did not raise the CapEx budget thus far here in 2022. You described a lot of the ways that you\u2019re able to kind of keep costs lower and some of the innovation that you\u2019ve sort of had. I did notice that you did pull some of the wells out of the schedule this year. It\u2019s not big numbers, just talking a few on the margin. Just wanted to get a sense, is there any thought that you\u2019re maybe doing a little bit less to kind of stay within the budget and just kind of looking at where you were in the first half and third quarter guidance. Is it fair to say you\u2019re probably kind of in the upper half of the CapEx for the year?\nBilly Helms: Yes. Leo, this is Billy Helms. Yes, the small change in well count is really just a result of two things, one is timing. Some of the wells that were scheduled to complete at year-end are going to slip into the next year. It\u2019s just a timing thing. The other factor that plays into that is a change in working interest in some of our plays. We\u2019ve had slightly lower working interest in some of our Delaware Basin wells in the second half of the year. Just to illustrate how minimal that is, that\u2019s only about a 2% average change in working interest across the year. So it\u2019s a very minuscule amount, but that explains the change in the well count. As far as the CapEx, we\u2019re very pleased, as you can tell from the comments we made about the ability of our teams to continue to innovate and drive efficiencies in our business to offset inflation. Inflation turns out to be just a little bit higher than we anticipated this year, so we are going to see a slight increase in our well cost as we go through especially the second half of the year, but we\u2019re still confident we\u2019re going to stay within our guidance and don\u2019t expect to face additional costs that will increase our budget.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan Chase. Arun, please go ahead.\nArun Jayaram: Hey, good morning. I appreciate the color on the Powder River Basin, but I guess my first question is just thinking about capital allocation between the basins as we think about next year. Today, Ezra, I think 22 of 24 of your rig lines are either in the Delaware or Eagle Ford, you have one rig in the Powder River Basin. You mentioned in your comments you plan to lean a little bit on Dorado next year and significantly increase perhaps the mix of activity in the Powder River Basin. Just wondering if you can give us a sense of how your activity could shift as we think about next year and how many rig lines you may have in the Powder.\nBilly Helms: Yes, Arun, this is Billy. As far as capital allocation, as we see it today, there\u2019s a lot of factors play into that, of course, and it\u2019s early to say where we\u2019re going to be still we\u2019ll have quite a bit of activity in the Delaware Basin going forward. It is a premier play in the company, and certainly, that will continue to command quite a bit of capital. Eagle Ford has been, as you know, a performance engine for the company for the last decade or longer. And that will \u2013 and they\u2019re generating outstanding results. So that will still command capital. As we compare \u2013 we allocate capital based on returns and certainly, the encouragement we\u2019re seeing from Dorado and the activity there is showing us the ability to be able to continue to fund that program going forward. And then the confidence we have in the new emerging Powder River Basin gives us a sense that, that will also come in quite a bit of activity. So the ratios, I would say, are going to stay similar. As far as the Powder River Basin and our overall capital plan, that will depend on the outlook for commodities at that time, but the \u2013 what we\u2019re going to see in the Powder, just to be clear, is a shift of activity from some of their older traditional plays, the Turner and the Parkman to some of the deeper, more emerging plays and then Mowry more specifically and the Nio. So you\u2019ll see that shift. The amount of capital allocated to that play will also depend on just the commodity price outlook that we see for the year once we get closer to that. But overall, we\u2019re \u2013 the takeaway from that, I would think, would be that the flexibility we have with the multiple plays we have to chase to continue to add value long-term to the shareholders.\nArun Jayaram: Great. My follow-up is just maybe one for Tim. Just maybe a housekeeping question. Tim, in the 10-Q, you have $1.8 billion of collateral postings associated with hedge activity. I was wondered if you could help us think about the potential runoff of those collateral postings as well as maybe the timing of when you plan to pay off the $1.25 billion of bonds. Is that later this year or in 2023?\nTim Driggers: Yes. This is Tim. As far as the bond, that is 2023. It\u2019s in the first quarter of 2023 is when that will mature. We have no plans to pay it off early. As far as the collateral they run off kind of like the hedges that we\u2019ve given you the timing of when those hedges are in our 10-Q. So it kind of runs off as that timing comes off. It all depends, of course, on where the strip goes, how that comes off. But right now, it\u2019s based on the strip, and that would be how it would come off, just as those run off.\nArun Jayaram: All right, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Scott, please go ahead.\nScott Hanold: Yes. Thanks. And if I could ask a question, one more question maybe on the PRB. You all highlight some good commodity price realizations that you\u2019re all seeing there. Is that something that you think can persist going forward? And is it a function of what\u2019s happening in the basin overall? Or is it specifically something EOG\u2019s got in place that allows you to kind of benefit there a little bit more.\nLance Terveen: Hey Scott, this is Lance Terveen. Thanks for your question. Yes, when you think about the price realizations, I think the broader message is just you can really just see how competitive the Powder is with all our other plays. I mean, operationally, I mean, you heard Jeff kind of outline a lot of things in the opening comments, but even for our products, we continue to just really see it being in high demand. For example, like even on the crude, you have to remember one of the important attributes up in the Powder, especially related to EOG, is just think about the crude quality. I mean today, we\u2019re kind of seeing right around 44, 45. We expect that to kind of be a 44, 47, kind of over time. And so we really want to protect that quality. We\u2019ve secured 500,000 barrels of storage is kind of in the field. We\u2019ve got firm capacity to both Guernsey and the Cushing market. So having that multiple flexibility where we can show that kind of high demand barrel and the API quality that we have keep it kind of segregated with that API quality, it\u2019s really a value when we sell direct to our refiners. And so just being able to have that value and have that quality and consistency is key, and so we draw a lot of that experience from what we\u2019ve done in the Eagle Ford and also in the Powder \u2013 I mean, I\u2019m sorry, in the Delaware Basin. But yes, that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 the quality is what you\u2019re seeing on the price realizations. And then as you think about the NGLs, you\u2019re seeing mostly ethane rejection that\u2019s happening there. So most of that, you\u2019re seeing the ethane that\u2019s going to be going more towards like an MMBtu or selling that as a gas. And so that is a heavier barrel that you\u2019re seeing that we kind of show. But again, we have the market flexibility. We can show that barrel in Conway. We can also show that barrel in Mont Belvieu. So we can kind of are that flexibility to and look at those spreads. So getting kind of back to your question, I mean, really the quality and then the flexibility that we have with the multiple markets and it\u2019s in an area that\u2019s absolutely in demand as we.\nScott Hanold: Got it. Thanks for that. And as my follow-up, I want to ask a question on Trinidad. And it looks like you\u2019re guiding down a fair amount for gas production in Trinidad. And I know you\u2019ve had some exploration success there, and I think you\u2019re drilling a development or you have or you\u2019re going to be drilling a development well this year. So can you give us a sense of like what to expect from Trinidad? And is it more of the relative pricing dynamic there versus Dorado in terms of like which play is going to get sort of more capital investment?\nBilly Helms: Yes, Scott, this is Billy Helms. So for Trinidad, we\u2019ve had, as you know, a long successful history of really maintaining pretty much flat production with minimal investment, and it generates quite a bit of cash for the company \u2013 cash flow for the company. So it\u2019s been a very successful project for multiple decades now. We still see exploration opportunities and are still counting on exploration success going forward just based on the things we see today. The small guide down in gas production, especially in the next, say, the rest of this year, is based on some turnaround projects we have on some of the compressor stations and platforms in the field. So it\u2019s just an operational issue really in the manifest in the third quarter mainly. So -- but as we start to drill some of these exploration wells, we still have confidence that production base will continue.\nScott Hanold: Okay. Okay. So it should turn around back to sort of normal levels by early 2023. Is that right?\nBilly Helms: Yes, that\u2019s right.\nScott Hanold: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Scott, please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: Yes, good morning. Just coming back to the inflation question, I know you guys have previously commented that you don\u2019t see an outsized inflationary impact on EOG next year from contract role or any other factors. But have you engaged in these earlier than normal discussions for services and consumables, et cetera. Are you still confident that the inflation that you experienced next year will not be any worse than the industry trends?\nBilly Helms: Yes, Scott, this is Billy Helms, again. On the inflation question, I think I would distinguish a little bit there. I think we\u2019re recognizing the inflation that everybody else in the industry is seeing. We\u2019re able to combat that really through a lot of the efficiencies we drive through our business. And that\u2019s really a result of the culture we have of continuous improvement and the quality of the staff we have in each of our operating divisions. So now the contracting strategy has always been a long-term thing for EOG. We worked with our vendors, our partners on the service side. And our contracts are always a little bit staggered so that all the contracts don\u2019t roll off at the same time. That gives us a lot of flexibility to also manage the commodity cycles to make sure we have a consistent operating performance level going into the year. We always start about this time of year. So I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re starting any earlier than we typically do. I think we always started sometime here in the middle part of the year to start securing services for the next year as we see things play out. We take opportunities as we see those emerge to make arrangements with vendors and our service partners to secure those services in the upcoming year and that determines the level of services that we secure for next year\u2019s well cost. We typically like to think about securing about 50% to 60% of the well cost ahead of any given year. And that range depends on the opportunities we see with service partners to lock in those services. This year, we expect to be somewhat the same as we go into next year, but it -- we\u2019ll see as we get closer to the year-end, but that\u2019s how we see the inflation. Obviously, we expect with the tightness in the market, we\u2019re going to see some additional inflationary pressure going into next year. So just anticipating that, we could see another uptick in our well cost going into next year, but we expect to, again, moderate a lot of that with our efficiency gains.\nScott Gruber: Got it. And then a follow-up here on the 60% distribution threshold really in light of the early hedge settlement payments you made this quarter, so if you include those payments which you guys are doing your reporting, then you guys are running ahead of the threshold. But if you assume those are more of a onetime hit to free cash, then you\u2019re running a little bit behind that threshold. And I know you look at the threshold on an annual basis. So I guess the question is, what\u2019s your appetite to approach the 60% payout for the year removing the impact of the $1.3 billion in early head settlement payments?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Scott, this is Ezra. Just a little bit of color on that. Obviously, the Board decides the dividend each quarter. They review our business needs, the macro environment, the cash position, so on and so forth. And as you said, the $1.50 per share special this quarter, which brings the total dividend commitment to right at $7.30 per share is on pace to achieve the minimum of a 60% free cash flow return. And I think that\u2019s the emphasis on there is that the 60% is a minimum. Ultimately, it\u2019s up to the Board, like I said, to return additional cash in 2022. The way to think about those early terminations of the hedges is really a reflection, I think, of our confidence in improving the financial profile of the company. Our ability to navigate inflationary pressures this year flexibility to allocate capital across multiple resource plays, which are each delivering exceptional returns and really our ability to continue to lower the cost base of the company. These are all things that deliver expanded free cash flow opportunities for EOG.\nScott Gruber: Great. Appreciate the color, Ezra. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann from Truist Securities. Neal, please go ahead.\nNeal Dingmann: My first question is maybe for you or Tim, on a little bit different capital allocation. Specifically, I\u2019m trying to get a sense of what you all would need to see either quantitative and qualitatively need to see to start potentially look at more or, I guess, as guys calling out there leading into buybacks. Do you have an understand you all have bought back shares for years and we did see a decent decline a month or so from the highs. So I\u2019m just wondering when you guys think about buybacks, what -- when you say opportunistic, what really goes into that?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Neal, this is Ezra. Thank you for the question. Basically, we evaluate a buyback just like any other investment decision. And really, what we do is we look to see how it\u2019s going to create long-term shareholder value. And as you highlighted and as we\u2019ve discussed previously, the $5 billion share repurchase authorization that we have in place, we\u2019ve talked about using it opportunistically. And what that means for us is using it during times of what we would say are significant dislocations in the market. And that\u2019s as opposed to a more programmatic system. And quite frankly, this year, during Q2, we didn\u2019t really see a what we would say was a significant dislocation. We definitely witnessed a lot of volatility, I think, rather than a dislocation. The volatility was due -- is driven by changes to the oil inventories that we saw that was really due to the SPR releases. We saw some concern over demand destruction associated with the inflationary pressures across the broad market. We saw some potential for weaker demand associated with the uptick of COVID cases. But ultimately, in our view, these are all kind of short-term events that really don\u2019t change the fundamental supply and demand picture.\nNeal Dingmann: I like how you all thinking about that, Ezra. And then my second or follow-up likely for Billy, just on vertical integration, specifically. You all have other areas -- other oilfield service areas besides you mentioned the self-sourced sand. And I\u2019m just wondering do you have other areas that, I guess, you would call it more vertically integrated or that you would think about doing that. And I\u2019m just wondering that also on that self-source sand, how much capacity do you have on that side?\nBilly Helms: Yes, Neal, this is Billy. Certainly, on the self-source sand, you named one of the primary ones. It\u2019s a big part of our program. We\u2019ve been doing that, as you might remember, for more than a decade. And what we\u2019ve been able to do is find ways to get the source of the sand closer and closer to the wellhead, minimizing not only the cost of the product, but also the transportation involved in getting it to the wellhead. We are expanding that through the rest of the year such that we\u2019ll be able to continue to supply greater and greater amounts from our own self-sourced mines, so we\u2019re excited about the growth in that. Other areas that we self source, there\u2019s a number of them. I mentioned briefly in the prepared comments, a note to our efforts to take control of the drilling motors that we use in our drilling operation. That\u2019s a small thing maybe, but it\u2019s a big driver of performance when it comes to that part of the business. And we recognized that a couple of years ago, built up some expertise in our staff to address that. We worked specifically to not only design, but also build and oversee the maintenance of those motors that ultimately drives the improved performance and we\u2019re seeing great results from that program. And that\u2019s another differentiator in our drilling performance that allows us to continue to offset inflation. Some of the other things, as you know, we\u2019ve been managing our tubular inventory for many, many years as well. we deal directly with the steel mills, which gives us a lot of advantages in the sense of having some clarity or some certainty on the market and kind of what that\u2019s indicating to get ahead of issues where we see it, take advantage of opportunities to secure those at lower cost and make sure that we have pipe for our programs on a go-forward basis. So those are maybe a couple of other things that would give you some color on what we\u2019re doing.\nNeal Dingmann: That\u2019s great details, Billy. Thank you guys for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Doug, please go ahead. Doug Leggate, your line is now open. You can proceed with your question.\nDoug Leggate: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for letting me on. Ezra, Slide 5, your latest assessment of cash flow doesn\u2019t give any numbers around it in terms of breakeven. I wonder if I could just ask you to look into 2023 and give us an update of where you see your sustaining capital and the breakeven oil and gas prices that go along with that, the assumptions behind that, if you don\u2019t mind.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Doug, we haven\u2019t released that and we did remove the breakeven slide from earlier this year, because of the significant change in gas prices that have gone on in the first six months of the year. The best thing I can point to is the fact that we continue to bring on lower-cost reserves, basically focused on the premium and double premium wells into the cost base of the company. You can look at the reduction in our unit costs and the reduction in our DD&A rate year-over-year to kind of infer the reduction in our breakevens.\nDoug Leggate: Okay. I\u2019ll push David on this and see if we can get him to put it back in, because it\u2019s a pretty critical input to, obviously, the market\u2019s perception of free cash flow, but I appreciate the answer. My follow-up Ezra, I apologize in advance, you\u2019re not going to like this, but it\u2019s a follow-up from the share buyback question. Application in your stock is subjected obviously, but if I look at your share performance in absolute terms and in relative terms in particular for the last four or five years it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s really struggled to against the rest of the sector. And one could interpret from your comments about dislocations and a version perhaps the buybacks that you don\u2019t see value in your stock. So if you could address that versus the transitory nature of a special dividend, why you wouldn\u2019t want to step in to just about every one of your peers is doing something on buybacks and their share performance is quite different from yours on a relative basis. So any thoughts around that would be appreciated?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Doug. The first thing I would say is that, that\u2019s right, I think it\u2019s stating the obvious that that I feel that our stock is undervalued right now. But again we look at that buyback and investment in that buyback we compare it against other opportunities in the business to create shareholder value \u2013 long-term shareholder value. And when we do that, when we compare it versus reinvesting in the business drilling these double premium, these premium wells at a 30% and a 60% direct after tax rate return based on $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. It\u2019s a very, very high hurdle. So when we think about what can create longer term value for the shareholder, we see the benefit of reinvesting in the business, driving down our long-term well cost, lowering the break evens as we talked about has a very, very competitive portion of allocation. Now with regards on the transitory nature comparison with the transferring nature of a special dividend, I think again it goes back to the way that we look at the buyback with regard to our shareholders. Buying repurchasing shares during a volatile movement in the stock price, I think our shareholders prefer to have the assurity of special dividends coming back to them as opposed to us trying to time the volatility in the markets. Now that\u2019s different from what \u2013 again, I would go back to what we call a significant market dislocation, where I think though you\u2019d have an opportunity there that would compete very favorably to create long-term shareholder value.\nDoug Leggate: It\u2019s a tricky one, I guess, a special dividend doesn\u2019t reinvesting and if you think your stock is undervalued, then one could argue that the volatility is something you got to live with, but you think \u2013 I guess we\u2019re never going to \u2013 we\u2019re probably not going to agree on this, but it seems to me the special dividend is, yes, it\u2019s the lesser permanent input from the share price, I guess is what I was getting at. But anyway, I appreciate your answer, as I always appreciate your perspective. Thank you.\nEzra Yacob: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Paul, please go ahead.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning. Two questions please. Ezra, could you comment on the A&D market in, for example, in Eagle Ford, I think you gentlemen have said the asset is getting a little bit tired. So do you see opportunity to make maybe more sizeable bolt-on acquisition that to beef up the operation there? And secondly, that just wondering that have you guys get a chance to review the new tender proposal on the tax law changes? And how that \u2013 what would be any major impact to EOG? Thank you.\nEzra Yacob: Thank you, Paul. This is Ezra. Let me attack that first question on the Eagle Ford and then I\u2019ll hand it over to Tim Driggers to give some feedback on the tax law proposals. So on the A&D market there in the Eagle Ford, yes, let me \u2013 let me clarify how we\u2019re viewing the Eagle Ford right now. We\u2019re on pace to deliver for the second year in the row, basically record rates have return and record finding costs in our drilling program there. And the big thing that it comes to is it kind of fits back into some of my opening comments talking about the right investment rate for plays at different life cycles. So clearly our Eagle Ford position has reached a point where it\u2019s not a main focus area for growth anymore, but what we see is a very, very long runway of exceptional returns on those wells as you were reinvesting them assuming that we\u2019re moving at the right pace, where our team has the ability to execute on lowering costs, increasing incrementally the well productivity. As far as expanding our footprint there, we still have a very robust Eagle Ford inventory position. When I think about the Eagle Ford position we\u2019ve talked about 7,000 locations and being approximately halfway drilled through those locations. So still well over 10 years worth of inventory to drill on. The other thing about looking to do A&D in an established basin like that is just going to be the cost of acquisition. We primarily focus our exploration efforts and we always have for the two decades that we\u2019ve been involved in unconventional resources on organic or Greenfield lease acquisitions because that low cost of entry is critically important to providing through cycle value to the shareholders. Those \u2013 the PDP value that you would have to pay for in an established area, or just established acreage prices. Those things stay with you on your books forever. It raises the cost base of the company and is really antithesis to what we\u2019ve been trying to do over the last few years by shifting to premium and now double premium drilling. Tim, would you like to please comment on the tax proposals?\nTim Driggers: Sure. Paul, as far as the proposal we\u2019re in the process of reviewing that as is everyone else currently. But specifically looking at the minimum tax proposal, we do not see that is having any detriment to EOGs. We are a full taxpayer already, so as we model it currently, it will have no impact on EOG.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Jeanine, please go ahead.\nJeanine Wai: Hi, thanks for taking our questions. Maybe just following up on Paul\u2019s question there, low cost bolt-ons have always been part of your capital allocation strategy, and we noticed the cash flow statement had about $350 million of that in there. Any color on whether that was primarily blocking and tackling in your active areas, or is that more on the exploration front?\nBilly Helms: Yes, Jeanine, this is Billy Helms. That particular acquisition is really just an opportunity we found to bolt-on some largely primarily acreage in some of our exploration plays, very little if no production on those plays. And it just is another way that we can continue to add and grow at a low cost our exploration opportunity set that we see in the future of the company.\nJeanine Wai: Okay, great. And then maybe just a quick-one on marketing, you talked about \u2013 you\u2019ve got optionality for up to 250,000 barrels a day of brent exposure. You\u2019re not electing that much right now, but we\u2019re looking at your production levels out of the Permian and the Eagle Ford, and so what\u2019s the capacity to increase beyond that 250,000 or maybe to get to that 250,000? And if you were to take on some more exposure on that, is this really looking at things more on the contract side, or are you also securing to, or are you also open to securing more dock space on your own? Thank you.\nEzra Yacob: Jeanine, thanks for the question. Good question too as timely. The exports especially for crude oil has been an important component of our marketing strategy, but when you really look just from an industry standpoint too, I mean, refiners in the U.S. are not expanding. I mean, if anything it\u2019s degrading, right? I mean, we\u2019re seeing our market share; you\u2019re seeing refineries shutting down. You\u2019re seeing refiners that are being repurposed and so we had a view going all the way back to 2018 that we wanted to have a significant export position that we could access from multiple plays. And I know one of your questions there was just, how do we think about the Delaware Basin? Or how do we think about the Eagle Ford? And you\u2019re exactly right, that was all in our contracting that we wanted to be able to have a large position that we could access from both of those plays. So if you think about it today, we have that 250,000 and yes, that facility is expandable. But we have 5 million barrels of storage. I mean, we can segregate WTL, WTI; we can segregate our Eagle Ford. I mean, we are in a premier position as we think about from a low cost and being in early with our tankage position and then also with the capacity that we have out of the Delaware Basin from a transport position and also from the Eagle Ford. So what I would say is we can \u2013 we can transact very quickly. We have tankage that\u2019s in place, and so if we feel the need that we needed to push more across, that\u2019s absolutely something that we could do.\nJeanine Wai: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Neil, please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: Hey, good morning Ezra and team. Just one question for me, it\u2019s just \u2013 can you give us the lay of the land of how the Dorado program is shaking up \u2013 shaping up and how do you think about the net asset as we go into next year from a planning perspective, but as we continue to see the gas curve is firmed up here? How do you think Dorado can fit into the overall U.S. gas picture? Thank you.\nKen Boedeker: Yes. Neil, this is Ken. At this time we really have two-drilling or executive in the Dorado play. And just to give you a little bit of a background on it, since 2018 we\u2019ve drilled and completed over 30 of our 1,250 premium locations, both in the Austin Chalk and the Eagle Ford and we\u2019ve really made excellent progress on reducing well cost and enhancing our geologic understanding and increasing our well performance. We\u2019ve increased our lateral length and we\u2019re really operationally being able to execute. As far as how 2023 goes, it\u2019s a little early to talk about the 2023 program yet. Obviously we\u2019ll remain disciplined with our investment there. First to make sure that the market needs the gas and second to make sure we\u2019re operationally getting better. We \u2013 one thing to keep in mind is we really don\u2019t need a lot of wells there to grow production significantly given the performance of the wells and their shallow decline rate.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks Ken.\nOperator: In the interest of time that is the end of the Q&A session today. So I\u2019ll now hand you over to Mr. Yacob for closing remarks.\nEzra Yacob: Yes. We want to thank everyone for participating in the call this morning and thanks to our shareholders for their continued support. We especially want to recognize our employees for their performance this quarter. Our discussion today highlights their focus on making EOG a low cost operator, generating high returns and lowering our environmental footprint each and every year. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thanks Ken, our emerging Mowry and Niobrara plays in the Southern Powder River Basin have made significant progress recently. The powder returned to steady development last year, after a pullback in 2020, driven by the pandemic. Results in 2021 were stellar with respect to both well performance and well cost reduction. Strong results to-date combined with the benefit of infrastructure investments have positioned the Mowry and Niobrara plays to command more capital in 2023 and beyond. The Powder River Basin is an established operating area for both EOG and the industry that has experienced several chapters of development over its history. The latest chapter for EOG kicked off in 2018 when we moved the Mowry and Niobrara plays into commercial development, we identified nearly 1,500 net premium locations between both targets over our 130,000 net acre position in the Southern part of the basin. Since 2018, we have made great strides in fine tuning our technical model to improve the predictability and performance of the wells. We've delineated the different parts of the basin, hydrating the specific landing zones. The basin has stacked potential similar to the Permian with two widespread well-known, very robust source rocks in the Mowry and Niobrara. Amongst those two source rocks are hybrid opportunities, such as silt zones and sand zones, a whole section of reservoir that really lends itself to horizontal drilling and completions. We have also made targeted infrastructure investments in recent years, which have helped lower the cost structure in each play. We have added nearly 40 miles of water pipeline in 2.5 million barrels of water storage capacity. Our water infrastructure investment in the PRB has allowed us to source about 90% of our water used in our operations from reuse, reducing costs for both water sourcing and disposal. We have also invested in infrastructure to enable local sand sourcing, the installation of a high pressure gas gathering system has been instrumental in achieving a 99.8% gas capture rate. The infrastructure is also benefiting our operating costs, per unit lease, operating expense in the powder is among the lowest in the company. The PRB is farther from market than some of our other premium plays. However, the Mowry and Niobrara have several advantages that more than make up for it. First and foremost, the wells have some of the largest per well reserves in the company on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. In the Southern PRB, the Niobrara and Mowry formations are more combo that is they produce a mix of oil and natural gas. While the laterals are also longer at 9,500 feet, which contributes to the higher recoveries while performance is mostly due to the quality of the reservoir and composition of the products with a large component of natural gas that supports higher recoveries. To-date, EOG has completed about 40 net Mowry and Niobrara wells in the Southern PRB. This year, we anticipate completing 15 net Mowry and Niobrara wells and expect to significantly increase that activity next year. As a result of our exploration work on the entire Powder River Basin hydrocarbon system over the last few years, we have also built an additional 110 net acre block in the north, extending our acreage in the productive fairway to 90 miles. The Northern area is a historically underexplored part of the basin. And after recognizing the potential in the area, we corded up acreage adjacent to our legacy 8 acreage through a series of trades and small bolt-on transactions, utilizing reservoir data for multiple plays. We identified landing zones in the Mowry and Niobrara formation with favorable petrophysical and geomechanical properties and began testing. We drilled four successful delineation wells, which we believe are industry first in the area. While it is still early in the delineation, we've confirmed the development potential of our Northern Powder River Basin acreage to add to our future premium inventory. The Mowry and Niobrara combo plays in the Southern Powder River Basin stand today, well positioned to compete for capital within the portfolio and combined with our position to the north, the basin has significant investment potential for years to come. Next up is Lance to provide some color on our marketing position in the Powder."

            "content": "Thanks Jeff. As we look further downstream, the investment in infrastructure that has lowered the cost structure in the Southern Powder River Basin also allows us to apply our time tested marketing strategy of establishing multiple connections to provide market pricing diversification. Today, we hold sufficient processing, transportation and fractionation capacity for natural gas liquids out of the PRB. We have access to both the Mid-Continent at Conway, Kansas, and the Gulf Coast at Mount Bellevue, Texas, and underappreciated aspect of the Mowry and Niobrara wells is the prolific NGL production and the heavier post-processing mix of NGLs they produce. After processing to minimize ethane extraction, our Powder River Basin in NGL barrel contains approximately 10% ethane, 45% propane, and the remainder being butanes and more of a heavier NGLs resulting in an NGL to WTI price ratio of over 50%. In the first half of this year, our NGL price realization was $53.01, which is a $7.17 premium to the Mount Bellevue typical barrel. In addition, the quality of the Powder River Basin oil has an average API gravity of 44 to 47 and remains in high demand. During the first half of this year, realized prices for our oil production out of the PRB were WTI plus $1.63 with access to both Wyoming and Cushing, Oklahoma markets. Stepping back, I'd like to review our marketing strategy for the company as a whole and all our active development areas we want to retain control of our products and establish multiple sales points, which adds significant value. For example, in the first half of this year, we transported an average of 188,000 barrels of oil per day for export, which represents about 30% of gross production with optionality to sell based on a WTI or a Brent Index with the widening of the Brent WTI spread, we have the opportunity to take advantage of our capacity to deliver up to 250,000 barrels of oil per day for export. For propane, we have delivered 19,000 barrels per day for export at premium prices to Mount Bellevue. We also continue to see strong uplift in our natural gas price realizations due to our early mover advantage, securing 140,000 MMBtus per day, linked to JKM through Cheniere LNG facility in Corpus Christi. Cheniere recently announced FID or final investment decision on Stage 3 in Corpus Christi. When Stage 3 goes in service, EOG will triple its exposure to JKM to 420,000 MMBtus per day. We continue to see constructive long-term demand for all our products, both domestically along the Gulf Coast and internationally. To unlock that value, you need control of your products, transportation capacity, and an early mover advantage to capture spreads quickly. As we look down the road, EOG is well positioned to capture the strength of prices in these export markets to generate additional cash flow and value to shareholders. Next up is Ezra for concluding remarks. Hey Scott, this is Lance Terveen. Thanks for your question. Yes, when you think about the price realizations, I think the broader message is just you can really just see how competitive the Powder is with all our other plays. I mean, operationally, I mean, you heard Jeff kind of outline a lot of things in the opening comments, but even for our products, we continue to just really see it being in high demand. For example, like even on the crude, you have to remember one of the important attributes up in the Powder, especially related to EOG, is just think about the crude quality. I mean today, we're kind of seeing right around 44, 45. We expect that to kind of be a 44, 47, kind of over time. And so we really want to protect that quality. We've secured 500,000 barrels of storage is kind of in the field. We've got firm capacity to both Guernsey and the Cushing market. So having that multiple flexibility where we can show that kind of high demand barrel and the API quality that we have keep it kind of segregated with that API quality, it's really a value when we sell direct to our refiners. And so just being able to have that value and have that quality and consistency is key, and so we draw a lot of that experience from what we've done in the Eagle Ford and also in the Powder \u2013 I mean, I'm sorry, in the Delaware Basin. But yes, that's \u2013 it's \u2013 the quality is what you're seeing on the price realizations. And then as you think about the NGLs, you're seeing mostly ethane rejection that's happening there. So most of that, you're seeing the ethane that's going to be going more towards like an MMBtu or selling that as a gas. And so that is a heavier barrel that you're seeing that we kind of show. But again, we have the market flexibility. We can show that barrel in Conway. We can also show that barrel in Mont Belvieu. So we can kind of are that flexibility to and look at those spreads. So getting kind of back to your question, I mean, really the quality and then the flexibility that we have with the multiple markets and it's in an area that's absolutely in demand as we."

            "content": "Thanks, Billy. This quarter, we are providing details on our continuous methane monitoring project, which is an example of the progress we're making in our emission reduction efforts. Over the last several years, our leak detection and repair program, or LDAR has advanced from sound, sight, smell surveys to surveys using more accurate optical gas imaging, to today's deployment of scalable solutions of the latest technology, continuous methane monitoring. This technology detects potential leaks and provides real-time alerts to help accelerate repairs and will provide data and trend analysis to potentially prevent future methane releases. We've been evaluating continuous methane monitoring technology for a few years. There are several third-party systems and technologies available to monitor and detect potential methane leaks, which use intermittent or continuous monitoring technology. About 18 months ago, we began a pilot project using a solution we built in-house named iSense, which is a fence-line monitoring solution that uses methane sensing technology to continuously monitor facilities and provide real-time alerts of potential leaks to a central control room. We tested iSense against monitoring solutions in use and available in the market today and confirmed that our sensor detected methane release events consistent with these third-party systems. The results from these tests confirmed that iSense is the most effective solution for EOG to use, to detect and accelerate leak repairs while also being scalable and economic. Like so many of our innovations, this technology is being spearheaded by our employees across the company. Since the pilot, our employees are rapidly deploying iSense in the field, prioritizing areas of highest potential impact. The initial installations are focused in the Delaware basin and currently cover about 60% of our production. We expect that most of the remaining Delaware basin production will be monitored by iSense by year-end. We'll continue to roll out iSense in other operating areas next year. Using our proprietary system allows us to own the data creation, flow and storage, which is a priority with all our information systems, owning the iSense data and retaining direct control of its collection provides invaluable flexibility to improve both data quality, as well as the tools to analyze and integrate iSense data with existing operational data from our production facilities. This data, along with our ability to monitor our operations for many of our four control rooms will enhance the 24/7 capability to continuously identify, prioritize and repair leaks. In the future, when data from iSense is paired with other real-time production data, we expect to be able to make improvements in the design of facilities to minimize releases. We're also optimistic that we will be able to more readily predict the likely size and source of a methane release. Leveraging technology to enhance our methane leak detection and repair program is another great example of EOG's culture of continuous improvement throughout all our operations. Our employees have embraced the company's a mission reduction efforts and I'm excited to see how EOG's culture of innovation and technology will continue to drive creative solutions. Now here's Jeff to discuss the progress we've made in our premium combo play in the Southern Powder River Basin. Yes. Neil, this is Ken. At this time we really have two-drilling or executive in the Dorado play. And just to give you a little bit of a background on it, since 2018 we've drilled and completed over 30 of our 1,250 premium locations, both in the Austin Chalk and the Eagle Ford and we've really made excellent progress on reducing well cost and enhancing our geologic understanding and increasing our well performance. We've increased our lateral length and we're really operationally being able to execute. As far as how 2023 goes, it's a little early to talk about the 2023 program yet. Obviously we'll remain disciplined with our investment there. First to make sure that the market needs the gas and second to make sure we're operationally getting better. We \u2013 one thing to keep in mind is we really don't need a lot of wells there to grow production significantly given the performance of the wells and their shallow decline rate."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Billy Helms",
            "content": "Thanks Ezra. We posted outstanding results in the second quarter. Our performance included exceeding the midpoints of our production guidance while capital expenditures and total per unit operating cost beat forecasted targets. So once again, more oil for less capital. I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication and persistence to execute and deliver such outstanding results. As we have guided to all year, our oil growth year-over-year will be about 4% to return our production to pre-COVID levels. Halfway through the year, we're on track to deliver that objective and have done so against a challenging supply chain backdrop. The upper price pressure on steel, fuel and labor continues due to ongoing supply constraints initiated by COVID and extended by the war in Ukraine. The impact of this has resulted in inflationary headwinds that have meaningfully exceeded our initial expectations earlier this year, making it increasingly challenging to maintain flat well cost. However, our employees continue to innovate and deliver efficiencies that offset a significant portion of this inflationary pressure. For example, in our Delaware Basin drilling operation, our down-hole drilling motor program is providing solid performance improvements, generating a 13% year-over-year increase in the foots drilled promoter run. The motor program and other improvements, are reducing drilling times versus last year. In the Eagle Ford, our drilling teams have improved the footage drilled per day by 11% versus last year, while also managing drilling parameters to reduce the cost of drilling fluids by 10%. In our completion operations, we had previously discussed the company's plans to increase the use of super-zipper completions, which are 40% faster than normal zipper operations. We have now utilized this technique on about 65% of EOG's completed wells year-to-date, which is yielding an 11% improvement in the lateral footage completed per day. Super-zipper completions combined with our focus on more efficient operational practices, has increased the amount of pumping hours per day by 24%. In addition, we continue to progress our self-sourced sand program and expect to further reduce sand cost in the second half of the year and extend those savings into 2023. All in all, we now expect our well cost to see a modest, single digit increase over last year. And most of this increase will be seen in the second half of the year. However, we're able to leverage our operational flexibility within our multi-basin portfolio, such that our capital and volume plan remains unchanged. Now turning to the macro backdrop, oil field service capacity remains extremely tight and is further constrained by the limited availability of materials and experienced labor, driving uncertainty in the cost of services, not only for this year, but also for 2023. These constraints are more concentrated in areas with the highest activities such as the Permian Basin. EOG's multi-basin portfolio provides us the flexibility to manage these constraints by optimizing activity between our multiple plays to maximize our return on investment. Just as in the past EOG will play to its strengths to mitigate where possible the inflationary pressure and operational constraints facing us. We're currently taking steps to secure services for next year, and we'll know more about the 2023 outlook next quarter. Regarding production growth, it's too early to discuss next year's plans with any degree of precision. However, it is important to recognize we will maintain our discipline. And as we see things today, would expect low, single digit oil growth similar to this year. On the natural gas side, we're excited about the results of our South Texas Dorado play and its ability to play an increasing role in supplying the growing demand of petrochemical and LNG markets along the Gulf Coast. As we allocate future capital based on returns, this play will command additional investment, not only to meet the growing demand, but also for infrastructure needed to capture the value chain from the wellhead to the market center. These investments not only generate healthy returns, but ultimately lead to lower well cost and lower long-term unit operating cost. We also expect to fund our emerging and promising exploration plays as we improve the company for the future. Now here is Ken to give you an update on our emissions reductions effort. Yes. Leo, this is Billy Helms. Yes, the small change in well count is really just a result of two things, one is timing. Some of the wells that were scheduled to complete at year-end are going to slip into the next year. It's just a timing thing. The other factor that plays into that is a change in working interest in some of our plays. We've had slightly lower working interest in some of our Delaware Basin wells in the second half of the year. Just to illustrate how minimal that is, that's only about a 2% average change in working interest across the year. So it's a very minuscule amount, but that explains the change in the well count. As far as the CapEx, we're very pleased, as you can tell from the comments we made about the ability of our teams to continue to innovate and drive efficiencies in our business to offset inflation. Inflation turns out to be just a little bit higher than we anticipated this year, so we are going to see a slight increase in our well cost as we go through especially the second half of the year, but we're still confident we're going to stay within our guidance and don't expect to face additional costs that will increase our budget. Yes, Arun, this is Billy. As far as capital allocation, as we see it today, there's a lot of factors play into that, of course, and it's early to say where we're going to be still we'll have quite a bit of activity in the Delaware Basin going forward. It is a premier play in the company, and certainly, that will continue to command quite a bit of capital. Eagle Ford has been, as you know, a performance engine for the company for the last decade or longer. And that will \u2013 and they're generating outstanding results. So that will still command capital. As we compare \u2013 we allocate capital based on returns and certainly, the encouragement we're seeing from Dorado and the activity there is showing us the ability to be able to continue to fund that program going forward. And then the confidence we have in the new emerging Powder River Basin gives us a sense that, that will also come in quite a bit of activity. So the ratios, I would say, are going to stay similar. As far as the Powder River Basin and our overall capital plan, that will depend on the outlook for commodities at that time, but the \u2013 what we're going to see in the Powder, just to be clear, is a shift of activity from some of their older traditional plays, the Turner and the Parkman to some of the deeper, more emerging plays and then Mowry more specifically and the Nio. So you'll see that shift. The amount of capital allocated to that play will also depend on just the commodity price outlook that we see for the year once we get closer to that. But overall, we're \u2013 the takeaway from that, I would think, would be that the flexibility we have with the multiple plays we have to chase to continue to add value long-term to the shareholders. Yes, Scott, this is Billy Helms. So for Trinidad, we've had, as you know, a long successful history of really maintaining pretty much flat production with minimal investment, and it generates quite a bit of cash for the company \u2013 cash flow for the company. So it's been a very successful project for multiple decades now. We still see exploration opportunities and are still counting on exploration success going forward just based on the things we see today. The small guide down in gas production, especially in the next, say, the rest of this year, is based on some turnaround projects we have on some of the compressor stations and platforms in the field. So it's just an operational issue really in the manifest in the third quarter mainly. So -- but as we start to drill some of these exploration wells, we still have confidence that production base will continue. Yes, that's right. Yes, Scott, this is Billy Helms, again. On the inflation question, I think I would distinguish a little bit there. I think we're recognizing the inflation that everybody else in the industry is seeing. We're able to combat that really through a lot of the efficiencies we drive through our business. And that's really a result of the culture we have of continuous improvement and the quality of the staff we have in each of our operating divisions. So now the contracting strategy has always been a long-term thing for EOG. We worked with our vendors, our partners on the service side. And our contracts are always a little bit staggered so that all the contracts don't roll off at the same time. That gives us a lot of flexibility to also manage the commodity cycles to make sure we have a consistent operating performance level going into the year. We always start about this time of year. So I wouldn't say we're starting any earlier than we typically do. I think we always started sometime here in the middle part of the year to start securing services for the next year as we see things play out. We take opportunities as we see those emerge to make arrangements with vendors and our service partners to secure those services in the upcoming year and that determines the level of services that we secure for next year's well cost. We typically like to think about securing about 50% to 60% of the well cost ahead of any given year. And that range depends on the opportunities we see with service partners to lock in those services. This year, we expect to be somewhat the same as we go into next year, but it -- we'll see as we get closer to the year-end, but that's how we see the inflation. Obviously, we expect with the tightness in the market, we're going to see some additional inflationary pressure going into next year. So just anticipating that, we could see another uptick in our well cost going into next year, but we expect to, again, moderate a lot of that with our efficiency gains. Yes, Neal, this is Billy. Certainly, on the self-source sand, you named one of the primary ones. It's a big part of our program. We've been doing that, as you might remember, for more than a decade. And what we've been able to do is find ways to get the source of the sand closer and closer to the wellhead, minimizing not only the cost of the product, but also the transportation involved in getting it to the wellhead. We are expanding that through the rest of the year such that we'll be able to continue to supply greater and greater amounts from our own self-sourced mines, so we're excited about the growth in that. Other areas that we self source, there's a number of them. I mentioned briefly in the prepared comments, a note to our efforts to take control of the drilling motors that we use in our drilling operation. That's a small thing maybe, but it's a big driver of performance when it comes to that part of the business. And we recognized that a couple of years ago, built up some expertise in our staff to address that. We worked specifically to not only design, but also build and oversee the maintenance of those motors that ultimately drives the improved performance and we're seeing great results from that program. And that's another differentiator in our drilling performance that allows us to continue to offset inflation. Some of the other things, as you know, we've been managing our tubular inventory for many, many years as well. we deal directly with the steel mills, which gives us a lot of advantages in the sense of having some clarity or some certainty on the market and kind of what that's indicating to get ahead of issues where we see it, take advantage of opportunities to secure those at lower cost and make sure that we have pipe for our programs on a go-forward basis. So those are maybe a couple of other things that would give you some color on what we're doing. Yes, Jeanine, this is Billy Helms. That particular acquisition is really just an opportunity we found to bolt-on some largely primarily acreage in some of our exploration plays, very little if no production on those plays. And it just is another way that we can continue to add and grow at a low cost our exploration opportunity set that we see in the future of the company."

Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chief Executive Officer; Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Jeff Leitzell, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor Relations. Here is Ezra. Yes. This is Tim. As far as the bond, that is 2023. It's in the first quarter of 2023 is when that will mature. We have no plans to pay it off early. As far as the collateral they run off kind of like the hedges that we've given you the timing of when those hedges are in our 10-Q. So it kind of runs off as that timing comes off. It all depends, of course, on where the strip goes, how that comes off. But right now, it's based on the strip, and that would be how it would come off, just as those run off. Sure. Paul, as far as the proposal we're in the process of reviewing that as is everyone else currently. But specifically looking at the minimum tax proposal, we do not see that is having any detriment to EOGs. We are a full taxpayer already, so as we model it currently, it will have no impact on EOG."

            "name": "Ezra Yacob",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday we declared a third special dividend for the year, demonstrating our commitment to deliver long-term shareholder value through our cash return strategy. The $1.50 dividend is supported by another outstanding quarter. We posted adjusted earnings of $2.74 per share and nearly $1.3 billion of free cash flow. So far this year, we have declared $4.30 per share of special dividends. Combined with our peer-leading annualized regular dividend of $3 per share, we are on pace to pay out a minimum of 60% of annual free cash flow. What continues to differentiate EOG is our people and our assets. We have cultivated an inventory of premium and double premium wells that provide a 20-year runway for the company through our focus on organic exploration, supported by a decentralized organizational structure. Our multi-basin portfolio is predominantly the result of having seven North American and one international cross-functional exploration teams that work independently, but collaborate on shared learnings. Our role here in Houston beyond capital allocation is to facilitate those shared learnings across all eight teams. The result is a robust exploration pipeline that continues to both improve the quality of and expand our more than 20-year inventory of premium and double premium wells. Our portfolio includes the Delaware Basin, which remains the largest area of activity in the company and is delivering exceptional returns. After more than a decade of high return drilling, our Eagle Ford asset continues to deliver top tier results while operating at a steady pace. And our emerging South Texas Dorado dry natural gas play and Powder River Basin Mowry and Niobrara combo plays are contributing to EOG's success today and laying the groundwork for years of future high return investment. In addition, we have tested our Mowry and Niobrara plays in the northern Powder River Basin. Our initial results have demonstrated the untapped potential of this oilier part of the basin as a compliment to the outstanding performance in the southern part of the basin. EOG's current multi-basin portfolio, offering exposure to both geographic and product diversity alongside several other prospects in our exploration pipeline will continue to expand EOG's premium inventory and provide through the cycle value creation. Disciplined reinvestment within any given play depends on where we are in the development life cycle of that play. Our multi-basin and portfolio of high return assets, all competitive against our premium hurdle rate, provides invaluable flexibility to invest at the pace that allows each play to get better. It also allows us to plan around basin level market dynamics, impacting services and infrastructure to minimize inflation and bottlenecks. We are able to optimize reinvestment across our total portfolio to add reserves at low refining costs, lower the overall cost base of the company, and continue to improve EOG's company-wide capital efficiency. This quarter, we are highlighting, iSense, our continuous methane monitoring system that we piloted in the Delaware Basin and are now deploying in our most active development areas. iSense is yet another example of how EOG's decentralized model, not only fosters innovation across eight teams, but also compounds the impact of innovation by taking ideas born in one operating area and expanding them across multiple basins. From the latest information technology-driven solutions to reduce emissions, to innovation focused on drilling and completions operations, to procurement of casing and sand EOG is unique in its ability to leverage its culture and operating structure to get incrementally better every year. The tremendous inventory and cost improvements we have made over the last several years, provides high confidence in the low breakevens and operational flexibility of our business. This confidence in our business, along with the strength of our industry-leading balance sheet, [indiscernible] this quarter to terminate a significant portion of our oil and natural gas hedges. Going forward, we expect to hedge significantly less than the 20% to 30% of volumes we typically hedged in prior years. The current operating environment is challenging given the volatility of commodity prices and inflation headwinds. Through it all our employees have remained focused on execution and have improved the business. Our second quarter performance is proof of that. We delivered more oil for less capital and in the face of a unique inflationary environment, our forecast for capital expenditure this year remains unchanged. EOG's, consistent execution, low cost structure, reduced hedge position and transparent cash return strategy based on a regular dividend that we have never suspended or cut that has grown 21 of the last 24 years and is now competitive with the broader market, puts EOG in its strongest position ever to deliver significant value to shareholders through the cycle. Here is Billy with an operational update and early look at 2023. Thanks, Lance. We believe EOG is differentiated for the following reasons. We have a diverse portfolio of assets across multiple basins providing geographic and product diversity. We are a reliable and consistent high performing operator. We have among the lowest cost structures. We are committed to sustainability. We maintain an exceptional balance sheet. Our cash return strategy is transparent. Our regular dividend is competitive with the broader market. And finally, the EOG culture is one of a kind and it's at the core of our differentiated performance. We believe there are only a handful of North American E&P companies that have the asset quality, the size, the scale to compete globally on oil and gas cost of supply. And on top of that, produce the barrels with a lower environmental footprint. In the future, those are the companies that the world is going to want to deliver additional barrels. And we firmly believe that EOG is a leader in that group of North American E&Ps. Thanks for listening. We'll now go to Q&A. Yes, Leo, this is Ezra. I appreciate your question. Really, what we've always talked about is that our growth is really the output of our ability to generate high returns from a disciplined reinvestment strategy. And that's really what we've tried to describe today is as you pointed out, first of all, it is early to talk about 2023. But ultimately, we're committed to remaining disciplined. We want to focus investment in each of our assets at a level where they can continue to improve every year. Directionally, as we see it today, how the supply and demand balances look, the constraints on services, the associated inflationary pressures, oil growth will likely be similar to this year. And as Billy highlighted, we'd expect to direct additional investment towards our Dorado natural gas play based on the positive results that we're seeing there. Yes, Scott, this is Ezra. Just a little bit of color on that. Obviously, the Board decides the dividend each quarter. They review our business needs, the macro environment, the cash position, so on and so forth. And as you said, the $1.50 per share special this quarter, which brings the total dividend commitment to right at $7.30 per share is on pace to achieve the minimum of a 60% free cash flow return. And I think that's the emphasis on there is that the 60% is a minimum. Ultimately, it's up to the Board, like I said, to return additional cash in 2022. The way to think about those early terminations of the hedges is really a reflection, I think, of our confidence in improving the financial profile of the company. Our ability to navigate inflationary pressures this year flexibility to allocate capital across multiple resource plays, which are each delivering exceptional returns and really our ability to continue to lower the cost base of the company. These are all things that deliver expanded free cash flow opportunities for EOG. Yes, Neal, this is Ezra. Thank you for the question. Basically, we evaluate a buyback just like any other investment decision. And really, what we do is we look to see how it's going to create long-term shareholder value. And as you highlighted and as we've discussed previously, the $5 billion share repurchase authorization that we have in place, we've talked about using it opportunistically. And what that means for us is using it during times of what we would say are significant dislocations in the market. And that's as opposed to a more programmatic system. And quite frankly, this year, during Q2, we didn't really see a what we would say was a significant dislocation. We definitely witnessed a lot of volatility, I think, rather than a dislocation. The volatility was due -- is driven by changes to the oil inventories that we saw that was really due to the SPR releases. We saw some concern over demand destruction associated with the inflationary pressures across the broad market. We saw some potential for weaker demand associated with the uptick of COVID cases. But ultimately, in our view, these are all kind of short-term events that really don't change the fundamental supply and demand picture. Yes, Doug, we haven't released that and we did remove the breakeven slide from earlier this year, because of the significant change in gas prices that have gone on in the first six months of the year. The best thing I can point to is the fact that we continue to bring on lower-cost reserves, basically focused on the premium and double premium wells into the cost base of the company. You can look at the reduction in our unit costs and the reduction in our DD&A rate year-over-year to kind of infer the reduction in our breakevens. Yes, Doug. The first thing I would say is that, that's right, I think it's stating the obvious that that I feel that our stock is undervalued right now. But again we look at that buyback and investment in that buyback we compare it against other opportunities in the business to create shareholder value \u2013 long-term shareholder value. And when we do that, when we compare it versus reinvesting in the business drilling these double premium, these premium wells at a 30% and a 60% direct after tax rate return based on $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. It's a very, very high hurdle. So when we think about what can create longer term value for the shareholder, we see the benefit of reinvesting in the business, driving down our long-term well cost, lowering the break evens as we talked about has a very, very competitive portion of allocation. Now with regards on the transitory nature comparison with the transferring nature of a special dividend, I think again it goes back to the way that we look at the buyback with regard to our shareholders. Buying repurchasing shares during a volatile movement in the stock price, I think our shareholders prefer to have the assurity of special dividends coming back to them as opposed to us trying to time the volatility in the markets. Now that's different from what \u2013 again, I would go back to what we call a significant market dislocation, where I think though you'd have an opportunity there that would compete very favorably to create long-term shareholder value. Thank you. Thank you, Paul. This is Ezra. Let me attack that first question on the Eagle Ford and then I'll hand it over to Tim Driggers to give some feedback on the tax law proposals. So on the A&D market there in the Eagle Ford, yes, let me \u2013 let me clarify how we're viewing the Eagle Ford right now. We're on pace to deliver for the second year in the row, basically record rates have return and record finding costs in our drilling program there. And the big thing that it comes to is it kind of fits back into some of my opening comments talking about the right investment rate for plays at different life cycles. So clearly our Eagle Ford position has reached a point where it's not a main focus area for growth anymore, but what we see is a very, very long runway of exceptional returns on those wells as you were reinvesting them assuming that we're moving at the right pace, where our team has the ability to execute on lowering costs, increasing incrementally the well productivity. As far as expanding our footprint there, we still have a very robust Eagle Ford inventory position. When I think about the Eagle Ford position we've talked about 7,000 locations and being approximately halfway drilled through those locations. So still well over 10 years worth of inventory to drill on. The other thing about looking to do A&D in an established basin like that is just going to be the cost of acquisition. We primarily focus our exploration efforts and we always have for the two decades that we've been involved in unconventional resources on organic or Greenfield lease acquisitions because that low cost of entry is critically important to providing through cycle value to the shareholders. Those \u2013 the PDP value that you would have to pay for in an established area, or just established acreage prices. Those things stay with you on your books forever. It raises the cost base of the company and is really antithesis to what we've been trying to do over the last few years by shifting to premium and now double premium drilling. Tim, would you like to please comment on the tax proposals? Jeanine, thanks for the question. Good question too as timely. The exports especially for crude oil has been an important component of our marketing strategy, but when you really look just from an industry standpoint too, I mean, refiners in the U.S. are not expanding. I mean, if anything it's degrading, right? I mean, we're seeing our market share; you're seeing refineries shutting down. You're seeing refiners that are being repurposed and so we had a view going all the way back to 2018 that we wanted to have a significant export position that we could access from multiple plays. And I know one of your questions there was just, how do we think about the Delaware Basin? Or how do we think about the Eagle Ford? And you're exactly right, that was all in our contracting that we wanted to be able to have a large position that we could access from both of those plays. So if you think about it today, we have that 250,000 and yes, that facility is expandable. But we have 5 million barrels of storage. I mean, we can segregate WTL, WTI; we can segregate our Eagle Ford. I mean, we are in a premier position as we think about from a low cost and being in early with our tankage position and then also with the capacity that we have out of the Delaware Basin from a transport position and also from the Eagle Ford. So what I would say is we can \u2013 we can transact very quickly. We have tankage that's in place, and so if we feel the need that we needed to push more across, that's absolutely something that we could do. Yes. We want to thank everyone for participating in the call this morning and thanks to our shareholders for their continued support. We especially want to recognize our employees for their performance this quarter. Our discussion today highlights their focus on making EOG a low cost operator, generating high returns and lowering our environmental footprint each and every year. Thank you."

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir.\nTim Driggers: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG\u2019s SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliations schedules for these non-GAAP measures can be found on the EOG\u2019s website. This conference call also include estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC\u2019s reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chief Executive Officer; Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration & Production; Jeff Leitzell, EVP, Exploration & Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor & Public Relations. Here\u2019s Ezra.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG\u2019s cash return strategy demonstrates our commitment to deliver long-term shareholder value. Yesterday, we declared a second special dividend for the year of $1.80 per share following last quarter\u2019s $1 per share. Combined with our peer-leading annualized regular dividend of $3 per share year-to-date, we have announced $3.4 billion in cash return to shareholders in 2022. EOG has a strong history of cash return. Since we began trading as an independent company in 1999, we have delivered a sustainable growing regular dividend. It has never been cut or suspended and its 23-year compound annual growth rate is 22%. Since the transition to premium drilling in 2016, our dividend compound annual growth rate has been even higher at 28% including doubling our dividend last year. Today, our regular dividend not only leads our E&P peer group. It is more than competitive across all sectors of the market. More recently, we have supplemented our regular dividend with significant special dividends, reflecting our commitment to both capital discipline and returning cash to shareholders. While we are proud of our cash return track record, we acknowledge shareholders desire for more transparency and predictability. To provide both, we recently formalized and yesterday announced our cash return commitment of returning a minimum of 60% of annual free cash flow. Going forward, our intention is to evaluate and pay the regular dividend and consider options for additional cash return every quarter. The addition of quantitative guidance to our cash return framework reflects our confidence in our business. The pandemic driven volatility in the oil and gas market is stabilizing. However, the macro environment continues to evolve with the war in Ukraine and other geopolitical events. We have proven to ourselves over the last several years that our business is resilient through the cycle, including unprecedented shocks to the industry. Credit for EOG\u2019s resilience for the steady improvement in our ability to generate free cash flow in any environment and the ability to make this free cash flow commitment to our shareholders goes to our employees who embrace our premium return hurdle rate six years ago, which requires that all investments are in a minimum of 30% direct after tax rate of return using a $40 flat oil and $2.50 flat natural gas price. Last year, we doubled the minimum return to 60%, both the premium and now double premium hurdle rates have positioned the company to have an outstanding year in 2022. In spite of the ongoing inflationary and supply chain issues facing our industry, our employees outperformed during the first quarter and are positioned to deliver on our annual capital and volumes plan. We have decades of low cost, high return inventory that support the consistent financial performance that our shareholders have come to expect and that drives long-term value. Our inventory spans multiple assets across oil, combo and dry natural gas basins throughout the country, which enables us to pursue the highest net backs by diversifying both our investment and sales market options. We also continue to explore. A year and a half ago, we announced Dorado a premium dry natural gas play, where we\u2019ve captured 21 Tcf of resource potential net to EOG. In a moment, Ken will update you on the progress we\u2019ve made on well performance and well costs and what we believe is the lowest cost and lowest emission source of natural gas onshore U.S. Our organic exploration program has grown our premium inventory by more than 3.5 times since the premium metric was introduced in 2016. So our exploration program isn\u2019t focused on adding more. We are looking for better inventory. New plays like Dorado and the potential we see in our current exploration pipeline gives us confidence we will continue to grow and improve our double premium inventory in the future as we have done in the past. While we have earmarked and committed to return a minimum of 60% of annual free cash flow, our longstanding framework and priorities for total free cash flow are unchanged, a sustainable growing regular dividend, a pristine balance sheet, additional cash return to shareholders through special dividends and opportunistic stock buybacks and low cost property bolt-ons. Sustaining and growing the regular dividend remains our highest priority and reflects our confidence in the long-term performance of the company. A pristine balance sheet is a strategic advantage functioning as a shock absorber that also provides the flexibility to exercise a buyback when the opportunity arises and to take advantage of other counter cyclical investments. Additional cash returns through special dividends and buybacks complement our other priorities and together with our free cash minimum return guidance support our goal to create significant long-term shareholder value. Now, here\u2019s Tim to review our financial position.\nTim Driggers: Thanks, Ezra. Our ability to refine our longstanding cash return framework by providing quantitative guidance is made possible by EOG\u2019s outstanding operational and financial performance. In the first quarter, EOG earned $2.3 billion after adjusting items or $4 per share. We generated $2.3 billion of free cash flow. Capital expenditures of $1 billion were near the low end of the guidance range, while production volumes and total per unit cash operating costs finished better than targets. Our confidence is further bolstered because we finished the quarter in an incredibly strong financial position. Total debt on March 31 was $5.1 billion. This includes the current portion of debt of $1.25 billion, reflecting the bond matures in March 2023, that we intend to pay off with cash on hand. Cash on March 31 was $4 billion for a net debt of $1.1 billion. This yield\u2019s a debt to total capitalization ratio of 4.8%. The $4 billion cash balance excludes $2.4 billion of collateral for hedges held by our counterparties. The amount of collateral fluctuates with oil and natural gas prices. These short-term timing differences in cash flows are not considered in our calculation of free cash flow and do not influence our decision on the timing or amount of cash return to shareholders. To that end, EOG has declared special dividends so far this year totaling $2.80 per share on top of the regular dividend of $3 per share on an annual basis, totaling $3.4 billion. Our objective in establishing our cash return guidance was to make it simple, yet dynamic so that it is easily communicated and understood while remaining suitable under a range of commodity price scenarios. The actual amount of cash return each year is a product of our long standing free cash flow priorities. These have not changed. The size of our regular dividend is now the largest of our E&P peers and the strength of our balance sheet supports our ability to return a large portion of free cash flow back to shareholders going forward under a range of scenarios. The $1.80 special dividend declared yesterday, along with $0.75 regular quarterly dividend demonstrate significant progress toward our commitment to returning at least 60% of our 2022 free cash flow to our shareholders. Subject to commodity prices, the amount of free cash flow available and the Board\u2019s discretion, our intention is to return cash through special dividends or stock buybacks on a quarterly basis going forward. Here\u2019s Billy.\nBilly Helms: Thanks, Tim. We\u2019ve had a great start to the year. Our first quarter volume, capital expenditure and total per unit cash operating cost performance exceeded our forecasted targets. We\u2019re also pleased with our progress to-date, offsetting inflation and managing well cost. Our drilling teams continue to reduce drilling days and generate consistent performance improvements. Use of self-sourced downhole tools as well as minimizing downtime and mud losses remain areas of focus to improve performance. For example, drilling times in our Eagle Ford oil play continue to improve, decreasing 28% in the last five years. The average well is now drilled in less than five days. On the completion side, we have increased the amount of treated lateral per day by about 10% over the last year, as we further deploy the super zipper technique. We are now using this technique on more than half of the wells completed in the company and expect to increase its use further as we progress through the year. In addition, our self-sourced sand program is providing a tremendous advantage that we expect to further offset additional inflation throughout the year. When we establish our plan at the beginning of the year, we knew the unusually tight supply constraints initially sparked by the economic recovery from the pandemic would present a unique challenge. Taking these headwinds into account, this year\u2019s plan was devised with known efficiency improvements that would maintain well cost flat with last year. While we have since seen increased steel and fuel prices directly associated with the war in Ukraine, we are confident we can still deliver on the CapEx and volume targets in our original plan. Rather than accept inflation as a given, our employees remain proactive. We have a track record of lowering cost and developing efficiencies through periods of economic expansion and other drivers of inflation. Our operating teams are ever more diligent in their quest to identify new areas of performance enhancements that will lower well cost. EOG\u2019s advantage lies with our people and our culture. Today\u2019s challenges are met with innovation and value creation in the field through our multi-basin decentralized approach. This period of inflationary fuel prices is a primary driver of the 2% increase in our full year per unit cash operating costs versus our previous guidance. However, higher commodity prices also present an opportune time to enhance our workover program, which will be reflected in LOE expense. These additional workovers bring on low cost production that pay out within weeks and increase the long-term performance of our assets. All in all, we\u2019re thoughtfully managing our assets to offset a small effect from inflation. While we have flexibility to adjust our plan in any given year to respond to unique or extreme marketing conditions such as the pandemic in 2020, our capital plan is thoughtfully planned across all our assets to support the pace of operations that is optimal for each individual asset to continue to improve. We believe we have the best people, assets, and plan to mitigate any headwinds and continue to improve the company for the long term. Here\u2019s Ken to discuss the incredible improvements we made in our premium gas play, Dorado.\nKen Boedeker: Thanks, Billy. A year and a half ago, we announced a major new natural gas discovery in South Texas. We named Dorado. It\u2019s a dry gas play with 21 Tcf of resource potential net EOG across stacked pays in the Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford formations. Our break even cost in Dorado is less than $1.25 per Mcf, which we believe represents the lowest cost of supply of natural gas in the United States. Dorado was the most recent double premium play to emerge from our organic exploration program. We began technical work on Dorado back in 2016, captured a large acreage position in the core of the play as a first mover during 2017 and 2018 and drill test wells in late 2018 and 2019. After pausing during the downturn in 2020, we moved Dorado into active development last year and completed 11 net wells. This year, we anticipate completing 30 net wells, nearly tripling activity. Since last year, we have doubled our production rate out of Dorado producing 140 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter of 2022. We are leveraging our proprietary knowledge built from prior plays to move quickly down the cost curve as we increase activity at a pace that allows us to incorporate learnings and savings. We completed seven net wells during the first quarter of 2022, while keeping well cost flat compared to similar designs in the first quarter of last year successfully offsetting inflation. Since our first well was drilled in 2018, we have reduced well cost over 35% and our approaching our target well cost faster than we anticipated. In addition, well performance is improving. Productivity from recent wells is significantly beating our initial forecast, refined completion techniques, and a focus on targeting have increased our performance projections on a per foot basis. This year, we have also moved to longer lateral switch combined with the improvements to per foot productivity have resulted in an 80% higher two-year cumulative production volume that our 2018 wells compounding our capital efficiency. Our preliminary plan for the play was to focus initial development on the Austin Chalk formation, and then follow that with development of the Eagle Ford. So it would benefit from well cost reductions as well as water and gas gathering infrastructure installed for the Austin Chalk. With the dramatic improvements to our Eagle Ford formation well results, we now expect to co-develop it with the Austin Chalk, which will provide additional opportunities to lower costs through scale and simultaneous operations. As a dry gas play in close proximity to multiple markets, we expect Dorado\u2019s gas will have a lower emissions footprint compared to other onshore gas supplies in the U.S. In addition, we continue to leverage company-wide expertise to build out an operationally efficient and low emissions field. As we expand development of Dorado into a core asset, it will contribute to lowering EOG\u2019s companywide emissions intensity rate. Combined with EOG\u2019s low operating costs and advantaged market position located close to several major sales hubs in South Texas, including access to pipelines to Mexico and several LNG export terminals, Dorado is in an ideal position to supply low cost, low emissions natural gas into markets with long-term growth potential. Now next up is Ezra for concluding remarks.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks Ken. I\u2019d like to note the following important takeaways from the call today. First, formalizing our cash return strategy demonstrates our commitment to our free cash flow priorities that along with high return discipline reinvestment offers significant long-term shareholder value. Second, EOG is realizing another tremendous year of improvement. We are set to deliver outstanding returns while demonstrating capital discipline within an inflationary environment, delivering on both volumes and capital as announced at the beginning of 2022. Third, our most recent organic exploration announcement Dorado has positioned us with over 20 Tcf of low cost natural gas with access to multiple markets. Our progress in Dorado is on pace to make this North America\u2019s lowest cost of supply. Thanks for listening. Now, we\u2019ll go to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug, your line is open.\nDoug Leggate: Well, thank you. Good morning, everybody. And Ezra I think I speak for everybody in saying we\u2019re delighted to see the framework you\u2019ve introduced for cash returns. I do have a question around this, however, and it is \u2013 I\u2019m just curious what\u2019s changed to move you in that direction? And I wonder if I could ask you to \u2013 you\u2019re obviously talking about percentage in free cash flow. So I wonder if you could frame some similar parameters around how you think about reinvestment rates or the planning assumptions that go around that so we can get some kind of idea as to what free cash flow ultimately looks like versus the level of spending if you see my point.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Doug. I sure do. So let me start with the \u2013 what is now, why now, and simply we feel that this is the right time for our business to come out with the additional guidance. We\u2019ve got the regular dividend increase to be competitive with the broad market. We\u2019ve got the balance sheets in a very strong position. And we\u2019re basically emerging stronger from the downturn and confident that we can deliver this minimum amount of cash return going forward. It\u2019s consistent with our long-term free cash flow priorities. So it\u2019s not really a change in strategy. In fact, in 2021, we returned about 49% of free cash flow and we paid off a $750 million bond. So when you combine those that was about 60%. And so it\u2019s a range internally we\u2019ve discussed and the announcement really just provides a bit of transparency. Now on the second part of your question with regards to how do you think about, how are we thinking about the reinvestment growth and to get to free cash flow. One thing, one reason we have given this guidance as a minimum of 60% return on free cash flow is because it\u2019s a guide that can be consistent and long term in nature through the cycle, like how we manage the business basing the guide off of a free cash flow, puts us in what we feel is the best overall position to create shareholder value through the cycle. So nothing\u2019s really changed in the reinvestment strategy. It\u2019s first, always based on returns and our ability to get better each year. There\u2019s \u2013 as we\u2019ve said in the past, there\u2019s no reason to invest in growth if you\u2019re not generating high returns and you\u2019re not doing it with an ability to improve the underlying business year after year. And what that means is, not chasing free cash flow, just because of high prices, if you\u2019re investing in something that\u2019s eroding the business long term. So you can take today, for example we could increase activity today into these high prices, but in the inflationary environment that\u2019s going to erode our capital efficiency. And then the second piece that we\u2019ve talked about as far as reinvestment our growth is based on the macro environment and market fundamentals. Does the market really need the barrels? What\u2019s supporting the global supply and demand fundamentals? Ultimately, investing in premium and double premium as you know, has made a somewhat price agnostic basing those decisions on $40 oil and 2.50 natural gas. And so it\u2019s really the capital discipline comes down to what can we do? And are we investing in a pace where each of our assets can get better year after year and ultimately improve the overall returns and company profile?\nDoug Leggate: I appreciate the answer, Ezra. As I said, we all welcome by what you\u2019ve done. So thank you for that. My follow-up is hopefully a quick one. So some years ago, you guys pivoted away from natural gas, Dorado, obviously, the exception today. But you also took a light off of a lot of your legacy gas assets. The world has obviously changed. So I\u2019m just wondering within the company, is there any effort or I guess, initiative to pivot back to some of those legacies \u2013 some of the legacy gas assets that are obviously still in your portfolio in light of what\u2019s going on as it relates to LNG expansion longer-term. I leave it there. Thank you.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Doug. As you said, the world\u2019s changed a lot and the company\u2019s changed quite a bit. The biggest thing for us is that introduction of the premium and now double premium reinvestment hurdle rates. So all of our gas assets now are judged and it\u2019s $2.50, flat natural gas price for the life of the well, and that really high grades our reinvestment opportunities into any of our assets, but especially the natural gas ones as we\u2019re talking about right now. Ultimately what we see with Dorado is that we\u2019ve captured a very significant resource geographically in the best spot. We think onshore U.S. with access to multiple markets. And we\u2019re very excited about being able to focus in on really that asset that we have. We think it\u2019s going to be the premier asset in North American natural gas.\nDoug Leggate: [Crushing] (ph) for sure. Thanks for taking my question. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles, your line is open.\nCharles Meade: Good morning, Ezra, and to the whole EOG team there. Ezra, kind of picking up on the point you just made. I\u2019m curious does - I get that you evaluate all your projects at 40 and 2.50, and that services the best oil projects and best gas projects. But is there any concern or discussion inside EOG that maybe evaluating projects that something so far below the strip is actually giving you a suboptimal relative ranking across oil and gas assets?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Charles. The way we look at it is we\u2019ve been fortunate. We\u2019ve been in unconventional North American exploration here for nearly two decades honestly, and what that\u2019s allowed us to do is put together a multi basin portfolio of what we think is really the deepest and highest quality asset inventory. When we switched to premium, it was really taking a long-term look at that $40 price, $2.50 natural gas price to not only help the immediate returns, the rate of return, the IRRs upfront, but really thinking about longer term through the cycles. What does it mean to really build a company where based on a commodity price, you can still be successful and create value through the cycles. Ratcheting that up to double premium in 2020 was really a reflection of our ability to have grown our premium inventory three and a half times through organic exploration since 2016. So actually I think the focus on double premium drilling and that reinvestment hurdle rate actually provides us with an optimal way to rank our assets.\nCharles Meade: Okay, thank you for that insight. And perhaps going back to Dorado, I caught during the prepared comments that I think that the two-year cum is 80% higher than your 2018 case and part of that is longer laterals. And I think that the base was the kind the 2018 case was 9,000 foot lateral. So is, am I making, am I in the right ballpark to thinking that if 80% higher, two year cum, some of that\u2019s longer laterals, so we\u2019re looking at maybe 40% or 50% higher productivity per lateral foot in the Dorado play versus the earlier case?\nKen Boedeker: Yes, Charles. This is Ken. We haven\u2019t really given out a number on how much higher the productivity is. If we look back to those 2018 wells, they were shorter laterals in the 6,000 to 7,000 foot range. We\u2019ve now have some extended laterals even past our original 9,000 foot range that we thought we\u2019d get. And those things both the improved performance and the lower cost have really driven that finding cost down to almost the $0.40 target that we\u2019re showing on Slide 11 there.\nCharles Meade: Yes. But no, you don\u2019t care to offer any comments on the productivity per lateral foot, I guess, and that\u2019s fine. Thank you.\nKen Boedeker: I guess Charles, just what I would say is, it is \u2013 our wells are beating our type curves that we have and those type curves do have a fairly low decline over the first several months of production. So we are seeing them beating our type curves. And if you look at it, we\u2019ve really only drilled 30 of our 1,250 wells in that place. So we\u2019re continuing to learn.\nCharles Meade: Thank you, Ken.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nArun Jayaram: Yes. Good morning. My first question is just on the supply chain, you guys are holding the line on CapEx. A number of your peers have raised CapEx expectations. So I was wondering if you could comment what\u2019s unique about the way you\u2019re managing the supply chain to give you confidence on delivering the $4.5 billion CapEx budget, and do some of these supply chain headwinds we\u2019re seeing within the industry. How does that influence your thoughts about 2023 given shortages of OFS equipment labor and just broader \u2013 just challenges on things like OCTG?\nBilly Helms: Yes, Arun. This is Billy. Let me start by providing maybe an overview of how we\u2019re managing the year\u2019s capital program. Then I\u2019d like to get Jeff to add some color and then I\u2019ll circle back to 2023. Let me first start by saying that we kind of look at each year the same way. As you know, we would \u2013 I would tend to bucket this in maybe three or four different areas. One, we self source a lot of materials that insulates this from a lot of the supply chain issues, we also do a lot of innovation in efficiency gains. The third bucket might be the pace of the adoption of these new efficiencies across the company. And then may be finally flexibility with our multi-basin approach. So just to elaborate on that a little bit more, at the beginning of the year, we constructed our plant, certainly recognizing the inflation we saw from the recovery of post-COVID. And we were confident in looking at that, we could offset inflation and maintain flat well cost. What we didn\u2019t anticipate was the war in Ukraine and that additional pressure and increased inflation we saw in commodities such as fuel and steel, but we\u2019re still working to offset this additional inflation through our efficiencies and new innovations. These improvements in efficiency gains are certainly happening, largely in the areas where we have the most activities such as Delaware basin and Eagle Ford. But I would also say that the pace of the adoption of these new technologies, the rapid adoption of the super zipper technology across the company is happening faster than we expected. So we also have the advantage of being in multiple basins. So that gives us a lot of flexibility to shift activity between areas. So we\u2019re very comfortable that we can maintain our plan, delivering our original volumes and within our stated CapEx goals, we laid out the start of the year. So with that, maybe I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff to give you some more details.\nJeff Leitzell: Yes, good morning, Arun. This is Jeff Leitzell. So as Billy stated, our ability to counter these inflationary pressures and some of the supply chain constraints that you talked about, it\u2019s really just a huge credit to our team\u2019s operational execution, their innovative culture and really continuing to improve on the efficiencies. So just to give you a little bit of color and some examples, start off with our drilling operations, our teams continue to increase their efficiencies and that\u2019s primarily with EOG\u2019s in-house motor program and our proprietary bit cutter development, which we can kind of design both of these uniquely around all the formations we drill in each of our plays. And our Eagle Ford operations, they\u2019re just a perfect example of this. We\u2019ve increased the drilled footage per day by over 17% this year. And this is one of our more mature plays that we\u2019ve been drilling in for 13 years. So really to EOG, no matter how far along we are in development, there\u2019s always improvements that can be made. And then on the same topic there with the Eagle Ford, they\u2019ve just done an outstanding job of reducing their drilling fluid costs also, even as diesel prices have risen and that\u2019s primary base in those fluids. We\u2019ve done this by optimizing the density and the additives and the drilling fluid in each area, really to try to reduce those fluid losses, which has resulted in a per barrel savings of about 20% so far in 2022. And then just a couple more basic examples in completions, our field team, they continue to see really good improvements there and they\u2019ve increased their overall completed lateral per foot per day by 10% compared to 2021 for the total company. And as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, one of the main drivers in this is really our continued implementation of super zipper operations. So we talked about last year, we were about a third of our activity with super zipper and this year we had a goal of trying to get to 60%. And we\u2019re just about there right now. So this is really significant because pretty much every additional well that we super zipper, we realize the savings of up to $300,000 per well or that equates to about 5% of the total well cost. So another kind of new process on the innovation side that we\u2019ve been implementing and testing is something called continuous frac pumping operations. So just a little bit of a rundown, typically in any completion operations, you have some unplanned maintenance and in order to be proactive, our field teams have started planning some of that scheduled maintenance periods of about three to four hours every three days. And what this has helped us do is really minimize any of that unplanned maintenance and really greatly \u2013 increase our overall efficiencies. So in the past quarter, really primarily in the Eagle Ford, we\u2019ve started some testing in the Delaware basin, but we\u2019ve been able to increase our completed lateral per foot per day by roughly 30%. So that\u2019s really just a huge time in cost savings there. And what we plan on doing is we optimize this process, we\u2019ll continue to roll it out to all of our operating areas. And then lastly more on the supply chain and material side of things, I just wanted to touch on a couple of our savings from the water and the sand cost side of things. In the Delaware basin, our team continues to reduce their water costs by optimizing the reuse process, which right now is approximately 90% of all their sourced water. And they\u2019re really doing this just through increasing the automation of all of our infrastructure and reducing the overall treatment cost per barrel, which we realized about a 9% reduction in each barrel of reuse water for 2022. And this is pretty significant, not just for CapEx, but also on the operating expense because every barrel we\u2019re allowed to reuse, is one less that we have to dispose of. And then finally here, over on the sand logistics side, EOG, we\u2019ve been in the sand business in self sourcing for about 15 years now. And we continue to reduce those costs across the company. For example, out in the Delaware basin, we continue to advance our abilities to get that sand closer to the wellhead and ultimately reduce the amount of trucking needed. And plans are, we\u2019re going to open up a second plant in the second half of next year. And we really anticipate to see some pretty good savings from Q1 through the rest of the year of about 20% per pound. So these are just a few of the many examples of how our operations teams just performing and really giving us great confidence that we\u2019ll be able to counter a lot of these inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints through 2022. And as Billy will talk about here 2023.\nBilly Helms: Yes, Arun, just to summarize maybe I know that\u2019s a lot of detail for you but obviously, we\u2019re very proud of the efforts of our employees to continue to fight against the rising well cost in this period of inflation. As we move into 2023, it\u2019s really early to talk about specifics about next year, but let me just kind of give you an overall impression of how we think about going into any year. Certainly we have a long history of managing through inflation to maintain or lower well cost that gives us confidence to be able to meet our goals. And we have two fundamental things that we think about. One is our contracting strategy and how we approach that is for example, this year is just a reminder. We have about 50% of our well cost secured with contracts, with service providers that provide about 90% of our drilling fleet. And about 60% of our frac fleet locked up under existing contracts. Not all of those service contracts are set to expire at the end of this year. So we try to stagger those as we go through a year to make sure that we have some continuity going into the preceding year. And then the lastly would be, as Jeff mentioned there, innovation and efficiency improvements. So we are already confident. We\u2019re seeing ideas that we can continue to push and explore to continue to reduce cost and offset inflation going into next year. So we\u2019re always chasing those kind of things. I know that\u2019s a lot of color, but it\u2019s certainly something that we\u2019re very proud of our employees and their efforts, and just want to make sure you fully understand it.\nArun Jayaram: Yes, appreciate the detail, Billy. My follow up is \u2013 maybe for Ezra or Tim, you guys have now committed to a 60% minimum return of free cash flow kind of framework. I wanted to get your thoughts on the other 40% bucket and what the priorities are between the balance sheet additional cash return and the bolt-ons. I know last quarter, Tim did message EOG\u2019s intention to build more cash on the balance sheet for countercyclical opportunities at other points in the cycle. So I wanted to \u2013 if you could give us some updated thoughts on that?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Arun. This is Ezra. I can start right there with where you left off, pardon me, let me say that. We\u2019re just thrilled to be in a unique position here to be able to strengthen the balance sheet and return $2.4 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2022. But ultimately, with the remaining 40%, it comes back to the fact that we\u2019re committed to delivering on our free cash flow priorities and doing the right thing at the right time to maximize long-term shareholder value. And it does include that balance sheet. And some of the things with the balance sheet we\u2019ve discussed in the past is, to have cash available just for running the business for operations to have cash for the small bolt-on acquisitions. As you mentioned to have cash available for the $5 billion stock repurchase authorization, which we\u2019ve said, we prefer to look at that as an opportunistic repurchase rather than something more programmatic. And then the last thing with regards to our balance sheet and cash on hand would also be our commitment there to retiring a bond, a $1.2 billion bond that\u2019s coming due here in the first quarter of 2023. So really, as we started off with the guide of returning a minimum of 60% of free cash flow, it\u2019s really not a change in strategy by any means. It\u2019s just a to provide a little more transparency a little more clarity, we\u2019ve heard some of our shareholders who have asked for a bit more transparency and clarity on the cash returns, and that\u2019s really what the change in messaging is, but our strategy remains very consistent.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Thanks, Ezra.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine, your line is open.\nJeanine Wai: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. Our first question, maybe if we can just hit back to Dorado, nice update on that. In the slides, you highlight potential export markets. Can you talk about how much midstream capacity EOG has currently or maybe what you see down the line in order to get Dorado gas to those sales points?\nLance Terveen: Yes. Jeanine, good morning. This is Lance. Yes. As you think about Dorado and takeaway there, we\u2019re very well connected. I mean you can see that in Slide 11. Obviously, you can see the proximity to market. But as we talk about capacity, yes, we have sufficient capacity there, plenty of running room as we look forward and just really want to highlight too, as you think about the proximity to those markets especially the demand growth that\u2019s expected to see in the potential that\u2019s equally important. What we\u2019re excited about is you think about the proximity, less than a 100 miles to get to the Agua Dulce market. And then the connectivity that we have even to get up into the [indiscernible] Houston Ship Channel market. And as you look forward on over the next five years, you have the potential to see an additional potential of like 5 Bcf a day of new demand growth. So the proximity, the connectivity that we have, and obviously as you\u2019ve seen as evidence to our other plays, as we think about capacity, we\u2019re always very forward-looking and making sure that we have enough ongoing capacity as we think about our program.\nJeanine Wai: Okay, great. Thank you. And then maybe just following-up on Arun\u2019s question. Ezra, we appreciate all the details you just provided about the cash build up there. And I guess just generally speaking, and I know it\u2019s never the simple about back solving to a cash number, but is net cash or is that like a suboptimal place for the business or would you be perfectly fine with the balance sheet getting to that point? Thank you.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Jeanine. No, we don\u2019t believe that\u2019s a suboptimal place in an industry like ours, that\u2019s proven to be cyclical in nature obviously. And at times very volatile even our current cash position, I\u2019d say, the cash on hand is a percent of market cap, places us roughly in the upper half of the S&P 500. And we think that\u2019s a fantastic position to be in, especially when you think about a cyclical industry like ours.\nJeanine Wai: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Leo, please go ahead with your question.\nLeo Mariani: Hi guys, wanted to follow-up a little bit on the gas macro here, obviously, very topical these days. In the past, I know EOG has spoken about kind of a longer-term oil growth target kind of 8% to 10% per annum. Do you guys feel that at this point in time just giving the changes in the world that U.S. gas is really just going to be higher for longer and you think it would be appropriate to maybe do something similar on the gas side as well. And obviously you kind of talked about the accessibility of your gas to LNG markets down there as well. So just wanted to get a sense if you guys are actively working on perhaps expanding activity over the next few years of Dorado and trying to get that gas international markets.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Leo. This is Ezra. Let me maybe make a few comments and then Lance can follow-up on some more detailed LNG perspectives. In general, what I would say, from the macro perspective, I know this will sound a little bit repetitive, but we based our decisions on investment and gas. The same as we do on investment in oil, and that\u2019s on the premium price deck. So for us, it really comes down to the first question is returns. How quickly can we invest in an asset and still generate high returns year-over-year, still continue to improve upon the asset. And what that means is lowering the finding and development cost every year and bringing, adding lower cost reserves to the base of our company. That\u2019s how we drop the cost base of the company and basically expand the margins going forward. With regards to global supply and demand that comes in second, same as on the oil side. I wouldn\u2019t say that we have an optimal level growth because obviously there\u2019s associated gas, but then we\u2019ve got these pure dry gas plays. So we look at them a little bit agnostically. Long-term, how we do feel, going out longer and thinking about the long-term global energy solution, we do feel the gas is going to play a significant role in that. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re very committed to the $2.50 price that we evaluate the reinvestment on, because we think that\u2019s globally going to be a very competitive and compelling price to be able to base the investments on. Lance?\nLance Terveen: Yes, Ezra. Yes, Leo, good morning. Maybe just add a little bit more color too, as you think about just LNG and kind of LNG off-take, but I mean the \u2013 it\u2019s an exciting time and it\u2019s been excellent having some exposure, especially as you think about our JKM exposure and the first mover advantage that we have, because the pendulum like you\u2019re saying \u2013 you\u2019re seeing in the environment today, the pendulum the swinging, you\u2019re seeing more of a demand pool. And so as we think about that, especially from a customer standpoint, I mean we\u2019re very well-positioned. I mean the way we think about it, there\u2019s really three important components of it. And one of them that\u2019s critical is investment grade status and the pristine balance sheet that we have that absolutely puts us and differentiates us. And then as you think about the control that we have with our firm transportation, when we think about LNG off-take, it\u2019s not just from Dorado, but we have firm off-take that can get us from each of our major plays. And then also when you think about supply flexibility too, I mean we have a lot of scale and a lot of flexibility. And so we\u2019re excited about it. Obviously you saw the deal that we\u2019ve done with Cheniere, that\u2019s expanding and increasing our sale that we have there. We feel that that\u2019s very strategic. That helped commercialize Stage 3, which were anticipating hopefully by the end of 2025, I think expected maybe an early 2026. All kind of in line with what we\u2019ve been talking about for a long time. We\u2019ve been working LNG since 2017 and entered into our first agreements in 2019, and then just recently expanded that again. So yes, we definitely have a constructive views. We think about LNG and all those components that I just talked about earlier, we feel puts us very advantage because we can transact quickly and we can move with scale because we have the supply flexibility as well.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Definitely sounds like you guys are looking at more deals. Also just wanted to ask about the earlier targets that had put out kind of pre-Ukraine of flat well costs year-over-year. I\u2019m certainly aware that you guys have efficiencies and you\u2019re working really hard on this, but at this point, I mean if you think that\u2019s still a realistic goal just given inflation. I think I heard you say that you got about 50% of the well cost locked up in 2022.\nBilly Helms: Yes. Leo, this is Billy Helms. Yes. We tried to address that certainly in the last answer we had, but I guess the bottom line is we\u2019re very confident. We\u2019re going to be able to keep our well cost flat this year and we\u2019re going to work hard to do it next year. So it\u2019s early to say what next year\u2019s going to be, but we just have line of sight on so many improvements we can continue to make in our business to fundamentally offset inflation. So we\u2019re very confident in this year\u2019s CapEx and volume targets.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Neal, please go ahead.\nNeal Dingmann: Yes. Thank you. My first question, as we\u2019re maybe on exploration, I\u2019m just wondering what would it take initial success maybe on a large acreage position such as what webcast or whatever for you to announce another plate or really just a broad question, what generally do you all like to see before publicly rolling out and talking about the next best opportunity you\u2019ll have.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Neal. We like to have confidence in what we\u2019re talking about and bringing out to the public and what that means for us these days and we\u2019ve talked about it a little bit before is these days it\u2019s not just a matter of trying to find oil or gas that has become relatively not too difficult. The challenge for us is to make sure that it\u2019s additive to the quality of our inventory. Like I said earlier, we believe we\u2019ve got the \u2013 really the highest quality and deepest inventory across a multi-basin portfolio as far as North American E&P companies go. And so trying to add to that, trying to add to the double premium rates of return program is challenging and what it takes is long \u2013 some longer-term production results, before we going back to Dorado and the Powder River Basin before we announced those basins to the public, we had some pretty significantly long production results to really make sure that we had captured what we had anticipated capturing. Last thing, we wanted to do is mislead anybody. And so especially looking at some of the new plays that we\u2019re talking about with these hybrid reservoirs, these things are relatively new in nature to the industry. And so gathering some longer-term production results and appraisal wells to really define the extent to these plays is very important and critical before we\u2019d be comfortable talking about them.\nNeal Dingmann: Got it and great details. And then my follow-up Ezra for you or Billy, just on OFS inflation and maybe logistics, you all continue a great job of mitigating even better than most OFS inflation. I\u2019m just wondering on \u2013 when you look out remainder this year in the 2030 of things sort of stay like they are now. We\u2019ve heard some issues of sand and different things in the Permian, maybe bring it up now Northern life in Wisconsin. Could you talk about \u2013 are you all \u2013 I guess, two questions. One, are you all locking in and continue to do sort of longer term whether that be on the sand, pipe or other side. And then number two, just wondering, would you \u2013 when you think about \u2013 would you have \u2013 if you have opportunities like you did like year or two ago about drill pipe, if those persist, I assume you\u2019ll continue to go after and do some opportunities like that.\nBilly Helms: Yes. Neal, this is Billy. Certainly, it\u2019s a very dynamic situation we\u2019re dealing with here, but part of the reason we have so much confidence in being able to offset inflation, especially the inflation that the industry is seeing today really goes back to the involvement or engagement of our employees and how committed they are to achieving the goals that are set out. And you might \u2013 for example, talk about sand, especially sand in the Permian. And Jeff kind of went through some of this in detail earlier. The big overlying reason that we have so much confidence is we took ownership. We took control of that many, many years ago. I want to say about 15 years ago. And certainly through that taking ownership, we\u2019ve learned a lot in the past and we continue to look for ways to reduce that cost. And lately, it\u2019s been by getting sand closer to the wellhead. As we move to locate near wellhead, so kind of close to the end user sources of supply, and we can move closer and closer and continue to reduce our cost both on the cost of the sand itself, but also transportation to the wellhead. All the logistics that you see are diminished. We take trucks off the road. It\u2019s just good many, many different ways. We also stay very engaged on the material side, tubulars and those kind of things. We work with meals really across the globe directly. We don\u2019t really go through distributors per se. We work directly with the mills and that way we are able to establish the relationships and capture opportunities at the right time. So it\u2019s just that further engagement in all aspects of our business that allows us to do that and the creativity of our employees that allows us that opportunity. So that\u2019s why we still remain so confident.\nNeal Dingmann: Very good. Thank you, Billy, for the details.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Neil.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you. Team, I have one micro question and then one macro question. The micro question is, as you think about your growth assets the Delaware, the PRB, and Dorado. How do you think about the relative capital allocation and how would you prioritize them based on returns and cost of supply?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Neil, this is Ezra. It\u2019s great to have such high quality inventory across multiple basins. It makes our job with capital allocation and portfolio management, I\u2019m exciting. The way we approach each of them is, looking at where they\u2019re individually at in the life cycle play and basing off on returns. And so even though, the Eagle Ford in there, certainly not a growth asset anymore. But by right sizing that program last year, I think we highlighted this in February. Last year, we turned in the highest rate of return drilling program we ever had in that play. When you think about a play like the Eagle Ford, that\u2019s really a trailblazing type of asset for the entire industry to see how to continue to make one of these resource plays, long life resource plays even better year after year after 12 or 13 years of drilling it. So when we think about the Delaware basin, the Powder River basin, and Dorado just at the high level, we would say the Delaware basin is kind of in the sweet spot, as far as drilling activity, our knowledge base, infrastructure. And the PRB and Dorado are a little bit behind that. We definitely slowed down, as Ken had mentioned, we paused drilling in Dorado during 2020, and we did the same in the Powder River basin. And so we\u2019re early in the life on those plays and so the capital allocation of those two really progresses with the build out of infrastructure and at the pace of which we can incorporate our learnings and continue to make the wells better.\nNeil Mehta: That makes a lot of sense. So the second is a big picture question, you guys have been doing a lot of work on the oil macro, and it\u2019s obviously a very dynamic environment. But there are two questions associated with it. One is, what do you think the long-term implications of potentially structurally lower Russian production capacity will be for the U.S. producers and for global oil producers. And the second is, how are you thinking about exit to exit U.S. oil production this year? Given some of the constraints that you talked about earlier on the call?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Neil. I\u2019ll start with the second one and reiterate our position on exit to exit U.S. oil hasn\u2019t really changed since February, when you look at kind of the range of forecasts that are out there. We\u2019re on the lower end is the way that we set it in February and that\u2019s what we would stick to today. We think the supply chain constraints and the inflationary issues, the discipline that you\u2019re seeing in North American E&P sector, we think that the U.S. exit to exit oil production growth is going to be on the lower end of most of the forecasts. Longer term with the structural implications for Russian capacity for U.S. and global and how that plays in. We\u2019re watching that the same as everyone else. We have \u2013 it\u2019s a volatile situation. There are things developing as we speak, including the sanctions that are being discussed. And how are those Russian barrels actually continuing to flow and how are they getting discounted and where are they showing up and what is that doing? Ultimately, I take a bigger step back and just say for the last few years, Neil, we\u2019ve been pretty consistent with our model that chronic underinvestment and exploration in our industry is really going to lead to generally lower supply, under supplied for the global supply and demand market longer term. That\u2019s why we continue to explore and we continue to explore for lower cost, higher return assets. And we think that really \u2013 as we\u2019ve said in the past, there\u2019s only a handful of North American E&P companies that have the asset quality, the size, the scale to compete on a global scale with that cost of supply. And on top of that, deliver the barrels with the lower environmental footprint. And in the future, those are the companies that the world\u2019s going to want to fill in additional barrels. And especially, with our operational results in this first quarter, we think, we know \u2013 we feel that EOG is a leader of that group of North American E&Ps.\nNeil Mehta: The under investment point is definitely playing out. We appreciate it, Ezra.\nEzra Yacob: Thank you, Neil.\nOperator: We have time for one more question today. And our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul, your line is open.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning. Two quick question. One, I think you sort of follow-up to Neil\u2019s question. So does the Russian invasion [indiscernible] change the way how you look at the global market and perhaps that your production outlook or development plan for the company? I think you\u2019ve been saying that you guys will be ready to grow if you think that\u2019s a need from the market. And you will be growing at maybe in the future 8% to 10% annual kind of growth rate on the maximum. So wondering if those kind of yield has been changed in any shape or form because of the recent events. The second question that you talk about Powder River basin. So what will it take for that development pace to accelerate.\nEzra Yacob: Yes. Paul, this is Ezra. I think I can answer both of those questions almost in the same manner. When we came out with the 8% to 10% growth, which was maybe close to 20 months ago now. That was \u2013 and I think we said at that time, it\u2019s dynamic, at that time that 8% to 10% model was reflective of what we could do to optimize near-term and long-term free cash flow with the current inventory and our current knowledge base. And as you can see, things continue to change for the better for us. We continue to drive down costs. We continue to drive forward each of our, let\u2019s call them, emerging place with the Powder River basin and Dorado. And so when we talk about what\u2019s a good growth rate going forward, it comes back to those two things that I started off the call with Doug with the first his optimizing our returns, investing at a pace where we can really create long-term shareholder value. And you do that through adding lower cost reserves to the base of the company. So driving down the cost base of the company, while also reinvesting so that you can turn your cash over quickly. Our wells this year, it\u2019s strip price since we base it on a $40 investment. What that really translates to wells that pay out on average in two to three months right now on the strip price. So it\u2019s a fantastic place to be, and it\u2019s really strengthening the base of the business and the company going forward. With regards to the PRB, it falls under the same type of line. It all depends on how we build out our infrastructure in that basin and moving out of pace to be able to incorporate our learnings to drive down the well costs. Last quarter, I think we highlighted, we had dropped the Niobrara well cost pretty significantly over the past year 2021, which was just tremendous results. And as we continue to see progress like that, we feel more confident to go ahead and allocate more capital to that portfolio \u2013 to that basin.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nOperator: That is all the time we have for questions today. So I\u2019ll now have the call back to Mr. Yacob to conclude.\nEzra Yacob: Yes. We\u2019d like to thank everyone for participating on the call this morning. And thanks to our shareholders for your support. We especially want to recognize each of our employees for their commitment to excellence and on delivering such an outstanding start to the year for EOG.\nOperator: Thank you everyone for joining our call today. This concludes our call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Jeff Leitzell",
            "content": "Yes, good morning, Arun. This is Jeff Leitzell. So as Billy stated, our ability to counter these inflationary pressures and some of the supply chain constraints that you talked about, it's really just a huge credit to our team's operational execution, their innovative culture and really continuing to improve on the efficiencies. So just to give you a little bit of color and some examples, start off with our drilling operations, our teams continue to increase their efficiencies and that's primarily with EOG's in-house motor program and our proprietary bit cutter development, which we can kind of design both of these uniquely around all the formations we drill in each of our plays. And our Eagle Ford operations, they're just a perfect example of this. We've increased the drilled footage per day by over 17% this year. And this is one of our more mature plays that we've been drilling in for 13 years. So really to EOG, no matter how far along we are in development, there's always improvements that can be made. And then on the same topic there with the Eagle Ford, they've just done an outstanding job of reducing their drilling fluid costs also, even as diesel prices have risen and that's primary base in those fluids. We've done this by optimizing the density and the additives and the drilling fluid in each area, really to try to reduce those fluid losses, which has resulted in a per barrel savings of about 20% so far in 2022. And then just a couple more basic examples in completions, our field team, they continue to see really good improvements there and they've increased their overall completed lateral per foot per day by 10% compared to 2021 for the total company. And as we've talked about in the past, one of the main drivers in this is really our continued implementation of super zipper operations. So we talked about last year, we were about a third of our activity with super zipper and this year we had a goal of trying to get to 60%. And we're just about there right now. So this is really significant because pretty much every additional well that we super zipper, we realize the savings of up to $300,000 per well or that equates to about 5% of the total well cost. So another kind of new process on the innovation side that we've been implementing and testing is something called continuous frac pumping operations. So just a little bit of a rundown, typically in any completion operations, you have some unplanned maintenance and in order to be proactive, our field teams have started planning some of that scheduled maintenance periods of about three to four hours every three days. And what this has helped us do is really minimize any of that unplanned maintenance and really greatly \u2013 increase our overall efficiencies. So in the past quarter, really primarily in the Eagle Ford, we've started some testing in the Delaware basin, but we've been able to increase our completed lateral per foot per day by roughly 30%. So that's really just a huge time in cost savings there. And what we plan on doing is we optimize this process, we'll continue to roll it out to all of our operating areas. And then lastly more on the supply chain and material side of things, I just wanted to touch on a couple of our savings from the water and the sand cost side of things. In the Delaware basin, our team continues to reduce their water costs by optimizing the reuse process, which right now is approximately 90% of all their sourced water. And they're really doing this just through increasing the automation of all of our infrastructure and reducing the overall treatment cost per barrel, which we realized about a 9% reduction in each barrel of reuse water for 2022. And this is pretty significant, not just for CapEx, but also on the operating expense because every barrel we're allowed to reuse, is one less that we have to dispose of. And then finally here, over on the sand logistics side, EOG, we've been in the sand business in self sourcing for about 15 years now. And we continue to reduce those costs across the company. For example, out in the Delaware basin, we continue to advance our abilities to get that sand closer to the wellhead and ultimately reduce the amount of trucking needed. And plans are, we're going to open up a second plant in the second half of next year. And we really anticipate to see some pretty good savings from Q1 through the rest of the year of about 20% per pound. So these are just a few of the many examples of how our operations teams just performing and really giving us great confidence that we'll be able to counter a lot of these inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints through 2022. And as Billy will talk about here 2023."

            "content": "Yes. Jeanine, good morning. This is Lance. Yes. As you think about Dorado and takeaway there, we're very well connected. I mean you can see that in Slide 11. Obviously, you can see the proximity to market. But as we talk about capacity, yes, we have sufficient capacity there, plenty of running room as we look forward and just really want to highlight too, as you think about the proximity to those markets especially the demand growth that's expected to see in the potential that's equally important. What we're excited about is you think about the proximity, less than a 100 miles to get to the Agua Dulce market. And then the connectivity that we have even to get up into the [indiscernible] Houston Ship Channel market. And as you look forward on over the next five years, you have the potential to see an additional potential of like 5 Bcf a day of new demand growth. So the proximity, the connectivity that we have, and obviously as you've seen as evidence to our other plays, as we think about capacity, we're always very forward-looking and making sure that we have enough ongoing capacity as we think about our program. Yes, Ezra. Yes, Leo, good morning. Maybe just add a little bit more color too, as you think about just LNG and kind of LNG off-take, but I mean the \u2013 it's an exciting time and it's been excellent having some exposure, especially as you think about our JKM exposure and the first mover advantage that we have, because the pendulum like you're saying \u2013 you're seeing in the environment today, the pendulum the swinging, you're seeing more of a demand pool. And so as we think about that, especially from a customer standpoint, I mean we're very well-positioned. I mean the way we think about it, there's really three important components of it. And one of them that's critical is investment grade status and the pristine balance sheet that we have that absolutely puts us and differentiates us. And then as you think about the control that we have with our firm transportation, when we think about LNG off-take, it's not just from Dorado, but we have firm off-take that can get us from each of our major plays. And then also when you think about supply flexibility too, I mean we have a lot of scale and a lot of flexibility. And so we're excited about it. Obviously you saw the deal that we've done with Cheniere, that's expanding and increasing our sale that we have there. We feel that that's very strategic. That helped commercialize Stage 3, which were anticipating hopefully by the end of 2025, I think expected maybe an early 2026. All kind of in line with what we've been talking about for a long time. We've been working LNG since 2017 and entered into our first agreements in 2019, and then just recently expanded that again. So yes, we definitely have a constructive views. We think about LNG and all those components that I just talked about earlier, we feel puts us very advantage because we can transact quickly and we can move with scale because we have the supply flexibility as well."

            "name": "Ken Boedeker",
            "content": "Thanks, Billy. A year and a half ago, we announced a major new natural gas discovery in South Texas. We named Dorado. It's a dry gas play with 21 Tcf of resource potential net EOG across stacked pays in the Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford formations. Our break even cost in Dorado is less than $1.25 per Mcf, which we believe represents the lowest cost of supply of natural gas in the United States. Dorado was the most recent double premium play to emerge from our organic exploration program. We began technical work on Dorado back in 2016, captured a large acreage position in the core of the play as a first mover during 2017 and 2018 and drill test wells in late 2018 and 2019. After pausing during the downturn in 2020, we moved Dorado into active development last year and completed 11 net wells. This year, we anticipate completing 30 net wells, nearly tripling activity. Since last year, we have doubled our production rate out of Dorado producing 140 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter of 2022. We are leveraging our proprietary knowledge built from prior plays to move quickly down the cost curve as we increase activity at a pace that allows us to incorporate learnings and savings. We completed seven net wells during the first quarter of 2022, while keeping well cost flat compared to similar designs in the first quarter of last year successfully offsetting inflation. Since our first well was drilled in 2018, we have reduced well cost over 35% and our approaching our target well cost faster than we anticipated. In addition, well performance is improving. Productivity from recent wells is significantly beating our initial forecast, refined completion techniques, and a focus on targeting have increased our performance projections on a per foot basis. This year, we have also moved to longer lateral switch combined with the improvements to per foot productivity have resulted in an 80% higher two-year cumulative production volume that our 2018 wells compounding our capital efficiency. Our preliminary plan for the play was to focus initial development on the Austin Chalk formation, and then follow that with development of the Eagle Ford. So it would benefit from well cost reductions as well as water and gas gathering infrastructure installed for the Austin Chalk. With the dramatic improvements to our Eagle Ford formation well results, we now expect to co-develop it with the Austin Chalk, which will provide additional opportunities to lower costs through scale and simultaneous operations. As a dry gas play in close proximity to multiple markets, we expect Dorado's gas will have a lower emissions footprint compared to other onshore gas supplies in the U.S. In addition, we continue to leverage company-wide expertise to build out an operationally efficient and low emissions field. As we expand development of Dorado into a core asset, it will contribute to lowering EOG's companywide emissions intensity rate. Combined with EOG's low operating costs and advantaged market position located close to several major sales hubs in South Texas, including access to pipelines to Mexico and several LNG export terminals, Dorado is in an ideal position to supply low cost, low emissions natural gas into markets with long-term growth potential. Now next up is Ezra for concluding remarks. Yes, Charles. This is Ken. We haven't really given out a number on how much higher the productivity is. If we look back to those 2018 wells, they were shorter laterals in the 6,000 to 7,000 foot range. We've now have some extended laterals even past our original 9,000 foot range that we thought we'd get. And those things both the improved performance and the lower cost have really driven that finding cost down to almost the $0.40 target that we're showing on Slide 11 there. I guess Charles, just what I would say is, it is \u2013 our wells are beating our type curves that we have and those type curves do have a fairly low decline over the first several months of production. So we are seeing them beating our type curves. And if you look at it, we've really only drilled 30 of our 1,250 wells in that place. So we're continuing to learn."

            "name": "Billy Helms",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. We've had a great start to the year. Our first quarter volume, capital expenditure and total per unit cash operating cost performance exceeded our forecasted targets. We're also pleased with our progress to-date, offsetting inflation and managing well cost. Our drilling teams continue to reduce drilling days and generate consistent performance improvements. Use of self-sourced downhole tools as well as minimizing downtime and mud losses remain areas of focus to improve performance. For example, drilling times in our Eagle Ford oil play continue to improve, decreasing 28% in the last five years. The average well is now drilled in less than five days. On the completion side, we have increased the amount of treated lateral per day by about 10% over the last year, as we further deploy the super zipper technique. We are now using this technique on more than half of the wells completed in the company and expect to increase its use further as we progress through the year. In addition, our self-sourced sand program is providing a tremendous advantage that we expect to further offset additional inflation throughout the year. When we establish our plan at the beginning of the year, we knew the unusually tight supply constraints initially sparked by the economic recovery from the pandemic would present a unique challenge. Taking these headwinds into account, this year's plan was devised with known efficiency improvements that would maintain well cost flat with last year. While we have since seen increased steel and fuel prices directly associated with the war in Ukraine, we are confident we can still deliver on the CapEx and volume targets in our original plan. Rather than accept inflation as a given, our employees remain proactive. We have a track record of lowering cost and developing efficiencies through periods of economic expansion and other drivers of inflation. Our operating teams are ever more diligent in their quest to identify new areas of performance enhancements that will lower well cost. EOG's advantage lies with our people and our culture. Today's challenges are met with innovation and value creation in the field through our multi-basin decentralized approach. This period of inflationary fuel prices is a primary driver of the 2% increase in our full year per unit cash operating costs versus our previous guidance. However, higher commodity prices also present an opportune time to enhance our workover program, which will be reflected in LOE expense. These additional workovers bring on low cost production that pay out within weeks and increase the long-term performance of our assets. All in all, we're thoughtfully managing our assets to offset a small effect from inflation. While we have flexibility to adjust our plan in any given year to respond to unique or extreme marketing conditions such as the pandemic in 2020, our capital plan is thoughtfully planned across all our assets to support the pace of operations that is optimal for each individual asset to continue to improve. We believe we have the best people, assets, and plan to mitigate any headwinds and continue to improve the company for the long term. Here's Ken to discuss the incredible improvements we made in our premium gas play, Dorado. Yes, Arun. This is Billy. Let me start by providing maybe an overview of how we're managing the year's capital program. Then I'd like to get Jeff to add some color and then I'll circle back to 2023. Let me first start by saying that we kind of look at each year the same way. As you know, we would \u2013 I would tend to bucket this in maybe three or four different areas. One, we self source a lot of materials that insulates this from a lot of the supply chain issues, we also do a lot of innovation in efficiency gains. The third bucket might be the pace of the adoption of these new efficiencies across the company. And then may be finally flexibility with our multi-basin approach. So just to elaborate on that a little bit more, at the beginning of the year, we constructed our plant, certainly recognizing the inflation we saw from the recovery of post-COVID. And we were confident in looking at that, we could offset inflation and maintain flat well cost. What we didn't anticipate was the war in Ukraine and that additional pressure and increased inflation we saw in commodities such as fuel and steel, but we're still working to offset this additional inflation through our efficiencies and new innovations. These improvements in efficiency gains are certainly happening, largely in the areas where we have the most activities such as Delaware basin and Eagle Ford. But I would also say that the pace of the adoption of these new technologies, the rapid adoption of the super zipper technology across the company is happening faster than we expected. So we also have the advantage of being in multiple basins. So that gives us a lot of flexibility to shift activity between areas. So we're very comfortable that we can maintain our plan, delivering our original volumes and within our stated CapEx goals, we laid out the start of the year. So with that, maybe I'll turn it over to Jeff to give you some more details. Yes, Arun, just to summarize maybe I know that's a lot of detail for you but obviously, we're very proud of the efforts of our employees to continue to fight against the rising well cost in this period of inflation. As we move into 2023, it's really early to talk about specifics about next year, but let me just kind of give you an overall impression of how we think about going into any year. Certainly we have a long history of managing through inflation to maintain or lower well cost that gives us confidence to be able to meet our goals. And we have two fundamental things that we think about. One is our contracting strategy and how we approach that is for example, this year is just a reminder. We have about 50% of our well cost secured with contracts, with service providers that provide about 90% of our drilling fleet. And about 60% of our frac fleet locked up under existing contracts. Not all of those service contracts are set to expire at the end of this year. So we try to stagger those as we go through a year to make sure that we have some continuity going into the preceding year. And then the lastly would be, as Jeff mentioned there, innovation and efficiency improvements. So we are already confident. We're seeing ideas that we can continue to push and explore to continue to reduce cost and offset inflation going into next year. So we're always chasing those kind of things. I know that's a lot of color, but it's certainly something that we're very proud of our employees and their efforts, and just want to make sure you fully understand it. Yes. Leo, this is Billy Helms. Yes. We tried to address that certainly in the last answer we had, but I guess the bottom line is we're very confident. We're going to be able to keep our well cost flat this year and we're going to work hard to do it next year. So it's early to say what next year's going to be, but we just have line of sight on so many improvements we can continue to make in our business to fundamentally offset inflation. So we're very confident in this year's CapEx and volume targets. Yes. Neal, this is Billy. Certainly, it's a very dynamic situation we're dealing with here, but part of the reason we have so much confidence in being able to offset inflation, especially the inflation that the industry is seeing today really goes back to the involvement or engagement of our employees and how committed they are to achieving the goals that are set out. And you might \u2013 for example, talk about sand, especially sand in the Permian. And Jeff kind of went through some of this in detail earlier. The big overlying reason that we have so much confidence is we took ownership. We took control of that many, many years ago. I want to say about 15 years ago. And certainly through that taking ownership, we've learned a lot in the past and we continue to look for ways to reduce that cost. And lately, it's been by getting sand closer to the wellhead. As we move to locate near wellhead, so kind of close to the end user sources of supply, and we can move closer and closer and continue to reduce our cost both on the cost of the sand itself, but also transportation to the wellhead. All the logistics that you see are diminished. We take trucks off the road. It's just good many, many different ways. We also stay very engaged on the material side, tubulars and those kind of things. We work with meals really across the globe directly. We don't really go through distributors per se. We work directly with the mills and that way we are able to establish the relationships and capture opportunities at the right time. So it's just that further engagement in all aspects of our business that allows us to do that and the creativity of our employees that allows us that opportunity. So that's why we still remain so confident."

            "content": "Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliations schedules for these non-GAAP measures can be found on the EOG's website. This conference call also include estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chief Executive Officer; Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration & Production; Jeff Leitzell, EVP, Exploration & Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor & Public Relations. Here's Ezra. Thanks, Ezra. Our ability to refine our longstanding cash return framework by providing quantitative guidance is made possible by EOG's outstanding operational and financial performance. In the first quarter, EOG earned $2.3 billion after adjusting items or $4 per share. We generated $2.3 billion of free cash flow. Capital expenditures of $1 billion were near the low end of the guidance range, while production volumes and total per unit cash operating costs finished better than targets. Our confidence is further bolstered because we finished the quarter in an incredibly strong financial position. Total debt on March 31 was $5.1 billion. This includes the current portion of debt of $1.25 billion, reflecting the bond matures in March 2023, that we intend to pay off with cash on hand. Cash on March 31 was $4 billion for a net debt of $1.1 billion. This yield's a debt to total capitalization ratio of 4.8%. The $4 billion cash balance excludes $2.4 billion of collateral for hedges held by our counterparties. The amount of collateral fluctuates with oil and natural gas prices. These short-term timing differences in cash flows are not considered in our calculation of free cash flow and do not influence our decision on the timing or amount of cash return to shareholders. To that end, EOG has declared special dividends so far this year totaling $2.80 per share on top of the regular dividend of $3 per share on an annual basis, totaling $3.4 billion. Our objective in establishing our cash return guidance was to make it simple, yet dynamic so that it is easily communicated and understood while remaining suitable under a range of commodity price scenarios. The actual amount of cash return each year is a product of our long standing free cash flow priorities. These have not changed. The size of our regular dividend is now the largest of our E&P peers and the strength of our balance sheet supports our ability to return a large portion of free cash flow back to shareholders going forward under a range of scenarios. The $1.80 special dividend declared yesterday, along with $0.75 regular quarterly dividend demonstrate significant progress toward our commitment to returning at least 60% of our 2022 free cash flow to our shareholders. Subject to commodity prices, the amount of free cash flow available and the Board's discretion, our intention is to return cash through special dividends or stock buybacks on a quarterly basis going forward. Here's Billy."

            "name": "Ezra Yacob",
            "content": "Thanks Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG's cash return strategy demonstrates our commitment to deliver long-term shareholder value. Yesterday, we declared a second special dividend for the year of $1.80 per share following last quarter's $1 per share. Combined with our peer-leading annualized regular dividend of $3 per share year-to-date, we have announced $3.4 billion in cash return to shareholders in 2022. EOG has a strong history of cash return. Since we began trading as an independent company in 1999, we have delivered a sustainable growing regular dividend. It has never been cut or suspended and its 23-year compound annual growth rate is 22%. Since the transition to premium drilling in 2016, our dividend compound annual growth rate has been even higher at 28% including doubling our dividend last year. Today, our regular dividend not only leads our E&P peer group. It is more than competitive across all sectors of the market. More recently, we have supplemented our regular dividend with significant special dividends, reflecting our commitment to both capital discipline and returning cash to shareholders. While we are proud of our cash return track record, we acknowledge shareholders desire for more transparency and predictability. To provide both, we recently formalized and yesterday announced our cash return commitment of returning a minimum of 60% of annual free cash flow. Going forward, our intention is to evaluate and pay the regular dividend and consider options for additional cash return every quarter. The addition of quantitative guidance to our cash return framework reflects our confidence in our business. The pandemic driven volatility in the oil and gas market is stabilizing. However, the macro environment continues to evolve with the war in Ukraine and other geopolitical events. We have proven to ourselves over the last several years that our business is resilient through the cycle, including unprecedented shocks to the industry. Credit for EOG's resilience for the steady improvement in our ability to generate free cash flow in any environment and the ability to make this free cash flow commitment to our shareholders goes to our employees who embrace our premium return hurdle rate six years ago, which requires that all investments are in a minimum of 30% direct after tax rate of return using a $40 flat oil and $2.50 flat natural gas price. Last year, we doubled the minimum return to 60%, both the premium and now double premium hurdle rates have positioned the company to have an outstanding year in 2022. In spite of the ongoing inflationary and supply chain issues facing our industry, our employees outperformed during the first quarter and are positioned to deliver on our annual capital and volumes plan. We have decades of low cost, high return inventory that support the consistent financial performance that our shareholders have come to expect and that drives long-term value. Our inventory spans multiple assets across oil, combo and dry natural gas basins throughout the country, which enables us to pursue the highest net backs by diversifying both our investment and sales market options. We also continue to explore. A year and a half ago, we announced Dorado a premium dry natural gas play, where we've captured 21 Tcf of resource potential net to EOG. In a moment, Ken will update you on the progress we've made on well performance and well costs and what we believe is the lowest cost and lowest emission source of natural gas onshore U.S. Our organic exploration program has grown our premium inventory by more than 3.5 times since the premium metric was introduced in 2016. So our exploration program isn't focused on adding more. We are looking for better inventory. New plays like Dorado and the potential we see in our current exploration pipeline gives us confidence we will continue to grow and improve our double premium inventory in the future as we have done in the past. While we have earmarked and committed to return a minimum of 60% of annual free cash flow, our longstanding framework and priorities for total free cash flow are unchanged, a sustainable growing regular dividend, a pristine balance sheet, additional cash return to shareholders through special dividends and opportunistic stock buybacks and low cost property bolt-ons. Sustaining and growing the regular dividend remains our highest priority and reflects our confidence in the long-term performance of the company. A pristine balance sheet is a strategic advantage functioning as a shock absorber that also provides the flexibility to exercise a buyback when the opportunity arises and to take advantage of other counter cyclical investments. Additional cash returns through special dividends and buybacks complement our other priorities and together with our free cash minimum return guidance support our goal to create significant long-term shareholder value. Now, here's Tim to review our financial position. Thanks Ken. I'd like to note the following important takeaways from the call today. First, formalizing our cash return strategy demonstrates our commitment to our free cash flow priorities that along with high return discipline reinvestment offers significant long-term shareholder value. Second, EOG is realizing another tremendous year of improvement. We are set to deliver outstanding returns while demonstrating capital discipline within an inflationary environment, delivering on both volumes and capital as announced at the beginning of 2022. Third, our most recent organic exploration announcement Dorado has positioned us with over 20 Tcf of low cost natural gas with access to multiple markets. Our progress in Dorado is on pace to make this North America's lowest cost of supply. Thanks for listening. Now, we'll go to Q&A. Yes, Doug. I sure do. So let me start with the \u2013 what is now, why now, and simply we feel that this is the right time for our business to come out with the additional guidance. We've got the regular dividend increase to be competitive with the broad market. We've got the balance sheets in a very strong position. And we're basically emerging stronger from the downturn and confident that we can deliver this minimum amount of cash return going forward. It's consistent with our long-term free cash flow priorities. So it's not really a change in strategy. In fact, in 2021, we returned about 49% of free cash flow and we paid off a $750 million bond. So when you combine those that was about 60%. And so it's a range internally we've discussed and the announcement really just provides a bit of transparency. Now on the second part of your question with regards to how do you think about, how are we thinking about the reinvestment growth and to get to free cash flow. One thing, one reason we have given this guidance as a minimum of 60% return on free cash flow is because it's a guide that can be consistent and long term in nature through the cycle, like how we manage the business basing the guide off of a free cash flow, puts us in what we feel is the best overall position to create shareholder value through the cycle. So nothing's really changed in the reinvestment strategy. It's first, always based on returns and our ability to get better each year. There's \u2013 as we've said in the past, there's no reason to invest in growth if you're not generating high returns and you're not doing it with an ability to improve the underlying business year after year. And what that means is, not chasing free cash flow, just because of high prices, if you're investing in something that's eroding the business long term. So you can take today, for example we could increase activity today into these high prices, but in the inflationary environment that's going to erode our capital efficiency. And then the second piece that we've talked about as far as reinvestment our growth is based on the macro environment and market fundamentals. Does the market really need the barrels? What's supporting the global supply and demand fundamentals? Ultimately, investing in premium and double premium as you know, has made a somewhat price agnostic basing those decisions on $40 oil and 2.50 natural gas. And so it's really the capital discipline comes down to what can we do? And are we investing in a pace where each of our assets can get better year after year and ultimately improve the overall returns and company profile? Yes, Doug. As you said, the world's changed a lot and the company's changed quite a bit. The biggest thing for us is that introduction of the premium and now double premium reinvestment hurdle rates. So all of our gas assets now are judged and it's $2.50, flat natural gas price for the life of the well, and that really high grades our reinvestment opportunities into any of our assets, but especially the natural gas ones as we're talking about right now. Ultimately what we see with Dorado is that we've captured a very significant resource geographically in the best spot. We think onshore U.S. with access to multiple markets. And we're very excited about being able to focus in on really that asset that we have. We think it's going to be the premier asset in North American natural gas. Yes, Charles. The way we look at it is we've been fortunate. We've been in unconventional North American exploration here for nearly two decades honestly, and what that's allowed us to do is put together a multi basin portfolio of what we think is really the deepest and highest quality asset inventory. When we switched to premium, it was really taking a long-term look at that $40 price, $2.50 natural gas price to not only help the immediate returns, the rate of return, the IRRs upfront, but really thinking about longer term through the cycles. What does it mean to really build a company where based on a commodity price, you can still be successful and create value through the cycles. Ratcheting that up to double premium in 2020 was really a reflection of our ability to have grown our premium inventory three and a half times through organic exploration since 2016. So actually I think the focus on double premium drilling and that reinvestment hurdle rate actually provides us with an optimal way to rank our assets. Yes, Arun. This is Ezra. I can start right there with where you left off, pardon me, let me say that. We're just thrilled to be in a unique position here to be able to strengthen the balance sheet and return $2.4 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2022. But ultimately, with the remaining 40%, it comes back to the fact that we're committed to delivering on our free cash flow priorities and doing the right thing at the right time to maximize long-term shareholder value. And it does include that balance sheet. And some of the things with the balance sheet we've discussed in the past is, to have cash available just for running the business for operations to have cash for the small bolt-on acquisitions. As you mentioned to have cash available for the $5 billion stock repurchase authorization, which we've said, we prefer to look at that as an opportunistic repurchase rather than something more programmatic. And then the last thing with regards to our balance sheet and cash on hand would also be our commitment there to retiring a bond, a $1.2 billion bond that's coming due here in the first quarter of 2023. So really, as we started off with the guide of returning a minimum of 60% of free cash flow, it's really not a change in strategy by any means. It's just a to provide a little more transparency a little more clarity, we've heard some of our shareholders who have asked for a bit more transparency and clarity on the cash returns, and that's really what the change in messaging is, but our strategy remains very consistent. Yes, Jeanine. No, we don't believe that's a suboptimal place in an industry like ours, that's proven to be cyclical in nature obviously. And at times very volatile even our current cash position, I'd say, the cash on hand is a percent of market cap, places us roughly in the upper half of the S&P 500. And we think that's a fantastic position to be in, especially when you think about a cyclical industry like ours. Yes, Leo. This is Ezra. Let me maybe make a few comments and then Lance can follow-up on some more detailed LNG perspectives. In general, what I would say, from the macro perspective, I know this will sound a little bit repetitive, but we based our decisions on investment and gas. The same as we do on investment in oil, and that's on the premium price deck. So for us, it really comes down to the first question is returns. How quickly can we invest in an asset and still generate high returns year-over-year, still continue to improve upon the asset. And what that means is lowering the finding and development cost every year and bringing, adding lower cost reserves to the base of our company. That's how we drop the cost base of the company and basically expand the margins going forward. With regards to global supply and demand that comes in second, same as on the oil side. I wouldn't say that we have an optimal level growth because obviously there's associated gas, but then we've got these pure dry gas plays. So we look at them a little bit agnostically. Long-term, how we do feel, going out longer and thinking about the long-term global energy solution, we do feel the gas is going to play a significant role in that. And that's why we're very committed to the $2.50 price that we evaluate the reinvestment on, because we think that's globally going to be a very competitive and compelling price to be able to base the investments on. Lance? Yes, Neal. We like to have confidence in what we're talking about and bringing out to the public and what that means for us these days and we've talked about it a little bit before is these days it's not just a matter of trying to find oil or gas that has become relatively not too difficult. The challenge for us is to make sure that it's additive to the quality of our inventory. Like I said earlier, we believe we've got the \u2013 really the highest quality and deepest inventory across a multi-basin portfolio as far as North American E&P companies go. And so trying to add to that, trying to add to the double premium rates of return program is challenging and what it takes is long \u2013 some longer-term production results, before we going back to Dorado and the Powder River Basin before we announced those basins to the public, we had some pretty significantly long production results to really make sure that we had captured what we had anticipated capturing. Last thing, we wanted to do is mislead anybody. And so especially looking at some of the new plays that we're talking about with these hybrid reservoirs, these things are relatively new in nature to the industry. And so gathering some longer-term production results and appraisal wells to really define the extent to these plays is very important and critical before we'd be comfortable talking about them. Yes, Neil, this is Ezra. It's great to have such high quality inventory across multiple basins. It makes our job with capital allocation and portfolio management, I'm exciting. The way we approach each of them is, looking at where they're individually at in the life cycle play and basing off on returns. And so even though, the Eagle Ford in there, certainly not a growth asset anymore. But by right sizing that program last year, I think we highlighted this in February. Last year, we turned in the highest rate of return drilling program we ever had in that play. When you think about a play like the Eagle Ford, that's really a trailblazing type of asset for the entire industry to see how to continue to make one of these resource plays, long life resource plays even better year after year after 12 or 13 years of drilling it. So when we think about the Delaware basin, the Powder River basin, and Dorado just at the high level, we would say the Delaware basin is kind of in the sweet spot, as far as drilling activity, our knowledge base, infrastructure. And the PRB and Dorado are a little bit behind that. We definitely slowed down, as Ken had mentioned, we paused drilling in Dorado during 2020, and we did the same in the Powder River basin. And so we're early in the life on those plays and so the capital allocation of those two really progresses with the build out of infrastructure and at the pace of which we can incorporate our learnings and continue to make the wells better. Yes, Neil. I'll start with the second one and reiterate our position on exit to exit U.S. oil hasn't really changed since February, when you look at kind of the range of forecasts that are out there. We're on the lower end is the way that we set it in February and that's what we would stick to today. We think the supply chain constraints and the inflationary issues, the discipline that you're seeing in North American E&P sector, we think that the U.S. exit to exit oil production growth is going to be on the lower end of most of the forecasts. Longer term with the structural implications for Russian capacity for U.S. and global and how that plays in. We're watching that the same as everyone else. We have \u2013 it's a volatile situation. There are things developing as we speak, including the sanctions that are being discussed. And how are those Russian barrels actually continuing to flow and how are they getting discounted and where are they showing up and what is that doing? Ultimately, I take a bigger step back and just say for the last few years, Neil, we've been pretty consistent with our model that chronic underinvestment and exploration in our industry is really going to lead to generally lower supply, under supplied for the global supply and demand market longer term. That's why we continue to explore and we continue to explore for lower cost, higher return assets. And we think that really \u2013 as we've said in the past, there's only a handful of North American E&P companies that have the asset quality, the size, the scale to compete on a global scale with that cost of supply. And on top of that, deliver the barrels with the lower environmental footprint. And in the future, those are the companies that the world's going to want to fill in additional barrels. And especially, with our operational results in this first quarter, we think, we know \u2013 we feel that EOG is a leader of that group of North American E&Ps. Thank you, Neil. Yes. Paul, this is Ezra. I think I can answer both of those questions almost in the same manner. When we came out with the 8% to 10% growth, which was maybe close to 20 months ago now. That was \u2013 and I think we said at that time, it's dynamic, at that time that 8% to 10% model was reflective of what we could do to optimize near-term and long-term free cash flow with the current inventory and our current knowledge base. And as you can see, things continue to change for the better for us. We continue to drive down costs. We continue to drive forward each of our, let's call them, emerging place with the Powder River basin and Dorado. And so when we talk about what's a good growth rate going forward, it comes back to those two things that I started off the call with Doug with the first his optimizing our returns, investing at a pace where we can really create long-term shareholder value. And you do that through adding lower cost reserves to the base of the company. So driving down the cost base of the company, while also reinvesting so that you can turn your cash over quickly. Our wells this year, it's strip price since we base it on a $40 investment. What that really translates to wells that pay out on average in two to three months right now on the strip price. So it's a fantastic place to be, and it's really strengthening the base of the business and the company going forward. With regards to the PRB, it falls under the same type of line. It all depends on how we build out our infrastructure in that basin and moving out of pace to be able to incorporate our learnings to drive down the well costs. Last quarter, I think we highlighted, we had dropped the Niobrara well cost pretty significantly over the past year 2021, which was just tremendous results. And as we continue to see progress like that, we feel more confident to go ahead and allocate more capital to that portfolio \u2013 to that basin. Yes. We'd like to thank everyone for participating on the call this morning. And thanks to our shareholders for your support. We especially want to recognize each of our employees for their commitment to excellence and on delivering such an outstanding start to the year for EOG."

Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, President; Jeff Leitzel, Chief Operating Officer, Ann Janssen, Chief Financial Officer, and Lance Terveen, Senior Vice President, Marketing. Here's Ezra.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Pearce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our outstanding performance last year demonstrates that EOG's value proposition delivers results. We beat our volume targets and reached a production milestone, exiting the year producing more than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. We earned adjusted net income of $6.8 billion for a return on capital employed of 31%. We generated $5.1 billion of free cash flow and returned more than 85% of that free cash flow to shareholders last year, handily outpacing our cash return commitment. Our regular dividend remains the anchor of our cash return strategy. We increased it 10% last year to an annualized rate of $3.64 per share, which represents among the highest regular dividend yields of our peers and is competitive with the broader market. 2023 was a year of record production and outstanding financial performance, and it's not a one-off year. The real power of EOG's value proposition is consistency. Over the last three years, since the start of 2021, EOG has generated about $20 billion of adjusted net income, over $18 billion of free cash flow, and returned over $12 billion to shareholders. EOG delivers reliable operating results that translate to consistent financial performance year after year through the cycle. And that's EOG's value proposition, sustainable value creation through industry cycles. Our strategy to deliver on that value proposition starts first with capital discipline, a returns-focused capital allocation strategy guided by our premium hurdle rate, which requires investments to earn at least 30% direct after tax return at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. Capital discipline allows EOG to consistently achieve its free cash flow priorities and deliver on shareholder return commitments, positioning EOG as a compelling investment competitive with the S&P 500. The second principle of our strategy to deliver on our value proposition is operational execution. Our multi-basin organic growth portfolio is a competitive advantage. We have superior in-house technical expertise that supports leading-edge well performance while minimizing well costs. Our proprietary information technology enables real-time data-driven decision-making. We actively avoid falling into manufacturing mode where one well design is stamped out across a basin. Rather, we adhere to the discipline of continuous improvement such that the latest learnings get embedded into the next well and transferred to the next basin. Integrated into our operations is our focus on sustainability, the third leg of our strategy to deliver EOG's value proposition. Last year was a banner year with respect to our environmental performance. In addition to maintaining GHG and methane emissions intensity rates below our 2025 targets, we also achieved zero routine flaring throughout our operations. We achieved a wellhead gas capture rate of 99.9% and in the Delaware basin, our most active operational area, we increased water reuse to 90%. The final leg and foundation of our value proposition is EOG's culture. Our employees embrace and embody EOG's unique culture and are the number one reason for EOG's success. Collaborative multidisciplinary teams drive innovation and sustain the cycle of continuous improvement and our technology leadership. Our company is decentralized and non-bureaucratic to allow decision-making in the field at the asset level, which truly differentiates EOG relative to our peers and is a lasting competitive advantage. This culture is what drove our successful results in 2023 and provides the foundation to continue to deliver in the future. Ann is up next to discuss our cash return strategy and preview the details of our 2024 capital plan. Here's Ann.\nAnn Janssen: Thanks, Ezra. This morning, I'd like to review EOG's cash return strategy. A growing sustainable regular dividend remains the foundation of our cash return commitment, which is now a minimum of 70% of our annual free cash flow. We believe the regular dividend is the best indicator of a company's confidence in its future performance. It's a commitment to our shareholders based on our ability to continue to lower our cost structure and sustainably expand future free cash flow generation. Since we began trading as an independent company in 1999, we have delivered a sustainable growing regular dividend. It has never been cut or suspended and its 25-year compound annual growth rate is 21%. Last year, we announced an increase in our regular dividend of 10%. In fact, we have increased our regular dividend by at least 10% each year for the last seven years. The indicated annual rate is now $3.64 per share, which currently represents about a 3.2% regular dividend yield, among the highest in our E&P peer group. In addition to our regular dividend, we paid $2.50 per share in special dividends in 2023 and took advantage of increased market volatility to opportunistically repurchase shares. We bought back approximately 1 billion of our shares at an average price of $112 per share, repurchasing nearly 9 million shares. Since putting the $5 billion repurchase authorization in place over two years ago, the fundamental strength of our business has improved and we continue to get better through consistent execution of and commitment to EOG's value proposition. Last year, we also further strengthened our balance sheet by retiring $1.25 billion of debt. At year-end 2023, we had $5.3 billion in cash on the balance sheet, $3.8 billion in long-term debt, and over $7 billion of liquidity. We view a strong balance sheet as a competitive advantage in a cyclical industry. Our balance sheet is among the strongest in the energy sector and ranks near the top 10% in the S&P 500. Between our $1.9 billion of regular dividends, $1.5 billion of special dividends, $1 billion of buybacks, and retiring $1.25 billion of debt, 100% of EOG's 2023 free cash flow of $5.1 billion is accounted for. With a financial profile more competitive than ever with the broader market, EOG has never been better positioned to generate significant long-term shareholder value. This quarter, we included a three-year scenario on slide five of our investor presentation to illustrate our ability to create future shareholder value. We assumed a macro environment, commodity prices, and production growth comparable to the last few years for production that's low single-digit oil growth and high single-digit BOE growth per year. In the current environment, this pace of activity has delivered exceptional results, and we expect to deliver more of the same. Using a $65 to $85 oil price range and a $3.25 natural gas price through 2026, we would expect to generate between $12 billion and $22 billion in cumulative free cash flow and an average return on capital employed of 20% to 30%. At the midpoint, the scenario estimates $17 billion in cumulative free cash flow, which represents about one-quarter of EOG's current enterprise value. We believe this three-year scenario highlights an extremely competitive shareholder return profile not only among energy companies, but also with the S&P 500. Turning more immediately to 2024, we forecast another year of strong operational and financial performance. We expect our $6.2 billion capital plan to grow oil volumes by 3% and total production on a BOE basis by 7%. At just $45 WTI, our plan breaks even. At $75 WTI and $250 Henry Hub, we expect to generate about $4.8 billion of free cash flow and produce an ROCE of greater than 20%. Based on our target of returning at least 70% of free cash flow, that implies a minimum return to shareholders of $3.4 billion this year. Now, here's Billy to review 2023 operating results and proved reserves.\nLloyd Helms: Thanks, Ann. 2023 proved to be another exceptional year of performance, and I would like to thank each of our employees for their accomplishments and execution last year. For the full year, we delivered oil production above the original guidance midpoint set at the beginning of the year, while capital spending was at the midpoint. Overall, we were able to grow our oil volumes by 3% and our total production by 8% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, we achieved a significant milestone, crossing the 1 million barrel of oil equivalent per day level of total production. EOG has been able to nearly double production over the last 10 years through our high return organic growth approach. Last year, our cross-functional teams worked to drive efficiency gains throughout our multi-basin portfolio. For drilling operations, our EOG motor program continues to reduce downtime with our 2023 program yielding about a 15% improvement in footage drilled per rig. For completions, we continue to expand our super zipper operations across our multi-basin portfolio, reduce frac fleet move times, and decrease stage pump times due to increased horsepower for frac fleet. This improved our completed footage per frac fleet by about 7% in 2023. And we expect to continue seeing the benefit of those gains throughout 2024, which Jeff will run through shortly. Our production teams work to optimize production and expenses, reducing our cash operating costs to $10.33 per BOE. In addition, our facility and operating personnel continue to reduce our methane emissions while commissioning our first CCS injection well. Our approved reserve base increased by 260 million barrels of oil equivalent last year, and now totals nearly 4.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This represents a 6% increase in reserves year-over-year, and proved reserve replacement of 202%, excluding price-related revisions, with a finding and development cost of just $7.20 per barrel of oil equivalent. Now here's Jeff to discuss operations and the 2024 plan.\nJeffrey Leitzell: Thanks, Billy. For our 2024 plan, we forecast a $6.2 billion CapEx program to deliver 3% oil volume growth and 7% total production growth. We expect to see some deflation throughout the year, and our forecasting well cost to be down a low single-digit percentage compared to last year. The primary drivers are a 10% to 15% reduction in tubulars and ancillary service costs. Our plan reflects increased investment in long-term strategic infrastructure in the Delaware Basin and Dorado, which are expected to reduce operating costs and expand margins for the life of these assets. These projects are highlighted on slide seven of our presentation, and Lance will discuss them in greater detail in a moment. I'd like to highlight that our year-over-year direct capital efficiency is improving, which is illustrated in our capital program breakdown on slide six of our earnings presentation. In addition to the operational improvements Billy mentioned, our company-wide average treated lateral length per well is increasing by 10% in 2024. These improved efficiencies and longer laterals have resulted in a decrease in the number of drilling rigs by four, frac fleets by two, and our net wells by 40 compared to last year. The ability to grow our volumes year-over-year for less direct CapEx is a testament to the improved well performance and operational efficiency gains we are realizing across our operating area. When looking at our activity in 2024, EOG remains focused on progressing each one of our plays at a measured pace that allows us to capture and implement valuable learnings while realizing consistent improvement. In our foundational plays, specifically the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford, our teams are executing at a high level, and we expect to maintain consistent activity compared to 2023. For Dorado, we remain excited about this 21 TCF resource potential asset and the role it will play in meeting growing global natural gas demand. Throughout last year, our team made good progress on improving operational efficiencies and recoveries. For 2024, we expect to moderate activity compared to 2023. A balanced approach to our investment in Dorado will allow us to maintain consistent operations to advance and improve the play while continuing to remain flexible as we monitor the natural gas market. In the Utica play, our technical and operations teams continue to make great progress. Our latest three-well Xavier package delivered initial 30-day average production of 3,250 barrel of oil equivalent per day with 55% oil and 75% liquids. The Xavier wells were drilled at 800-foot spacing, which is tighter than the Timberwolf package at 1,000-foot spacing. We are pleased that all of our package wells to date have come online at production levels exceeding results from our initial individual test wells. For 2024, we expect to increase our activity level to one full rig, continue to test well spacing, and delineate our acreage across the play. Our next four-well package, named White Rhino, is located in the southern part of the Utica, and we expect these wells to come online in the first half of the year. In the Powder River Basin, our team has continued to improve well productivity in the Mowry Formation. We have observed double-digit increases in oil and BOE productivity per well due to improved targeting and our consistent package development. Moving into 2024, we expect to moderate activity levels, and along with Mowry development, will begin testing packages in the shallower Niobrara Formation in our primary development area. I would like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication that has positioned the company for another outstanding year. We are excited about executing our 2024 plan. EOG remains focused on running the business for the long-term, generating high returns through disciplined growth, operational execution, and investing in projects that will lower the future cost bases of the company. Now here's Lance to discuss infrastructure.\nLance Terveen: Thanks, Jeff. Infrastructure investments have been an essential element of EOG's marketing strategy to maintain transportation flexibility out of a basin, diversification of in-sales markets, and control from wellhead to sales point for flow assurance and to maximize margins. More recently, we have invested in two new strategic infrastructure assets to lower the long-term cost bases of the company and enhance margins. In the Delaware Basin, we are constructing the Janus natural gas processing plant, a 300 million cubic feet per day facility, along with gathering pipelines up to 24 inches in diameter. This new plant and gathering system is expected to provide material savings over the life of our Delaware Basin asset and reliability and flow assurance in the most active oil play in the U.S. We expect Janus will go into service in the first half of next year and deliver cost savings and revenue uplift of about $0.50 per MCF. While we enjoy great relationships with our third-party midstream providers, this new EOG-owned plant adds optionality consistent with our marketing strategy. The Delaware Basin is our largest asset by throughput volumes, and early high utilizations at our Janus plant provides for an anticipated 20% plus rate of return. In our emerging South Texas Dorado play, we're constructing Phase 2 of the Verde 36-inch natural gas pipeline. We have taken a very disciplined approach to build out Verde commensurate with expansion of U.S. Gulf Coast demand. We placed Phase 1, which terminates in Freer, Texas, in service last year. And once Phase 2 is fully in service later this year, the Verde pipeline will extend to Agua Dulce, where we will have a premier position along the Gulf Coast with pipeline connections to reach multiple demand centers, including LNG facilities and additional local and Mexico markets. We continue to see consistent well results in Dorado, and this new strategic investment supports lower future breakevens in a volatile natural gas market. We're extremely pleased with the progress we're making with these strategic infrastructure investments, which we expect will lower the cost basis of the company, provide substantial savings versus other alternatives, and increase operational control. In addition to strategic infrastructure, we continue to be a first mover in marketing our domestic natural gas to diverse indexes. We recently finalized a sale and purchase agreement for 140,000 MMBtu per day of our natural gas index to Brent, and another 40,000 MMBtu per day index to Brent, or a U.S. Gulf Coast gas index, beginning in January of 2027. Adding a Brent-linked agreement with start date certainty further expands EOG's pricing exposure to international natural gas markets and growing LNG demand. EOG is executing on its marketing strategy to diversify our access to customers across multiple end markets for our growing production of reliable and affordable natural gas. Now here's Ezra to wrap up.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Lance. EOG's business has never been better, and our financial position has never been stronger. Our 2023 operational and financial results were not a one-time event. Rather, the results reflect our value proposition at work. Capital discipline, operational execution, leadership, and sustainability, and a unique culture are at the core of our success and will continue to deliver consistent shareholder value, and it continues in 2024. We are investing across our multi-basin portfolio with a focus on optimizing both near and long-term free cash flow generation and delivering high returns, while staying flexible with respect to supply and demand fundamentals of both oil and natural gas. Our disciplined approach to premium oil investment, commitment to organic exploration, and strategic infrastructure investments drive our low breakevens and through-cycle value creation. And you can see this discipline delivering consistent results across our three-year scenario. Our confidence in EOG's ability to compete across sectors, create value for our shareholders and be a part of the long-term energy solution has never been higher. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Leo Mariani of ROTH MKM. Please go ahead.\nLeo Mariani: Hi, guys. I wanted to just address the U.S. gas production guidance for 2024. It seems like it's a pretty wide range this year versus the oil number, which is quite a bit tighter. I just wanted to get a sense if there's kind of a concerted effort on EOG's behalf to perhaps alter some of the timing of turn in lines during the course of the year to maybe try to avoid some of these weak months here for gas prices and potentially try to bring volumes on closer to next winter. And just any thoughts on your macro for gas in terms of kind of tying it in terms of how you see gas prices play out here.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Leo. This is Ezra. Thanks for the question. Yeah. What I would say is you can expect out of Dorado similar treatment to what we did last year. I mean, to start with, we already reduced our activity level at Dorado by reducing the rig activity. And then we'll be flexible just like we were last year with completions and when we're bringing those wells on throughout the year with respect to the natural gas market. I think when you're talking about the gas growth and the gas guide for the company in general, you bring up a good point. When we look at U.S. gas growth from Q4 exit rates to the 2024 midpoint guide, you're really seeing about 80 million a day in the domestic gas growth. And then what's a little bit unique to this year is the amount of gas growth we're actually seeing out of Trinidad. That's actually contributing a significant amount of gas growth at the company level from the Q4 exit rates to the midpoint 2024 guide for Trinidad. You're seeing about a 50 million a day growth rate there. So a little bit unique. And as you guys know, we've got a consistent program down in Trinidad. We've been in the middle of a drilling campaign for this year, and we're also still under construction on a platform that we plan on placing at the end of this year.  And the unique thing about Trinidad, of course, is that their current supply and demand fundamentals on gas are, quite frankly, almost opposite of what we're seeing domestically here in the U.S. That's a country which, up until the last decade, used to have a very robust supply of natural gas. And in the last decade or so, that's been decreasing. So they find themselves really undersupplied on the natural gas side for their domestic needs. And, of course, we sell all of our gas currently into the domestic market at pricing that's slightly advantaged and makes those projects down there very competitive with the rest of our domestic portfolio. Outside of that, the U.S. gas growth is really -- the majority of that 80 million a day is really associated gas that's coming off of our liquids rich and oil plays.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just jump in gears over to the PRB. Obviously, that's an important play that you guys have emphasized over the last couple years. I do see that there is some additional Utica activity this year, but it looks like you're pulling back a little bit in the PRB, which maybe was a little bit kind of surprising to me. I think you've got 10 fewer wells in terms of completions this year versus last. I assume that you're still trying to progress the science and the learnings on the play. So maybe you can just add a little color as to why some of the months pull back here in '24.\nJeffrey Leitzell: Yeah, Leo. This is Jeff. And yeah, great point. So, we had a lot of great success as we talked about in our opening comments with our Mowry program there. We're seeing increases in overall productivity in that target by about 10% year-over-year, both on oil and BOE. And really what it has to do with is just us getting the package development on our corridor and really understanding how to offset those parent packages with additional activity. So with that, though, we've also been able to really accumulate data with drilling all those Mowry wells up through that overlying Niobrara. So we're going to shift gears here a little bit there since we've been able to refine our geologic models. And we're going to go ahead and start testing some of the package development in that shallower Niobrara formation right along our primary infrastructure corridor. So really when you look at our program, it's just a slight step back on the Mowry and a little bit more focused now to kind of really figure out the geologic models in the Niobrara and get some package production performance on. So activity will be equally split really kind of between the Mowry and the Niobrara formations. So it's very similar to what we did in the Delaware Basin. Really we developed from the bottom up and it's a similar codevelopment strategy really just to maximize the value of the asset.\nOperator: The next question comes from Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nNeal Dingmann: Morning. Thanks for the time guys. My first question is on the Utica oil play. I'm just wondering, are you continuing to add acreage? It sounds like maybe you've recently added some and then secondly on that play, how far west in that black oil window do you all have confidence these days?\nLloyd Helms: Yeah, Neal. This is Billy Helms. We have continued to look for opportunities to pick up acreage where we see it. Just a reminder overall our acreage acquisition cost is probably around $600 an acre. So very low cost of entry, especially when you consider it compared to a lot of other opportunities to deploy capital. So we're very pleased with our organic approach there and we'll continue that trend and try to pick up acreage that's accretive to our position. And then as far as how far west are we confident? We're continuing to test out the play. Just a reminder, if you look on the slide in our investor deck, I think slide 17, it illustrates how that play extends 140 miles north to south. So far we've got a handful of wells where we have production data on. We'll grow that this year to about add another 20-plus or minus wells. So we're very pleased with the activity we've seen, the results we've seen. We still have a lot of testing to do across that 140 mile span. We are seeing some data that tells us we can go a little bit further west, but we have yet to prove that out. So we'll give you those results as we start seeing the performance of some wells in the future. But we're still remain extremely excited about the potential of that play.\nNeal Dingmann: Yeah, I look forward to what you all got going there. And then secondly, just on OFS materials, specifically, in the past you guys have done a great job using that strong balance sheet to optimize the stockpile of pipe and other materials. And I'm just wondering, can you speak to if you're currently building any inventory levels or if you believe future prices could fall? So you're just -- I guess, running more in real time.\nJeffrey Leitzell: Yeah, Neal. This is Jeff. So yeah, we always tend to carry somewhere between a six-month to a 12-year inventory. And it really does give us an advantage to kind of strike on opportunistic purchases. And I think that's one of the things, if you look at this year, really the primary drivers that we're seeing, as far as deflation is really going to be those tubular costs, which we're expecting to be down kind of 10% to 15%. That's really a credit to our procurement team to be able to really find really opportunistic times to be able to buy the pipe and go ahead and add that to our inventory. So we're able to see that price drop throughout this year. And then the other thing I'd say is really the other drop we're seeing is in ancillary services really supporting kind of drilling and completions. We see kind of a 10% to 15% drop in those support services such as coal tubing, wire line, cement and other such. So seeing some movement there on the deflationary front. We think from an overall tubular standpoint, we're in great position for 2024.\nOperator: The next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hope everyone's doing well after a busy earnings season. Ezra, I always appreciate, we always appreciate the free cash flow visibility that you guys try and give us after last quarter in particular. I'm looking at slide five, however, and you've got about 7% growth this year. Presumably there is growth in future years through that '26 plan. My question is, if I look at the cumulative free cash flow and just do the simple math, it looks like the free cash flow is flatlining over that period despite the growth. So I wonder if you could give us some color on the CapEx that goes along with that. And how at the end of the period your sustaining capital would reset given the larger volume you would have at that time.\nEzra Yacob: Yeah. Doug, thanks for the question. This is Ezra. Yeah. The cumulative free cash flow over the three-year period in the three-year scenario here that you highlighted on slide five, it's roughly 10% higher than the previous three years here that we have. So you see expanding margins in that three-year scenario. And unfortunately what we haven't given you is some of those specific details that you're really getting into. What we have talked about, and we talked about this in November, and then you and I talked about it again in your conference there in November, is our maintenance capital number currently is midpoint of 4.5 under a variety of different scenarios for a multi-basin organic growth company like ourselves, that maintenance capital will kind of range from 4.2 to 4.8. And that depends on, again, are we trying to keep oil flat, equivalents flat. Are we really just focused on maintaining production? Or are we actually investing in additional exploration and infrastructure and things of that nature? When you look and roll that into the three-year scenario, since we are growing volumes, you're right, that maintenance capital should be trending up a little bit. That's also going to be offset in the real world by some of the deflationary factors that we have moving towards us throughout this three-year plan. What I would say is that we don't see that the free cash flow is flatlining. In fact, what we see is a 6% cash flow and free cash flow per share compound annual growth rate across that three-year scenario.\nDoug Leggate: That's helpful. We'll take another look at it in the buybacks. We'll certainly help that, I hope. My follow-up is a little bit random, perhaps. But clearly it seems with the Utica and Dorado, you can't kind of help yourself, but grow gas with one rig in the Dorado, given how strong the volumes are, obviously. But it seems that the mix is kind of shifting a little bit over time. I think we also talked about that in November. My question is, what can we expect from the next steps of the organic strategy from EOG? If I could be a little specific, there's a fair amount of speculation that you guys are looking hard again at Canada and the -- should we think that organic growth could move in that direction? I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nEzra Yacob: Yeah. Doug, to quote you, that is a bit of a random question. We're always organically exploring for things. With regards to the Canadian assets, we were up there a number of years ago and we strategically exited that asset. At the real heart of your question, the way to think about the strategy for us is we've captured a tremendous resource down here in South Texas in the Dorado natural gas play. What we're building is a low-cost gas business that really sits alongside our core oil investment. And so when we think about capital allocation, it's not necessarily allocating more capital to gas rather than oil. It's really looking at these assets in place independently and what's the best thing for the company to continue to drive down our breakevens, continue to build value for the shareholders. With regards to the Utica and some of the other emerging assets, in a lot of ways our premium and double premium return threshold makes us a little bit ambivalent or agnostic to the actual hydrocarbon type that we're producing because again, these things are really a return-based question. When you layer in the macro environment, we do need to have consideration on that. Going forward with the gas market, this year definitely does look a little bit soft. We touched on that just a little with Leo's question at the top of the Q&A. But we still do remain constructive on the U.S. domestic gas market, say, 12 months and further out from here as the LNG demand continues to come on. And with some of the announcements we've made today, you can see that we plan on being a part of that solution going forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Hanold of RBC. Please go ahead.\nScott Hanold: Thanks. Hey, Ezra, EOG shares have laid some of its peers on both multiple bases and just in aggregate performance here. I can remember in the past when you all had commanded a pretty good multiple premium to everyone else. I'm just curious, you've shown the willingness and appetite to step in to buyback strategically over the last year. As you look at 2024 where your stock's trading right now and in your strong balance sheet, is there a willingness to get more aggressive and use some of that balance sheet strength to underpin the intrinsic value seen in EOG?\nEzra Yacob: Scott, that's a good question. I think when we think about buybacks, again, we think about what's the best way to create long-term shareholder value. That's it. You're right. We've seen our multiple compressed. We've seen really multiples compressed across all of industry. I think you don't have to look any further than the weighting of energy in the S&P 500 at approximately 5%, maybe a little bit under that, with close to 10% on forecasted earnings. So I do think we sit currently in what we'd say is a dislocated environment. And from that regard, I think as we move forward and generate a significant amount of free cash flow this year with our minimum commitment to shareholders to return 70% of that free cash flow to our shareholders, you could anticipate that being more in the form of buybacks right now. Now, when we look back at what we have done historically on buybacks, in 2023, we were very active in the first half of the year, during some real dramatic dislocations, I would say, regional banking crisis and the debt ceiling conversations and things like that. Now, we did, as an example, take a step back on buybacks in Q3 as oil price rose from $69 to $93 throughout that quarter. And obviously, there was some share price appreciation as well. And then in the fourth quarter with volatility entering the sector, again, the continued multiple compression across industry and across EOG, we obviously stepped back into it. When we think about it, we think about the strength of the company as we continue to improve. I think you can see with our three-year scenario, we continue to expand the free cash flow potential of the company. We continue to do that while generating high returns. I think really -- like I said, currently, we would consider ourselves in a dislocated environment.\nScott Hanold: Okay. I appreciate the color. And then if I can pivot to the three-year outlook and kind of parlay the premium activity into that. You all provided that chart on the Permian where you show the mix of wells and an increasing overall cumulative production, but just a touch lower on oil. I know you guys do a lot of codevelopment, but can you talk about the trend investors should expect on how that mix shifts going forward and within that three-year outlook? A - Jeffrey Leitzell Yeah, Scott. This is Jeff and thanks for the question. Yeah. We are going to be completing a few more Wolfcamp M wells in our 2025 program, but it's just part of our plan and our normal cadence of development as we move section to section and we move up in section and develop each one of the intervals. The one thing about the M is you need to identify whether or not it has a good barrier between it and the upper Wolfcamp. If there is, you can go ahead and develop that target independently, but in many of our areas that we are going to be developing the Wolfcamp this year, it's really optimal to codevelop those two targets together. And this is just strategic really to minimize any kind of depletion in these sections and maximize the value of each one of those targets. As a reminder, the Wolfcamp M does have more associated gas, but it's also a very, very prolific oil producer. It's got premium returns and the wells pay out in about eight months. So our goal in the Permian or any kind of stacked pay basins is always going to be to continue to execute a codevelopment strategy and really just focus on maximizing returns and NPV. And I'm sorry, I think I said 2025, I meant 2024 program.\nOperator: The next question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: Yeah. Thanks, Ezra and team. First question on just going back to the macro, I think we've been surprised by the supply of natural gas from the U.S. over the course of the last six months. And one of the areas has been associated Permian supply. And so, Ezra, I love your perspective on how you see that evolving, especially as some of the wells mature, but maybe as U.S. production declines on the other side of it. And how that all ties into the way you're thinking about mid-cycle views on gas?\nEzra Yacob: Yeah. Thanks, Neil. That's a good point. I think you will continue to see -- so far our models is here for U.S. growth might start there since we're going to be talking about associated gas is really where your question is. It's roughly around a 500,000 barrel total liquids. So roughly say 300,000 barrels more along the crude oil. And obviously, the significant amount of that is going to be coming out of the Permian, which in general, that basin is a little bit higher GOR than some of the historical plays like the Eagle Ford and the Bakken that we've had. And I think you'll continue to see -- our model would suggest you'll continue to see an increase in the associated gas and more than likely a bit more of a differential struggles there with Waha. We take that into consideration when we're thinking about the development of Dorado. Like I said, you can't forecast a supply and demand or forecast future gas, mid-cycle gas prices without having a recognition of what's happening on the oil side. It's one of the things that makes forecasting gas so difficult. So the ultimate thing, the way that we manage our business and we're trying to grow this gas asset in concert with our oil plays is to really think about being the absolute low-cost producer. And that's one reason you haven't seen us ramp up aggressively in the Dorado asset. It's one reason you've seen us last year and this year moderate activity, because we've captured a significant resource. We think geographically it's located a place that gives us significant advantage. We've invested in some additional infrastructure, including the Dorado pipeline that's named Verde, that's going to give us a margin expansion over the life of that asset. And that's really the way that we're focusing on developing a pure gas asset is really in concert with the growing future North American demand, which is dominantly driven from the LNG there along the Gulf Coast.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Ezra. The follow-up is you have a different strategy than many of your peers. We've seen so much consolidation in the conventional space in the last year, and you've got a much more organic approach. And I guess I wanted to give you an opportunity to talk to the investor base about why you think that is the right strategy and what are the pluses and minuses that come with that strategy.\nEzra Yacob: Yeah. Well, as we've talked about before, we're focused on creating shareholder value through the cycles. And the consistent way that we've been able to generate that value is through organic exploration, a focus on low-cost operations and a commitment to capital discipline. We have a high level of confidence in our existing portfolio, and it's aimed at improving the financial performance of the company. And again, I think you can see that with expanded margins and expanded free cash flow in that three-year scenario we provided. It's underpinned with a 10 billion barrel of equivalent premium resource. And we have meaningful upside with that resource, not only through future conversions, future exploration, but also just through the Utica resource that we've already captured and we've begun discussing. When you think about our organic exploration effort, our first mover advantage on the three emerging assets, the Dorado North Powder -- I'm sorry, Powder River Basin and the Utica, those three individual assets have the ability to represent, the equivalence of a smaller midsize E&P company, quite frankly. Dorado with 160,000 acres and approximately 20 TCF captured, the Powder River Basin with multiple targets across 380,000 acres, and the Utica asset with over 400,000 acres. So we continue to focus on improving the inventory, not just expanding it. Unproven resources, we do think trade at a wider discount these days than what proven resources do. And so we're focused on continuing to prove up and drive down the cost of these assets and bring them forward to create that value for our shareholders.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brad Brackett of Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\nBrad Brackett: Good morning. And thinking about the Utica, I look at the 90-day cubes. You can put a reasonable price against those volumes and compare it to a reasonable well cost, and it looks quite impressive. And maybe in the old era, that would lead to a flag dropping and a huge ramp in activity in volumes. Is there something that's governing the pace at which you develop the Utica? And maybe it's corporate strategy, or maybe it's gas takeaway, or maybe it's just getting costs of wells down. And will we ever see the sort of off to the races ramp that we saw in the old days in emerging shale plays?\nLloyd Helms: Yeah, Bob. This is Billy. Yeah, thanks for the recognition there for the Utica. We're very excited about that play, and the performance of the wells that we've tested across the play seem to continue to meet or beat our type curve. So we're very pleased with that. We haven't given you a lot of details on the cost yet, but we continue to drive down our cost through increased efficiency gains. And early in any play, you do a lot of testing and a lot of science gathering data. And we expect to see that cost come down. And we haven't really given you a lot of color yet on the EUR of those wells yet either, because we don't have but just a handful of wells with limited production data. And we want to gather more time before we can give you some answers. But I guess from all that, we still feel very confident that our previous estimates of being in that $5 finding cost range look very strong. And we're still committed to that. And on top of that, as far as the ramp up and how we expect to see that continuing, as we gather more data, we get more confidence and we can be more diligent about how we want to choose to ramp to make the most cost-efficient way we can develop that asset. So we simply don't need to ramp up any single asset very aggressively. And that's why you don't see us -- I mean, that's the advantage of being in a multi-basin portfolio is you're not required to grow or meet certain targets out of one asset. We have the flexibility that provides us to grow gradually in pace with our learnings so we don't outrun our learning curve. And we can be the most efficient operator in any of those basins.\nBrad Brackett: And maybe there's never a huge incentive from your shareholder base that goes and tells you, hey, go build some gas pipe take-away, ramp this thing to 100,000 barrels a day. So we might never see sort of those huge levels of growth from the previous era.\nLloyd Helms: Yeah. I think you wouldn't see the same levels of growth you saw in the past. I think our strategy would be to grow at a pace that's commensurate with our understanding of the resource, how to best develop it over the long term for our shareholders, and bring that value forward the best. We don't want to destroy value either by running too fast. So that's the balance here is we want to develop at a pace that is commensurate with our understanding of each asset.\nOperator: The next question comes from Roger Reed of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nRoger Reed: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I'd like to come back a little bit more on the well efficiencies, kind of the well costs as you look at '24 versus '23,the longer lateral links. Just where should we think about that occurring? You just mentioned multi-basin, right? So is the lateral improvement or increase coming mostly out of the Delaware? Is it spread across all the operations? And what are, either opportunities or limitations on further expansion of the lateral links?\nJeffrey Leitzell: Yeah, Roger, this is Jeff. Thanks for the question. So the lateral links have been a pretty big driver in our efficiency gains. We've had an opportunity to test longer laterals over the last few years pretty much throughout our multi-basin portfolio, and all of them with good success. So based on -- basically drilling longer where it's applicable based on our acreage footprint. And that's one of the limiting factors that we run into. In San Antonio, we've talked about, the years, our 15 years of drilling there, we've moved from the east, which has a little bit more robust geology out to the west, which has a little lesser geology. But we've been able to really optimize the economics there by utilizing longer laterals and really pushing our completion techniques to improve operational and capital efficiencies. And we're continuing to do that this year. So we're seeing some extension there in the Eagle Ford. In the Utica, we've talked about, we've been doing delineation up and down the 140-mile oily fairway there. And now we're starting to move into spacing packages and then just package development. So the majority of those wells are going to be three miles moving forward. So that's an increase in the overall lateral length of the company there. And then in Midland, we've been testing three-mile laterals for the last couple of years, but not really in high volume. Last year we drilled about four or five of them. And we've seen really good success. And we've been able to find the correct blocks and places that works with our acreage. We're going to increase that to about over 53-mile laterals there in Midland. So when you kind of roll it all up across the company, the overall lateral length will be up about 10% versus 2023 program. And we talked about, with those efficiency gains from the lateral length and just what we're seeing from some of the stuff Billy talked on the drilling and completion side, we're going to require that four less rigs and two less frac fleets and then also four less net wells. But all while doing that, we're still going to be completing a similar amount of total lateral length as we did with our 2023 program. So the way I'd look at it is we're just riding a lot of momentum with our efficiencies and our lateral lengths coming out of 2023. We'll just continue to look to build on that in 2024.\nRoger Reed: Thanks. There was a lot in that question, so I'll turn it back there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matthew Portillo of TPH. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Portillo: Good morning, all. Just a follow-up question on the marketing side. In the Permian specifically, you highlight the ability to build out the gas processing plant, which lowers your cost structure. I was curious how you see the fairway for long-haul gas takeaway out of the Permian over the next few years. I know Matterhorn will start to clear the basin towards the end of 2024, but it does feel like it remains pretty tight in 2025 and 2026 plus. So just curious what role EOG might play in long-haul takeaway out of the Permian as it relates to potentially taking on some incremental capacity to make sure that gas is able to flow.\nLance Terveen: Yeah, Matthew, good morning. This is Lance. Maybe I'll start. When you think about just kind of the macro, you're right. You have Matterhorn that's coming on, and you've had other pipes that have been expanded with like horsepower, right? So we kind of see going in -- you're going to see the basis going to continue to kind of be wide moving this year and probably potentially into next year. But what I would want to really highlight is just we've continued to be a leader as we think about like our transportation portfolio. And we have been a part of many of those pipes. So we were actually very early on pushing on those pipes to make sure that we have a pretty significant transportation portfolio for not only the gas, but then also the crude oil. But from a natural gas standpoint and then the long-haul pipes from an EOG standpoint, we're very well positioned with over a BCF a day of residue takeaway that hits into what we think are some great markets along the Gulf Coast.\nMatthew Portillo: Great. And then maybe as a follow-up question. I just wanted to come back to the Powder, highlighting obviously the opportunity set to delineate the Niobrara, which I think carries an oilier horizon to it. I'm just curious, the learnings you've had so far in terms of the drilling environment. I know trying to drive down the well cost has been a big part of improving the economics as well as the productivity uplift you all talked about. And is this just a pause in the overall program? Or should we be thinking about this as potentially a pull of capital permanently towards the Utica going forward?\nJeffrey Leitzell: Yeah, Matt. This is Jeff. No, I wouldn't look at it as a pause necessarily in the program. I think it's just a shift. We've gathered really good data. We've had great results in that Mowry target. We've had great efficiency gains and cost improvement. And our plan always was once we were able to gather some really robust data sets on the overlying to go ahead and step into the Niobrara a little bit, which, with that we'll back off with our packages in the Mowry to do so. So, Niobrara as far as from -- in the Mowry from a drilling aspect, they're a little bit different. The Niobrara is going to be a little bit easier drilling, I would say, compared to the Mowry because the Mowry is deeper. And then also in there you have some [indiscernible] you can get caught into and have some issues. The Niobrara, on the other hand is -- there's clinaforms [ph] and really we've mapped those clinaforms out well to find out what the better producers are. So we really want to be strategic as we mark across our acreage to make sure we're staying in those right clinaforms. And I think that really has to do with the discipline pace that we're looking at there in the Powder.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Freeman of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJohn Freeman: Thanks a lot. Just a follow up on what Scott asked earlier regarding sort of the development in the Delaware Basin. And it's obviously clear you all are taking a long-term strategy the way that that's developed with the codevelopment strategy with multiple targets as opposed to just sort of cherry picking, just drilling the oiliest zones because gas is weaker. It does look like those targeted intervals, Wolfcamp oil and the combo, it has moved around a lot kind of each year, not to get too far ahead, but since you did give the three-year outlook. Would it be safe to assume that if you were thinking out '25, that that sort of shifts a little bit back more towards the oilier zone, just as a nature of the way that you're codeveloping the package?\nEzra Yacob: Yeah. John, great question. And yeah, you pretty much hit it on the head. It really just flexes as we move kind of across our acreage into different sections and as the geology changes. So you will see that. If you look at the last four years, you really do see that flex back and forth because we're moving section to section and with our codevelopment strategies strategically codeveloping up from the bottom up to the top of it. So yeah, it will flex kind of through the next handful of years that you see in that three-year scenario.\nJohn Freeman: Great. And then just my follow-up, when we look at the infrastructure projects, obviously this year they stepped up with what you're doing at Dorado and Delaware. When we think about something like the Utica combo, is it going to continue to get more and more scale and grow? Should we assume that that kind of infrastructure bucket within the total CapEx, that sort of stays at kind of the level it was this year as a percentage of the budget? Does that potentially go higher when you're looking at kind of that three-year outlook and having these kind of emerging plays like you do?\nLloyd Helms: Yeah, John. This is Billy. Let me answer that in a couple of different ways. The infrastructure span, just to address that real up front here. Those are discrete projects that offer long-term support to plays that are going to be developed over multiple decades. So that's a very specific direction for those infrastructure projects that continue to lower our cost in the plays for the company going forward and expand margins for a long, long period of time. For the Utica, there is adequate processing capacity up there, so we're not seeing those kind of projects as an opportunity for the company. I think we're going to be looking at largely gathering process or gathering lines in that area as we develop each play out. Typical of any other normal play, we don't see the need at this point to develop out the large strategic infrastructure in that area. And so I would expect to see over time the infrastructure will stay in that 15% to 20% of our normal capital budget going forward when you take out these two discrete projects.\nOperator: The next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JP Morgan Securities. Please go ahead.\nArun Jayaram: Yeah. Good morning. My first question is regarding your marketing agreement with Chenier to sell some volumes on a JKM link basis tied to Corpus Christi Stage 3. A question for you is on their conference call, they mentioned that the project is undergoing perhaps an accelerated timeline with first LNG possible by the end of this year and for some meaningful full production at this project in 2025. So I was wondering if you could give us some thoughts -- would the marketing agreement kick in earlier coincident with an earlier receipt of first gas?\nLance Terveen: Arun, this is Lance. I'm not going to comment on the confidential nature of the agreement, but what I can tell you is we're very excited and we've heard the same comments in terms of effectively probably taking a little bit of feed gas to start some of their operations. And what I want to really point you to is we saw that early, right? I mean, getting that agreement put in place. But I'd say more importantly, right, as you heard Ezra talk about and Billy too on the strategic infrastructure, having that pipeline connectivity, we're going to have a direct connection to Chenier and to that facility. So we're actually very excited and want to be very helpful from that startup of that facility just because that's a major increase of demand that we're going to see that's going to help here within the U.S. as we think about LNG demand. So I really want to point more to that than just we're positioned is what I'll tell you, Arun, we're very well positioned that we can meet that. And so if there's an early startup, great. If not, we're going to be positioned there with our pipeline at the second half of this year to be able to commence deliveries.\nArun Jayaram: Okay. Just to clarify, it sounds like if first gas is earlier, you would be able to market your volumes earlier. Is that fair, Lance?\nLance Terveen: We would be able to sell into our agreement. That's right.\nArun Jayaram: Okay, great. My follow-up is several or a few of your E&P peers have claimed an R&D tax credit, maybe associated with exploration-type activities. I was wondering, just given EOG's historically spent money on exploration, do you qualify for that tax credit? And just give us some thoughts on what it takes and maybe the magnitude if you do qualify.\nAnn Janssen: We took it -- this is Ann. We took an R&D credit several years ago. Can't remember the year off the top of my head. But we're not planning on taking anything going forward. We don't have the opportunity to take anything forward. And we went and researched again back several years ago on the R&D and took what was available to us.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Yacob for any closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nEzra Yacob: Thank you. We appreciate everyone's time today. And we want to thank our shareholders for their support, and special thanks to our employees for delivering another exceptional quarter.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ann Janssen",
            "content": "Thanks, Ezra. This morning, I'd like to review EOG's cash return strategy. A growing sustainable regular dividend remains the foundation of our cash return commitment, which is now a minimum of 70% of our annual free cash flow. We believe the regular dividend is the best indicator of a company's confidence in its future performance. It's a commitment to our shareholders based on our ability to continue to lower our cost structure and sustainably expand future free cash flow generation. Since we began trading as an independent company in 1999, we have delivered a sustainable growing regular dividend. It has never been cut or suspended and its 25-year compound annual growth rate is 21%. Last year, we announced an increase in our regular dividend of 10%. In fact, we have increased our regular dividend by at least 10% each year for the last seven years. The indicated annual rate is now $3.64 per share, which currently represents about a 3.2% regular dividend yield, among the highest in our E&P peer group. In addition to our regular dividend, we paid $2.50 per share in special dividends in 2023 and took advantage of increased market volatility to opportunistically repurchase shares. We bought back approximately 1 billion of our shares at an average price of $112 per share, repurchasing nearly 9 million shares. Since putting the $5 billion repurchase authorization in place over two years ago, the fundamental strength of our business has improved and we continue to get better through consistent execution of and commitment to EOG's value proposition. Last year, we also further strengthened our balance sheet by retiring $1.25 billion of debt. At year-end 2023, we had $5.3 billion in cash on the balance sheet, $3.8 billion in long-term debt, and over $7 billion of liquidity. We view a strong balance sheet as a competitive advantage in a cyclical industry. Our balance sheet is among the strongest in the energy sector and ranks near the top 10% in the S&P 500. Between our $1.9 billion of regular dividends, $1.5 billion of special dividends, $1 billion of buybacks, and retiring $1.25 billion of debt, 100% of EOG's 2023 free cash flow of $5.1 billion is accounted for. With a financial profile more competitive than ever with the broader market, EOG has never been better positioned to generate significant long-term shareholder value. This quarter, we included a three-year scenario on slide five of our investor presentation to illustrate our ability to create future shareholder value. We assumed a macro environment, commodity prices, and production growth comparable to the last few years for production that's low single-digit oil growth and high single-digit BOE growth per year. In the current environment, this pace of activity has delivered exceptional results, and we expect to deliver more of the same. Using a $65 to $85 oil price range and a $3.25 natural gas price through 2026, we would expect to generate between $12 billion and $22 billion in cumulative free cash flow and an average return on capital employed of 20% to 30%. At the midpoint, the scenario estimates $17 billion in cumulative free cash flow, which represents about one-quarter of EOG's current enterprise value. We believe this three-year scenario highlights an extremely competitive shareholder return profile not only among energy companies, but also with the S&P 500. Turning more immediately to 2024, we forecast another year of strong operational and financial performance. We expect our $6.2 billion capital plan to grow oil volumes by 3% and total production on a BOE basis by 7%. At just $45 WTI, our plan breaks even. At $75 WTI and $250 Henry Hub, we expect to generate about $4.8 billion of free cash flow and produce an ROCE of greater than 20%. Based on our target of returning at least 70% of free cash flow, that implies a minimum return to shareholders of $3.4 billion this year. Now, here's Billy to review 2023 operating results and proved reserves. We took it -- this is Ann. We took an R&D credit several years ago. Can't remember the year off the top of my head. But we're not planning on taking anything going forward. We don't have the opportunity to take anything forward. And we went and researched again back several years ago on the R&D and took what was available to us."

            "name": "Lance Terveen",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. Infrastructure investments have been an essential element of EOG's marketing strategy to maintain transportation flexibility out of a basin, diversification of in-sales markets, and control from wellhead to sales point for flow assurance and to maximize margins. More recently, we have invested in two new strategic infrastructure assets to lower the long-term cost bases of the company and enhance margins. In the Delaware Basin, we are constructing the Janus natural gas processing plant, a 300 million cubic feet per day facility, along with gathering pipelines up to 24 inches in diameter. This new plant and gathering system is expected to provide material savings over the life of our Delaware Basin asset and reliability and flow assurance in the most active oil play in the U.S. We expect Janus will go into service in the first half of next year and deliver cost savings and revenue uplift of about $0.50 per MCF. While we enjoy great relationships with our third-party midstream providers, this new EOG-owned plant adds optionality consistent with our marketing strategy. The Delaware Basin is our largest asset by throughput volumes, and early high utilizations at our Janus plant provides for an anticipated 20% plus rate of return. In our emerging South Texas Dorado play, we're constructing Phase 2 of the Verde 36-inch natural gas pipeline. We have taken a very disciplined approach to build out Verde commensurate with expansion of U.S. Gulf Coast demand. We placed Phase 1, which terminates in Freer, Texas, in service last year. And once Phase 2 is fully in service later this year, the Verde pipeline will extend to Agua Dulce, where we will have a premier position along the Gulf Coast with pipeline connections to reach multiple demand centers, including LNG facilities and additional local and Mexico markets. We continue to see consistent well results in Dorado, and this new strategic investment supports lower future breakevens in a volatile natural gas market. We're extremely pleased with the progress we're making with these strategic infrastructure investments, which we expect will lower the cost basis of the company, provide substantial savings versus other alternatives, and increase operational control. In addition to strategic infrastructure, we continue to be a first mover in marketing our domestic natural gas to diverse indexes. We recently finalized a sale and purchase agreement for 140,000 MMBtu per day of our natural gas index to Brent, and another 40,000 MMBtu per day index to Brent, or a U.S. Gulf Coast gas index, beginning in January of 2027. Adding a Brent-linked agreement with start date certainty further expands EOG's pricing exposure to international natural gas markets and growing LNG demand. EOG is executing on its marketing strategy to diversify our access to customers across multiple end markets for our growing production of reliable and affordable natural gas. Now here's Ezra to wrap up. Yeah, Matthew, good morning. This is Lance. Maybe I'll start. When you think about just kind of the macro, you're right. You have Matterhorn that's coming on, and you've had other pipes that have been expanded with like horsepower, right? So we kind of see going in -- you're going to see the basis going to continue to kind of be wide moving this year and probably potentially into next year. But what I would want to really highlight is just we've continued to be a leader as we think about like our transportation portfolio. And we have been a part of many of those pipes. So we were actually very early on pushing on those pipes to make sure that we have a pretty significant transportation portfolio for not only the gas, but then also the crude oil. But from a natural gas standpoint and then the long-haul pipes from an EOG standpoint, we're very well positioned with over a BCF a day of residue takeaway that hits into what we think are some great markets along the Gulf Coast. Arun, this is Lance. I'm not going to comment on the confidential nature of the agreement, but what I can tell you is we're very excited and we've heard the same comments in terms of effectively probably taking a little bit of feed gas to start some of their operations. And what I want to really point you to is we saw that early, right? I mean, getting that agreement put in place. But I'd say more importantly, right, as you heard Ezra talk about and Billy too on the strategic infrastructure, having that pipeline connectivity, we're going to have a direct connection to Chenier and to that facility. So we're actually very excited and want to be very helpful from that startup of that facility just because that's a major increase of demand that we're going to see that's going to help here within the U.S. as we think about LNG demand. So I really want to point more to that than just we're positioned is what I'll tell you, Arun, we're very well positioned that we can meet that. And so if there's an early startup, great. If not, we're going to be positioned there with our pipeline at the second half of this year to be able to commence deliveries. We would be able to sell into our agreement. That's right."

            "name": "Lloyd Helms",
            "content": "Thanks, Ann. 2023 proved to be another exceptional year of performance, and I would like to thank each of our employees for their accomplishments and execution last year. For the full year, we delivered oil production above the original guidance midpoint set at the beginning of the year, while capital spending was at the midpoint. Overall, we were able to grow our oil volumes by 3% and our total production by 8% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, we achieved a significant milestone, crossing the 1 million barrel of oil equivalent per day level of total production. EOG has been able to nearly double production over the last 10 years through our high return organic growth approach. Last year, our cross-functional teams worked to drive efficiency gains throughout our multi-basin portfolio. For drilling operations, our EOG motor program continues to reduce downtime with our 2023 program yielding about a 15% improvement in footage drilled per rig. For completions, we continue to expand our super zipper operations across our multi-basin portfolio, reduce frac fleet move times, and decrease stage pump times due to increased horsepower for frac fleet. This improved our completed footage per frac fleet by about 7% in 2023. And we expect to continue seeing the benefit of those gains throughout 2024, which Jeff will run through shortly. Our production teams work to optimize production and expenses, reducing our cash operating costs to $10.33 per BOE. In addition, our facility and operating personnel continue to reduce our methane emissions while commissioning our first CCS injection well. Our approved reserve base increased by 260 million barrels of oil equivalent last year, and now totals nearly 4.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This represents a 6% increase in reserves year-over-year, and proved reserve replacement of 202%, excluding price-related revisions, with a finding and development cost of just $7.20 per barrel of oil equivalent. Now here's Jeff to discuss operations and the 2024 plan. Yeah, Neal. This is Billy Helms. We have continued to look for opportunities to pick up acreage where we see it. Just a reminder overall our acreage acquisition cost is probably around $600 an acre. So very low cost of entry, especially when you consider it compared to a lot of other opportunities to deploy capital. So we're very pleased with our organic approach there and we'll continue that trend and try to pick up acreage that's accretive to our position. And then as far as how far west are we confident? We're continuing to test out the play. Just a reminder, if you look on the slide in our investor deck, I think slide 17, it illustrates how that play extends 140 miles north to south. So far we've got a handful of wells where we have production data on. We'll grow that this year to about add another 20-plus or minus wells. So we're very pleased with the activity we've seen, the results we've seen. We still have a lot of testing to do across that 140 mile span. We are seeing some data that tells us we can go a little bit further west, but we have yet to prove that out. So we'll give you those results as we start seeing the performance of some wells in the future. But we're still remain extremely excited about the potential of that play. Yeah, Bob. This is Billy. Yeah, thanks for the recognition there for the Utica. We're very excited about that play, and the performance of the wells that we've tested across the play seem to continue to meet or beat our type curve. So we're very pleased with that. We haven't given you a lot of details on the cost yet, but we continue to drive down our cost through increased efficiency gains. And early in any play, you do a lot of testing and a lot of science gathering data. And we expect to see that cost come down. And we haven't really given you a lot of color yet on the EUR of those wells yet either, because we don't have but just a handful of wells with limited production data. And we want to gather more time before we can give you some answers. But I guess from all that, we still feel very confident that our previous estimates of being in that $5 finding cost range look very strong. And we're still committed to that. And on top of that, as far as the ramp up and how we expect to see that continuing, as we gather more data, we get more confidence and we can be more diligent about how we want to choose to ramp to make the most cost-efficient way we can develop that asset. So we simply don't need to ramp up any single asset very aggressively. And that's why you don't see us -- I mean, that's the advantage of being in a multi-basin portfolio is you're not required to grow or meet certain targets out of one asset. We have the flexibility that provides us to grow gradually in pace with our learnings so we don't outrun our learning curve. And we can be the most efficient operator in any of those basins. Yeah. I think you wouldn't see the same levels of growth you saw in the past. I think our strategy would be to grow at a pace that's commensurate with our understanding of the resource, how to best develop it over the long term for our shareholders, and bring that value forward the best. We don't want to destroy value either by running too fast. So that's the balance here is we want to develop at a pace that is commensurate with our understanding of each asset. Yeah, John. This is Billy. Let me answer that in a couple of different ways. The infrastructure span, just to address that real up front here. Those are discrete projects that offer long-term support to plays that are going to be developed over multiple decades. So that's a very specific direction for those infrastructure projects that continue to lower our cost in the plays for the company going forward and expand margins for a long, long period of time. For the Utica, there is adequate processing capacity up there, so we're not seeing those kind of projects as an opportunity for the company. I think we're going to be looking at largely gathering process or gathering lines in that area as we develop each play out. Typical of any other normal play, we don't see the need at this point to develop out the large strategic infrastructure in that area. And so I would expect to see over time the infrastructure will stay in that 15% to 20% of our normal capital budget going forward when you take out these two discrete projects."

            "name": "Ezra Yacob",
            "content": "Thanks, Pearce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our outstanding performance last year demonstrates that EOG's value proposition delivers results. We beat our volume targets and reached a production milestone, exiting the year producing more than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. We earned adjusted net income of $6.8 billion for a return on capital employed of 31%. We generated $5.1 billion of free cash flow and returned more than 85% of that free cash flow to shareholders last year, handily outpacing our cash return commitment. Our regular dividend remains the anchor of our cash return strategy. We increased it 10% last year to an annualized rate of $3.64 per share, which represents among the highest regular dividend yields of our peers and is competitive with the broader market. 2023 was a year of record production and outstanding financial performance, and it's not a one-off year. The real power of EOG's value proposition is consistency. Over the last three years, since the start of 2021, EOG has generated about $20 billion of adjusted net income, over $18 billion of free cash flow, and returned over $12 billion to shareholders. EOG delivers reliable operating results that translate to consistent financial performance year after year through the cycle. And that's EOG's value proposition, sustainable value creation through industry cycles. Our strategy to deliver on that value proposition starts first with capital discipline, a returns-focused capital allocation strategy guided by our premium hurdle rate, which requires investments to earn at least 30% direct after tax return at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. Capital discipline allows EOG to consistently achieve its free cash flow priorities and deliver on shareholder return commitments, positioning EOG as a compelling investment competitive with the S&P 500. The second principle of our strategy to deliver on our value proposition is operational execution. Our multi-basin organic growth portfolio is a competitive advantage. We have superior in-house technical expertise that supports leading-edge well performance while minimizing well costs. Our proprietary information technology enables real-time data-driven decision-making. We actively avoid falling into manufacturing mode where one well design is stamped out across a basin. Rather, we adhere to the discipline of continuous improvement such that the latest learnings get embedded into the next well and transferred to the next basin. Integrated into our operations is our focus on sustainability, the third leg of our strategy to deliver EOG's value proposition. Last year was a banner year with respect to our environmental performance. In addition to maintaining GHG and methane emissions intensity rates below our 2025 targets, we also achieved zero routine flaring throughout our operations. We achieved a wellhead gas capture rate of 99.9% and in the Delaware basin, our most active operational area, we increased water reuse to 90%. The final leg and foundation of our value proposition is EOG's culture. Our employees embrace and embody EOG's unique culture and are the number one reason for EOG's success. Collaborative multidisciplinary teams drive innovation and sustain the cycle of continuous improvement and our technology leadership. Our company is decentralized and non-bureaucratic to allow decision-making in the field at the asset level, which truly differentiates EOG relative to our peers and is a lasting competitive advantage. This culture is what drove our successful results in 2023 and provides the foundation to continue to deliver in the future. Ann is up next to discuss our cash return strategy and preview the details of our 2024 capital plan. Here's Ann. Thanks, Lance. EOG's business has never been better, and our financial position has never been stronger. Our 2023 operational and financial results were not a one-time event. Rather, the results reflect our value proposition at work. Capital discipline, operational execution, leadership, and sustainability, and a unique culture are at the core of our success and will continue to deliver consistent shareholder value, and it continues in 2024. We are investing across our multi-basin portfolio with a focus on optimizing both near and long-term free cash flow generation and delivering high returns, while staying flexible with respect to supply and demand fundamentals of both oil and natural gas. Our disciplined approach to premium oil investment, commitment to organic exploration, and strategic infrastructure investments drive our low breakevens and through-cycle value creation. And you can see this discipline delivering consistent results across our three-year scenario. Our confidence in EOG's ability to compete across sectors, create value for our shareholders and be a part of the long-term energy solution has never been higher. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A. Yes, Leo. This is Ezra. Thanks for the question. Yeah. What I would say is you can expect out of Dorado similar treatment to what we did last year. I mean, to start with, we already reduced our activity level at Dorado by reducing the rig activity. And then we'll be flexible just like we were last year with completions and when we're bringing those wells on throughout the year with respect to the natural gas market. I think when you're talking about the gas growth and the gas guide for the company in general, you bring up a good point. When we look at U.S. gas growth from Q4 exit rates to the 2024 midpoint guide, you're really seeing about 80 million a day in the domestic gas growth. And then what's a little bit unique to this year is the amount of gas growth we're actually seeing out of Trinidad. That's actually contributing a significant amount of gas growth at the company level from the Q4 exit rates to the midpoint 2024 guide for Trinidad. You're seeing about a 50 million a day growth rate there. So a little bit unique. And as you guys know, we've got a consistent program down in Trinidad. We've been in the middle of a drilling campaign for this year, and we're also still under construction on a platform that we plan on placing at the end of this year.  And the unique thing about Trinidad, of course, is that their current supply and demand fundamentals on gas are, quite frankly, almost opposite of what we're seeing domestically here in the U.S. That's a country which, up until the last decade, used to have a very robust supply of natural gas. And in the last decade or so, that's been decreasing. So they find themselves really undersupplied on the natural gas side for their domestic needs. And, of course, we sell all of our gas currently into the domestic market at pricing that's slightly advantaged and makes those projects down there very competitive with the rest of our domestic portfolio. Outside of that, the U.S. gas growth is really -- the majority of that 80 million a day is really associated gas that's coming off of our liquids rich and oil plays. Yeah. Doug, thanks for the question. This is Ezra. Yeah. The cumulative free cash flow over the three-year period in the three-year scenario here that you highlighted on slide five, it's roughly 10% higher than the previous three years here that we have. So you see expanding margins in that three-year scenario. And unfortunately what we haven't given you is some of those specific details that you're really getting into. What we have talked about, and we talked about this in November, and then you and I talked about it again in your conference there in November, is our maintenance capital number currently is midpoint of 4.5 under a variety of different scenarios for a multi-basin organic growth company like ourselves, that maintenance capital will kind of range from 4.2 to 4.8. And that depends on, again, are we trying to keep oil flat, equivalents flat. Are we really just focused on maintaining production? Or are we actually investing in additional exploration and infrastructure and things of that nature? When you look and roll that into the three-year scenario, since we are growing volumes, you're right, that maintenance capital should be trending up a little bit. That's also going to be offset in the real world by some of the deflationary factors that we have moving towards us throughout this three-year plan. What I would say is that we don't see that the free cash flow is flatlining. In fact, what we see is a 6% cash flow and free cash flow per share compound annual growth rate across that three-year scenario. Yeah. Doug, to quote you, that is a bit of a random question. We're always organically exploring for things. With regards to the Canadian assets, we were up there a number of years ago and we strategically exited that asset. At the real heart of your question, the way to think about the strategy for us is we've captured a tremendous resource down here in South Texas in the Dorado natural gas play. What we're building is a low-cost gas business that really sits alongside our core oil investment. And so when we think about capital allocation, it's not necessarily allocating more capital to gas rather than oil. It's really looking at these assets in place independently and what's the best thing for the company to continue to drive down our breakevens, continue to build value for the shareholders. With regards to the Utica and some of the other emerging assets, in a lot of ways our premium and double premium return threshold makes us a little bit ambivalent or agnostic to the actual hydrocarbon type that we're producing because again, these things are really a return-based question. When you layer in the macro environment, we do need to have consideration on that. Going forward with the gas market, this year definitely does look a little bit soft. We touched on that just a little with Leo's question at the top of the Q&A. But we still do remain constructive on the U.S. domestic gas market, say, 12 months and further out from here as the LNG demand continues to come on. And with some of the announcements we've made today, you can see that we plan on being a part of that solution going forward. Scott, that's a good question. I think when we think about buybacks, again, we think about what's the best way to create long-term shareholder value. That's it. You're right. We've seen our multiple compressed. We've seen really multiples compressed across all of industry. I think you don't have to look any further than the weighting of energy in the S&P 500 at approximately 5%, maybe a little bit under that, with close to 10% on forecasted earnings. So I do think we sit currently in what we'd say is a dislocated environment. And from that regard, I think as we move forward and generate a significant amount of free cash flow this year with our minimum commitment to shareholders to return 70% of that free cash flow to our shareholders, you could anticipate that being more in the form of buybacks right now. Now, when we look back at what we have done historically on buybacks, in 2023, we were very active in the first half of the year, during some real dramatic dislocations, I would say, regional banking crisis and the debt ceiling conversations and things like that. Now, we did, as an example, take a step back on buybacks in Q3 as oil price rose from $69 to $93 throughout that quarter. And obviously, there was some share price appreciation as well. And then in the fourth quarter with volatility entering the sector, again, the continued multiple compression across industry and across EOG, we obviously stepped back into it. When we think about it, we think about the strength of the company as we continue to improve. I think you can see with our three-year scenario, we continue to expand the free cash flow potential of the company. We continue to do that while generating high returns. I think really -- like I said, currently, we would consider ourselves in a dislocated environment. Yeah. Thanks, Neil. That's a good point. I think you will continue to see -- so far our models is here for U.S. growth might start there since we're going to be talking about associated gas is really where your question is. It's roughly around a 500,000 barrel total liquids. So roughly say 300,000 barrels more along the crude oil. And obviously, the significant amount of that is going to be coming out of the Permian, which in general, that basin is a little bit higher GOR than some of the historical plays like the Eagle Ford and the Bakken that we've had. And I think you'll continue to see -- our model would suggest you'll continue to see an increase in the associated gas and more than likely a bit more of a differential struggles there with Waha. We take that into consideration when we're thinking about the development of Dorado. Like I said, you can't forecast a supply and demand or forecast future gas, mid-cycle gas prices without having a recognition of what's happening on the oil side. It's one of the things that makes forecasting gas so difficult. So the ultimate thing, the way that we manage our business and we're trying to grow this gas asset in concert with our oil plays is to really think about being the absolute low-cost producer. And that's one reason you haven't seen us ramp up aggressively in the Dorado asset. It's one reason you've seen us last year and this year moderate activity, because we've captured a significant resource. We think geographically it's located a place that gives us significant advantage. We've invested in some additional infrastructure, including the Dorado pipeline that's named Verde, that's going to give us a margin expansion over the life of that asset. And that's really the way that we're focusing on developing a pure gas asset is really in concert with the growing future North American demand, which is dominantly driven from the LNG there along the Gulf Coast. Yeah. Well, as we've talked about before, we're focused on creating shareholder value through the cycles. And the consistent way that we've been able to generate that value is through organic exploration, a focus on low-cost operations and a commitment to capital discipline. We have a high level of confidence in our existing portfolio, and it's aimed at improving the financial performance of the company. And again, I think you can see that with expanded margins and expanded free cash flow in that three-year scenario we provided. It's underpinned with a 10 billion barrel of equivalent premium resource. And we have meaningful upside with that resource, not only through future conversions, future exploration, but also just through the Utica resource that we've already captured and we've begun discussing. When you think about our organic exploration effort, our first mover advantage on the three emerging assets, the Dorado North Powder -- I'm sorry, Powder River Basin and the Utica, those three individual assets have the ability to represent, the equivalence of a smaller midsize E&P company, quite frankly. Dorado with 160,000 acres and approximately 20 TCF captured, the Powder River Basin with multiple targets across 380,000 acres, and the Utica asset with over 400,000 acres. So we continue to focus on improving the inventory, not just expanding it. Unproven resources, we do think trade at a wider discount these days than what proven resources do. And so we're focused on continuing to prove up and drive down the cost of these assets and bring them forward to create that value for our shareholders. Yeah. John, great question. And yeah, you pretty much hit it on the head. It really just flexes as we move kind of across our acreage into different sections and as the geology changes. So you will see that. If you look at the last four years, you really do see that flex back and forth because we're moving section to section and with our codevelopment strategies strategically codeveloping up from the bottom up to the top of it. So yeah, it will flex kind of through the next handful of years that you see in that three-year scenario."

            "content": "Thanks, Billy. For our 2024 plan, we forecast a $6.2 billion CapEx program to deliver 3% oil volume growth and 7% total production growth. We expect to see some deflation throughout the year, and our forecasting well cost to be down a low single-digit percentage compared to last year. The primary drivers are a 10% to 15% reduction in tubulars and ancillary service costs. Our plan reflects increased investment in long-term strategic infrastructure in the Delaware Basin and Dorado, which are expected to reduce operating costs and expand margins for the life of these assets. These projects are highlighted on slide seven of our presentation, and Lance will discuss them in greater detail in a moment. I'd like to highlight that our year-over-year direct capital efficiency is improving, which is illustrated in our capital program breakdown on slide six of our earnings presentation. In addition to the operational improvements Billy mentioned, our company-wide average treated lateral length per well is increasing by 10% in 2024. These improved efficiencies and longer laterals have resulted in a decrease in the number of drilling rigs by four, frac fleets by two, and our net wells by 40 compared to last year. The ability to grow our volumes year-over-year for less direct CapEx is a testament to the improved well performance and operational efficiency gains we are realizing across our operating area. When looking at our activity in 2024, EOG remains focused on progressing each one of our plays at a measured pace that allows us to capture and implement valuable learnings while realizing consistent improvement. In our foundational plays, specifically the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford, our teams are executing at a high level, and we expect to maintain consistent activity compared to 2023. For Dorado, we remain excited about this 21 TCF resource potential asset and the role it will play in meeting growing global natural gas demand. Throughout last year, our team made good progress on improving operational efficiencies and recoveries. For 2024, we expect to moderate activity compared to 2023. A balanced approach to our investment in Dorado will allow us to maintain consistent operations to advance and improve the play while continuing to remain flexible as we monitor the natural gas market. In the Utica play, our technical and operations teams continue to make great progress. Our latest three-well Xavier package delivered initial 30-day average production of 3,250 barrel of oil equivalent per day with 55% oil and 75% liquids. The Xavier wells were drilled at 800-foot spacing, which is tighter than the Timberwolf package at 1,000-foot spacing. We are pleased that all of our package wells to date have come online at production levels exceeding results from our initial individual test wells. For 2024, we expect to increase our activity level to one full rig, continue to test well spacing, and delineate our acreage across the play. Our next four-well package, named White Rhino, is located in the southern part of the Utica, and we expect these wells to come online in the first half of the year. In the Powder River Basin, our team has continued to improve well productivity in the Mowry Formation. We have observed double-digit increases in oil and BOE productivity per well due to improved targeting and our consistent package development. Moving into 2024, we expect to moderate activity levels, and along with Mowry development, will begin testing packages in the shallower Niobrara Formation in our primary development area. I would like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication that has positioned the company for another outstanding year. We are excited about executing our 2024 plan. EOG remains focused on running the business for the long-term, generating high returns through disciplined growth, operational execution, and investing in projects that will lower the future cost bases of the company. Now here's Lance to discuss infrastructure. Yeah, Leo. This is Jeff. And yeah, great point. So, we had a lot of great success as we talked about in our opening comments with our Mowry program there. We're seeing increases in overall productivity in that target by about 10% year-over-year, both on oil and BOE. And really what it has to do with is just us getting the package development on our corridor and really understanding how to offset those parent packages with additional activity. So with that, though, we've also been able to really accumulate data with drilling all those Mowry wells up through that overlying Niobrara. So we're going to shift gears here a little bit there since we've been able to refine our geologic models. And we're going to go ahead and start testing some of the package development in that shallower Niobrara formation right along our primary infrastructure corridor. So really when you look at our program, it's just a slight step back on the Mowry and a little bit more focused now to kind of really figure out the geologic models in the Niobrara and get some package production performance on. So activity will be equally split really kind of between the Mowry and the Niobrara formations. So it's very similar to what we did in the Delaware Basin. Really we developed from the bottom up and it's a similar codevelopment strategy really just to maximize the value of the asset. Yeah, Neal. This is Jeff. So yeah, we always tend to carry somewhere between a six-month to a 12-year inventory. And it really does give us an advantage to kind of strike on opportunistic purchases. And I think that's one of the things, if you look at this year, really the primary drivers that we're seeing, as far as deflation is really going to be those tubular costs, which we're expecting to be down kind of 10% to 15%. That's really a credit to our procurement team to be able to really find really opportunistic times to be able to buy the pipe and go ahead and add that to our inventory. So we're able to see that price drop throughout this year. And then the other thing I'd say is really the other drop we're seeing is in ancillary services really supporting kind of drilling and completions. We see kind of a 10% to 15% drop in those support services such as coal tubing, wire line, cement and other such. So seeing some movement there on the deflationary front. We think from an overall tubular standpoint, we're in great position for 2024. Yeah, Roger, this is Jeff. Thanks for the question. So the lateral links have been a pretty big driver in our efficiency gains. We've had an opportunity to test longer laterals over the last few years pretty much throughout our multi-basin portfolio, and all of them with good success. So based on -- basically drilling longer where it's applicable based on our acreage footprint. And that's one of the limiting factors that we run into. In San Antonio, we've talked about, the years, our 15 years of drilling there, we've moved from the east, which has a little bit more robust geology out to the west, which has a little lesser geology. But we've been able to really optimize the economics there by utilizing longer laterals and really pushing our completion techniques to improve operational and capital efficiencies. And we're continuing to do that this year. So we're seeing some extension there in the Eagle Ford. In the Utica, we've talked about, we've been doing delineation up and down the 140-mile oily fairway there. And now we're starting to move into spacing packages and then just package development. So the majority of those wells are going to be three miles moving forward. So that's an increase in the overall lateral length of the company there. And then in Midland, we've been testing three-mile laterals for the last couple of years, but not really in high volume. Last year we drilled about four or five of them. And we've seen really good success. And we've been able to find the correct blocks and places that works with our acreage. We're going to increase that to about over 53-mile laterals there in Midland. So when you kind of roll it all up across the company, the overall lateral length will be up about 10% versus 2023 program. And we talked about, with those efficiency gains from the lateral length and just what we're seeing from some of the stuff Billy talked on the drilling and completion side, we're going to require that four less rigs and two less frac fleets and then also four less net wells. But all while doing that, we're still going to be completing a similar amount of total lateral length as we did with our 2023 program. So the way I'd look at it is we're just riding a lot of momentum with our efficiencies and our lateral lengths coming out of 2023. We'll just continue to look to build on that in 2024. Yeah, Matt. This is Jeff. No, I wouldn't look at it as a pause necessarily in the program. I think it's just a shift. We've gathered really good data. We've had great results in that Mowry target. We've had great efficiency gains and cost improvement. And our plan always was once we were able to gather some really robust data sets on the overlying to go ahead and step into the Niobrara a little bit, which, with that we'll back off with our packages in the Mowry to do so. So, Niobrara as far as from -- in the Mowry from a drilling aspect, they're a little bit different. The Niobrara is going to be a little bit easier drilling, I would say, compared to the Mowry because the Mowry is deeper. And then also in there you have some [indiscernible] you can get caught into and have some issues. The Niobrara, on the other hand is -- there's clinaforms [ph] and really we've mapped those clinaforms out well to find out what the better producers are. So we really want to be strategic as we mark across our acreage to make sure we're staying in those right clinaforms. And I think that really has to do with the discipline pace that we're looking at there in the Powder."

        "content": "Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to EOG Resources Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir.\nTim Driggers: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those and our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release, and EOG's SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, definitions and reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures can be found on the EOG's website. In addition, some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves, and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SECs reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Leitzel, EVP Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP Marketing; and Piers Hammond, VP Investor Relations. Here's Ezra.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Over the past five years, EOG has increased production 33%, decrease per unit operating costs 17% generated over $20 billion of free cash flow and over $20 billion in net income. We've increased our regular dividend rate nearly 350% and including both regular and special dividends paid and committed to have returned about $13 billion directly to shareholders, all while reducing total debt by more than 40%. At the core of our historical and future success of EOG's employees who embrace and embody the EOG culture. And our third quarter results continue to reflect our employees outstanding execution, strong performance and our foundational Delaware basin and Eagle Ford assets, as well as continued progress across our emerging plays have delivered production volumes, capital expenditures, and per unit operating costs better than expectations, and enabled us to raise our full year oil production guidance and reduce our full year cash operating costs guidance. In addition to announcing third quarter results yesterday, we demonstrated our confidence in the outlook for our business by increasing the regular dividend 10%, announcing a $1.50 per share special dividend and raising our cash return commitment to shareholders beginning in 2024, to a minimum of 70% of annual free cash flow. Our annualized regular dividend is now $3.64 per share, which represents the highest regular dividend yield amongst our peers and is competitive with the broader market. This dividend increase reflects two things. First, the progress we continue to make on our cost structure by leveraging technology and innovation sustainably improves EOGs capital efficiency. Furthermore, we expect the advantages of operating in multiple basins will drive additional improvements to EOGs cost structure and returns and reduce the break-even oil price to fund the dividend in the years ahead. Today we estimate that we can maintain our current level of production and fund the $2.1 billion regular dividend commitment at an oil price as low as $45 WTI. Second, this dividend increase reflects our confidence in EOGs expanding portfolio of premium plays to grow the company's future income and future free cash flow. This quarter we've highlighted recent well performance results in the newest addition to our premium portfolio of assets, the Utica combo play. Over the last several years, our success in organic exploration continues to add low-cost reserves and consistently drive down our DD&A rate enabling EOG to create value through industry cycles. Beyond our regular dividend, which we've never cut or suspended, we raised our cash return commitment to shareholders to a minimum of 70% of annual free cash flow beginning in 2024. Alongside our portfolio of premium assets, and our cash flow margins EOGs balance sheet continues to strengthen allowing us to supplement the dividend with a larger commitment of future free cash flow through special dividends and share repurchases. In addition to the $1.50 per share special dividend declared yesterday, we executed additional opportunistic share repurchases for the third consecutive quarter. For 2023, we estimate our committed cash return will be about 75% of free cash flow. EOG continues to consistently execute lower our cost structure through innovation efficiencies, and organically grow the quality of our portfolio to improve capital efficiency and free cash flow potential. Our transparent cash return strategy is anchored to a sustainable growing regular dividend and backstopped by an impeccable balance sheet. EOG is in a better position than ever to deliver value for our shareholders through industry cycles and play a leading role in the long-term future of energy. Here's Tim to review our financial position.\nTim Driggers: Thanks, Ezra. EOG delivered superb operating and financial performance in the third quarter. Oil production increased 4% year over year, while total production was up 9% year-over-year per unit cash operating costs declined by 5% from the prior year period. The DD&A rate fell by 9% year-over-year driven by the addition of reserves at lower finding costs compared to our production base. Capital Expenditures came in at $1.52 billion, $140 million below our target, mostly due to the timing of non-well related expenditures, such as infrastructure projects. Year-to-date, CapEx of $4.5 billion is 75% of the full year guidance. We earned adjusted net income of $3.44 per share in the third quarter, and generated free cash flow of $1.5 billion. We announced a $1.50 per share special dividend and during the third quarter we spent $61 million on share repurchases, bringing total 2023 share repurchases through the third quarter to $671 million, at an average price of $108 per share. In total, we're on track to return $4.1 billion of cash to shareholders this year, in the form of regular dividends, special dividends and repurchases. This equates to about 75% of our estimated 2023 free cash flow higher than our 2023 minimum commitment of 60% of annual free cash flow return to shareholders. Overall, it was a strong quarter driven by solid operational execution and improving capital efficiency. Here's Billy to review operations.\nBilly Helms: Thanks, Tim. EOGs operational performance continues to improve and this quarter is another example. We exceeded our third quarter forecast across the board on volumes per unit operating cost and CapEx. Thanks goes to our employees for consistently delivering the EOG value proposition quarter-after-quarter. Third quarter volumes exceeded guidance largely due to accelerated timing of activity within the quarter driven primarily by improved efficiencies, as well as some benefits from better well productivity. Efficiencies in our completion efforts have reduced the time to bring wells to sales. For example, in our Eagle Ford play, the completed lateral fleet per day has increased 19% year-over-year. The team has also reduced non-productive time by 31%, which is the added benefit of lowering total well cost. In addition, our new completion design continues to drive performance improvements in the Delaware basin, with targeted laterals realizing a 20% increase in productivity. Well productivity improvements is the primary reason we were able to increase the full year oil guidance by 1500 barrels of oil per day. Last quarter, we reduced our full year guidance for total unit cash operating cost, mostly due to lower release operating expense and reduced transportation cost. Our third quarter performance continued that trend. Our production teams are optimizing both production and cost through our many technology applications that allow for real-time decisions to maximize production and reduce interruptions of third-party downtime. These cross functional efforts by our production, marketing and information systems teams continue to pay dividends. Once again, we are lowering our guidance for full year cash operating costs by approximately 2% this quarter, bringing our total reduction since the start of the year to 3% or nearly $0.30 per BOE. Capital Expenditures in the third quarter were lower than expected due to timing of infrastructure projects, as well as variances in activity across our multi-basin portfolio. We expect to maintain our current levels of activity for the remainder of the year, and our full year capital guidance is unchanged. For 2024, we are currently evaluating this year's results as we develop our plans for each of our plays. As a reminder, we invest to generate returns and growth is a byproduct of the investments in our highly economic multi-basin portfolio. We are very pleased that the levels of activity across our portfolio are at a pace that allows for continuous learning and improvements, and thus we'd expect to maintain similar levels of activity through 2024. With the strong results we're achieving in our emerging plays, we anticipate a few additional wills in both the Utica and Dorado. As we typically do each year, we will remain focused on managing costs through the cycle by contracting for about 50% of services and leveraging our scale and consistent activity levels to build and maintain strong partnerships with service providers. As a result, we're able to take a longer-term view to sustainably lower well cost over time. This year is shaping up to be another solid year performance for EOG. And I remain excited about the opportunities we see through the remainder of the year and into 2024. Now here's Jeff to talk about the updates on the Utica play.\nJeff Leitzell: Thanks, Billy. In addition to sharing new well results, I'd like to review a few unique characteristics of our Utica asset to provide distinct advantages including our low cost of entry, our mineral rights position, held by production status, geologic operating environment, and downstream infrastructure status. This year we added 25,000 net acres and have now accumulated 430,000 net acres predominantly in the volatile oil window across 140-mile trend running north to south. Our leasehold cost of entry remains less than 600 per net acre. We've also acquired 100% of the mineral rights across 135,000 acres of our leasehold. Mineral rights significantly enhance the value of this play by adding 25% to our production and reserve streams for no additional well cost or operating expense. Furthermore, over 90% of the Utica acreage is held by production and requires only a handful of wells to be drilled every year to maintain. The result is more control over our development to allow us to invest in an appropriate pace to capture and incorporate technical learnings and continually improve the play. Another unique advantage of the Utica is its geologic operating environment. Due to the place favorable geologic properties, the opportunity to drive down cost through efficiencies is significant. The target zone is both shallow and consistent, which lends itself easily to drilling 3-mile laterals, and we anticipate testing even longer laterals as we continue to delineate and collect more data. Consistent geology also allows for precise targeting of the very best most productive rock. We're able to regularly drill 99 plus percent in zone within a narrow 10-foot window. As a result, this play provides an excellent geologic environment for significant efficiency improvements and low-cost operations. On Slide 11 of this quarter's investor presentation, we highlighted our strong and consistent well result to span our acreage position from the north and to the south. Our initial 4-well Timberwolf package was drilled at 1000-foot spacing and has been performing well above type curve. These 3-mile laterals each deliver an initial 30-day production averaging 2150 barrels of oil equivalent and an 85% liquid cut. With a large amount of liquids in the product mix all of the wells we have drilled today support double premium potential across our acreage position. The Utica also has the advantage of abundant midstream infrastructure, the existing processing fractionation and residue build out eliminates the need for significant new build commitments, which was a well-recognized advantage when we evaluated the play. In the north, we have placed into service, a pipeline that runs east of our acreage into the market center. In the south, we have an established reliable third-party building out a new pipeline that is expected to be in service late this year. With these trunk lines in place investment will be limited to in-field gathering as we prepare for a modest increase in activity next year. Our current plans for 2024 are to run approximately one full drilling rig that will continue to test optimal well spacing and improve operational efficiencies. Our Utica asset is another textbook example of our differentiated approach to build a diverse portfolio of premium assets predominantly through low-cost organic exploration, which adds reserves at lower finding and development costs and lowers the overall cost basis of the company. The end result is continuous improvement to EOGs company-wide capital efficiency. Our track record of successful exploration and strong operational execution has positioned the company to create shareholder value through the industry cycles. Here's Lance with a marketing update.\nLance Terveen: Thanks Jeff. In our South Texas Dorado play, we recently completed two projects to service future gas flows from this premium, dry natural gas play and natural gas treatment facility and the first phase of a 36-inch pipeline. The facility was recently placed in the service to treat gas from the Dorado play prior to transportation through our 36-inch natural gas pipeline to sales near [indiscernible], Texas. Both projects were delivered on time and under budget, a testament to our operational team and foresight to procure a pipe counter-cyclically, along with other long lead time materials. The second phase of the natural gas pipeline will kick off construction in early 2024 and is expected to be complete late next year. Phase 2 of the pipeline will terminate in the Agua Dulce, which provides access to three other pipelines with connectivity to the growing demand along the Gulf Coast and Mexico, and potential premium pricing relative to Henry Hub. Our pipeline will be instrumental in expanding our gas sales options for the 21 TCF of net resource potential we've captured in Dorado, and perhaps more importantly, save $0.20 to $0.30 per MCF in transportation costs over the life of the asset versus third-party alternatives. Now here's is Ezra to wrap up.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Lance. EOG continues to deliver on our value proposition and our approach remains differentiated for several reasons. First, our premium return standard investments are governed by one of the highest hurdle rates in the industry 30% direct after-tax rate of return using $40 oil, and $2.50 natural gas pricing. Second is organic exploration, by prioritizing organic exploration we add inventory and reserves at lower finding and development costs. Third, our assets are unique. By remaining focused on the first two returns and organic exploration, we have built one of the largest highest return lowest cost and most diverse portfolios of assets in the business. We operate in 16 plays across nine basins and have a mass resources of 10 billion barrels of equivalents with an average finding and development cost of just $5 per barrel. At our current production level, that's equivalent to about 30 years of low cost, high margin inventory, and our assets continue to grow. Fourth is technology. We have never considered as a manufacturing process. We leverage both infield technology and information technology to improve well productivity and efficiencies. Our goal is to lower costs and expand our margins to constantly improve our existing assets and new discoveries. Thanks for listening. Now we will go to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nScott Hanold: Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the strong quarter. Ezra, I think it was pretty notable, the way you all took a step up in your fixed dividend payments. I mean, you've got a history of doing that, but it was a good step up this quarter, in addition to boosting the shareholder return program to 70%. So, can you talk about some of the more significant factors like, why make those pretty pronounced moves now? Is there something in the business model, you guys get more confidence at this point to make those moves?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Scott, thanks for the question. The decision to raise minimum cash return to 70%. Overall, it just demonstrates our commitment our shareholders. It reflects our continual improvements since the initial commitment was made nearly two years ago. And really to your question on the business model change, it's really just our ability to deliver that shareholder value. It's grounded in the fact that our strong cash return generation capacity continues to improve the strength of our industry leading balance sheet continues to improve and our commitment again to just being disciplined with our reinvestment across the entire portfolio. So we're in a position now where we feel very confident that and proud that we can increase that minimum commitment to 70%. And we look forward to being able to deliver that to the shareholders.\nScott Hanold: So when you look at those breakeven points to do that, sort of this base business, is that breakeven point then lowered from, say, where you were a year or 2 ago to where it is now?\nEzra Yacob: Yes. That's right, Scott. As we continue to invest in these higher-return, lower-cost reserves and bring them into the base business, we continue to do some strategic infrastructure spending to lower the overall cost of the company going forward. That continues to expand the free cash flow potential of the company. And that, in addition to strengthening the balance sheet, everyone knows we retired a $1.25 billion bond earlier this year, and we've been able to be not only net zero but actually put a little bit of cash on the balance sheet. All of those things are what gives us confidence in the base business going forward and the fact that we can continue to increase this minimum cash return to our shareholders from the 60% up to the 70%.\nOperator: The next question comes from Leo Mariani of ROTH MKM. Please go ahead.\nLeo Mariani: You guys spoke about sort of similar '24 activity versus 2023, but also kind of said that there might be a handful of more wells in the Utica, in the Dorado. So I just kind of wanted to get a sense there. I mean, do you see this as kind of a give-and-take proposition, where if you do a little bit more in some place, you might have kind of a few less wells and some other plays? And just trying to get a sense of how maybe costs are trending overall in wells today.\nBilly Helms: Yes, Leo. This is Billy. Yes, as far as 2024, certainly, it's too early to get into many specifics about the plan. But I would say that our plan will be based on a couple of different factors. One would be the macro environment, kind of what that looks like going into next year. The other one is really governed by what's the optimum level of activity across each of our plays that supports the objective of having continuous improvement. And so on that, on our core plays say, our foundational plays, the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin, we're very pleased with the activity levels we currently have there. And we'd expect to maintain similar levels of activity in those plays. We see the advantage of that is we are seeing continued improvement in each one of those plays, as we've talked about already on this call, And then, for our emerging plays, the Utica and the Dorado, for instance, we're very pleased with the results we're seeing to date. And so as we move into next year, we certainly want to continue that learning, and you may see a few additional wells in those plays on top of what we've done this year. As far as the cost trends, that's one reason we like to maintain these levels of activity. It allows us to improve our cost basis, improve operationally on how we're executing these wells, and we're seeing the benefits of that play out. So I'll maybe leave it at that and see what your follow-up is.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. No, that's helpful. So maybe just to kind of jump over to the Utica. Obviously, you brought a new package of wells online here. I know it's sort of early days, but when you look at these wells, do you tell yourself that you've already been able to see some improvement over the last year? Just trying to get a sense, are these wells a little better than they were, say, a year ago? And then on the cost side, in the Utica, are you starting to see maybe the cost come down a little bit here? Or maybe it's kind of early. I think you've had a target of sort of sub-$5 F&D, just not really sure kind of where you're at today.\nJeff Leitzell: Yes. Thanks, Leo. No, we're really excited about the latest package that we brought on. That's our Timberwolf package that we highlighted on Slide 11. It's in a 1,000-foot space test. And of note there, as we've talked about our new completion design down there in the Permian and the Wolfcamp, we were able to go ahead and implement that on that. And as you can see from the initial results that we talked about, the 30-day IPs on that or 2,150 BOE per day over that 30-day period. So really excited about how that's turning out from the spacing test. We have an additional package. We actually highlighted in our slide deck, Xavier. We're going to tighten the spacing on that to 800 foot, and we should have results coming on here fairly shortly. So we're very excited with the results. And with that application of new completion design, it's going to be tough to tell if that's really what the big mover is, but we're extremely excited about the results that we're seeing so far. And from a cost standpoint, we really haven't disclosed specific costs in the Utica. We're still in the early stages, as we talked about in learning in this play. We've got a lot of room for operational efficiency gains. We've got some infrastructure, small infrastructure to develop that we can install like water gathering, reuse and sand to drive down costs. And then as we said, with the well results we're seeing, we feel really confident in supporting that sub-$5 F&D cost.\nOperator: The next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead.\nArun Jayaram: Ezra, I wanted to get your thoughts maybe at a high level in 2024. On the third quarter call of last year, you provided some soft [Technical Difficulty]. I was wondering if you could maybe give us some thoughts on overall, how you see the year kind of playing out. If I look at consensus forecast, it's for about $6.1 billion of CapEx with [Technical Difficulty]. So I want to get your thoughts if you could give us some soft guidance around next year.\nBilly Helms: Yes, Arun. This is Billy. Let me try to weigh in on that for you. And I apologize if I missed some of your question, you were breaking up a little bit there. As far as 2024, as I said earlier, it's a little bit early to give specifics on the plan, but I would say just look at our activity levels we're seeing today. And I would expect to see similar levels of activity on our core foundational plays going into next year, give you some hint as to what activity levels we might have. I would expect a few additional wells next year in our emerging plays, such as the Utica and maybe Dorado. And then, as far as service costs, let me just weigh in a little bit on that while we're talking about that. We certainly understand service costs have moderated in the industry as industry activity has dropped throughout the year. The magnitude of those declines certainly varies between the services and in which basins we're operating in. We remain focused on just continuous improvement that we see in our efficiency gains throughout our operations. So we tend to use the latest technology in the highest-performing crews, which includes super-spec rigs and frac fleets. That equipment continues, as you know, to be in high demand with service pricing proving to be more resilient. We have seen drops in tubular and casing costs for next year that will tend to reduce overall well cost. But again, the magnitude of that effect on overall well cost is yet to be quantified. So as we go into next year, certainly, we expect to maintain our activity levels that we see in our core plays, a few extra wells, some softening on well cost. Overall, I think that's kind of where we're headed.\nArun Jayaram: Okay. Fair enough. Maybe one for Jeff. Jeff, if you can give some more details. You've provided your Utica type curve on Slide 11. Just wanted to get a sense of is that type curve for the entire play? Is it for the volatile oil window only? And would that be representative of both the North and the Southern portions of the play?\nJeff Leitzell: Yes. That would just be the general type curve in mix across the 140 miles kind of from North to South there in the play. So it's pretty consistent. You can see on the slide that we put our first handful of wells on there, and that's really what a lot of the type curve was going to be built off. And you can see the Timberwolf package is the most recent one that we brought on and the outperformance in that one.\nOperator: The next question comes from Philips Johnston of Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.\nPhilips Johnston: Just a few quick follow-ups for Jeff on the Utica. First, on the 55% oil cut, what sort of API are we talking about on that crew? Or is it more of a quasi-condensate type of mix there?\nLance Terveen: Hey, Philip. This is Lance. Yes, what we're seeing is still early, but what we're seeing is kind of APIs in kind of the 40s to 50s.\nPhilips Johnston: Okay. Sounds good. And then, the wells so far are pretty much all been up along the eastern edge of the acreage. And I'm pretty sure you guys have previously cited the black oil window. It's sort of in the exploratory phase still. But how does the geology change as you go West? And when would you expect to test other parts of your acreage?\nJeff Leitzell: Yes. Good question. So to kind of start off, why do we started off on the East, really the big reason with that is just we had good quality seismic data over on the east side of it when we were first starting out. And obviously, that's really important, so you can get a really good look at the detailed subsurface, any kind of drilling hazards to make sure you perform really, really clean tests. So where we started, where that seismics at, obviously, we started the delineation. We've got spacing tests in place. And then as we start to zero in on that spacing, we'll be able to kind of step out more to the west and be able to apply some of those spacing techniques to start developing out there. But we do know there's going to be variation in productivity. And as you did state, we do expect it to get more oilier as you do move out to the west.\nOperator: The next question comes from Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nNeal Dingmann: I'll maybe stick with the Utica. Just my first question, typically, would your AMI in the eastern side of the play limit in any way thoughts about incremental activity or potential additional acquisitions in that Eastern oil window?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Neal, this is Ezra. We're pretty happy with the footprint that we've been able to put together since we entered the play. I think we highlighted on the call that we've added an additional 25,000 acres, bringing our total up to 425,000 acres at very low cost. And let me just highlight again that we actually own the minerals across 130,000 mineral acres down in the southern portion of the play. So when we look at it right now, as Jeff said, we're drilling some initial spacing packages, some delineation tests where we currently have seismic. We're also this year acquiring seismic in a couple of different parts of the play. So we can continue to step out and gather results on that and provide a bigger better estimate of what we've captured here for you guys. As far as being limited on incremental activity. I want to think of it that way. Like I said, we've put together a very large contiguous acreage position. And really, our activity right now as far as investment in pace, as Billy said, is going to be determined on our ability to collect data and integrate the production data that we're seeing back into the front-end of our geologic models. The activity is really always considered to be at a pace where we can continue to learn and incorporate those learnings on the next set of wells.\nNeal Dingmann: Great details, Ezra. And then just to follow up, I want to make sure, I'll stick with the Utica. Just it sounds like you have more than ample takeaway if I hear right, on the Southern Utica, but I just want to make sure it was clear for plans on the Northern portion that. Bill, I think you're one of the guys just talking about it. Maybe just talk about the infrastructure plans and if that would capture any of the upside if you decided to boost activity in that northern area.\nLance Terveen: Yes, Neal. This is Lance. Good morning. I think what makes this place so unique is that it is just positioned to so much existing capacity. I mean, actually, in fact, when -- there's even some idle processing capacity and fractionation, ideal processing capacity that's nearby on our acreage. So when we look at that just from an infrastructure standpoint, we've been focused on more just the gathering infrastructure. And as Jeff mentioned, we put into service our pipeline in the North and then we're going to have a pipeline in the South as well. So we're going to have plenty of running room, just long-term running room as we think about the infrastructure that we're putting in place along with third parties and then also the available capacity that's in place.\nOperator: The next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDoug Leggate: I'm not loving the new dial-in system, but thanks for getting me on. Ezra, I wonder if I could hit first two things. I want to hit the cash return change and the evolution of the portfolio as you look forward. So dealing first with the 70% number, that obviously is subject to whatever the level of capital is. And I guess, the flow on the machine is that 60% of free cash flow or 70% of free cash flow is still free cash flow, which means it's entirely dependent on what you decide as a discretionary spending, which to me doesn't mean a whole lot. So what commitment can you give or at least guidance or framework for what the level of spending looks like in order for us to interpret what the increase in free cash flow commitment actually means?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Doug, it's a good question. We based our cash return model on free cash flow for a couple of reasons. It's simple but it's also pretty dynamic, and it's close to the intentions that we have over a range of different price scenarios. So we're not entering into an area where we need to modify the commitment going forward. It's something that once we come out with that commitment, hopefully, our shareholders can see by our track record that once we come out with something, we're very consistent with it. The 70% return is a minimum of free cash flow is pretty consistent with our longstanding strategy, I would say, to build shareholder value and position the company to be able to do it through industry cycles. And that means that reinvestment at the right pace in our high-return inventory, that's the best thing we can do to create shareholder value. Ultimately, the cash return strategy, it begins with our commitment to a growing and sustainable regular dividend which, again, we raised that. We increased that just 10% and that dividend has never been cut or suspended over the 25 years that we've been paying one. In addition, we've committed now to return either additional specials or buybacks to reach that 70% minimum commitment. For us, hopefully, the increased commitment, the reason we like the 70% of free cash flow is, it's consistent with our free cash flow return in that it puts the emphasis on our regular dividend, which we think is peer-leading and competitive with S&P 500. And again, we feel that we can maintain current levels of production and cover that base dividend at WTI prices as low as $45.\nDoug Leggate: I appreciate the new breakeven number, Ezra. That's very helpful. Thank you. My follow-up is on portfolio evolution because, I guess, we all know that 10 years is not the number, I guess, for EOG. But yet your slide deck continues to refer to 10 years of double premium. So if I assume that's dominated by the Eagle Ford and the Permian given that you're happy with that level of activity, how does it evolve if the next leg of growth is Dorado, Utica in terms of mix? And I guess what I'm really driving at is, our channel checks on midstream suggests you could potentially be drilling north of 300 wells in the Utica in 2026. Does that sound reasonable to you in which case, what's the implication for mix?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Doug, I'm not going to speculate on 2026. As Billy said, it's a little bit early to be speculating on 2024. What I'd come back to is our disciplined base of investment. We have a lot of flexibility in the Utica. Specifically, we've got over 90 or roughly 90% of the acreage there is held by preexisting production. We only have a minor drilling commitment there. So we're in a great spot where we can actually develop that asset in a disciplined ability to increase activity commensurate with the increase of our learnings. Now overall, your question is recently our exploration efforts have yielded very high return, more combo plays, or in Dorado case, a gas play, and that's true. And there's something to be said for that. Our exploration and emphasis, I would say is dominantly more oil-focused because the margins are a bit more forgiving on oil from what we see. But ultimately, with our premium investment hurdle rate, and that's at bottom cycle pricing of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas through the life of the asset, we're somewhat agnostic to the product mix. Now it does require a heavy lift, by Lance, to discover new market potentials for us. And we continue to invest in different parts of the infrastructure and supply chain to lower our costs and lower our break-evens. But ultimately, we're investing in high-return assets and we continue to build out the inventory in a high return framework. More than the 10 years of double premium drilling, I think I'd steer you towards the 10 billion barrels of equivalents overall that is, at a finding and development cost, lower than our current DD&A rate. And as I said in the opening remarks, that contemplates maintenance levels at current levels of production, roughly 30 years of production. So we're very confident in the high-return inventory that we put together and believe that it's going to continue to deliver great shareholder value in the future.\nOperator: The next question comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.\nCharles Meade: Billy, I'm going to make one more run at the '24 outlook. I think you've laid out that the activity levels are going to be pretty similar to '23. If I look at or if I try to think about the big moving pieces, you're going to have some efficiency gains, some capital efficiency gains, especially as some costs come down. On the other side, you have a slightly higher base production. So is it a reasonable stake in the ground to think that you guys can have similar results of '23 in the sense of low single-digit oil growth and kind of low-teens NGL and natural gas growth?\nBilly Helms: Thanks, Charles. Yes, this is Billy. For '24, we've kind of said it's a little early to get specifics about things. But I would point you to the fact that we're running at a pretty decent level of activity now. We're going to maintain that same level of activity going into next year. Now just a reminder, we're spending about $6 billion on our CapEx program this year, and it has proved to be fairly ratable through each quarter of the year. Similar levels of activity, there will be some upward movement maybe on efficiency gains. Like you said, we'll have a little bit more efficiency gains to factor in maybe some cost reductions due to casing cost, those kind of things. We'll still have some infrastructure spend. We may drill a few more wells in the Utica and Dorado plays. And we're trying to quantify that as we go towards the end of the year. But directionally, that kind of hopefully points you towards what next year might look like. We're not going to see a big ramp up in activity in any play as we see today, small changes in capital efficiency and well cost as we go into next year, we have some infrastructure spend.\nCharles Meade: Got it. Thank you, Billy. And then, I'm not sure who this would be best for, but I'm curious about your 3-mile laterals in the Utica. It seems to me like you're pleased with the results because you mentioned that you're even considering longer laterals in the Utica. But curious if you could address that point? And then also whether we can expect to see 3-mile laterals in other key plays for you guys? And if yes, where, or if no, what's special about the Utica that it works there and not in other places?\nBilly Helms: Yes. Charles. This is Billy again. Let me give you kind of an overview and then Jeff may add some more color. The 3-mile laterals in the Utica, yes, we're very excited about that play and its ability to do these longer laterals very efficiently on the operational side. We're drilling these things in record times and making progress with each pattern of wells we drill. And we feel we have line of sight on being able to continue to reduce cost over the longer-term period as we apply learnings from other plays into this area. So that's going to continue. Now we're also drilling longer laterals in some other plays. We've drilled some 3-mile laterals in the Eagle Ford and we're drilling 3-mile laterals in the Delaware Basin. So we expect that trend to continue in each of our plays. Now Jeff might want to add some colors on what we're seeing on performance there, too.\nJeff Leitzell: Yes. Just a little bit to add in. In the Delaware, in the Eagle Ford and in Utica, we've had great operational efficiency with our 3-mile laterals. And that's one of the things, as you start stretching out the length of these laterals, you want to make sure that operationally you don't have any issues on the drilling side and you're able to optimally complete that. And we've seen really, really good results with that. The other thing we're also seeing is by drilling these longer laterals, we're able to supplement 1 vertical with a 3-mile lateral versus 2 verticals and a 2-mile lateral. So we're able to see substantial cost savings there anywhere from kind of 15% to 25%. So we're definitely excited about where we're seeing it. Obviously, it ties in with our leasehold, and we have to see where we can actually drill 3-mile laterals. But we are looking to expand that across our plays moving into next year and beyond.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: The enhanced completion technique in the Delaware appears to be a success, if I heard correctly, 20% uplift in productivity. But there has been a question regarding applicability as you've talked about in the past. What's your latest thinking on how widely applicable the technique is across the play? And will there be an increase in the number of wells completed with the technique next year?\nJeff Leitzell: Yes, Scott. Just there's no major updates this quarter, especially just in the Permian with the Wolfcamp. We're still seeing the outstanding strong results that we talked about earlier. Consistently 20% uplift in the first year production in EOR. The thing I would say is there in the Permian, we do have a handful of tests up in the shallower targets, and that's really where our focus is shifting out there. We hope to bring those on towards the end of this year and kind of the first half of next year. And once we get those results, we'll go ahead and share those with. But then around the rest of the plays, we talked about in the Powder River Basin, we do have a test in the ground we're currently evaluating there. And then more so over in the Utica, obviously, we started applying that with all of our new designs there. So seeing good results, but we're still just kind of collecting data and we'll see exactly what formations that we have success with moving forward.\nScott Gruber: Got it. And then a follow-up on the South Texas pipeline. Does the completion of Phase 2 of the pipeline later next year influence how you think about the cadence of activity in Dorado? Are you inclined to add rigs into the play later in '24 to set the stage for a stronger growth once the pipeline is complete?\nBilly Helms: Yes, Scott. This is Billy. Phase 2, first of all, we're very excited about that project. Getting that pipeline is going to give us access to multiple markets in that basin. The pace of activity in Dorado is really governed by our learnings and results more so than the pipeline date. Certainly, we're excited about the pipeline, because as Lance laid out, it's going to allow us to save $0.20 or $0.30 in Mcf over the life of those reserves, which is 21 Tcf of reserves, But the pace of activity is really governed by how we see the macro and our learnings as we progress to play really independent of the pipeline.\nLance Terveen: And then this is Lance, too. Some of the other strategic things we've done as you think about Phase 2, once we go in service, just to start, we already have existing capacity with other existing markets that are in place. But as Billy mentioned, really excited about getting to what we're going to potentially see as premium markets because we've got offtake agreements already in place, 2 of those which are very strategic. One of those, obviously, is with Cheniere and excited to see the development and momentum they're getting with the Stage 3 facility where we'll be a big piece of. And then, just two, the Transco, we'll have a strategic connection there. And that's going to give us access all the way up essentially the Gulf Coast Corridor, getting all the way into the premium market. So again, really excited about that as well, just from an offtake capability as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from Derrick Whitfield of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nDerrick Whitfield: I have two questions related to topics not covered yet. So first question, I wanted to focus on your CCS pilot, was the benefit of a year of experience in the pilot. I wonder to see if you could speak to some of the learnings to date and applicability of the pilot to your larger operations as a means to achieve net zero.\nBilly Helms: Yes, Derrick, this is Billy. Yes, the CCS pilot project, we're very excited about that project, what we've learned and how we can move forward with the play. So as far as how we've learned, there's a lot of operational things we've kind of uncovered as we develop that project, how we think about the CO2 we're sequestering, how we store it, how we move it, the pipeline infrastructure, the equipment we need, those kind of things. But also technically, what we've learned there as well. One thing we bring to the table on all these CCS projects, we have an immense amount of understanding of geological areas to store the carbon and our ability to map out those zones. And then we're also very good at drilling wells. So applying those 2 things give us some advantage on projects as we move forward. What we've learned in some of the monitoring we've done so far is very supportive of our initial thoughts on the play and how we can store the CO2 and observe its movement in the ground and be able to have confidence that we can store that for a sustainable period of time. So we're learning a lot. We're very pleased with the results we're seeing. Now we're also looking beyond our pilot project to see where else we can apply that technology. And it's early to say yet where we're going to take that, but needless to say, we're encouraged with what we're doing and excited about the opportunities moving forward.\nScott Gruber: Great. And then, second, I wanted to lean in on your shallow water exploration schedule. With offshore drilling rig rates approaching historic levels and industry messaging sustained strength, how does that impact your views on the timeline for exploration wells and, more importantly, development activities, assuming exploration success?\nBilly Helms: Yes, Derrick. This is Billy again. Certainly, for offshore, as you mentioned there, the rig utilization is pretty tight or I'd say it's pretty high. So the market remains pretty tight on offshore rigs. We are very happy and pleased with the activity we have ongoing in Trinidad. We've been in the Trinidad, just a reminder, we've been in Trinidad for over 30 years. And currently, we have line of sight on probably one of our longest running programs we've ever had in the history of that play. And so we've secured a rig there for that operation and very pleased with the results we've seen to date. So now moving forward, as far as our exploration activity, certainly we're interested in pursuing other shallow water offshore opportunities in the company, and mainly because we've built quite a bit of expertise of drilling these offshore wells very efficiently and cost competitively compared to the industry. So we think that gives us a strategic advantage being able to pursue these kind of opportunities around the world. So we're continuing to look for those opportunities. And certainly, those opportunities would factor in the cost of doing business today the current offshore rig environment. And they'd have to be competitive with what we're doing in the rest of our portfolio. So looking at it that way, we see opportunities to continue to pursue that and excited about what that looks like going forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nitin Kumar of Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nNitin Kumar: Why don't we go back to the Delaware for a minute? As I look at your slides, and there were 2 things that you were doing in the Delaware this year. You were also increasing the mix of your Wolfcamp oil in the drilling schedule and then there were the enhancements that you made. Could you break out the improvement that you're seeing between the mix and then the new technologies that you're talking about?\nJeff Leitzell: Yes. This is Jeff. The first thing I'd say is in the Delaware, our technical teams, they're doing an outstanding job of continuing to build on their understanding of the subsurface geology, their geologic models. And really what they're focused on is increasing the value of each of our development units by maximizing and improving the overall NPV. So really, we look at it from kind of a total bench standpoint when we go into development. Now when we're looking at productivity and you talk about that, the wells are looking outstanding and we're kind of seeing a marked improvement year-over-year. We've seen good increase in productivity across the majority of our benches, and really the Wolfcamp as about a lot is kind of leading the way due to that new completion design. But the one thing that we always want to go ahead and highlight is, we have a large acreage footprint, over 400,000 acres. We've got high number of unique targets that we co-develop based off the very unique geology in each one of these areas. So you're going to see when you look at individual well results or even roll-up for the play, you're going to see that quarter-to-quarter variations in productivity and well performance. But ultimately, we're really happy with all the results that we see and it's hitting all the expectations and we have all of that built into our forecast.\nNitin Kumar: Great. I guess the reason I'm asking this question is one of your peers in the play has talked about improving recovery rates, not just optimizing the well but actually improving recovery rates with the application of technology and they've talked about 20% gains. So I guess, given your experience in shale and, of course, your track record, I'm curious to see if you have seen technologies or are seeing technologies that could help that recovery factor increase not, just optimizing the wells but really a step change in what you're drawing from the rock.\nBilly Helms: Yes, Nitin. This is Billy. Let me give you a little more color on that in general. As far as the recovery factor, we're constantly improving or working to improve the long-term recovery in all of our plays, and it's something that goes really back to the foundation of the company and is something historically we've done, as you mentioned. We leverage a lot of technology to help us understand how we're targeting those plays and how we're completing each well. And so it involves a lot of things. And let me just talk about that in the sense of how we think about it. I mean, these unconventional plays, the completion efficiency is really important how we evolve over time. And so just thinking about how we've applied new technology, it goes back several years where we talked about the frac design itself, how we change the way we attack the well from the type of sand we pump, the spacing of the perforations, the cluster spacing, the frac rate, how we target reservoirs, our understanding geologically of how we understand the best place to place the target so we can co-develop like zones and those kind of things. So that evolution over time has caused us to see dramatic improvements in production, which is a proxy for a recovery factor over time. And the most recent example is, this is what Jeff just talked about, the improvements we've seen in our Wolfcamp play. And you can readily see, the 20% uplift we're seeing in completions in production performance is due to the completion approaches. So all those things over time lead to improved recovery factor.\nOperator: Next question comes from Josh Silverstein of UBS. Please go ahead.\nJosh Silverstein: Just on the updated 70% shareholder return level. How are you thinking about excess free cash flow beyond this? Will you look to increase the exploration budget, or could you, in theory, increase the shareholder returns to 90%? Any thoughts would be helpful here just to get the cash balance can keep growing substantially next year and there's no maturity until 2025.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Josh. This is Ezra. Ultimately, I think the answer to your question is that 70% is a minimum hurdle. In the last couple of years since we first came out with the initial cash return guidance, we had a minimum cash return commitment of 60%. In 2022, we were at 67%, and this year you see that we're on track to be north of 70%, probably closer to 75%. So I think that's the way you should be thinking about the guidance on there. And really, the big thing with our free cash flow commitment, it's a minimum of that 70%. But again, it's really founded in and hopefully, it doesn't remove the focus from our regular dividend. The regular dividend, we feel, is the best indicator of a company's ongoing performance, the improved capital efficiency going forward. And it's a commitment that we give to our shareholders based on our ability to continue to lower the break-evens and expand the sustainable future free cash flow generation in the company. It's backstopped with a pristine balance sheet. And in this quarter, when we raised it to 10%, One of the ways that we raised is by looking at what does it take on a breakeven there. And as we talked about before, we can support this new $2.1 billion regular dividend in commitment. At a range of maintenance CapEx scenarios, the higher end of that range would be with a $45 WTI price. And when I say a range of maintenance capital scenarios, let me be clear when I say that. For a company like ours that has multiple basins, differing amounts year-over-year of infrastructure spend or exploration, different product types. We look at maintenance capital through the lens of what does it take to keep production flat for a 5-year period, but also across those different investment scenarios. Are we investing in the health of the company longer term with exploration or are we really just narrowing it down to just a focus on maintaining production? And so we end up with basically a range of maintenance CapEx between $4.2 billion and $4.8 billion and so a midpoint of about $4.5 million. And as I said, at the higher end, that's where we can maintain that level with the $45 WTI.\nJosh Silverstein: Got it. And last for me. As you guys are thinking about the portfolio, how are you thinking about any kind of long cycle or conventional opportunities like Trinidad to kind of add in relative to bringing on some additional unconventional growth opportunities? Thanks.\nBilly Helms: Yes, Josh. This is Billy. Let me give you a little bit of hint maybe of kind of what we're looking at. Certainly, we have a deep portfolio of unconventional plays in the things we're currently drilling today. But our active exploration program is continuously looking for all opportunities. And they're geared towards, first of all, generating solid returns and being competitive with what we're investing in today. So they will include things that are conventional or unconventional, offshore or onshore, U.S. or not. So we're looking at all kinds of things that are competitive with what our portfolio is generating today.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Yacob for any closing remarks.\nEzraYacob: Yes. I'd just like to say that we appreciate everyone's time today. One final takeaway I'd like to leave you with is that EOG's cash return announcements in the third quarter demonstrate our commitment to creating long-term value for our shareholders. We've increased our free cash flow payout minimum to 70% and increased our regular dividend 10%, and we're confident in the sustainability of our regular dividend due to the consistent execution of our value proposition that improves the company year-after-year. EOG is in a better position than ever to deliver value for our shareholders through industry cycles and play a leading role in the long-term future of energy.

            "content": "Thanks, Billy. In addition to sharing new well results, I'd like to review a few unique characteristics of our Utica asset to provide distinct advantages including our low cost of entry, our mineral rights position, held by production status, geologic operating environment, and downstream infrastructure status. This year we added 25,000 net acres and have now accumulated 430,000 net acres predominantly in the volatile oil window across 140-mile trend running north to south. Our leasehold cost of entry remains less than 600 per net acre. We've also acquired 100% of the mineral rights across 135,000 acres of our leasehold. Mineral rights significantly enhance the value of this play by adding 25% to our production and reserve streams for no additional well cost or operating expense. Furthermore, over 90% of the Utica acreage is held by production and requires only a handful of wells to be drilled every year to maintain. The result is more control over our development to allow us to invest in an appropriate pace to capture and incorporate technical learnings and continually improve the play. Another unique advantage of the Utica is its geologic operating environment. Due to the place favorable geologic properties, the opportunity to drive down cost through efficiencies is significant. The target zone is both shallow and consistent, which lends itself easily to drilling 3-mile laterals, and we anticipate testing even longer laterals as we continue to delineate and collect more data. Consistent geology also allows for precise targeting of the very best most productive rock. We're able to regularly drill 99 plus percent in zone within a narrow 10-foot window. As a result, this play provides an excellent geologic environment for significant efficiency improvements and low-cost operations. On Slide 11 of this quarter's investor presentation, we highlighted our strong and consistent well result to span our acreage position from the north and to the south. Our initial 4-well Timberwolf package was drilled at 1000-foot spacing and has been performing well above type curve. These 3-mile laterals each deliver an initial 30-day production averaging 2150 barrels of oil equivalent and an 85% liquid cut. With a large amount of liquids in the product mix all of the wells we have drilled today support double premium potential across our acreage position. The Utica also has the advantage of abundant midstream infrastructure, the existing processing fractionation and residue build out eliminates the need for significant new build commitments, which was a well-recognized advantage when we evaluated the play. In the north, we have placed into service, a pipeline that runs east of our acreage into the market center. In the south, we have an established reliable third-party building out a new pipeline that is expected to be in service late this year. With these trunk lines in place investment will be limited to in-field gathering as we prepare for a modest increase in activity next year. Our current plans for 2024 are to run approximately one full drilling rig that will continue to test optimal well spacing and improve operational efficiencies. Our Utica asset is another textbook example of our differentiated approach to build a diverse portfolio of premium assets predominantly through low-cost organic exploration, which adds reserves at lower finding and development costs and lowers the overall cost basis of the company. The end result is continuous improvement to EOGs company-wide capital efficiency. Our track record of successful exploration and strong operational execution has positioned the company to create shareholder value through the industry cycles. Here's Lance with a marketing update. Yes. Thanks, Leo. No, we're really excited about the latest package that we brought on. That's our Timberwolf package that we highlighted on Slide 11. It's in a 1,000-foot space test. And of note there, as we've talked about our new completion design down there in the Permian and the Wolfcamp, we were able to go ahead and implement that on that. And as you can see from the initial results that we talked about, the 30-day IPs on that or 2,150 BOE per day over that 30-day period. So really excited about how that's turning out from the spacing test. We have an additional package. We actually highlighted in our slide deck, Xavier. We're going to tighten the spacing on that to 800 foot, and we should have results coming on here fairly shortly. So we're very excited with the results. And with that application of new completion design, it's going to be tough to tell if that's really what the big mover is, but we're extremely excited about the results that we're seeing so far. And from a cost standpoint, we really haven't disclosed specific costs in the Utica. We're still in the early stages, as we talked about in learning in this play. We've got a lot of room for operational efficiency gains. We've got some infrastructure, small infrastructure to develop that we can install like water gathering, reuse and sand to drive down costs. And then as we said, with the well results we're seeing, we feel really confident in supporting that sub-$5 F&D cost. Yes. That would just be the general type curve in mix across the 140 miles kind of from North to South there in the play. So it's pretty consistent. You can see on the slide that we put our first handful of wells on there, and that's really what a lot of the type curve was going to be built off. And you can see the Timberwolf package is the most recent one that we brought on and the outperformance in that one. Yes. Good question. So to kind of start off, why do we started off on the East, really the big reason with that is just we had good quality seismic data over on the east side of it when we were first starting out. And obviously, that's really important, so you can get a really good look at the detailed subsurface, any kind of drilling hazards to make sure you perform really, really clean tests. So where we started, where that seismics at, obviously, we started the delineation. We've got spacing tests in place. And then as we start to zero in on that spacing, we'll be able to kind of step out more to the west and be able to apply some of those spacing techniques to start developing out there. But we do know there's going to be variation in productivity. And as you did state, we do expect it to get more oilier as you do move out to the west. Yes. Just a little bit to add in. In the Delaware, in the Eagle Ford and in Utica, we've had great operational efficiency with our 3-mile laterals. And that's one of the things, as you start stretching out the length of these laterals, you want to make sure that operationally you don't have any issues on the drilling side and you're able to optimally complete that. And we've seen really, really good results with that. The other thing we're also seeing is by drilling these longer laterals, we're able to supplement 1 vertical with a 3-mile lateral versus 2 verticals and a 2-mile lateral. So we're able to see substantial cost savings there anywhere from kind of 15% to 25%. So we're definitely excited about where we're seeing it. Obviously, it ties in with our leasehold, and we have to see where we can actually drill 3-mile laterals. But we are looking to expand that across our plays moving into next year and beyond. Yes, Scott. Just there's no major updates this quarter, especially just in the Permian with the Wolfcamp. We're still seeing the outstanding strong results that we talked about earlier. Consistently 20% uplift in the first year production in EOR. The thing I would say is there in the Permian, we do have a handful of tests up in the shallower targets, and that's really where our focus is shifting out there. We hope to bring those on towards the end of this year and kind of the first half of next year. And once we get those results, we'll go ahead and share those with. But then around the rest of the plays, we talked about in the Powder River Basin, we do have a test in the ground we're currently evaluating there. And then more so over in the Utica, obviously, we started applying that with all of our new designs there. So seeing good results, but we're still just kind of collecting data and we'll see exactly what formations that we have success with moving forward. Yes. This is Jeff. The first thing I'd say is in the Delaware, our technical teams, they're doing an outstanding job of continuing to build on their understanding of the subsurface geology, their geologic models. And really what they're focused on is increasing the value of each of our development units by maximizing and improving the overall NPV. So really, we look at it from kind of a total bench standpoint when we go into development. Now when we're looking at productivity and you talk about that, the wells are looking outstanding and we're kind of seeing a marked improvement year-over-year. We've seen good increase in productivity across the majority of our benches, and really the Wolfcamp as about a lot is kind of leading the way due to that new completion design. But the one thing that we always want to go ahead and highlight is, we have a large acreage footprint, over 400,000 acres. We've got high number of unique targets that we co-develop based off the very unique geology in each one of these areas. So you're going to see when you look at individual well results or even roll-up for the play, you're going to see that quarter-to-quarter variations in productivity and well performance. But ultimately, we're really happy with all the results that we see and it's hitting all the expectations and we have all of that built into our forecast."

            "content": "Thanks Jeff. In our South Texas Dorado play, we recently completed two projects to service future gas flows from this premium, dry natural gas play and natural gas treatment facility and the first phase of a 36-inch pipeline. The facility was recently placed in the service to treat gas from the Dorado play prior to transportation through our 36-inch natural gas pipeline to sales near [indiscernible], Texas. Both projects were delivered on time and under budget, a testament to our operational team and foresight to procure a pipe counter-cyclically, along with other long lead time materials. The second phase of the natural gas pipeline will kick off construction in early 2024 and is expected to be complete late next year. Phase 2 of the pipeline will terminate in the Agua Dulce, which provides access to three other pipelines with connectivity to the growing demand along the Gulf Coast and Mexico, and potential premium pricing relative to Henry Hub. Our pipeline will be instrumental in expanding our gas sales options for the 21 TCF of net resource potential we've captured in Dorado, and perhaps more importantly, save $0.20 to $0.30 per MCF in transportation costs over the life of the asset versus third-party alternatives. Now here's is Ezra to wrap up. Hey, Philip. This is Lance. Yes, what we're seeing is still early, but what we're seeing is kind of APIs in kind of the 40s to 50s. Yes, Neal. This is Lance. Good morning. I think what makes this place so unique is that it is just positioned to so much existing capacity. I mean, actually, in fact, when -- there's even some idle processing capacity and fractionation, ideal processing capacity that's nearby on our acreage. So when we look at that just from an infrastructure standpoint, we've been focused on more just the gathering infrastructure. And as Jeff mentioned, we put into service our pipeline in the North and then we're going to have a pipeline in the South as well. So we're going to have plenty of running room, just long-term running room as we think about the infrastructure that we're putting in place along with third parties and then also the available capacity that's in place. And then this is Lance, too. Some of the other strategic things we've done as you think about Phase 2, once we go in service, just to start, we already have existing capacity with other existing markets that are in place. But as Billy mentioned, really excited about getting to what we're going to potentially see as premium markets because we've got offtake agreements already in place, 2 of those which are very strategic. One of those, obviously, is with Cheniere and excited to see the development and momentum they're getting with the Stage 3 facility where we'll be a big piece of. And then, just two, the Transco, we'll have a strategic connection there. And that's going to give us access all the way up essentially the Gulf Coast Corridor, getting all the way into the premium market. So again, really excited about that as well, just from an offtake capability as well."

            "name": "Billy Helms",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. EOGs operational performance continues to improve and this quarter is another example. We exceeded our third quarter forecast across the board on volumes per unit operating cost and CapEx. Thanks goes to our employees for consistently delivering the EOG value proposition quarter-after-quarter. Third quarter volumes exceeded guidance largely due to accelerated timing of activity within the quarter driven primarily by improved efficiencies, as well as some benefits from better well productivity. Efficiencies in our completion efforts have reduced the time to bring wells to sales. For example, in our Eagle Ford play, the completed lateral fleet per day has increased 19% year-over-year. The team has also reduced non-productive time by 31%, which is the added benefit of lowering total well cost. In addition, our new completion design continues to drive performance improvements in the Delaware basin, with targeted laterals realizing a 20% increase in productivity. Well productivity improvements is the primary reason we were able to increase the full year oil guidance by 1500 barrels of oil per day. Last quarter, we reduced our full year guidance for total unit cash operating cost, mostly due to lower release operating expense and reduced transportation cost. Our third quarter performance continued that trend. Our production teams are optimizing both production and cost through our many technology applications that allow for real-time decisions to maximize production and reduce interruptions of third-party downtime. These cross functional efforts by our production, marketing and information systems teams continue to pay dividends. Once again, we are lowering our guidance for full year cash operating costs by approximately 2% this quarter, bringing our total reduction since the start of the year to 3% or nearly $0.30 per BOE. Capital Expenditures in the third quarter were lower than expected due to timing of infrastructure projects, as well as variances in activity across our multi-basin portfolio. We expect to maintain our current levels of activity for the remainder of the year, and our full year capital guidance is unchanged. For 2024, we are currently evaluating this year's results as we develop our plans for each of our plays. As a reminder, we invest to generate returns and growth is a byproduct of the investments in our highly economic multi-basin portfolio. We are very pleased that the levels of activity across our portfolio are at a pace that allows for continuous learning and improvements, and thus we'd expect to maintain similar levels of activity through 2024. With the strong results we're achieving in our emerging plays, we anticipate a few additional wills in both the Utica and Dorado. As we typically do each year, we will remain focused on managing costs through the cycle by contracting for about 50% of services and leveraging our scale and consistent activity levels to build and maintain strong partnerships with service providers. As a result, we're able to take a longer-term view to sustainably lower well cost over time. This year is shaping up to be another solid year performance for EOG. And I remain excited about the opportunities we see through the remainder of the year and into 2024. Now here's Jeff to talk about the updates on the Utica play. Yes, Leo. This is Billy. Yes, as far as 2024, certainly, it's too early to get into many specifics about the plan. But I would say that our plan will be based on a couple of different factors. One would be the macro environment, kind of what that looks like going into next year. The other one is really governed by what's the optimum level of activity across each of our plays that supports the objective of having continuous improvement. And so on that, on our core plays say, our foundational plays, the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin, we're very pleased with the activity levels we currently have there. And we'd expect to maintain similar levels of activity in those plays. We see the advantage of that is we are seeing continued improvement in each one of those plays, as we've talked about already on this call, And then, for our emerging plays, the Utica and the Dorado, for instance, we're very pleased with the results we're seeing to date. And so as we move into next year, we certainly want to continue that learning, and you may see a few additional wells in those plays on top of what we've done this year. As far as the cost trends, that's one reason we like to maintain these levels of activity. It allows us to improve our cost basis, improve operationally on how we're executing these wells, and we're seeing the benefits of that play out. So I'll maybe leave it at that and see what your follow-up is. Yes, Arun. This is Billy. Let me try to weigh in on that for you. And I apologize if I missed some of your question, you were breaking up a little bit there. As far as 2024, as I said earlier, it's a little bit early to give specifics on the plan, but I would say just look at our activity levels we're seeing today. And I would expect to see similar levels of activity on our core foundational plays going into next year, give you some hint as to what activity levels we might have. I would expect a few additional wells next year in our emerging plays, such as the Utica and maybe Dorado. And then, as far as service costs, let me just weigh in a little bit on that while we're talking about that. We certainly understand service costs have moderated in the industry as industry activity has dropped throughout the year. The magnitude of those declines certainly varies between the services and in which basins we're operating in. We remain focused on just continuous improvement that we see in our efficiency gains throughout our operations. So we tend to use the latest technology in the highest-performing crews, which includes super-spec rigs and frac fleets. That equipment continues, as you know, to be in high demand with service pricing proving to be more resilient. We have seen drops in tubular and casing costs for next year that will tend to reduce overall well cost. But again, the magnitude of that effect on overall well cost is yet to be quantified. So as we go into next year, certainly, we expect to maintain our activity levels that we see in our core plays, a few extra wells, some softening on well cost. Overall, I think that's kind of where we're headed. Thanks, Charles. Yes, this is Billy. For '24, we've kind of said it's a little early to get specifics about things. But I would point you to the fact that we're running at a pretty decent level of activity now. We're going to maintain that same level of activity going into next year. Now just a reminder, we're spending about $6 billion on our CapEx program this year, and it has proved to be fairly ratable through each quarter of the year. Similar levels of activity, there will be some upward movement maybe on efficiency gains. Like you said, we'll have a little bit more efficiency gains to factor in maybe some cost reductions due to casing cost, those kind of things. We'll still have some infrastructure spend. We may drill a few more wells in the Utica and Dorado plays. And we're trying to quantify that as we go towards the end of the year. But directionally, that kind of hopefully points you towards what next year might look like. We're not going to see a big ramp up in activity in any play as we see today, small changes in capital efficiency and well cost as we go into next year, we have some infrastructure spend. Yes. Charles. This is Billy again. Let me give you kind of an overview and then Jeff may add some more color. The 3-mile laterals in the Utica, yes, we're very excited about that play and its ability to do these longer laterals very efficiently on the operational side. We're drilling these things in record times and making progress with each pattern of wells we drill. And we feel we have line of sight on being able to continue to reduce cost over the longer-term period as we apply learnings from other plays into this area. So that's going to continue. Now we're also drilling longer laterals in some other plays. We've drilled some 3-mile laterals in the Eagle Ford and we're drilling 3-mile laterals in the Delaware Basin. So we expect that trend to continue in each of our plays. Now Jeff might want to add some colors on what we're seeing on performance there, too. Yes, Scott. This is Billy. Phase 2, first of all, we're very excited about that project. Getting that pipeline is going to give us access to multiple markets in that basin. The pace of activity in Dorado is really governed by our learnings and results more so than the pipeline date. Certainly, we're excited about the pipeline, because as Lance laid out, it's going to allow us to save $0.20 or $0.30 in Mcf over the life of those reserves, which is 21 Tcf of reserves, But the pace of activity is really governed by how we see the macro and our learnings as we progress to play really independent of the pipeline. Yes, Derrick, this is Billy. Yes, the CCS pilot project, we're very excited about that project, what we've learned and how we can move forward with the play. So as far as how we've learned, there's a lot of operational things we've kind of uncovered as we develop that project, how we think about the CO2 we're sequestering, how we store it, how we move it, the pipeline infrastructure, the equipment we need, those kind of things. But also technically, what we've learned there as well. One thing we bring to the table on all these CCS projects, we have an immense amount of understanding of geological areas to store the carbon and our ability to map out those zones. And then we're also very good at drilling wells. So applying those 2 things give us some advantage on projects as we move forward. What we've learned in some of the monitoring we've done so far is very supportive of our initial thoughts on the play and how we can store the CO2 and observe its movement in the ground and be able to have confidence that we can store that for a sustainable period of time. So we're learning a lot. We're very pleased with the results we're seeing. Now we're also looking beyond our pilot project to see where else we can apply that technology. And it's early to say yet where we're going to take that, but needless to say, we're encouraged with what we're doing and excited about the opportunities moving forward. Yes, Derrick. This is Billy again. Certainly, for offshore, as you mentioned there, the rig utilization is pretty tight or I'd say it's pretty high. So the market remains pretty tight on offshore rigs. We are very happy and pleased with the activity we have ongoing in Trinidad. We've been in the Trinidad, just a reminder, we've been in Trinidad for over 30 years. And currently, we have line of sight on probably one of our longest running programs we've ever had in the history of that play. And so we've secured a rig there for that operation and very pleased with the results we've seen to date. So now moving forward, as far as our exploration activity, certainly we're interested in pursuing other shallow water offshore opportunities in the company, and mainly because we've built quite a bit of expertise of drilling these offshore wells very efficiently and cost competitively compared to the industry. So we think that gives us a strategic advantage being able to pursue these kind of opportunities around the world. So we're continuing to look for those opportunities. And certainly, those opportunities would factor in the cost of doing business today the current offshore rig environment. And they'd have to be competitive with what we're doing in the rest of our portfolio. So looking at it that way, we see opportunities to continue to pursue that and excited about what that looks like going forward. Yes, Nitin. This is Billy. Let me give you a little more color on that in general. As far as the recovery factor, we're constantly improving or working to improve the long-term recovery in all of our plays, and it's something that goes really back to the foundation of the company and is something historically we've done, as you mentioned. We leverage a lot of technology to help us understand how we're targeting those plays and how we're completing each well. And so it involves a lot of things. And let me just talk about that in the sense of how we think about it. I mean, these unconventional plays, the completion efficiency is really important how we evolve over time. And so just thinking about how we've applied new technology, it goes back several years where we talked about the frac design itself, how we change the way we attack the well from the type of sand we pump, the spacing of the perforations, the cluster spacing, the frac rate, how we target reservoirs, our understanding geologically of how we understand the best place to place the target so we can co-develop like zones and those kind of things. So that evolution over time has caused us to see dramatic improvements in production, which is a proxy for a recovery factor over time. And the most recent example is, this is what Jeff just talked about, the improvements we've seen in our Wolfcamp play. And you can readily see, the 20% uplift we're seeing in completions in production performance is due to the completion approaches. So all those things over time lead to improved recovery factor. Yes, Josh. This is Billy. Let me give you a little bit of hint maybe of kind of what we're looking at. Certainly, we have a deep portfolio of unconventional plays in the things we're currently drilling today. But our active exploration program is continuously looking for all opportunities. And they're geared towards, first of all, generating solid returns and being competitive with what we're investing in today. So they will include things that are conventional or unconventional, offshore or onshore, U.S. or not. So we're looking at all kinds of things that are competitive with what our portfolio is generating today."

            "content": "Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those and our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release, and EOG's SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, definitions and reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures can be found on the EOG's website. In addition, some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves, and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SECs reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Leitzel, EVP Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP Marketing; and Piers Hammond, VP Investor Relations. Here's Ezra. Thanks, Ezra. EOG delivered superb operating and financial performance in the third quarter. Oil production increased 4% year over year, while total production was up 9% year-over-year per unit cash operating costs declined by 5% from the prior year period. The DD&A rate fell by 9% year-over-year driven by the addition of reserves at lower finding costs compared to our production base. Capital Expenditures came in at $1.52 billion, $140 million below our target, mostly due to the timing of non-well related expenditures, such as infrastructure projects. Year-to-date, CapEx of $4.5 billion is 75% of the full year guidance. We earned adjusted net income of $3.44 per share in the third quarter, and generated free cash flow of $1.5 billion. We announced a $1.50 per share special dividend and during the third quarter we spent $61 million on share repurchases, bringing total 2023 share repurchases through the third quarter to $671 million, at an average price of $108 per share. In total, we're on track to return $4.1 billion of cash to shareholders this year, in the form of regular dividends, special dividends and repurchases. This equates to about 75% of our estimated 2023 free cash flow higher than our 2023 minimum commitment of 60% of annual free cash flow return to shareholders. Overall, it was a strong quarter driven by solid operational execution and improving capital efficiency. Here's Billy to review operations."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Ezra Yacob",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Over the past five years, EOG has increased production 33%, decrease per unit operating costs 17% generated over $20 billion of free cash flow and over $20 billion in net income. We've increased our regular dividend rate nearly 350% and including both regular and special dividends paid and committed to have returned about $13 billion directly to shareholders, all while reducing total debt by more than 40%. At the core of our historical and future success of EOG's employees who embrace and embody the EOG culture. And our third quarter results continue to reflect our employees outstanding execution, strong performance and our foundational Delaware basin and Eagle Ford assets, as well as continued progress across our emerging plays have delivered production volumes, capital expenditures, and per unit operating costs better than expectations, and enabled us to raise our full year oil production guidance and reduce our full year cash operating costs guidance. In addition to announcing third quarter results yesterday, we demonstrated our confidence in the outlook for our business by increasing the regular dividend 10%, announcing a $1.50 per share special dividend and raising our cash return commitment to shareholders beginning in 2024, to a minimum of 70% of annual free cash flow. Our annualized regular dividend is now $3.64 per share, which represents the highest regular dividend yield amongst our peers and is competitive with the broader market. This dividend increase reflects two things. First, the progress we continue to make on our cost structure by leveraging technology and innovation sustainably improves EOGs capital efficiency. Furthermore, we expect the advantages of operating in multiple basins will drive additional improvements to EOGs cost structure and returns and reduce the break-even oil price to fund the dividend in the years ahead. Today we estimate that we can maintain our current level of production and fund the $2.1 billion regular dividend commitment at an oil price as low as $45 WTI. Second, this dividend increase reflects our confidence in EOGs expanding portfolio of premium plays to grow the company's future income and future free cash flow. This quarter we've highlighted recent well performance results in the newest addition to our premium portfolio of assets, the Utica combo play. Over the last several years, our success in organic exploration continues to add low-cost reserves and consistently drive down our DD&A rate enabling EOG to create value through industry cycles. Beyond our regular dividend, which we've never cut or suspended, we raised our cash return commitment to shareholders to a minimum of 70% of annual free cash flow beginning in 2024. Alongside our portfolio of premium assets, and our cash flow margins EOGs balance sheet continues to strengthen allowing us to supplement the dividend with a larger commitment of future free cash flow through special dividends and share repurchases. In addition to the $1.50 per share special dividend declared yesterday, we executed additional opportunistic share repurchases for the third consecutive quarter. For 2023, we estimate our committed cash return will be about 75% of free cash flow. EOG continues to consistently execute lower our cost structure through innovation efficiencies, and organically grow the quality of our portfolio to improve capital efficiency and free cash flow potential. Our transparent cash return strategy is anchored to a sustainable growing regular dividend and backstopped by an impeccable balance sheet. EOG is in a better position than ever to deliver value for our shareholders through industry cycles and play a leading role in the long-term future of energy. Here's Tim to review our financial position. Thanks, Lance. EOG continues to deliver on our value proposition and our approach remains differentiated for several reasons. First, our premium return standard investments are governed by one of the highest hurdle rates in the industry 30% direct after-tax rate of return using $40 oil, and $2.50 natural gas pricing. Second is organic exploration, by prioritizing organic exploration we add inventory and reserves at lower finding and development costs. Third, our assets are unique. By remaining focused on the first two returns and organic exploration, we have built one of the largest highest return lowest cost and most diverse portfolios of assets in the business. We operate in 16 plays across nine basins and have a mass resources of 10 billion barrels of equivalents with an average finding and development cost of just $5 per barrel. At our current production level, that's equivalent to about 30 years of low cost, high margin inventory, and our assets continue to grow. Fourth is technology. We have never considered as a manufacturing process. We leverage both infield technology and information technology to improve well productivity and efficiencies. Our goal is to lower costs and expand our margins to constantly improve our existing assets and new discoveries. Thanks for listening. Now we will go to Q&A. Yes, Scott, thanks for the question. The decision to raise minimum cash return to 70%. Overall, it just demonstrates our commitment our shareholders. It reflects our continual improvements since the initial commitment was made nearly two years ago. And really to your question on the business model change, it's really just our ability to deliver that shareholder value. It's grounded in the fact that our strong cash return generation capacity continues to improve the strength of our industry leading balance sheet continues to improve and our commitment again to just being disciplined with our reinvestment across the entire portfolio. So we're in a position now where we feel very confident that and proud that we can increase that minimum commitment to 70%. And we look forward to being able to deliver that to the shareholders. Yes. That's right, Scott. As we continue to invest in these higher-return, lower-cost reserves and bring them into the base business, we continue to do some strategic infrastructure spending to lower the overall cost of the company going forward. That continues to expand the free cash flow potential of the company. And that, in addition to strengthening the balance sheet, everyone knows we retired a $1.25 billion bond earlier this year, and we've been able to be not only net zero but actually put a little bit of cash on the balance sheet. All of those things are what gives us confidence in the base business going forward and the fact that we can continue to increase this minimum cash return to our shareholders from the 60% up to the 70%. Yes, Neal, this is Ezra. We're pretty happy with the footprint that we've been able to put together since we entered the play. I think we highlighted on the call that we've added an additional 25,000 acres, bringing our total up to 425,000 acres at very low cost. And let me just highlight again that we actually own the minerals across 130,000 mineral acres down in the southern portion of the play. So when we look at it right now, as Jeff said, we're drilling some initial spacing packages, some delineation tests where we currently have seismic. We're also this year acquiring seismic in a couple of different parts of the play. So we can continue to step out and gather results on that and provide a bigger better estimate of what we've captured here for you guys. As far as being limited on incremental activity. I want to think of it that way. Like I said, we've put together a very large contiguous acreage position. And really, our activity right now as far as investment in pace, as Billy said, is going to be determined on our ability to collect data and integrate the production data that we're seeing back into the front-end of our geologic models. The activity is really always considered to be at a pace where we can continue to learn and incorporate those learnings on the next set of wells. Yes, Doug, it's a good question. We based our cash return model on free cash flow for a couple of reasons. It's simple but it's also pretty dynamic, and it's close to the intentions that we have over a range of different price scenarios. So we're not entering into an area where we need to modify the commitment going forward. It's something that once we come out with that commitment, hopefully, our shareholders can see by our track record that once we come out with something, we're very consistent with it. The 70% return is a minimum of free cash flow is pretty consistent with our longstanding strategy, I would say, to build shareholder value and position the company to be able to do it through industry cycles. And that means that reinvestment at the right pace in our high-return inventory, that's the best thing we can do to create shareholder value. Ultimately, the cash return strategy, it begins with our commitment to a growing and sustainable regular dividend which, again, we raised that. We increased that just 10% and that dividend has never been cut or suspended over the 25 years that we've been paying one. In addition, we've committed now to return either additional specials or buybacks to reach that 70% minimum commitment. For us, hopefully, the increased commitment, the reason we like the 70% of free cash flow is, it's consistent with our free cash flow return in that it puts the emphasis on our regular dividend, which we think is peer-leading and competitive with S&P 500. And again, we feel that we can maintain current levels of production and cover that base dividend at WTI prices as low as $45. Yes, Doug, I'm not going to speculate on 2026. As Billy said, it's a little bit early to be speculating on 2024. What I'd come back to is our disciplined base of investment. We have a lot of flexibility in the Utica. Specifically, we've got over 90 or roughly 90% of the acreage there is held by preexisting production. We only have a minor drilling commitment there. So we're in a great spot where we can actually develop that asset in a disciplined ability to increase activity commensurate with the increase of our learnings. Now overall, your question is recently our exploration efforts have yielded very high return, more combo plays, or in Dorado case, a gas play, and that's true. And there's something to be said for that. Our exploration and emphasis, I would say is dominantly more oil-focused because the margins are a bit more forgiving on oil from what we see. But ultimately, with our premium investment hurdle rate, and that's at bottom cycle pricing of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas through the life of the asset, we're somewhat agnostic to the product mix. Now it does require a heavy lift, by Lance, to discover new market potentials for us. And we continue to invest in different parts of the infrastructure and supply chain to lower our costs and lower our break-evens. But ultimately, we're investing in high-return assets and we continue to build out the inventory in a high return framework. More than the 10 years of double premium drilling, I think I'd steer you towards the 10 billion barrels of equivalents overall that is, at a finding and development cost, lower than our current DD&A rate. And as I said in the opening remarks, that contemplates maintenance levels at current levels of production, roughly 30 years of production. So we're very confident in the high-return inventory that we put together and believe that it's going to continue to deliver great shareholder value in the future. Yes, Josh. This is Ezra. Ultimately, I think the answer to your question is that 70% is a minimum hurdle. In the last couple of years since we first came out with the initial cash return guidance, we had a minimum cash return commitment of 60%. In 2022, we were at 67%, and this year you see that we're on track to be north of 70%, probably closer to 75%. So I think that's the way you should be thinking about the guidance on there. And really, the big thing with our free cash flow commitment, it's a minimum of that 70%. But again, it's really founded in and hopefully, it doesn't remove the focus from our regular dividend. The regular dividend, we feel, is the best indicator of a company's ongoing performance, the improved capital efficiency going forward. And it's a commitment that we give to our shareholders based on our ability to continue to lower the break-evens and expand the sustainable future free cash flow generation in the company. It's backstopped with a pristine balance sheet. And in this quarter, when we raised it to 10%, One of the ways that we raised is by looking at what does it take on a breakeven there. And as we talked about before, we can support this new $2.1 billion regular dividend in commitment. At a range of maintenance CapEx scenarios, the higher end of that range would be with a $45 WTI price. And when I say a range of maintenance capital scenarios, let me be clear when I say that. For a company like ours that has multiple basins, differing amounts year-over-year of infrastructure spend or exploration, different product types. We look at maintenance capital through the lens of what does it take to keep production flat for a 5-year period, but also across those different investment scenarios. Are we investing in the health of the company longer term with exploration or are we really just narrowing it down to just a focus on maintaining production? And so we end up with basically a range of maintenance CapEx between $4.2 billion and $4.8 billion and so a midpoint of about $4.5 million. And as I said, at the higher end, that's where we can maintain that level with the $45 WTI. Yes. I'd just like to say that we appreciate everyone's time today. One final takeaway I'd like to leave you with is that EOG's cash return announcements in the third quarter demonstrate our commitment to creating long-term value for our shareholders. We've increased our free cash flow payout minimum to 70% and increased our regular dividend 10%, and we're confident in the sustainability of our regular dividend due to the consistent execution of our value proposition that improves the company year-after-year. EOG is in a better position than ever to deliver value for our shareholders through industry cycles and play a leading role in the long-term future of energy. Thank you."

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir.\nTim Driggers: Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG\u2019s SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures can be found on EOG\u2019s website. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC\u2019s reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Jeff Leitzell, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor Relations and Finance. Here is Ezra.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results reflect exceptional execution throughout our multi-basin portfolio. Production volumes, CapEx, cash operating costs and DD&A all beat targets driving another quarter of excellent financial performance. We earn $1.5 billion of adjusted net income and generated $1 billion of free cash flow, year-to-date we've generated free cash flow of $2.1 billion. That free cash flow and cash on the balance sheet funded year-to-date cash returned to shareholders of $2.2 billion, including more than $600 million of share repurchases executed during the first half of the year.  Taking into account our full year regular dividend, we have committed to return $3.1 billion to shareholders in 2023, or about 67% of our estimated 2023 cash flow assuming a $75 oil price well ahead of our target minimum return of 60%. EOGs peer-leading regular dividend is currently the majority of the $3.1 billion of cash return and committed to shareholders this year. Our sustainable growing regular dividend which we have never cut nor suspended remains the first priority to return cash.  We also continue to leverage special dividends and buybacks to return additional cash depending on market conditions through the first two quarters of 2023 we've deployed more than $600 million to opportunistically repurchase shares during times of increased volatility. And while our cash return strategy remains consistent, what has evolved since putting the $5 billion repurchase authorization in place over a year and a half ago, is the fundamental strength of our business. And we continue to get better through relentless execution of and commitment to EOGs value proposition.  We invest in high return projects across our multi-basin portfolio, adding lower costs reserves, which reduces our breakeven and expands our margins. We are now actively investing in five premium basins, more than any time in our history. Our foundational assets in the Delaware Basin an Eagle Ford continue to consistently deliver and we're pleased by the outstanding progress across our emerging Southern Powder River Basin, Ohio Utica Combo, and South Texas Dorado plays.  Well productivity and cost performance are meeting or beating expectations across our portfolio as we invest and develop each asset at a pace that supports consistent execution and continued innovation. We continue to lower the cost basis of our company, utilizing technology and innovation that improves well performance and lowers well costs to sustainably reduce our finding and development costs, efficiencies and infrastructure investments are lowering current and future unit operating costs and contribute to our emissions reduction efforts.  Finally, we have further strengthened our pristine balance sheet this year, while generating significant free cash flow and funding our transparent cash return strategy, which is designed to deliver consistent shareholder value through the cycle. And heading into the second half of 2023. Our continued performance gains will be complemented by strong fundamentals. Oil demand has been resilient despite volatility in the first half of the year, and demand is showing signs of continued growth through the second half of the year. Strong inventory drawers since the start of the year have pulled oil inventories below five year averages and refinery utilization remains high. Production growth in the U.S. is on pace to deliver similar rates as 2022, while exiting the year with significantly less activity as public companies continue to demonstrate discipline. And it appears OPEC+ are following through on an ounce production cuts. The culmination of these actions should further reduce inventory levels and place upward pressure on pricing through year end.  Regarding North American natural gas, while inventory levels remain above the five-year average, prices have firmed up recently, reflecting a reduction in natural gas drilling, and an increase in demand from both power generation and LNG exports. These trends should support a more balanced supply and demand environment late this year and heading into 2024. We remain constructive on the longer term gas story for the U.S. supported by recent LNG project approvals, and the growing petrochemical complex on the Gulf Coast.  And we're especially pleased with Dorados place in the market, as one of the lowest cost supplies of natural gas in the U.S. with an advantage location and emissions profile. EOGs value proposition is delivering results and the strength of our business has never been better to deliver value for the shareholders through industry cycles and play a leading role in the long term future of energy.  Now here's Tim to review our financial position.\nTim Driggers: Thanks, Ezra. EOG delivered excellent operating and financial performance in all areas in the second quarter. Oil production increased 3% year-over-year while total production increased 5%. Per unit cash operating costs remained essentially flat from the prior year period despite industry wide inflation. Compared to the first quarter, however, per unit cash operating costs declined by 5% and were lower in all four categories. We're beginning to see the benefits of lower cost improve our operating margin.  The DD&A rate fell by 10% year-over-year driven by the addition of reserves at lower finding costs compared to our production base. Capital expenditures came in at $1.5 billion $130 million below our target and just slightly above the first quarter level. The difference was mostly due to the timing of non-well related costs such as infrastructure projects. Year-to-date CapEx of $3 billion is 50% of the full year budget.  The improving capital efficiency of our assets, consistent operational execution, along with the application of innovation and technology to lower costs is making a big impact on the financial performance of the company. We earned adjusted net income of $2.49 per share in the second quarter, and generated free cash flow of $1 billion. Return on capital employed for the last 12 months is 29% at an average WTI oil price of $81 and Henry Hub natural gas price of about $5.  Here's Billy to review operations.\nBilly Helms: Thanks, Tim. I would like to first thank our employees for their commitment and dedication that led to another quarter of exceptional execution. EOG once again meet our forecasted targets and delivered a near perfect quarter. As a result, we have completed the first half of the year ahead on volumes, and ahead on total per unit cash operating cost. Our volume performance in the first half of the year is due to several factors. The performance of new wells is outpacing our forecast, primarily in the Delaware Basin, part of which is due to our new completion design. We're also experiencing less downtime due to market interruptions than previously planned, our investments in infrastructure along with real time data analytics provided the control and flexibility needed to redirect sales volumes to different markets to maintain production. Unit cash operating costs through the first half of the year average 5% below the midpoint of our quarterly guidance, due to a combination of several factors including lower lease operating expenses, as well as reduced transportation cost.  Lower workover and compression related expense reduced LOE, while transportation costs benefited from the flexibility to sell into more favorable markets throughout the quarter. Credit goes to the cross functional efforts of our production, marketing and information systems teams, who remain focused on sustainable, low cost operations quarter after quarter. We have line of sight to maintain these cost improvements throughout the year, and as a result have reduced our full year guidance for total unit cash operating cost.  Operationally, EOG is firing on all cylinders. Our foundational Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin plays are delivering exceptional results. While our emerging plays benefit from learnings and technology transfer across our multi-basin portfolio. Our decentralized structure supports innovation in each operating area, which much and much like independent technology incubators, and compounds the impact of that innovation by taking ideas born in one area and expanding them across multiple basins and across multiple functions. Across every operating area, our frontline engineers and geologists work that technology every day to lower cost and improve well performance. We look for strategic opportunities to vertically integrate certain services within the supply chain, where we find an opportunity to better align those services with our goals. That includes areas like downhole drilling motors, drilling mud, sand and water. Developing such capabilities in-house significantly improves the cost structure of the company.  This quarter we're highlighting drilling performance improvements in the south Texas Dorado, South Powder River Basin Mowry and the Ohio Utica Combo plays. Our emerging plays are moving up the learning curve faster due to the benefit of drilling advancements, and the application of technology over the past decade.  We continue to evolve our proprietary suite of applications, powered by real time high frequency data and analytics to assist our frontline employees to collaborate and make decisions faster. The combined benefit of these efforts has already contributed to an increase of up to 25% in drilling feet per day for wells and our emerging plays this year. In our Ohio Utica play, we recently drilled a 15,700-foot lateral in 2.6 days and 100% in zone.  Capitalization expenditures for the first half are also a running light, due primarily to the infrastructure span that has been deferred into the second half of the year. It is worth noting the economic impact of our investments in EOG owned infrastructure. Our realized U.S. oil price in the second quarter was $1.23 above WTI. And U.S. natural gas was essentially flat to Henry Hub.  CapEx for our drilling and completion program are right on track. The rate of change for inflation this year is consistent with what we'd anticipated started the year. So we still see line of sight to limit year-over-year well cost inflation in \u201823 to just 10% While any additional softening of service cost in this year has the potential to impact 2024. It's simply too early to predict. The market remains too dynamic, particularly given the constructive outlook for oil in the second half of the year.  Furthermore, we remain focused on generating long-term, sustainable cost reductions, driven by utilizing the highest quality equipment and the highest performing teams, which are less exposed to the leading edge price declines that we see in more marginal equipment. Our $6 billion capital program is focused -- is forecasted to deliver 3% or volume growth and 6% total liquid growth. In Dorado, our South Texas Natural Gas play, we delayed the timing of plant completions earlier this year, and about five wells had been pushed into early 2024. Thus, we reduced our full year gas volume guidance accordingly.  We maintained our drilling pace in Dorado to build operational momentum and capture the corresponding efficiencies. As a result, we're seeing a 16% improvement in our drilling times for Dorado. As shown on slide 11 of our updated Investor Presentation. We\u2019re constructive on natural gas longer term, and believe Dorado will be one of the lowest cost and lowest emission supplies of natural gas in the U.S. and will compete on a global scale.  This year started out with many challenges, but also many opportunities to continue to improve the company. I am very pleased with the progress our teams continue to deliver and remain optimistic about the second half of the year, and how the company has positioned for the future.  Now I'll turn the call over to Ken to discuss progress on lowering our emissions.\nKen Boedeker : Thanks, Billy. We're continuing to make outstanding progress on our emissions goals. As a preview to our 2022 sustainability report that will be published in September, we are excited to announce that we've reached three significant near term goals well ahead of schedule. First, our 2022 GHG intensity rate of 13.3 metric tons of CO2e per Mboe as less than our 2025 goal of 13.5.  Second, our 2022 methane emissions percentage is 0.04% of our natural gas produced and is significantly less than our 2025 goal of 0.06%. And third, we have achieved our zero routine flaring goal in 2023, well ahead of our 2025 target, and significantly ahead of the World Bank initiative, which strives to attain zero routine flaring by 2030. We have also confirmed that our wellhead gas capture rate for 2022 was 99.9% of the gas produced.  We continue to expand our in-house continuous methane monitoring technology named iSense and finished 2022 with 95% of our production in the Delaware Basin covered by iSense monitoring. As a reminder, the power of iSense is incorporating continuous methane monitoring data with our production and facilities data and monitoring this data on a 24-hour basis in one of our four control centers.  This enhances our ability to identify potential leaks, and prioritize repairs that are needed in the field to minimize fugitive emissions. As with a number of EOG operations, it is anticipated that collection and integration of iSense data will lead to continuous improvement in facilities and production design and operations.  We're excited about the progress we've made in the last several years on our emissions performance and are very proud that we have such dedicated employees who are continuing making our operations more efficient. Their innovative solutions and push to beat expectations have driven us to exceed our goals early. We are currently assessing new goals with our operations groups and anticipate publicizing those goals in the first half of 2024.  Now, here's Ezra, to wrap up.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Ken. Our second quarter results demonstrate once again that EOGs value proposition works. We invest in high return low cost assets across a diverse multi basin portfolio. We leverage technology and innovation to sustainably lower well costs and reduce emissions. These high return low cost investments generate significant free cash flow to fund our transparent cash return strategy backstopped by a pristine balance sheet to deliver consistent shareholder value through the cycle. Most importantly, our culture is at the core of our value proposition and is our ultimate competitive advantage.  Thanks for listening we'll now go to Q&A\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Paul, please go ahead.\nPaul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning. Can you hear me okay?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, sir. Paul, go ahead, please.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Two questions, please. First, on the cash return on the free cash flow, thank you that you are paying more than 100%. Just want to see how you determine that this is the right time to pay more than 100%, or how should we reset into the future given you're already in a net cash position, should we think that there's a little bit change in the management view and the payout is going to perhaps closer to 100% until that maybe that market condition change. And also that whether we should read the second consecutive quarter of the buyback means that management now see the buyback as more of an ongoing part of the toolbox on your cash return? That's the first question.  Second question that on Dorado, the decision that to delay the five well in this year. Can you -- maybe share with us, I think Billy has mentioned that, can you share with us then what's the thinking behind the delay? I know that the Street has been bugging you that you should delay the Dorado, and you guys do it in this quarter. But I want to understand a little bit better in terms of the decision-making process behind. And the full year guidance reduction, I think it's all related to that, right? Thank you.\nEzra Yacob: Sure, Paul. This is Ezra. I think I'll take that first question and then Billy can address the second question regarding Dorado. So yes, on the first one, it's kind of a broad question on our cash return strategy. So hopefully, I hit on all the points that you're trying to get at. But first, let's start with our guidance, which has always been the minimum of 60% of free cash flow. So we've never guided to that 60% as being a specific target, it's always been a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow. The reason we like that guide is, honestly, it's pretty simple and dynamic, it's easy to understand and communicate.  The minimum of 60% is -- it can be supported over a range of price scenarios, especially when there's a pullback in prices. And really, we can underpin that with the growing sustainable regular dividend that we highlight and talk about so much. And that's what can provide really a meaningful amount of cash return through the cycle. Again, I do want to emphasize, we consider that regular dividend to still be the true hallmark of a strong and improving underlying business, and we like the message that it sends. We increased that regular dividend commensurate with the strength of the business, lowering the cost basis of the company, and also in consideration with strengthening our balance sheet.  More specifically to kind of payouts that you've seen this year, we do recognize the value of opportunistic buybacks as part of that cash return strategy is a way to create shareholder value. So I would say that really, the decision that you've seen is consistent with our overall capital allocation strategy where we buy back shares in an opportunistic manner as a means to return cash above and beyond that minimum of 60%, in addition, to our regular dividend and at times, instead of paying a special dividend.  We basically evaluate that buyback, just like we do any of our other investment decisions, whether it's exploration or drilling high-return oil and gas wells or investing in infrastructure. It's how is that investment going to create long-term shareholder value. That's what we primarily focus on.  And so the percent will fluctuate depending on a specific moment and time and what the circumstances are around our cash return strategy. But what we have guided to and what you can bank on is it's the minimum of 60% now. We highlighted -- we paid 67% out last year, and we're very well positioned halfway through the year right now where we've already committed or paid 67%, as I highlighted in the script. And all -- for the Dorado timing, I'll hand it over to Billy.\nBilly Helms: Yes. Good morning, Paul. On Dorado, we had indicated earlier in the year that we were evaluating the potential to delay some of our completions in Dorado and we are consistent with that strategy. We elected to maintain our drilling operations there, and we're seeing the benefits of that decision to play through the efficiencies we're gaining on the operational side. And we've given some color on that in our new investor deck illustrating the improvements in drilling times there in that place.  So we're very pleased with that progress. But don't forget, our investment strategy includes a gas price of investing for $2.50. That's our premium price deck when it relates to gas prices. We certainly were watching inventory levels on the gas side and just prudently decided to delay a little bit of the completions there until we saw the fundamentals improve, and so we'll be just laying some of those completions as we go into the late this year, which pushes five wells into the next year. So that's simply the thinking on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann of Truist. Neal, the line is yours.\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. As for my questions on well productivity, specifically looking at that Slide 10 of yours, certainly it appears that your Delaware wells continue to notably improve, and so what I'm wondering is this driven more by just continued D&C efficiencies. Or is it more an informational targeting? I asked that, I just was looking at the bottom through the left corner of those pies. It looks like over the years, not only the wells improving, but it looks like they're becoming more focus on that Wolfcamp oil. So I'm just wondering what is driving that, it does look very positive.\nEzra Yacob: Thank you, Neil. This is Ezra. I'm actually going to let Jeff Leitzell step in and address your question.\nJeff Leitzell: Hi, Neil. This is Jeff. On our Permian productivity, we've been really happy with how the wells have performed in the Delaware through the first half of the year. So all of our primary targets, they're performing right now as forecasted or better. And I'd say this is primarily due to just our stacked pay co-development strategy in combination with the new completion design we talked about, which has continued to be really successful in our Wolfcamp targets. And in regards to that new completion design, just kind of a quick update, we're still observing a 20% increase in both first year production and EUR for both oil and BOEs in the Wolfcamp.  So for the full year of 2023, we're planning on bringing on about 70 total Wolfcamp wells with this new design, which is nearly twice the number we've completed in 2022. And also with it, as we talked about, we're continuing to test and expand the technique in other areas and targets in the Delaware Basin along with all across our emerging plays in our multi-basin portfolio.\nNeal Dingmann: It's very helpful. And then -- and sorry about that. My second question is just on OFS costs. In the past, you all have been among the best not only just what I would say renegotiating contracts, but I know in the past, you've been able to stockpile type at the right time and all those sort of things. I'm just wondering if maybe give us a little bit of details on how you see the market now?\nBilly Helms: Yes, Neal. This is Billy. So certainly, we're seeing the service prices start to soften. But these savings from lower service costs really probably won't manifest into a lower well cost until later this year and certainly into 2024. These leading-edge prices are falling across various products and services for the industry. And certainly, it varies depending on the product in the area. I'd add that there are several factors that kind of reflect kind of where our '23 capital program is. As a company, as you mentioned there, we focused on sustainable cost reductions through our operational efficiency gains.  As a result, we do seek out the highest performing equipment in cruise, super-spec rigs, electric frac fleets, et cetera. That's really less exposed to some of these headline inflation numbers that we're seeing on the more marginal and equipments on the spot market. And the second part of that is we really anticipate that service costs would moderate through the year when we put our plan together since rig count really peaked back in November, and we built our plan in February, expecting well costs would increase no more than 10% relative to this last year. So things are really playing out exactly the way we planned.  Another point there is we do try to secure about 50% of our well costs in the start of any given year that really helps insulate us from inflationary impacts to our activity levels. And then lastly, based on how we do manage our business, we are less exposed to the volatility in service cost in any given year.  And I would remind you, as you kind of alluded to there, our well cost really only increased about 7% last year compared to the over 20% inflation that we saw in the market. So yes, it really helps us kind of manage our activity level with confidence as we go through the year. And we'll certainly remained flexible as we look into next year to see how we can position ourselves for next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Arun the line is yours. \nArun Jayaram: Yes, good morning. I was wondering if you could help us think about the second half oil production profile for EOG. It looks like your updated guidance points to a slight sequential decline in 3Q. And I just wanted to get some thoughts on to hit if there's still kind of confidence in hitting the midpoint of the oil guidance range because that would imply fourth quarter oil production number in the mid-480s to upper 480s. So help us think about the sequential movement in volumes in the second half of the year?\nBilly Helms: Yes, Arun, this is Billy. Yes, I think the thing to keep in mind is we do operate in more than one basin and multiple plays, and we have varying sizes of well packages in each play. So the timing of really the quarter-to-quarter variance in production is really driven by the timing on a quarter-to-quarter basis of how these packages across different plays come online. And even within the quarter, how that varies month-to-month within the quarter can vary -- can drive the volume profile.  And I would remind you, and I just ask you to go back and look at the change from the first quarter to the second quarter, it's actually larger than what you're seeing in the forecast from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So we would -- we are maintaining ratable activity throughout the year and just as a matter of simply timing on bringing on some of these larger packages. So, so far this year, we've either met or exceeded our volume forecast and have complete confidence in being able to meet the midpoint of our guidance.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Just a follow-up, I wanted to get some thoughts on the Ohio Utica. One of the midstream providers highlighted how they're building out, call it, a backbone in the Utica looks like you may be the anchor E&P for that investment. But I'd love to get some thoughts on the Utica. We did see that you may be pulled your TIL guidance down a little bit this year, but just an update would be helpful.\nLance Terveen: Arun, good morning. This is Lance. Yes, I would say what we're most focused on right now is just getting all the midstream infrastructure in place. So we do have two ongoing projects that are going on. We've got 1 in the north and then another one in the South as well. So what we're really focused on is linking our production to the available processing capacity.  And really, what's happening is it's a consistent strategy that we've done and all are plays, where we're going to have a balance of EOG-owned infrastructure along with strong relationships with really good working third parties. We're going to need both in the Utica Combo up there. And so right now, just focused on setting up 2024 and beyond with the infrastructure.\nKen Boedeker : Yes, Arun, this is Ken. I just want to give you a quick update on the Utica. We're making excellent progress on that program this year. We do plan to bring a 4-well package online this month and our frac crew will be starting up again in a few weeks. So the wells we drilled and completed in 2022, we do continue to deliver our expected performance, and we also continue to add acreage and look for additional low-cost opportunities to add to our position up there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Doug, the line is yours. \nDoug Leggate: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Ezra, it's a long time since we had to worry about the U.S. growing too quickly and all the whole market share battle issues that we all lived through over the last four, five years with OPEC. But in your opening remarks, you did talk about Saudi's decision to support the price or extended cuts. So I'm wondering when you sit in the boardroom and you look at what is an artificially high oil price because Saudi is cutting production arguably to support price.  How do you think about what that means for your business, the appropriate level of spending the right allocation of one could call it, windfall cash flow because it's not -- it's an artificially supported price by definition? So I'm just curious how you think about what that means to your business your cash flow is basically being subsidized again by Saudi.\nEzra Yacob: Good morning, Doug, Thanks for the question. This is Ezra. Yes, it's a dynamic environment. We had a large SPR release last year that increased the inventory levels kind of entering this year. And as those have started to come down, now they're going to start all indications that they're going to start coming down significantly faster because OPEC Plus, as I said, it looks like they are going to support their cuts to kind of bring those inventory levels down. So your point is, it's a very interesting one, and it's one we discuss regularly, obviously, and we do different scenarios around.  So in general, what I'd say is, on this year, what we look at is whether it's crude products, gasoline, distillates, either globally or domestically, inventory levels are basically in the lower half of a five-year range. Now that's a choppy five years, like we said, because of 2020 with COVID and then, of course, with 2020 with half of the year being exceptionally low and then half of the year being somewhat artificially higher with the SPR.  Outside of the last month, the last month, we've seen kind of gasoline and distillate demand being just a bit weaker domestically. But otherwise, products demand has really been in line all year with our expectations. Crude demand, has continued to increase, continue to grow. And not only with the high inventory levels that we entered the year with, but really supply, I think, has surprised everybody a little bit to the upside.  And it's not necessarily, as you pointed out, U.S. growth or new barrels, but it's really historically displaced barrels that are back online. And dominantly, what I'm talking about is Venezuela and Iran, and maybe a little bit of -- I think everyone has been a little bit surprised at least we have on the resiliency of the Russian barrels to hit the market.  So we don't forecast those as having a significant longer-term effect. And one thing that we think about when we talk about the spare capacity that's now offline with OPEC Plus is some of that spare capacity is really offsetting the previous spare capacity I just highlighted from Venezuela and Iran. So it is a little bit different from prior years. Ultimately, what we see is the increasing oil demand overall exiting this year, most estimates have it at least at 102 to exit the year, which would put us at a significantly high point.  Now to your ultimate question on how we actually look at that internally, our planning begins with everything we just talked about kind of an evaluation of the macro environment with respect to supply and demand fundamentals, including spare capacity that's off-line just by choice and spare capacity that's offline for true geopolitical reasons. But then more than that, Doug, it really does come down to evaluating across all of our premium assets both individually and collectively, we evaluate the correct investment level for each of those, the activity levels to make sure that each asset will deliver improved metrics year-over-year.  And ultimately, that will be driving optimized returns and free cash flow generation at the corporate level, and that's what will continue to set up EOG to create shareholder value in the near and long term. Honestly, the growth ends up being a real output of our ability to invest and continue to lower the cost basis of the company and provide both near-term and future free cash flow generation.\nDoug Leggate: An interesting dilemma. Ezra, thank you for your perspectives on that. A quick follow-up, hopefully, is a quick one. I wanted to touch on, I think this was asked earlier, but I wanted to elaborate just a little bit. The comments about inflation limiting to 10% this year, but it's too early to talk about 2024. You're pretty much the second to last company to have your earnings call this quarter. And pretty much everybody else has been pointing to, yes, we're going to see some deflation in 2024. I'm just -- are you just being conservative, or do you genuinely believe that there's still upside risk to capital in '24 from inflation, I mean.\nBilly Helms: No, Doug, I don't think we are anticipating that you'll see inflation into next year. I think what the comment was when we started out the year let me just clarify something. We saw inflation last year coming in the business. Rig counts kind of peaked in November of last year. We anticipated we would see a deflation in the market going into this year. And so we built our plan based on the fact that our well cost in 2023 would increase no more than 10% relative to 2022. So that's where the 10% comment comes from.  As we go into '24, I think we recognize and clearly, we're seeing deflation in our business. I'd say it's too early to predict what that level of deflation is going to do to our well cost next year. There's still a lot of market dynamics that we see in the business as Ezra just went through. And so it's early to predict what that impact that's going to have on next year's capital program as well as kind of how we choose to develop our plays across the different plays that we have to invest in. So that's the comment about too early for next year. It's just too early with the market dynamics we have for next year.\nOperator: Next question comes from Leo Mariani of ROTH Capital Partners. Leo, please go ahead. \nLeo Mariani: Yes, good morning. Just wanted to kind of touch base on some of the emerging plays, really thinking about kind of Utica and PRB. And also some of the undisclosed exploratory plays out there as well. Just trying to get a sense if generally speaking, you've seen any increased competition in these plays during the course of 2023. I mean it still seems like EOG being a bit of a lone wolf in pursuing some of these plays where others maybe aren't doing as much, but maybe there's more kind of going on behind the scenes that you guys can help out with here.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Leo, this is Ezra. Yes, we continue to see very limited competition domestically on any exploration, I think, and you can kind of see that to just in the public comments that are made. Most operators, companies, whether private or public, have really kind of picked the basin and are honing in on more of a drill down kind of specialist manufacturing mode. We continue to explore. And as Ken said, we're still looking to put on low-cost, high-quality bolt-on opportunities in some of those plays.  With respect to the Utica and PRB in specific. It's a little bit early this year on Utica. We're pleased with what we're seeing on the operations side. And as Ken said, we'll get a completion spread in there and get some results here coming up. On the PRB, we've had a very strong year. Everything has really fallen in the line there. And again, the PRB in Dorado are really benefiting from more of a continuous operations program this year as we focus on Austin Chalk and a little bit of co-development in the Eagle Ford and Dorado, and then we center most of our focus in the PRB in the Southern PRB is basically on the Mowry this year.  And then shifting to international for just a minute on the exploration side. As you guys know, we both explore onshore and offshore and shallow water internationally. I would say onshore, there's still limited competition on the exploration side for unconventionals in what we see. Of course, it's still a high bar that we have for international opportunities to -- they really do need to compete with our domestic portfolio.  We're not just exploring internationally to try and say that we've got something internationally, it really needs to compete and deliver value for the shareholders. And then in the shallow water, probably a bit of the same, maybe a little bit more exploration out there. But dominantly, I think what you're hearing about in in offshore international exploration is a bit more in the deep and even ultra-deepwater and really in the shallow water that we're focused on.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. Appreciate that. Just wanted to turn to CapEx for a minute here. You talked about this a little bit in your prepared comments, but you guys are kind of at 50% of the budget in the first half kind of right on where you expected here. Looking at guidance, third quarter CapEx is up a fair bit versus second quarter. So do we expect to see kind of a commensurate drop in 4Q capital to kind of get you back to that kind of midpoint on the full year? Just trying to get a sense of kind of CapEx cadence in the second half?\nBilly Helms: Yes, Lee, this is Billy. So on the CapEx, I'd say our drilling and completion activity has been very ratable throughout the year, and we're pretty much on track with what our plan has laid out. The reason third quarter is up is simply due to the timing of our non-drilling and completion capital, and it moved from the second quarter into the second half of the year. Everything else, all of our drilling and completion CapEx is really on pace with what we laid out.  We've spent about half the CapEx for the year, and we've completed about half the wells that we're planning for the year. So I'd say everything is pretty much on track. But fourth quarter will be a reflection of how that non-D&C non-drilling and completion CapEx gets spent in the third.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Scott, the line is yours. \nScott Gruber : Thanks. And good morning. I'll just go ahead and ask two questions up front here since they're related you guys know to continue the efficiency gains in the emerging plays. What are you seeing in terms of efficiency gains more broadly across the portfolio? Obviously, the gains are always greatest in the new plays, but I'm curious if you're still seeing solid gains more broadly across the portfolio. And if you are, without adding rigs and frac crews next year, just curious how much the overall well count could potentially grow next year just on the back of those efficiency gains? Is that a kind of low single-digit type figure potentially a mid-single-digit figure?\nBilly Helms: Yes, Scott, this is Billy. We're still seeing continued improvements, although as you noted, at a lesser pace than our more active foundational plays like the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford, simply because we've been active there for a long period of time. And as you noted, the emerging plays benefit from that transfer of technology more rapidly, I guess, than some of the existing plays.  And really, I'd just like to tie that back in a little bit. We still experiment quite a bit with applying technology across all of our assets and especially true of our foundational plays, the efforts we've gone to, to put in our data systems and track data across our plays gives us a lot of insights on how to -- how things are performing. That goes back to our bringing in-house our drilling tools, our drilling motors, those kind of things. So we still see improvements in some of our supplemental deck in the back, you can see some of the increase in drilling times say, in our Permian program, and how that's improved over time, and we continue to drive that down.  And so that's an effort there. And then the same for the Eagle Ford, I think those are some of the spots in the back of our deck. So we're still seeing improvements in both the drilling times and the completed lateral feet per day, and we're very encouraged with that because that enables the technology transfer enables quickly to go to the emerging plays and continue to reduce our cost. How that translates into next year.  Again, I'd say we're still a little bit early to see how things are going to play out on the macro side, depending on what the market looks like. So it's early to see, but I'm encouraged with the efficiency gains that we're seeing that we'll continue to find sustainable ways to improve our business and lower our cost basis going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Derrick Whitfield of Stifel. Derrick, please go ahead. \nDerrick Whitfield: Good morning, all. For my first question, I wanted to focus on long lateral development, which has been seen throughout Q2 and its development you're highlighting in the Eagle Ford with an over 15,000-foot lateral this quarter. As it relates to the Eagle Ford and perhaps more broadly for your portfolio, are there considerations beyond lease geometry and legacy development that would limit your ability to pursue more 15,000-foot laterals?\nKen Boedeker : Yes, Derrick, this is Ken. Really, longer laterals are a way we're increasing our capital efficiency in the Eagle Ford. If you look at it, we've drilled over 85 wells with laterals over 2.5 miles long across the Eagle Ford. And we've utilized these longer laterals over the last five-plus years, where appropriate.  You think about it, the faulting across the Eagle Ford does make these longer laterals challenging, but our data-driven approach and multidisciplinary teams enable us to steer the laterals within some narrow target windows and apply an optimal completion design to maximize that capital efficiency. These longer laterals have really contributed to us lowering our cost basis in the Eagle Ford and are an example of how we're focused on increasing our efficiencies even in that play where we've been developing it for over 10 years.\nBilly Helms: Yes, Derrick, this is Billy. I just might add, the lessons we're learning from our longer laterals, we're pushing in the Eagle Ford, we're applying across all of our portfolio. And so we're seeing those opportunities across every asset that we have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Neil, please go ahead. \nNeil Mehta : Thanks very much. The first question is just around Dorado. Maybe you could talk about how that's tracking versus your target. How do you think about the timing of recompleting those Dorado wells?\nKen Boedeker : Yes, Neil, this is Ken. As far as the way that's tracking, the five wells that we've deferred, we would see that we'd be completing those early in next year. And it's still early in the play and the wells in our core area are really performing as we've anticipated.\nNeil Mehta: Timing dynamic. And then would love your perspective stepping back to talk about the M&A market. We've seen a pickup in consolidation throughout U.S. shale. How do you think of EOG's role in future consolidation? And is the best strategy given the exploration program that we've been talking about here is to continue organically to grow the business? Or do you think there are going to be opportunities [indiscernible] to bolt-on?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Neal, this is Ezra. I think we've been 30 years strong as an organic exploration company, 20 years separated there. And I think that's -- the thing about that is the way we look at these deals is that it's similar to how I described every investment decision is, it's a returns-based decision, and how is that investment going to create long-term shareholder value. We don't think of M&A versus exploration. But as a first mover, looking -- trying to capture the sweet spots of new plays, obviously, you can get a lower cost of entry and that offers a higher return. So the exploration, I think, organic exploration stands on itself.  With regards specifically to M&As, we're aware of opportunities. We evaluate many, many opportunities. And the challenge with it always comes back to, is that opportunity really going to be additive to the corporate portfolio? Is it really going to be something that we -- is better than what we're already drilling is it's something that's going to add to the returns and add to the 10 billion barrels of equivalents that we've already captured as premium resources. And we continue just to evaluate opportunities, but kind of come up short with that evaluation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Roger please go ahead.\nRoger Read : Good morning. I'd like to come back to two things that have been discussed a little bit. One, Ezra, just you talked about the low carbon advantage or the emissions advantage of Dorado. I was wondering if you could go in a little more depth on specifically what you see there. And then my other question will be on the inflation side. With oil at 80, 85 right now, aren't we sitting in a situation where inflation pressures might be reversing rather than behind us? And if that's not the right way to look at it, I'd be curious what you are seeing that says deflation is the right track here.\nKen Boedeker : Yes, Roger, this is Ken. I'll go ahead and answer the first part of that with Dorado. We're really confident that our gas production at Dorado generates significant returns and that development will be both operationally efficient and have a small emissions footprint because of the dry nature of the gas and really the proximity of that gas to the Gulf Coast markets.\nBilly Helms: Yes, Roger, this is Billy. On the inflation question, I think you're spot on. I think that's why we're saying, certainly, we see deflation in the market today, but it's too early to think about 2024 because of the dynamic markets that we're seeing play out. And we're kind of be patient and watch the market and see how it develops before we make any comments about where cost would go in 2024. I think as a company, we're certainly well positioned to take advantage of any opportunities that are presented in our strategy about contracting and seeking out the highest-performing crews are things that drive really our focus on sustainable cost improvements through the long term, and that's really what drives our advantage over trying to capture the premium barrel, premium price for all of our products.\nOperator: We have no further questions on the phone line. So I'll hand back to Mr. Yacob.\nEzra Yacob: We appreciate everyone's time today on the phone call. Thank you to our shareholders for their support, and I just want to give a special thanks to our employees for delivering another exceptional quarter. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you for joining. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Hi, Neil. This is Jeff. On our Permian productivity, we've been really happy with how the wells have performed in the Delaware through the first half of the year. So all of our primary targets, they're performing right now as forecasted or better. And I'd say this is primarily due to just our stacked pay co-development strategy in combination with the new completion design we talked about, which has continued to be really successful in our Wolfcamp targets. And in regards to that new completion design, just kind of a quick update, we're still observing a 20% increase in both first year production and EUR for both oil and BOEs in the Wolfcamp.  So for the full year of 2023, we're planning on bringing on about 70 total Wolfcamp wells with this new design, which is nearly twice the number we've completed in 2022. And also with it, as we talked about, we're continuing to test and expand the technique in other areas and targets in the Delaware Basin along with all across our emerging plays in our multi-basin portfolio."

            "content": "Thanks, Billy. We're continuing to make outstanding progress on our emissions goals. As a preview to our 2022 sustainability report that will be published in September, we are excited to announce that we've reached three significant near term goals well ahead of schedule. First, our 2022 GHG intensity rate of 13.3 metric tons of CO2e per Mboe as less than our 2025 goal of 13.5.  Second, our 2022 methane emissions percentage is 0.04% of our natural gas produced and is significantly less than our 2025 goal of 0.06%. And third, we have achieved our zero routine flaring goal in 2023, well ahead of our 2025 target, and significantly ahead of the World Bank initiative, which strives to attain zero routine flaring by 2030. We have also confirmed that our wellhead gas capture rate for 2022 was 99.9% of the gas produced.  We continue to expand our in-house continuous methane monitoring technology named iSense and finished 2022 with 95% of our production in the Delaware Basin covered by iSense monitoring. As a reminder, the power of iSense is incorporating continuous methane monitoring data with our production and facilities data and monitoring this data on a 24-hour basis in one of our four control centers.  This enhances our ability to identify potential leaks, and prioritize repairs that are needed in the field to minimize fugitive emissions. As with a number of EOG operations, it is anticipated that collection and integration of iSense data will lead to continuous improvement in facilities and production design and operations.  We're excited about the progress we've made in the last several years on our emissions performance and are very proud that we have such dedicated employees who are continuing making our operations more efficient. Their innovative solutions and push to beat expectations have driven us to exceed our goals early. We are currently assessing new goals with our operations groups and anticipate publicizing those goals in the first half of 2024.  Now, here's Ezra, to wrap up. Yes, Arun, this is Ken. I just want to give you a quick update on the Utica. We're making excellent progress on that program this year. We do plan to bring a 4-well package online this month and our frac crew will be starting up again in a few weeks. So the wells we drilled and completed in 2022, we do continue to deliver our expected performance, and we also continue to add acreage and look for additional low-cost opportunities to add to our position up there. Yes, Derrick, this is Ken. Really, longer laterals are a way we're increasing our capital efficiency in the Eagle Ford.

            "name": "Billy Helms",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. I would like to first thank our employees for their commitment and dedication that led to another quarter of exceptional execution. EOG once again meet our forecasted targets and delivered a near perfect quarter. As a result, we have completed the first half of the year ahead on volumes, and ahead on total per unit cash operating cost. Our volume performance in the first half of the year is due to several factors. The performance of new wells is outpacing our forecast, primarily in the Delaware Basin, part of which is due to our new completion design. We're also experiencing less downtime due to market interruptions than previously planned, our investments in infrastructure along with real time data analytics provided the control and flexibility needed to redirect sales volumes to different markets to maintain production. Unit cash operating costs through the first half of the year average 5% below the midpoint of our quarterly guidance, due to a combination of several factors including lower lease operating expenses, as well as reduced transportation cost.  Lower workover and compression related expense reduced LOE, while transportation costs benefited from the flexibility to sell into more favorable markets throughout the quarter. Credit goes to the cross functional efforts of our production, marketing and information systems teams, who remain focused on sustainable, low cost operations quarter after quarter. We have line of sight to maintain these cost improvements throughout the year, and as a result have reduced our full year guidance for total unit cash operating cost.  Operationally, EOG is firing on all cylinders. Our foundational Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin plays are delivering exceptional results. While our emerging plays benefit from learnings and technology transfer across our multi-basin portfolio. Our decentralized structure supports innovation in each operating area, which much and much like independent technology incubators, and compounds the impact of that innovation by taking ideas born in one area and expanding them across multiple basins and across multiple functions. Across every operating area, our frontline engineers and geologists work that technology every day to lower cost and improve well performance. We look for strategic opportunities to vertically integrate certain services within the supply chain, where we find an opportunity to better align those services with our goals. That includes areas like downhole drilling motors, drilling mud, sand and water. Developing such capabilities in-house significantly improves the cost structure of the company.  This quarter we're highlighting drilling performance improvements in the south Texas Dorado, South Powder River Basin Mowry and the Ohio Utica Combo plays. Our emerging plays are moving up the learning curve faster due to the benefit of drilling advancements, and the application of technology over the past decade.  We continue to evolve our proprietary suite of applications, powered by real time high frequency data and analytics to assist our frontline employees to collaborate and make decisions faster. The combined benefit of these efforts has already contributed to an increase of up to 25% in drilling feet per day for wells and our emerging plays this year. In our Ohio Utica play, we recently drilled a 15,700-foot lateral in 2.6 days and 100% in zone.  Capitalization expenditures for the first half are also a running light, due primarily to the infrastructure span that has been deferred into the second half of the year. It is worth noting the economic impact of our investments in EOG owned infrastructure. Our realized U.S. oil price in the second quarter was $1.23 above WTI. And U.S. natural gas was essentially flat to Henry Hub.  CapEx for our drilling and completion program are right on track. The rate of change for inflation this year is consistent with what we'd anticipated started the year. So we still see line of sight to limit year-over-year well cost inflation in \u201823 to just 10% While any additional softening of service cost in this year has the potential to impact 2024. It's simply too early to predict. The market remains too dynamic, particularly given the constructive outlook for oil in the second half of the year.  Furthermore, we remain focused on generating long-term, sustainable cost reductions, driven by utilizing the highest quality equipment and the highest performing teams, which are less exposed to the leading edge price declines that we see in more marginal equipment. Our $6 billion capital program is focused -- is forecasted to deliver 3% or volume growth and 6% total liquid growth. In Dorado, our South Texas Natural Gas play, we delayed the timing of plant completions earlier this year, and about five wells had been pushed into early 2024. Thus, we reduced our full year gas volume guidance accordingly.  We maintained our drilling pace in Dorado to build operational momentum and capture the corresponding efficiencies. As a result, we're seeing a 16% improvement in our drilling times for Dorado. As shown on slide 11 of our updated Investor Presentation. We're constructive on natural gas longer term, and believe Dorado will be one of the lowest cost and lowest emission supplies of natural gas in the U.S. and will compete on a global scale.  This year started out with many challenges, but also many opportunities to continue to improve the company. I am very pleased with the progress our teams continue to deliver and remain optimistic about the second half of the year, and how the company has positioned for the future.  Now I'll turn the call over to Ken to discuss progress on lowering our emissions. Yes. Good morning, Paul. On Dorado, we had indicated earlier in the year that we were evaluating the potential to delay some of our completions in Dorado and we are consistent with that strategy. We elected to maintain our drilling operations there, and we're seeing the benefits of that decision to play through the efficiencies we're gaining on the operational side. And we've given some color on that in our new investor deck illustrating the improvements in drilling times there in that place.  So we're very pleased with that progress. But don't forget, our investment strategy includes a gas price of investing for $2.50. That's our premium price deck when it relates to gas prices. We certainly were watching inventory levels on the gas side and just prudently decided to delay a little bit of the completions there until we saw the fundamentals improve, and so we'll be just laying some of those completions as we go into the late this year, which pushes five wells into the next year. So that's simply the thinking on that. Yes, Neal. This is Billy. So certainly, we're seeing the service prices start to soften. But these savings from lower service costs really probably won't manifest into a lower well cost until later this year and certainly into 2024. These leading-edge prices are falling across various products and services for the industry. And certainly, it varies depending on the product in the area. I'd add that there are several factors that kind of reflect kind of where our '23 capital program is. As a company, as you mentioned there, we focused on sustainable cost reductions through our operational efficiency gains.  As a result, we do seek out the highest performing equipment in cruise, super-spec rigs, electric frac fleets, et cetera. That's really less exposed to some of these headline inflation numbers that we're seeing on the more marginal and equipments on the spot market. And the second part of that is we really anticipate that service costs would moderate through the year when we put our plan together since rig count really peaked back in November, and we built our plan in February, expecting well costs would increase no more than 10% relative to this last year. So things are really playing out exactly the way we planned.  Another point there is we do try to secure about 50% of our well costs in the start of any given year that really helps insulate us from inflationary impacts to our activity levels. And then lastly, based on how we do manage our business, we are less exposed to the volatility in service cost in any given year.  And I would remind you, as you kind of alluded to there, our well cost really only increased about 7% last year compared to the over 20% inflation that we saw in the market. So yes, it really helps us kind of manage our activity level with confidence as we go through the year. And we'll certainly remained flexible as we look into next year to see how we can position ourselves for next year. Yes, Arun, this is Billy. Yes, I think the thing to keep in mind is we do operate in more than one basin and multiple plays, and we have varying sizes of well packages in each play. So the timing of really the quarter-to-quarter variance in production is really driven by the timing on a quarter-to-quarter basis of how these packages across different plays come online. And even within the quarter, how that varies month-to-month within the quarter can vary -- can drive the volume profile.  And I would remind you, and I just ask you to go back and look at the change from the first quarter to the second quarter, it's actually larger than what you're seeing in the forecast from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So we would -- we are maintaining ratable activity throughout the year and just as a matter of simply timing on bringing on some of these larger packages. So, so far this year, we've either met or exceeded our volume forecast and have complete confidence in being able to meet the midpoint of our guidance. No, Doug, I don't think we are anticipating that you'll see inflation into next year. I think what the comment was when we started out the year let me just clarify something. We saw inflation last year coming in the business. Rig counts kind of peaked in November of last year. We anticipated we would see a deflation in the market going into this year. And so we built our plan based on the fact that our well cost in 2023 would increase no more than 10% relative to 2022. So that's where the 10% comment comes from.  As we go into '24, I think we recognize and clearly, we're seeing deflation in our business. I'd say it's too early to predict what that level of deflation is going to do to our well cost next year. There's still a lot of market dynamics that we see in the business as Ezra just went through. And so it's early to predict what that impact that's going to have on next year's capital program as well as kind of how we choose to develop our plays across the different plays that we have to invest in. So that's the comment about too early for next year. It's just too early with the market dynamics we have for next year. Yes, Lee, this is Billy. So on the CapEx, I'd say our drilling and completion activity has been very ratable throughout the year, and we're pretty much on track with what our plan has laid out. The reason third quarter is up is simply due to the timing of our non-drilling and completion capital, and it moved from the second quarter into the second half of the year. Everything else, all of our drilling and completion CapEx is really on pace with what we laid out.  We've spent about half the CapEx for the year, and we've completed about half the wells that we're planning for the year. So I'd say everything is pretty much on track. But fourth quarter will be a reflection of how that non-D&C non-drilling and completion CapEx gets spent in the third. Yes, Scott, this is Billy. We're still seeing continued improvements, although as you noted, at a lesser pace than our more active foundational plays like the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford, simply because we've been active there for a long period of time. And as you noted, the emerging plays benefit from that transfer of technology more rapidly, I guess, than some of the existing plays.  And really, I'd just like to tie that back in a little bit. We still experiment quite a bit with applying technology across all of our assets and especially true of our foundational plays, the efforts we've gone to, to put in our data systems and track data across our plays gives us a lot of insights on how to -- how things are performing. That goes back to our bringing in-house our drilling tools, our drilling motors, those kind of things. So we still see improvements in some of our supplemental deck in the back, you can see some of the increase in drilling times say, in our Permian program, and how that's improved over time, and we continue to drive that down.  And so that's an effort there. And then the same for the Eagle Ford, I think those are some of the spots in the back of our deck. So we're still seeing improvements in both the drilling times and the completed lateral feet per day, and we're very encouraged with that because that enables the technology transfer enables quickly to go to the emerging plays and continue to reduce our cost. How that translates into next year.  Again, I'd say we're still a little bit early to see how things are going to play out on the macro side, depending on what the market looks like. So it's early to see, but I'm encouraged with the efficiency gains that we're seeing that we'll continue to find sustainable ways to improve our business and lower our cost basis going forward. Yes, Derrick, this is Billy. I just might add, the lessons we're learning from our longer laterals, we're pushing in the Eagle Ford, we're applying across all of our portfolio. And so we're seeing those opportunities across every asset that we have. Yes, Roger, this is Billy. On the inflation question, I think you're spot on. I think that's why we're saying, certainly, we see deflation in the market today, but it's too early to think about 2024 because of the dynamic markets that we're seeing play out. And we're kind of be patient and watch the market and see how it develops before we make any comments about where cost would go in 2024. I think as a company, we're certainly well positioned to take advantage of any opportunities that are presented in our strategy about contracting and seeking out the highest-performing crews are things that drive really our focus on sustainable cost improvements through the long term, and that's really what drives our advantage over trying to capture the premium barrel, premium price for all of our products."

Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures can be found on EOG's website. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Jeff Leitzell, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor Relations and Finance. Here is Ezra. Thanks, Ezra. EOG delivered excellent operating and financial performance in all areas in the second quarter. Oil production increased 3% year-over-year while total production increased 5%. Per unit cash operating costs remained essentially flat from the prior year period despite industry wide inflation. Compared to the first quarter, however, per unit cash operating costs declined by 5% and were lower in all four categories. We're beginning to see the benefits of lower cost improve our operating margin.  The DD&A rate fell by 10% year-over-year driven by the addition of reserves at lower finding costs compared to our production base. Capital expenditures came in at $1.5 billion $130 million below our target and just slightly above the first quarter level. The difference was mostly due to the timing of non-well related costs such as infrastructure projects. Year-to-date CapEx of $3 billion is 50% of the full year budget.  The improving capital efficiency of our assets, consistent operational execution, along with the application of innovation and technology to lower costs is making a big impact on the financial performance of the company. We earned adjusted net income of $2.49 per share in the second quarter, and generated free cash flow of $1 billion. Return on capital employed for the last 12 months is 29% at an average WTI oil price of $81 and Henry Hub natural gas price of about $5.  Here's Billy to review operations."

            "name": "Ezra Yacob",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results reflect exceptional execution throughout our multi-basin portfolio. Production volumes, CapEx, cash operating costs and DD&A all beat targets driving another quarter of excellent financial performance. We earn $1.5 billion of adjusted net income and generated $1 billion of free cash flow, year-to-date we've generated free cash flow of $2.1 billion. That free cash flow and cash on the balance sheet funded year-to-date cash returned to shareholders of $2.2 billion, including more than $600 million of share repurchases executed during the first half of the year.  Taking into account our full year regular dividend, we have committed to return $3.1 billion to shareholders in 2023, or about 67% of our estimated 2023 cash flow assuming a $75 oil price well ahead of our target minimum return of 60%. EOGs peer-leading regular dividend is currently the majority of the $3.1 billion of cash return and committed to shareholders this year. Our sustainable growing regular dividend which we have never cut nor suspended remains the first priority to return cash.  We also continue to leverage special dividends and buybacks to return additional cash depending on market conditions through the first two quarters of 2023 we've deployed more than $600 million to opportunistically repurchase shares during times of increased volatility. And while our cash return strategy remains consistent, what has evolved since putting the $5 billion repurchase authorization in place over a year and a half ago, is the fundamental strength of our business. And we continue to get better through relentless execution of and commitment to EOGs value proposition.  We invest in high return projects across our multi-basin portfolio, adding lower costs reserves, which reduces our breakeven and expands our margins. We are now actively investing in five premium basins, more than any time in our history. Our foundational assets in the Delaware Basin an Eagle Ford continue to consistently deliver and we're pleased by the outstanding progress across our emerging Southern Powder River Basin, Ohio Utica Combo, and South Texas Dorado plays.  Well productivity and cost performance are meeting or beating expectations across our portfolio as we invest and develop each asset at a pace that supports consistent execution and continued innovation. We continue to lower the cost basis of our company, utilizing technology and innovation that improves well performance and lowers well costs to sustainably reduce our finding and development costs, efficiencies and infrastructure investments are lowering current and future unit operating costs and contribute to our emissions reduction efforts.  Finally, we have further strengthened our pristine balance sheet this year, while generating significant free cash flow and funding our transparent cash return strategy, which is designed to deliver consistent shareholder value through the cycle. And heading into the second half of 2023. Our continued performance gains will be complemented by strong fundamentals. Oil demand has been resilient despite volatility in the first half of the year, and demand is showing signs of continued growth through the second half of the year. Strong inventory drawers since the start of the year have pulled oil inventories below five year averages and refinery utilization remains high. Production growth in the U.S. is on pace to deliver similar rates as 2022, while exiting the year with significantly less activity as public companies continue to demonstrate discipline. And it appears OPEC+ are following through on an ounce production cuts. The culmination of these actions should further reduce inventory levels and place upward pressure on pricing through year end.  Regarding North American natural gas, while inventory levels remain above the five-year average, prices have firmed up recently, reflecting a reduction in natural gas drilling, and an increase in demand from both power generation and LNG exports. These trends should support a more balanced supply and demand environment late this year and heading into 2024. We remain constructive on the longer term gas story for the U.S. supported by recent LNG project approvals, and the growing petrochemical complex on the Gulf Coast.  And we're especially pleased with Dorados place in the market, as one of the lowest cost supplies of natural gas in the U.S. with an advantage location and emissions profile. EOGs value proposition is delivering results and the strength of our business has never been better to deliver value for the shareholders through industry cycles and play a leading role in the long term future of energy.  Now here's Tim to review our financial position. Thanks, Ken. Our second quarter results demonstrate once again that EOGs value proposition works. We invest in high return low cost assets across a diverse multi basin portfolio. We leverage technology and innovation to sustainably lower well costs and reduce emissions. These high return low cost investments generate significant free cash flow to fund our transparent cash return strategy backstopped by a pristine balance sheet to deliver consistent shareholder value through the cycle. Most importantly, our culture is at the core of our value proposition and is our ultimate competitive advantage.  Thanks for listening we'll now go to Q&A Yes, sir. Paul, go ahead, please. Sure, Paul. This is Ezra. I think I'll take that first question and then Billy can address the second question regarding Dorado. So yes, on the first one, it's kind of a broad question on our cash return strategy. So hopefully, I hit on all the points that you're trying to get at. But first, let's start with our guidance, which has always been the minimum of 60% of free cash flow. So we've never guided to that 60% as being a specific target, it's always been a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow. The reason we like that guide is, honestly, it's pretty simple and dynamic, it's easy to understand and communicate.  The minimum of 60% is -- it can be supported over a range of price scenarios, especially when there's a pullback in prices. And really, we can underpin that with the growing sustainable regular dividend that we highlight and talk about so much. And that's what can provide really a meaningful amount of cash return through the cycle. Again, I do want to emphasize, we consider that regular dividend to still be the true hallmark of a strong and improving underlying business, and we like the message that it sends. We increased that regular dividend commensurate with the strength of the business, lowering the cost basis of the company, and also in consideration with strengthening our balance sheet.  More specifically to kind of payouts that you've seen this year, we do recognize the value of opportunistic buybacks as part of that cash return strategy is a way to create shareholder value. So I would say that really, the decision that you've seen is consistent with our overall capital allocation strategy where we buy back shares in an opportunistic manner as a means to return cash above and beyond that minimum of 60%, in addition, to our regular dividend and at times, instead of paying a special dividend.  We basically evaluate that buyback, just like we do any of our other investment decisions, whether it's exploration or drilling high-return oil and gas wells or investing in infrastructure. It's how is that investment going to create long-term shareholder value. That's what we primarily focus on.  And so the percent will fluctuate depending on a specific moment and time and what the circumstances are around our cash return strategy. But what we have guided to and what you can bank on is it's the minimum of 60% now. We highlighted -- we paid 67% out last year, and we're very well positioned halfway through the year right now where we've already committed or paid 67%, as I highlighted in the script. And all -- for the Dorado timing, I'll hand it over to Billy. Thank you, Neil. This is Ezra. I'm actually going to let Jeff Leitzell step in and address your question. Good morning, Doug, Thanks for the question. This is Ezra. Yes, it's a dynamic environment. We had a large SPR release last year that increased the inventory levels kind of entering this year. And as those have started to come down, now they're going to start all indications that they're going to start coming down significantly faster because OPEC Plus, as I said, it looks like they are going to support their cuts to kind of bring those inventory levels down. So your point is, it's a very interesting one, and it's one we discuss regularly, obviously, and we do different scenarios around.  So in general, what I'd say is, on this year, what we look at is whether it's crude products, gasoline, distillates, either globally or domestically, inventory levels are basically in the lower half of a five-year range. Now that's a choppy five years, like we said, because of 2020 with COVID and then, of course, with 2020 with half of the year being exceptionally low and then half of the year being somewhat artificially higher with the SPR.  Outside of the last month, the last month, we've seen kind of gasoline and distillate demand being just a bit weaker domestically. But otherwise, products demand has really been in line all year with our expectations. Crude demand, has continued to increase, continue to grow. And not only with the high inventory levels that we entered the year with, but really supply, I think, has surprised everybody a little bit to the upside.  And it's not necessarily, as you pointed out, U.S. growth or new barrels, but it's really historically displaced barrels that are back online. And dominantly, what I'm talking about is Venezuela and Iran, and maybe a little bit of -- I think everyone has been a little bit surprised at least we have on the resiliency of the Russian barrels to hit the market.  So we don't forecast those as having a significant longer-term effect. And one thing that we think about when we talk about the spare capacity that's now offline with OPEC Plus is some of that spare capacity is really offsetting the previous spare capacity I just highlighted from Venezuela and Iran. So it is a little bit different from prior years. Ultimately, what we see is the increasing oil demand overall exiting this year, most estimates have it at least at 102 to exit the year, which would put us at a significantly high point.  Now to your ultimate question on how we actually look at that internally, our planning begins with everything we just talked about kind of an evaluation of the macro environment with respect to supply and demand fundamentals, including spare capacity that's off-line just by choice and spare capacity that's offline for true geopolitical reasons. But then more than that, Doug, it really does come down to evaluating across all of our premium assets both individually and collectively, we evaluate the correct investment level for each of those, the activity levels to make sure that each asset will deliver improved metrics year-over-year.  And ultimately, that will be driving optimized returns and free cash flow generation at the corporate level, and that's what will continue to set up EOG to create shareholder value in the near and long term. Honestly, the growth ends up being a real output of our ability to invest and continue to lower the cost basis of the company and provide both near-term and future free cash flow generation. Yes, Leo, this is Ezra. Yes, we continue to see very limited competition domestically on any exploration, I think, and you can kind of see that to just in the public comments that are made. Most operators, companies, whether private or public, have really kind of picked the basin and are honing in on more of a drill down kind of specialist manufacturing mode. We continue to explore. And as Ken said, we're still looking to put on low-cost, high-quality bolt-on opportunities in some of those plays.  With respect to the Utica and PRB in specific. It's a little bit early this year on Utica. We're pleased with what we're seeing on the operations side. And as Ken said, we'll get a completion spread in there and get some results here coming up. On the PRB, we've had a very strong year. Everything has really fallen in the line there. And again, the PRB in Dorado are really benefiting from more of a continuous operations program this year as we focus on Austin Chalk and a little bit of co-development in the Eagle Ford and Dorado, and then we center most of our focus in the PRB in the Southern PRB is basically on the Mowry this year.  And then shifting to international for just a minute on the exploration side. As you guys know, we both explore onshore and offshore and shallow water internationally. I would say onshore, there's still limited competition on the exploration side for unconventionals in what we see. Of course, it's still a high bar that we have for international opportunities to -- they really do need to compete with our domestic portfolio.  We're not just exploring internationally to try and say that we've got something internationally, it really needs to compete and deliver value for the shareholders. And then in the shallow water, probably a bit of the same, maybe a little bit more exploration out there. But dominantly, I think what you're hearing about in in offshore international exploration is a bit more in the deep and even ultra-deepwater and really in the shallow water that we're focused on. Yes, Neal, this is Ezra. I think we've been 30 years strong as an organic exploration company, 20 years separated there. And I think that's -- the thing about that is the way we look at these deals is that it's similar to how I described every investment decision is, it's a returns-based decision, and how is that investment going to create long-term shareholder value. We don't think of M&A versus exploration. But as a first mover, looking -- trying to capture the sweet spots of new plays, obviously, you can get a lower cost of entry and that offers a higher return. So the exploration, I think, organic exploration stands on itself.  With regards specifically to M&As, we're aware of opportunities. We evaluate many, many opportunities. And the challenge with it always comes back to, is that opportunity really going to be additive to the corporate portfolio? Is it really going to be something that we -- is better than what we're already drilling is it's something that's going to add to the returns and add to the 10 billion barrels of equivalents that we've already captured as premium resources. And we continue just to evaluate opportunities, but kind of come up short with that evaluation. We appreciate everyone's time today on the phone call. Thank you to our shareholders for their support, and I just want to give a special thanks to our employees for delivering another exceptional quarter. Thank you, everybody."

Please go ahead, sir.\nTim Driggers: Thank you and good morning. Thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG\u2019s SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures can be found on EOG\u2019s website.

Here is Ezra.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Strong first quarter execution from every operating team across our multi-basin portfolio has positioned the company to deliver exceptional results in 2023. Production, CapEx, cash operating costs and DD&A all beat targets, which underpinned our excellent financial performance during the first quarter. We earned $1.6 billion of adjusted net income and generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow. Free cash flow helped fund year-to-date cash return to shareholders of $1.4 billion through a combination of regular and special dividends, and share repurchases executed during the first quarter. Combined with our full year regular dividend, we have committed to return $2.8 billion to shareholders in 2023 or about 50% of our estimated 2023 free cash flow assuming an $80 oil price. We are well on our way to achieve our target minimum return of 60% of annual free cash flow to shareholders. Our first quarter results demonstrate the value of EOG\u2019s multi-basin portfolio. We have decades of low cost, high return inventory that spans oil, combo and dry natural gas basins throughout the country. Our portfolio includes the Delaware Basin, which remains the largest area of activity in the company and is delivering exceptional returns. After more than a decade of high return drilling, our Eagle Ford asset continues to deliver top tier results while operating at a steady pace. And beyond these core foundational assets, we continue to invest in our emerging Powder River Basin, Ohio Utica Combo and South Texas Dorado plays, which contribute to EOG\u2019s financial performance today, while also laying the groundwork for years of future high return investment. Our portfolio provides flexibility to invest with discipline and develop each asset at a pace that allows it to get better. It provides optionality to actively manage our investments to minimize impacts from inflation. Diversity of our investment portfolio also translates to diverse sales market options, enabling us to pursue the highest netbacks. Our shift to premium drilling several years ago has helped to decouple EOG\u2019s performance from short-term swings in the market. The result is an ability to deliver consistent, operational and financial performance that our shareholders have come to expect and that drives long-term value through the cycle. Recession risk and the near-term demand outlook for oil continues to drive volatility of prices month-to-month. However, our outlook remains positive, inventory levels currently near the five-year average are reducing as we progress through the year, global demand continues to increase and is forecast to reach record levels by year-end and new supply has moderated from pre-pandemic levels of growth. Longer term, with the reduced investment in upstream projects the last several years, we remain constructive on future pricing. For North American gas, near-term prices reflect high inventory levels due to this year\u2019s warm winter and reduced LNG demand during repairs at Freeport. As such, we are currently evaluating options to delay some activity at Dorado. The medium- and long-term outlook for natural gas, however, continues to strengthen. Currently, U.S. LNG demand is at record levels, with an additional 7 Bcf a day capacity under construction or through FID with expected startup between 2024 to 2027 that should position the U.S. as a leader in the global LNG market. Our confidence in the outlook for our business is demonstrated by our capital allocation decisions in the first quarter. Disciplined reinvestment in our high return inventory continues to lower our breakeven and expand the free cash flow potential of EOG. We strengthened our balance sheet by retiring debt, paid out nearly 100% of free cash flow in regular and special dividends, and we utilized our repurchase authorization to buy back $310 million worth of stock late in the quarter during a significant market dislocation. I am confident EOG has the assets, the technology and the people to deliver both return on capital and return of capital for years to come. In a moment, Billy will discuss why we believe our foundational assets in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford will provide higher returns, margins and free cash flow in the years ahead, and why we remain excited about the progress we are making in our emerging assets, Powder River Basin, Ohio Utica Combo and South Texas Dorado. But first, here\u2019s Tim to review our financial position.\nTim Driggers: Thanks, Ezra. EOG generated outstanding financial performance in the first quarter. We produced $1.6 billion of adjusted net income or $2.69 per share and $1.1 billion of free cash flow. Timing differences associated with working capital accounted for an additional $661 million of cash inflow in the quarter. Our outstanding financial results were driven by strong operating performance. Compared with the prior year, first quarter production volumes increased 2% for oil and 7% overall. We mitigated most of the inflationary headwinds to limit the increase to per unit cash operating costs to just 3% or $10.59 per BOE, which was more than offset by a 12% decline in the DD&A rate. Capital expenditures in the quarter of $1.5 billion came in $100 million below target. Our longstanding free cash flow priorities and cash return framework remain consistent. Our priorities are sustainable regular dividend growth, a pristine balance sheet, additional cash return options and low cost property bolt-ons. We are committed to return a minimum of 60% of the annual free cash flow to shareholders through our sustainable regular dividend, special dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. We believe the consistent application of our free cash flow priorities and transparent cash return framework positions the company to create long-term shareholder value through the cycle. In March, we strengthened the balance sheet by paying off a $1.25 billion bond at maturity with cash on hand leaving $3.8 billion of debt on the balance sheet. The next maturity is a $500 million bond due April 2025. Cash at the end of the quarter was $5 billion, yielding a net cash position of $1.2 billion, up $300 million from December 31. Yesterday, our Board declared a second regular dividend of $0.825 per share, the same as last quarter and a 10% increase from the prior year level. The $3.30 annual rate is a $1.9 billion annual commitment. On March 30, we also paid the $1 per share special dividend declared in February. EOG also repurchased $310 million of stock in the first quarter at an average price of $105 per share. For several days during the last two weeks of March, market volatility created a significant dislocation between the price of our stock and the value of the business. We were able to utilize our strong balance sheet to repurchase shares at highly accretive prices. We will continue to monitor the price and value of our stock and you should expect us to step into the market again when there are significant dislocations. We are off to a very strong start in 2023 to deliver on our full year cash return commitment of a minimum of 60% of annual free cash flow. Altogether, the full year regular dividend along with the first quarter special dividend and buyback, represents $2.8 billion of cash return, which is about 50% of the $5.5 billion of free cash flow we forecast for 2023 assuming an $80 oil price. We will continue to monitor oil and gas prices going forward and we remain committed to delivering on our cash return commitment and look forward to updating you over the rest of the year. Here\u2019s Billy to discuss operations.\nBilly Helms: Thanks, Tim. EOG\u2019s operating performance continues to improve with the first quarter generating outstanding results. Our first quarter volume, capital expenditures and total per unit cash operating cost performance came in better than our forecasted targets. I\u2019d like to thank our employees for their dedication and outstanding execution, giving us a great start to 2023. Our full year 2023 capital and production plans are unchanged. We forecast a $6 billion capital program to deliver 3% oil volume growth and 9% total production growth. We maintained the pace of activity from the fourth quarter of last year in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford. Our core foundational plays and continue to expand development in our emerging Powder River Basin, Ohio Utica combo and South Texas Dorado plays. Well productivity and cost performance are meeting or beating expectations across our portfolio as each play sustains sufficient activity to support continued innovation. As Ezra mentioned, our foundational assets in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford are performing exceptionally well and were a big part of our overall strong first quarter results. Sustaining a consistent level of activity in these core plays is driving operational improvements and continues to be one of the primary hedges to offset areas of cost inflation. We are excited about the outlook for these assets in the years ahead. Even as these assets mature, we can apply technical learnings, operational innovation and leverage prior infrastructure investments to continue to improve the operating margin and capital efficiencies of these world-class assets. In the Delaware Basin, we expect well performance will continue to improve this year, delivering productivity and returns well above the premium hurdle rate. Last year, our Delaware Wolfcamp wells delivered an average six-month cumulative production of about 34 barrels of oil equivalent per foot and are expected to improve this year. See slide 10 of our updated investor presentation for details. While well mix can impact the relative contribution of oil, NGLs and natural gas, overall performance is improving in large part due to continued innovations like our new completion design. We have now tested 39 wells in the Wolfcamp that are yielding an average increase of 22% in the first year production, with a 20% uplift in the estimated ultimate recovery compared to the similar wells and targets using our previous completion design. With these encouraging results, we now expect to deploy this new design on about 70 wells this year. This new design is continuing to show promise, as we expand the number of wells and test the design across different targets and basins. Operationally, maintaining a consistent level of activity in the Delaware Basin, combined with our culture of continuous improvement is generating noticeable results. Drilling times continue to improve and are generating peer-leading performance aided by our drilling motor program and high-performing staff. The amount of footage drilled per motor run improved by 11% in the first quarter as compared to last year. Similar progress is being achieved with our completion operations with the expansion of our super zipper technique. These efforts, combined with the opportunities that co-developed multiple targets in the stacked pay resource by using our existing surface footprint and an infrastructure are expected to drive significant efficiency gains and continue to improve our margins in the Delaware Basin for years to come. The first -- we first introduced the super zipper completion technique in the Eagle Ford in 2020. Since then, we have expanded its use throughout the play and have more than doubled completions efficiency as measured by completed lateral feet per day. As indicated on page 12 of our quarterly investor slides, the amount of lateral completed per day year-to-date has increased by another 18% compared to last year. In the first quarter, we also set a record in the Eagle Ford, drilling our longest well to-date, reaching a measure depth of nearly 26,500 feet with a lateral length of over 15,500 feet. We expect to continue to see completion efficiency improvements as we extend laterals in the Eagle Ford to 3-plus miles where feasible. As a core operating area that has been under development for more than a decade, the Eagle Ford also benefits from our existing infrastructure from over 3,700 producing wells. Leveraging existing investments made in strategic water, oil and gas infrastructure minimizes future CapEx needs and lowers operating costs. Ongoing improvements to completion operations and leveraging the benefit of existing infrastructure, enable our Eagle Ford finding and development costs to continue to decline. Last year, the Eagle Ford\u2019s rate of return was the highest in the plays history. Longer term, we have over a decade of drilling inventory in the Eagle Ford, allowing us to maintain the current production base, while generating high returns and lowering breakevens. As previously mentioned, we are maintaining activity in our core plays and progressing our newer emerging plays. This year\u2019s plan in Dorado contemplates eight additional wells completed compared to 2022 in order to achieve a consistent level of activity to drive performance improvements. Our drilling operations are realizing a 29% improvement in the footage drilled per day since 2021. Completion operations will be conducted on a few wells in the second quarter. However, we are evaluating options to delay additional completions originally scheduled later this year due to the current natural gas price environment. To-date, operational progress towards improvements and Dorado\u2019s well performance is meeting or exceeding our early expectations. Activity in the Utica combo play is just commencing, yet we are already witnessing the compounding effects of sharing technology across our multiple plays. For example, drilling performance for recent wells is improving on the order of 20% to 30% compared to last year\u2019s results with the benefit of our proprietary drilling motor program and precision targeting. We expect similar levels of improvement from our completion program once we begin completing wells in the third quarter. Now for a little color on inflation and industry service costs. As we had anticipated in building this year\u2019s plan, the upward inflationary pressure that we witnessed last year appears to have plateaued, which still leaves us confident that our average well cost should increase no more than 10% compared to last year. Early indicators are showing signs of service cost moderation, which is more prevalent in some basins and less than others. We would expect that any softening of service and tubular costs will be slow to manifest into lower well cost and cash operating costs until much later in the year or more likely in 2024. As the year unfolds, we will continue to look for opportunities to leverage our scale and the flexibility of our multi-basin portfolio to manage costs across all operating areas. We also remain highly focused on sustainable cost reductions through innovation, operational performance and execution improvements to mitigate inflation and further drive down our cost structure. Now I will turn it back to Ezra.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Billy. In conclusion, I\u2019d like to note the following important takeaways. First, strong execution from every operating team across our multi-basin portfolio has positioned the company to deliver exceptional results in 2023. Thanks goes to our employees for delivering a great first quarter with their outstanding execution. Second, our foundational assets in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford are performing exceptionally well and were a significant part of our first quarter results. Third, our first quarter performance demonstrates the value of EOG\u2019s multi-basin portfolio. We have decades of low cost, high return inventory that spans oil combo and dry natural gas basins throughout the country. And fourth, our long-term outlook for both oil and gas remains positive, and our shift to premium drilling several years ago has helped decouple EOG\u2019s performance from short-term swings in the market. The result is an ability to deliver consistent, operational and financial performance that our shareholders have come to expect and that drives long-term value through the cycle. Thanks for listening. We will now go to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul, your line is now open.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Two questions, please. I think the first one is probably for Billy. You talked about the Permian, the good well productivity. Just can you give us a little bit more detail in terms of the test size you have doing over there and whether you have increasing it, especially if you start to do more co-development and how many different landing zones or that you are targeting in your program? And second one that, just curious, I mean, I think, in the last, say, several months, a lot of investor have been asking why that go ahead with the expansion in the Dorado. And I think last quarter in the conference call, management has said, you have looking for the long-term. So just curious that what may have trigger your -- maybe there\u2019s a slightly change in your view about the pace on that development? Thank you.\nBilly Helms: Yeah. Paul, this is Billy. Let me give you a little highlight maybe of the Permian program and what we are seeing there. And then I will probably ask Jeff to give some more detailed color to help explain some of the improvements we are seeing. Overall, we are very pleased with the progress our Permian plans are showing. In general, our results are playing out just as we anticipated. In our plans, we had planned - all of our type curves are modeled and forecasted, and the results are meeting or exceeding our forecasted results including the co-development of different targets at the same time. But I\u2019d like to go ahead and turn it over now to Jeff to maybe talk a little bit about the new completion design and the results that we are seeing and then some of the productivity improvements.\nJeff Leitzell: Yeah. Thanks, Billy. Paul, this is Jeff. Yeah. We\u2019re extremely happy with our productivity out of the Delaware. And just to give you a little color, one of the big things that\u2019s really improving that is our new completions design, or I should say, kind of our improved completion design. So, as Billy stated to date, we\u2019ve tested around 39 wells in the Wolfcamp and we are seeing an uplift of about 20% or so in the well productivity and that\u2019s in both the early and late life performance of that. I will also note that the uplift, we are not just seeing that in one phase. We\u2019re seeing both in oil and gas, so kind of across the Board. So with these outstanding results, what we have done is we have really expanded this program and we\u2019re planning on completing about 70 additional wells in the Wolfcamp this year. So going to be about a 2.5 times increase from last year and we definitely went ahead and taken this into account, both our drilling plans and guidance for 2023. So looking forward with this design, we\u2019ve had a lot of success in our deeper formations. Our team really plans to continue to kind of test in some of the shallower formations to evaluate its benefits. One thing that we have observed with this design is that there\u2019s varying performance uplift depending on the rock type and the depth of the target. And the design does come with a little bit of a cost increase, so we just want to be mindful about how quickly we\u2019re testing it and be strategic at the pace that we\u2019re going ahead and put these in the ground. Also, I\u2019d like to point out that the design isn\u2019t really new to EOG. It was actually first tested down in our Eagle Ford asset. And this is just an example of the technology transfer in the company of our multi-basin operations. It\u2019s really helped us accelerate our learnings throughout the company. And then lastly, with the success that we have seen in the Delaware Basin, we\u2019re actively testing it in all of our emerging places throughout the company and really look forward to evaluating those results throughout the year.\nBilly Helms: And then, Paul, the other part of your question was on Dorado and really what triggered the change of pace that we have thinking about. We put together a plan originally just to remind everybody that really, it was not a huge acceleration in activity planned for. We\u2019re only adding eight wells. So the plan never contemplated a huge amount of growth in the -- in Dorado to start with. However, we always remain flexible on our program and with -- that\u2019s the benefit of having a multi-basin portfolio as we can move activity around based on market conditions or other factors as they present themselves. Naturally, with gas prices remaining weak and moving into the year, it\u2019s only natural to think about options that we might be able to explore with Dorado activity. We are exploring the option to delay some completions that were scheduled for later in the year and we will give more color on that as that unfolds.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Cheng. The next question is from the line of Leo Mariani with ROTH Capital Partners. Leo, your line is now open.\nLeo Mariani: Yeah. Hi. Just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the buyback versus the special dividend. Obviously, there was no new special dividend, I guess, announced this quarter instead, you got certainly lean on the buyback as you described in March. I just wanted to kind of confirm your thinking around this. I mean it still sounds like the buyback is going to be reserved only for kind of very opportunistic situations, where there is this dislocation. And generally speaking, it\u2019s probably more reasonable to expect the special going forward with the buyback kind of maybe every once in a while, is that kind of how to think about it?\nEzra Yacob: Yes. Leo, this is Ezra Yacob. Good morning. I think that\u2019s -- I think you have summarized it pretty well. Our strategy hasn\u2019t really changed. We are committed to returning at least 60% of our free cash flow on an annual basis. Year-to-date, as Tim had mentioned, our cash return commitment is $2.8 billion. It\u2019s approximately 50% of our -- what would be our fiscal year free cash flow at the assumed $80 oil price there. And just to recall, the cash return priorities for us, it really begins with the regular dividend as the first priority. The excess free cash flow, as you said, will either come back in the form of special dividends, which we have paid seven quarters of the last eight quarters, we have distributed a special dividend or opportunistic buybacks. And what we saw in the first quarter when we executed a repurchase was, we really saw a dislocation dominantly associated with the banking crisis and we were able to step in to repurchase approximately $300 million of the stock. So, as you pointed out, really in line with our strategy. Now what I would say has changed over the last 18 months since putting the repurchase authorization in place is really the strength of our company. Our primary value proposition, of course, is investing in high return projects, adding lower cost reserves to our company\u2019s profile, which thereby reduces our breakevens and expands our margins. And so as we continue to execute on this strategy and we continue to strengthen the company, the way we consider dislocations certainly evolves as well.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I just wanted to see if there\u2019s any more of a robust update on the Utica. I think the last time you guys kind of rolled that out. I think you had four wells on production with a fair bit of history. Just trying to get a sense of the more wells producing at this point in time in the Utica and just any thoughts around some of the long-term performance of those prior wells have been on for, I guess, over a year at this point?\nKen Boedeker: Yeah. Leo, this is Ken. We\u2019re making excellent progress on our Utica program this year. We currently have a drilling rig actively operating in our northern area and we\u2019re progressing nicely on our gathering and infrastructure projects. The four wells that you talked about that we drilled and completed in 2022 really do continue to deliver our expected performance and we plan to drill and complete about 15 wells across both our North and Southern areas this year and we will have those production results more towards the end of the year. Another thing to note is we also continue to add acreage and look for additional low-cost opportunities to add to our position.\nOperator: Thank you, Leo. The next question is from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC. Scott, please go ahead.\nScott Hanold: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the quarter. Ezra, maybe if I could pivot back on the buyback conversation and if you can give us some color on, what were the key triggers on the decision to do buybacks? Was it relative valuation of EOG to peers, was it just the aggregate move or is there other things like intrinsic value assessments that kind of generated that process to really kick it off there?\nEzra Yacob: Good morning, Scott. Yes. This is Ezra. Those are all accurate to the tune of how we kind of look at these opportunities. As we have talked about in the past, it kind of begins with the macro, first of all, right? What\u2019s happening on both global and domestic supply and demand balances. As far as dislocations go, we do measure, we look at the intrinsic value of our business relative to different pricing scenarios, both short- and long-term. And we do evaluate trading multiples, not just at EOG versus the peers, but actually for the entire peer group and see what\u2019s happening. And so one comparison that could be made is the dramatic sell-off that the industry saw last summer, which was associated with a pretty dramatic pullback in oil prices, that was really fundamentally supported by a change we felt in the macro outlook. There was a significant announcement there for roughly 300 million barrels of petroleum reserves that would be hitting the market on the supply side from across the globe. What we saw in the first quarter was not really supported by a big change in the forecast on the fundamentals. Potentially really just triggered from the banking crisis, potentially an increased fear on the demand side from increased recession, but we really feel like most of that has already been priced in to the market on the demand side. And so when we saw a pullback there in a dislocation with the market, really again associated in late March there with the banking crisis. We really didn\u2019t hesitate and we have able to step into the market and do that $300 million share repurchase and we think we have really created a significant amount of value there for the shareholders.\nScott Hanold: That\u2019s great. Thanks for that. And as my follow-up, one of the things I think tends to get lost or is underappreciated is the premium pricing you all continue to get on your commodities across the Board. And can you just give us a sense of -- as you kind of look forward, do you find more opportunities ahead where you can continue to raise the bar on that as well?\nLance Terveen: Hey, Scott. Good morning. This is Lance. Thanks for the question. Yeah. The -- our realizations continue to be excellent, and I mean, when we think about it, it\u2019s really just the capability that we have. When you think about the multi-basins that we have, but just our transport position and then the capacity that we have taken out. You hear us talk a lot about control and having control all the way to the water is exceptionally important. So I would just say, as you think about our position and the price realizations too and then extracting additional premiums, I think, our ability to just transact very quickly and with the supply, the scale that we have, I mean, we can definitely walk in with further opportunities.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Scott, please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: Yes. Good morning. I want to circle back on the Wolfcamp development strategy. After looking at slide 10 here in the deck, last year you layered in more Wolfcamp M wells. But this year, the percentage of Wolfcamp M will be slowing back down some. Is that impacted by where you will develop and deploy the new completion design or is that a reflection tend to be more selective with where you co-develop the Wolfcamp M, just what guidance shift in mix?\nJeff Leitzell: Yeah. Scott, this is Jeff. Really with the -- our co-development strategy, it\u2019s pretty straightforward, and what we have trying to do is, we have just adding in high rate of return targets to our well packages. And really it\u2019s driven by the geology, and obviously, the geology across our acreage, it changes very quickly. So kind of from development unit to development unit, we have really got to strategically dissect what our strategy is going to be there. But from what we have seeing right now, and you can see that on slide 10 and 11 in our deck, by adding in some of those deeper targets in the lower Wolfcamp, or I should say, the lower Upper Wolfcamp and then the middle, we have achieving economics well over our premium hurdle rates and we have some of the tightest co-develop pacing out there in the basin. So ultimately, just this approach, I mean, it\u2019s improving our total recovery per acre, helping optimize that NPV of the resource and it\u2019s just adding those barrels finding costs below our current Delaware Basin levels.\nScott Gruber: Got it. And then maybe just one for some more color on the new completion design. You said it was initially developed and rolled out the Eagle Ford. Did it become a dominant design in the Eagle Ford and will it become the dominant design in the Permian and how quickly it can be rolled out to some of your new plays?\nEzra Yacob: Yeah. Scott, great question. So, yeah, the design, as I talked about, it was first utilized in the Eagle Ford. It was back in -- right around 2016 and we didn\u2019t see the same uplift that we see in the Permian. It wasn\u2019t quite as extensive, but it really has to do with the difference in rock type and their geological properties between the two plays. But it did provide the application, we are really beneficial as far as helping lower well costs and reduce our completion time. So, yes, it is something that we still do employ there in the Eagle Ford, and as I said, in a lot of our emerging plays. As far as in the Delaware and our rollout, our plan is to increase, as I said, the year-over-year number by 2.5 times what we did last year. And I also did state, there\u2019s just a slight cost increase, so we want to be cognizant of how quickly we roll it out and like anything in our program, we just don\u2019t want to outrun our learnings and we want to make sure that we continue to evolve this technique as we learn.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Derrick, please go ahead.\nDerrick Whitfield: Good morning, all, and thanks for taking my questions. With my first question, I wanted to focus on CapEx cadence throughout 2023. With Q1 coming in better than expected in Q2 projected to be heavier than expected. Could you comment on the one to two drivers, and separately, if not part of the answer, could you speak to cadence on non-D&C investments throughout 2023?\nBilly Helms: Yeah. Derek, this is Billy Helms. So, yeah, the second quarter CapEx has gotten to be a little bit higher than the first quarter and it\u2019s mainly due to some non-drilling and completion capital, the indirect or infrastructure and those kind of things that we put in our program that it was recently scheduled to occur at the latter half of the first quarter, it turned out to be pushed into the second quarter. That\u2019s the reason the first quarter under -- was under our own CapEx and the second quarter is a little bit higher. And that really sticks to our original plan, we had always planned for about 52% of our CapEx to be spent in the first half of the year and so we have still on target for that in the 48% in the back half, so that\u2019s kind of the way the program plays out.\nDerrick Whitfield: Great. And with my follow-up, I\u2019d like to focus on your operational efficiency gains in the Eagle Ford. Is your gain principally driven by increased super zipper activity, and if so, are there practical limitations on the amount of completions you could pursue utilizing this approach?\nKen Boedeker: Yeah. Derek, this is Ken. I\u2019d like to start off by really crediting our team there in San Antonio for driving down that finding cost that you talked about. Really by focusing on improving the efficiency of every portion of the process, we have been able to drive down costs over the past several years. And increasing our lateral lengths, while improving targeting and focusing on bit and motor performance in conjunction with the advent of super zipper completion operations have really allowed us to improve efficiencies and really drill and complete more lateral footage in a day compared to a few years ago. That\u2019s really showing up on a lower cost basis. And one thing to note is we do have over 10 years of high-return drilling in this play that can sustain our current production levels and continue to expand our margins.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug?\nJohn Abbott: Good morning. This is John Abbott on for Doug Leggate. Our questions -- first our question are really on Dorado. We understand that you have going to potentially delay activity this year. But one of the goals that you set out this year was to try to just begin get greater economies of scale into play. When do you think you need to achieve that size and scale, noting that you have additional LNG capacity coming on, exposure in 2026?\nBilly Helms: Yeah. John, this is Billy Helms. So for Dorado, yes, we are increasing activity there, mainly from a drilling side. Recently we had planned to also bring in additional completions. On the drilling side, I would add that, we are seeing a tremendous improvement in the efficiency gains there. The team there has done just an excellent job of being able to improve our drilling times, lower our well costs and just increase efficiencies overall. So we have very pleased with the progress we have made and so I think that increased activity we have seeing on the drilling side is playing out what we have seeing on the drilling results and giving us insights into how we can continue to lower well costs going forward. On the completion side, we have some planned activity here in the second quarter. But beyond that, we have looking at ways we can -- with the flexibility we have in our program to delay the completion of any wells that would be on in the second half. And really just thinking about how we can leverage some of the learnings from our other programs in play and combine that activity with the activity we have in Dorado by sharing equipment, people and those learnings across our portfolio. So we don\u2019t really feel the need to jump in and complete those wells, but we are evaluating options as they roll out and we will see how those present themselves. And then as far as the activities for\u2026\nJohn Abbott: I guess\u2026\nBilly Helms: \u2026LNG demand, I guess, the play -- the unique thing about this play, it didn\u2019t take a lot of wells. The wells are very prolific. So we have well ahead of any timing that we would need to add LNG capacity in the future. And then we also have the flexibility of moving gas from other operating areas, multi-basin portfolio to the Gulf Coast. So don\u2019t think of the Dorado is just simply applying itself to the LNG market. It\u2019s got the opportunity but looking at gas from other players to the Gulf Coast as well through our marketing arrangements.\nJohn Abbott: That\u2019s extremely helpful, which leads to the next question. Assuming there was not an issue with gas prices, how do you think about the optimal level of production for that play or activity long-term? I mean, how big does it came to get to? How do you think about that program -- that -- from an efficiency program longer term?\nKen Boedeker: Yeah. John, this is Ken.\nJohn Abbott: You can\u2026\nKen Boedeker: Yeah. John, this is Ken. I think the real thing in Dorado is it doesn\u2019t take a lot of wells to generate significant volumes out of that play. So I don\u2019t know the exact right pace. But what we want to do is we want to develop this at the right pace where we don\u2019t outrun our learnings. We have making significant progress as we really get those operational synergies together that Billy talked about and so that pace of development is really going to be dictated by not outrunning our learnings.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist. Neal, please go ahead.\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning. Thanks for the time. My first question, just on the Powder River. I am just wondering I heard too much on that right. I am just wondering how do you still feel this competes versus your other premium players? I know at one time, you suggested you had almost 1,700 locations and I am just wondering your thoughts around this.\nJeff Leitzell: Yeah. Neal, this is Jeff. No. We have outstanding results there in the Powder right now and it\u2019s some of the lowest finding costs that we have seeing there in the whole portfolio. So, yeah, we still have between kind of our full South Powder River Basin and then moving up to our North, about 1,600 net undrilled premium locations. So just looking at our program, everything is on pace this year. The wells are performing as we expected. Q1 we have completed about 15 gross wells, which two-thirds of those were Mowry and we have seeing a lot of benefits also by getting some consistent activity up there in the Powder. We have running a consistent two and -- two to three rigs and one full frac spread with that, which is really allowing them to kind of push their efficiencies. And then we also have a lot of confidence in the play just with the overall performance and stuff with the Mowry. And then from there, as we talked about, we want to go ahead and gather the data in the upper overlying formations like the Niobrara, so we can develop that later in the future. Also, additional confidence in the play, I think, would be really -- should be said is that the infrastructure acquisition that we had. We had noted that in our 10-Q, we acquired Evolution. And I will go ahead and let maybe Lance say a couple of things on that.\nLance Terveen: Yeah. No. Thanks, Jeff. Yeah. Just to add to that, on our confidence when we think about the Powder River Basin, we did make a strategic investment there. That was about $135 million and we view that as a bolt-on acquisition and that\u2019s really midstream footprint. There\u2019s a plant and gathering system that just overlays our southern acreage. The plant is a first-class asset. It was completed in 2019 and when we think about this, it just really complements our existing gas gathering infrastructure build-out as we have connections in place. So we really look at that as value, because we can load that plant, fill the plant very quickly. And there\u2019s also other benefits that we see long-term as well, as we think about just lowering cash operating costs, gathering, processing expense versus third parties, we will have control and redundancy, but then also to the confidence we can expand that very quickly. So\u2026\nNeal Dingmann: Was that\u2026\nLance Terveen: \u2026 the last thing I just...\nNeal Dingmann: Was that plant helped a deeps there as well? I am just wondering would you mention with that plant, would that boost the deeps there a little bit as well?\nLance Terveen: When we think about that, we think about actually the gathering, processing and transportation expense. So it\u2019s absolutely when we think about loading it with our equity gas into that facility and having been control, we have definitely going to see better netbacks. But it\u2019s more as we think about just controlling the cost and lowering the cost basis of the company that\u2019s going to absolutely make the Powder River Basin and the Southern acres they are more competitive.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein. Bob?\nBob Brackett: Good morning. Back to the Wolfcamp co-development. If you have hitting 2-plus targets in the Wolfcamp versus, say, cherry picking the best zone, all things being equal, you would expect wells to get worse, yet you have seeing wells get better. Is that attributable completely to the design change?\nEzra Yacob: No. I\u2019d say it\u2019s attributed to our co-development strategy. I mean it\u2019s -- really, it\u2019s been a process over time. So if you look at back in 2016 in the Wolfcamp or I should say our strategy through the whole Permian, we had six unique targets and kind of fast forward here, we have up to 18 unique targets. Obviously, with that, the spacing has changed both in zone and from a vertical perspective. So our teams have methodically obviously tested this. They have taken into account the actual spacing, how they interact, the depletion to it, and we have come up obviously with the best co-development strategy really to maximize the overall production of those intervals and then obviously maximize the economics related to it.\nBob Brackett: Great. I guess the follow-up would be, so it sounds like the co-development strategy is driven by that desire to maximize the lack of communication between zones or is it more driven by just logistics of having that kit sit in one spot for a longer time?\nEzra Yacob: No. It\u2019s really -- it\u2019s about maximizing the overall resource there, as you said. So we do have the optimal amount of communication that we have actually able to optimize the recovery and then like I said, really maximize those economics.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun, please go ahead.\nArun Jayaram: Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to come back to the new completion design. You highlighted how you have tested this on 39 wells and you plan to go to 70 wells. And my question is, was the 20% uplift relative to wells in the same area or relative to the -- to your type curve? And maybe the follow-up is, are the 70 wells contemplated for this calendar year and was that part of your guidance, did that include that or would that reflect an upside risk to your oil guide?\nBilly Helms: Yeah. Arun, this is Billy. So the uplift we have seeing, part of that was actually baked into our guidance. We didn\u2019t bake in the entire amount. So when we put together our plan, we understood that there were going to be some uplift. We did plan on 70 wells to be part of that calendar year program and we have baked in some of that into our production guidance, knowing that we would see some uplift. I think the uplift is surprising us a little bit more to the upside, but I would say that\u2019s already factored into our guidance that we have issued. And then as far as the what we have doing there, we were finding that the target is critical. So the rock type is critical to why it works in some areas and so we have cautiously moving through our program to make sure we test as we go to understand which our targets lend themselves best to this design change and which ones don\u2019t, because it does cost a little bit more and we want to be very disciplined on how we apply that across the fields we maximize as Jeff was saying, the economics of the play.\nArun Jayaram: Okay. And just my follow-up is, any update on Beehive and Australia timing?\nBilly Helms: Yeah. Arun, on Beehive, we have still excited to be able to drill that well, but it\u2019s going to be probably in the first half of next year before we have able to get that well drilled. And\u2026\nOperator: Thank you.\nBilly Helms: \u2026just really due to some timing on permits and those kind of things.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles, please go ahead.\nCharles Meade: Good morning, Ezra, Billy, Ken and the whole EOG team there. I think just a couple of quick ones for me touching on some of the common themes that you have already spoken on for a while. The Dorado, evaluating the slowdown, can you give some insight in your thinking? Is this about the natural gas price falling below your 250 [ph] double premium or is this about the contango you see in the curve and just the value of just waiting a few months or is it -- I recognize those aren\u2019t exclusive, but just some insight what really keep you guys to want to examine that?\nBilly Helms: Yeah. Charles, this is Billy. Certainly, it really is not triggered on a specific gas price, but just the overall softness we see in the current market conditions and the need to simply bring more gas on in this current condition. As we talk near-term, we understand the near-term softness in the market but longer term, medium and longer term, we have still very bullish on the long-term outlook for gas. So we do look at the different flex -- the flexibility we have in the program and we have evaluating options to be able to successfully push those back in the year. And we have just continue to remain disciplined on our investment to make sure we have maximizing the value to the company over the long-term.\nCharles Meade: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one more quick one on this Wolfcamp completion design. So I got the message, I think, in your last -- your response to the last question, that this is not going to be an across the Board shift that you would want to make. But presumably you have confirmed, I think, you have talking about 16 targets it works and can you give us a sense as we work in a quarter of the targets and maybe upside to half or three quarters or what\u2019s it look like to you guys right now?\nJeff Leitzell: Yeah. This is Jeff again. Yeah. That is correct. It\u2019s not necessarily a one size fits all across. It really does have to do with the geology that we have applying it to. And when looking particularly there in the Permian, we primarily just applied it down in the deeper Wolfcamp targets. So that would basically be just kind of the up or down through the middle in a co-development standpoint. Now we are testing on those shallower targets, but there are quite a few different rock types. So right now, I\u2019d say it\u2019s area by area, and from a percentage basis, you kind of hate to put an actual percentage on it. But right now we have still evaluating that, and it will be a case-by-case basis.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil?\nNeil Mehta: Yeah. Good morning, team. My question was on the natural gas liquids market where realizations, obviously, have been trending lower. I am just curious on your perspective on what gets NGLs to firm up relative to WTI and what are you seeing real time in the export markets? Thank you.\nLance Terveen: Yeah. Neil, good morning. It\u2019s Lance. Yeah. I think what you have continuing to see absolutely the export positions that are getting built out. I think as you kind of have to think of those kind of as we think about them kind of more on ethane and more in propane. So continuing to see healthy propane exports. We continue to see the build out. That\u2019s a company with that. You have continuing to see the demand as you think about the Far East demand that\u2019s going to be the demand pool for those barrels. So continue to see that there could be some firming up there, kind of maybe more longer term, ethane, obviously, is going to flow a little bit more with gas prices and that\u2019s kind of like what you have seeing today.\nNeil Mehta: Great. And then just curious on your guys\u2019 perspective on the gas markets as well. You have talked a little bit about slowing down potentially in terms from a drilling perspective, but how do you see the balances moving from here in a weather normal way over the course of the year?\nEzra Yacob: Yes. Neil, this is Ezra. As I stated kind of in the opening remarks, we still remain constructive on kind of the longer term gas story for the U.S. We think that the U.S., especially Dorado being a big piece of it has really captured low cost of gas supply that can really compete on the global scale with the amount of LNG that the U.S. is exporting right now, which is at record levels right now for the U.S. combined with the number of projects that have made it through a financial or a final investment decision and then the additional projects that are still being kind of planned and discussed, the U.S. will be long-term position to be really a global leader in the LNG market. Now gas is always difficult because it is highly volatile when it comes to things like the short-term pricing on weather. And it\u2019s one reason you have heard this morning from both myself, Ken and Billy that the most important thing we look at when we develop Dorado is to really invest in that at the right pace for the long term. We want to make sure that we have not out running our learnings, that we appropriately invest to be able to keep our costs low and at the end of the day, really keep our margins wide. We want to put in the correct infrastructure to keep our low operating costs, because the margins are always pretty skinny on gas and the low-cost producer for gas is going to be able to be exposed to the global market here in the U.S. for the long-term.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Josh Silverstein with UBS. Josh, please go ahead.\nJosh Silverstein: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe just sticking with gas first. You have an unusually wide gap on your differential even after reporting the first quarter results. Can you just talk about how you think that may shape over the course of the year, what you have looking for to come in towards the high end versus the low end there? Thanks.\nLance Terveen: Yeah, Josh. Hey. This is Lance. I believe when we think about our guidance, I think, we were just below the midpoint of the guidance on our realization so from a gas standpoint. And then you have seen kind of our guidance for like the full year and we expect a lot of that\u2019s going to be driven, obviously, we have the diversification that we have with our California exposure. We have -- you can see on our supplemental slide, slide eight, you can obviously see the large exposure that we have into the Gulf Coast and then obviously, our JKM exposure as well. So I think we have going to hold with the existing guidance that we have.\nJosh Silverstein: Got it. And then just as far as the shareholder return profile, I know you have been thinking about it from a percentage of free cash flow. But how would you think about it from managing like a cash balance standpoint? You have been over $5 billion now for the past few quarters, including paying down the debt maturity in the first quarter. Is $5 billion, $6 billion the right level of cash for EOG? What level of cash would you not want to get over, because it feels like there are certain periods where you could return over 100% of cash or free cash flow to shareholders if you really want to? Thanks.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Josh. This is Ezra. When we came out with that cash return guidance with a minimum of 60%, we really did just mean that, but it\u2019s a minimum. In fact, last year we returned excess of this 60% free cash flow to our shareholders. And we started with that 60%, because we feel confident on that, especially when we roll in kind of almost a peer-leading regular dividend that we would be able to compete and deliver that through the cycles. So when we think about a specific target for cash on hand, I wouldn\u2019t say that we have a real target. We have spoken about some indicators and things that we strategically think about as far as holding a cash balance. The first, of course, is we like to have a bit of cash on balance just to run the business to make us allow us to stay out of commercial paper, and historically, that\u2019s around about $2 billion kind of depending at what point you are in the cycle. And then in addition to that, we do like to have cash on hand so that we can be strategic and counter cyclically invest in opportunities as they arise, whether that\u2019s at times investing in casing or line pipe or last year we were able to step in and do an acquisition in one of our emerging players there in the Utica, where we actually purchased approximately 130,000 mineral rights. And then lastly, of course, just the stock repurchase, which we exercised here in the first quarter. We have talked about being able to utilize that opportunistically and really part of our strategy, the reason that you can actually step into a dislocated market and have the confidence to do a buyback is that you have got the strength of the balance sheet, which includes cash on hand. That\u2019s really what we have going for and so I think that provides another compelling reason to carry potentially a higher cash balance than the company has historically done.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session for today. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Yacob for any closing or additional remarks.\nEzra Yacob: I just want to thank everyone for participating on the call this morning and I especially want to thank our employees for the outstanding results they delivered in this first quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the EOG Resources first quarter 2023 earnings results conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Jeff Leitzell",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks, Billy. Paul, this is Jeff. Yeah. We're extremely happy with our productivity out of the Delaware. And just to give you a little color, one of the big things that's really improving that is our new completions design, or I should say, kind of our improved completion design. So, as Billy stated to date, we've tested around 39 wells in the Wolfcamp and we are seeing an uplift of about 20% or so in the well productivity and that's in both the early and late life performance of that. I will also note that the uplift, we are not just seeing that in one phase. We're seeing both in oil and gas, so kind of across the Board. So with these outstanding results, what we have done is we have really expanded this program and we're planning on completing about 70 additional wells in the Wolfcamp this year. So going to be about a 2.5 times increase from last year and we definitely went ahead and taken this into account, both our drilling plans and guidance for 2023. So looking forward with this design, we've had a lot of success in our deeper formations. Our team really plans to continue to kind of test in some of the shallower formations to evaluate its benefits. One thing that we have observed with this design is that there's varying performance uplift depending on the rock type and the depth of the target. And the design does come with a little bit of a cost increase, so we just want to be mindful about how quickly we're testing it and be strategic at the pace that we're going ahead and put these in the ground. Also, I'd like to point out that the design isn't really new to EOG. It was actually first tested down in our Eagle Ford asset. And this is just an example of the technology transfer in the company of our multi-basin operations. It's really helped us accelerate our learnings throughout the company. And then lastly, with the success that we have seen in the Delaware Basin, we're actively testing it in all of our emerging places throughout the company and really look forward to evaluating those results throughout the year. Yeah. Scott, this is Jeff. Really with the -- our co-development strategy, it's pretty straightforward, and what we have trying to do is, we have just adding in high rate of return targets to our well packages. And really it's driven by the geology, and obviously, the geology across our acreage, it changes very quickly. So kind of from development unit to development unit, we have really got to strategically dissect what our strategy is going to be there. But from what we have seeing right now, and you can see that on slide 10 and 11 in our deck, by adding in some of those deeper targets in the lower Wolfcamp, or I should say, the lower Upper Wolfcamp and then the middle, we have achieving economics well over our premium hurdle rates and we have some of the tightest co-develop pacing out there in the basin. So ultimately, just this approach, I mean, it's improving our total recovery per acre, helping optimize that NPV of the resource and it's just adding those barrels finding costs below our current Delaware Basin levels. Yeah. Neal, this is Jeff. No. We have outstanding results there in the Powder right now and it's some of the lowest finding costs that we have seeing there in the whole portfolio. So, yeah, we still have between kind of our full South Powder River Basin and then moving up to our North, about 1,600 net undrilled premium locations. So just looking at our program, everything is on pace this year. The wells are performing as we expected. Q1 we have completed about 15 gross wells, which two-thirds of those were Mowry and we have seeing a lot of benefits also by getting some consistent activity up there in the Powder. We have running a consistent two and -- two to three rigs and one full frac spread with that, which is really allowing them to kind of push their efficiencies. And then we also have a lot of confidence in the play just with the overall performance and stuff with the Mowry. And then from there, as we talked about, we want to go ahead and gather the data in the upper overlying formations like the Niobrara, so we can develop that later in the future. Also, additional confidence in the play, I think, would be really -- should be said is that the infrastructure acquisition that we had. We had noted that in our 10-Q, we acquired Evolution. And I will go ahead and let maybe Lance say a couple of things on that. Yeah. This is Jeff again. Yeah. That is correct. It's not necessarily a one size fits all across. It really does have to do with the geology that we have applying it to. And when looking particularly there in the Permian, we primarily just applied it down in the deeper Wolfcamp targets. So that would basically be just kind of the up or down through the middle in a co-development standpoint. Now we are testing on those shallower targets, but there are quite a few different rock types. So right now, I'd say it's area by area, and from a percentage basis, you kind of hate to put an actual percentage on it. But right now we have still evaluating that, and it will be a case-by-case basis."

            "name": "Lance Terveen",
            "content": "Hey, Scott. Good morning. This is Lance. Thanks for the question. Yeah. The -- our realizations continue to be excellent, and I mean, when we think about it, it's really just the capability that we have. When you think about the multi-basins that we have, but just our transport position and then the capacity that we have taken out. You hear us talk a lot about control and having control all the way to the water is exceptionally important. So I would just say, as you think about our position and the price realizations too and then extracting additional premiums, I think, our ability to just transact very quickly and with the supply, the scale that we have, I mean, we can definitely walk in with further opportunities. Yeah. No. Thanks, Jeff. Yeah. Just to add to that, on our confidence when we think about the Powder River Basin, we did make a strategic investment there. That was about $135 million and we view that as a bolt-on acquisition and that's really midstream footprint. There's a plant and gathering system that just overlays our southern acreage. The plant is a first-class asset. It was completed in 2019 and when we think about this, it just really complements our existing gas gathering infrastructure build-out as we have connections in place. So we really look at that as value, because we can load that plant, fill the plant very quickly. And there's also other benefits that we see long-term as well, as we think about just lowering cash operating costs, gathering, processing expense versus third parties, we will have control and redundancy, but then also to the confidence we can expand that very quickly. So... ... the last thing I just... When we think about that, we think about actually the gathering, processing and transportation expense. So it's absolutely when we think about loading it with our equity gas into that facility and having been control, we have definitely going to see better netbacks. But it's more as we think about just controlling the cost and lowering the cost basis of the company that's going to absolutely make the Powder River Basin and the Southern acres they are more competitive. Yeah. Neil, good morning. It's Lance. Yeah. I think what you have continuing to see absolutely the export positions that are getting built out. I think as you kind of have to think of those kind of as we think about them kind of more on ethane and more in propane. So continuing to see healthy propane exports. We continue to see the build out. That's a company with that. You have continuing to see the demand as you think about the Far East demand that's going to be the demand pool for those barrels. So continue to see that there could be some firming up there, kind of maybe more longer term, ethane, obviously, is going to flow a little bit more with gas prices and that's kind of like what you have seeing today. Yeah, Josh. Hey. This is Lance. I believe when we think about our guidance, I think, we were just below the midpoint of the guidance on our realization so from a gas standpoint. And then you have seen kind of our guidance for like the full year and we expect a lot of that's going to be driven, obviously, we have the diversification that we have with our California exposure.

            "name": "Ken Boedeker",
            "content": "Yeah. Leo, this is Ken. We're making excellent progress on our Utica program this year. We currently have a drilling rig actively operating in our northern area and we're progressing nicely on our gathering and infrastructure projects. The four wells that you talked about that we drilled and completed in 2022 really do continue to deliver our expected performance and we plan to drill and complete about 15 wells across both our North and Southern areas this year and we will have those production results more towards the end of the year. Another thing to note is we also continue to add acreage and look for additional low-cost opportunities to add to our position. Yeah. Derek, this is Ken. I'd like to start off by really crediting our team there in San Antonio for driving down that finding cost that you talked about. Really by focusing on improving the efficiency of every portion of the process, we have been able to drive down costs over the past several years. And increasing our lateral lengths, while improving targeting and focusing on bit and motor performance in conjunction with the advent of super zipper completion operations have really allowed us to improve efficiencies and really drill and complete more lateral footage in a day compared to a few years ago. That's really showing up on a lower cost basis. And one thing to note is we do have over 10 years of high-return drilling in this play that can sustain our current production levels and continue to expand our margins. Yeah. John, this is Ken. Yeah. John, this is Ken. I think the real thing in Dorado is it doesn't take a lot of wells to generate significant volumes out of that play. So I don't know the exact right pace. But what we want to do is we want to develop this at the right pace where we don't outrun our learnings. We have making significant progress as we really get those operational synergies together that Billy talked about and so that pace of development is really going to be dictated by not outrunning our learnings."

            "name": "Billy Helms",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. EOG's operating performance continues to improve with the first quarter generating outstanding results. Our first quarter volume, capital expenditures and total per unit cash operating cost performance came in better than our forecasted targets. I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication and outstanding execution, giving us a great start to 2023. Our full year 2023 capital and production plans are unchanged. We forecast a $6 billion capital program to deliver 3% oil volume growth and 9% total production growth. We maintained the pace of activity from the fourth quarter of last year in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford. Our core foundational plays and continue to expand development in our emerging Powder River Basin, Ohio Utica combo and South Texas Dorado plays. Well productivity and cost performance are meeting or beating expectations across our portfolio as each play sustains sufficient activity to support continued innovation. As Ezra mentioned, our foundational assets in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford are performing exceptionally well and were a big part of our overall strong first quarter results. Sustaining a consistent level of activity in these core plays is driving operational improvements and continues to be one of the primary hedges to offset areas of cost inflation. We are excited about the outlook for these assets in the years ahead. Even as these assets mature, we can apply technical learnings, operational innovation and leverage prior infrastructure investments to continue to improve the operating margin and capital efficiencies of these world-class assets. In the Delaware Basin, we expect well performance will continue to improve this year, delivering productivity and returns well above the premium hurdle rate. Last year, our Delaware Wolfcamp wells delivered an average six-month cumulative production of about 34 barrels of oil equivalent per foot and are expected to improve this year. See slide 10 of our updated investor presentation for details. While well mix can impact the relative contribution of oil, NGLs and natural gas, overall performance is improving in large part due to continued innovations like our new completion design. We have now tested 39 wells in the Wolfcamp that are yielding an average increase of 22% in the first year production, with a 20% uplift in the estimated ultimate recovery compared to the similar wells and targets using our previous completion design. With these encouraging results, we now expect to deploy this new design on about 70 wells this year. This new design is continuing to show promise, as we expand the number of wells and test the design across different targets and basins. Operationally, maintaining a consistent level of activity in the Delaware Basin, combined with our culture of continuous improvement is generating noticeable results. Drilling times continue to improve and are generating peer-leading performance aided by our drilling motor program and high-performing staff. The amount of footage drilled per motor run improved by 11% in the first quarter as compared to last year. Similar progress is being achieved with our completion operations with the expansion of our super zipper technique. These efforts, combined with the opportunities that co-developed multiple targets in the stacked pay resource by using our existing surface footprint and an infrastructure are expected to drive significant efficiency gains and continue to improve our margins in the Delaware Basin for years to come. The first -- we first introduced the super zipper completion technique in the Eagle Ford in 2020. Since then, we have expanded its use throughout the play and have more than doubled completions efficiency as measured by completed lateral feet per day. As indicated on page 12 of our quarterly investor slides, the amount of lateral completed per day year-to-date has increased by another 18% compared to last year. In the first quarter, we also set a record in the Eagle Ford, drilling our longest well to-date, reaching a measure depth of nearly 26,500 feet with a lateral length of over 15,500 feet. We expect to continue to see completion efficiency improvements as we extend laterals in the Eagle Ford to 3-plus miles where feasible. As a core operating area that has been under development for more than a decade, the Eagle Ford also benefits from our existing infrastructure from over 3,700 producing wells. Leveraging existing investments made in strategic water, oil and gas infrastructure minimizes future CapEx needs and lowers operating costs. Ongoing improvements to completion operations and leveraging the benefit of existing infrastructure, enable our Eagle Ford finding and development costs to continue to decline. Last year, the Eagle Ford's rate of return was the highest in the plays history. Longer term, we have over a decade of drilling inventory in the Eagle Ford, allowing us to maintain the current production base, while generating high returns and lowering breakevens. As previously mentioned, we are maintaining activity in our core plays and progressing our newer emerging plays. This year's plan in Dorado contemplates eight additional wells completed compared to 2022 in order to achieve a consistent level of activity to drive performance improvements. Our drilling operations are realizing a 29% improvement in the footage drilled per day since 2021. Completion operations will be conducted on a few wells in the second quarter. However, we are evaluating options to delay additional completions originally scheduled later this year due to the current natural gas price environment. To-date, operational progress towards improvements and Dorado's well performance is meeting or exceeding our early expectations. Activity in the Utica combo play is just commencing, yet we are already witnessing the compounding effects of sharing technology across our multiple plays. For example, drilling performance for recent wells is improving on the order of 20% to 30% compared to last year's results with the benefit of our proprietary drilling motor program and precision targeting. We expect similar levels of improvement from our completion program once we begin completing wells in the third quarter. Now for a little color on inflation and industry service costs. As we had anticipated in building this year's plan, the upward inflationary pressure that we witnessed last year appears to have plateaued, which still leaves us confident that our average well cost should increase no more than 10% compared to last year. Early indicators are showing signs of service cost moderation, which is more prevalent in some basins and less than others. We would expect that any softening of service and tubular costs will be slow to manifest into lower well cost and cash operating costs until much later in the year or more likely in 2024. As the year unfolds, we will continue to look for opportunities to leverage our scale and the flexibility of our multi-basin portfolio to manage costs across all operating areas. We also remain highly focused on sustainable cost reductions through innovation, operational performance and execution improvements to mitigate inflation and further drive down our cost structure. Now I will turn it back to Ezra. Yeah. Paul, this is Billy. Let me give you a little highlight maybe of the Permian program and what we are seeing there. And then I will probably ask Jeff to give some more detailed color to help explain some of the improvements we are seeing. Overall, we are very pleased with the progress our Permian plans are showing. In general, our results are playing out just as we anticipated. In our plans, we had planned - all of our type curves are modeled and forecasted, and the results are meeting or exceeding our forecasted results including the co-development of different targets at the same time. But I'd like to go ahead and turn it over now to Jeff to maybe talk a little bit about the new completion design and the results that we are seeing and then some of the productivity improvements. And then, Paul, the other part of your question was on Dorado and really what triggered the change of pace that we have thinking about. We put together a plan originally just to remind everybody that really, it was not a huge acceleration in activity planned for. We're only adding eight wells. So the plan never contemplated a huge amount of growth in the -- in Dorado to start with. However, we always remain flexible on our program and with -- that's the benefit of having a multi-basin portfolio as we can move activity around based on market conditions or other factors as they present themselves. Naturally, with gas prices remaining weak and moving into the year, it's only natural to think about options that we might be able to explore with Dorado activity. We are exploring the option to delay some completions that were scheduled for later in the year and we will give more color on that as that unfolds. Yeah. Derek, this is Billy Helms. So, yeah, the second quarter CapEx has gotten to be a little bit higher than the first quarter and it's mainly due to some non-drilling and completion capital, the indirect or infrastructure and those kind of things that we put in our program that it was recently scheduled to occur at the latter half of the first quarter, it turned out to be pushed into the second quarter. That's the reason the first quarter under -- was under our own CapEx and the second quarter is a little bit higher. And that really sticks to our original plan, we had always planned for about 52% of our CapEx to be spent in the first half of the year and so we have still on target for that in the 48% in the back half, so that's kind of the way the program plays out. Yeah. John, this is Billy Helms. So for Dorado, yes, we are increasing activity there, mainly from a drilling side. Recently we had planned to also bring in additional completions. On the drilling side, I would add that, we are seeing a tremendous improvement in the efficiency gains there. The team there has done just an excellent job of being able to improve our drilling times, lower our well costs and just increase efficiencies overall. So we have very pleased with the progress we have made and so I think that increased activity we have seeing on the drilling side is playing out what we have seeing on the drilling results and giving us insights into how we can continue to lower well costs going forward. On the completion side, we have some planned activity here in the second quarter. But beyond that, we have looking at ways we can -- with the flexibility we have in our program to delay the completion of any wells that would be on in the second half. And really just thinking about how we can leverage some of the learnings from our other programs in play and combine that activity with the activity we have in Dorado by sharing equipment, people and those learnings across our portfolio. So we don't really feel the need to jump in and complete those wells, but we are evaluating options as they roll out and we will see how those present themselves. And then as far as the activities for... ...LNG demand, I guess, the play -- the unique thing about this play, it didn't take a lot of wells. The wells are very prolific. So we have well ahead of any timing that we would need to add LNG capacity in the future. And then we also have the flexibility of moving gas from other operating areas, multi-basin portfolio to the Gulf Coast. So don't think of the Dorado is just simply applying itself to the LNG market. It's got the opportunity but looking at gas from other players to the Gulf Coast as well through our marketing arrangements. Yeah. Arun, this is Billy. So the uplift we have seeing, part of that was actually baked into our guidance. We didn't bake in the entire amount. So when we put together our plan, we understood that there were going to be some uplift. We did plan on 70 wells to be part of that calendar year program and we have baked in some of that into our production guidance, knowing that we would see some uplift. I think the uplift is surprising us a little bit more to the upside, but I would say that's already factored into our guidance that we have issued. And then as far as the what we have doing there, we were finding that the target is critical. So the rock type is critical to why it works in some areas and so we have cautiously moving through our program to make sure we test as we go to understand which our targets lend themselves best to this design change and which ones don't, because it does cost a little bit more and we want to be very disciplined on how we apply that across the fields we maximize as Jeff was saying, the economics of the play. Yeah. Arun, on Beehive, we have still excited to be able to drill that well, but it's going to be probably in the first half of next year before we have able to get that well drilled. And... ...just really due to some timing on permits and those kind of things. Yeah. Charles, this is Billy. Certainly, it really is not triggered on a specific gas price, but just the overall softness we see in the current market conditions and the need to simply bring more gas on in this current condition. As we talk near-term, we understand the near-term softness in the market but longer term, medium and longer term, we have still very bullish on the long-term outlook for gas. So we do look at the different flex -- the flexibility we have in the program and we have evaluating options to be able to successfully push those back in the year. And we have just continue to remain disciplined on our investment to make sure we have maximizing the value to the company over the long-term."

Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures can be found on EOG's website. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Jeff Leitzell, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor Relations. Here is Ezra. Thanks, Ezra. EOG generated outstanding financial performance in the first quarter. We produced $1.6 billion of adjusted net income or $2.69 per share and $1.1 billion of free cash flow. Timing differences associated with working capital accounted for an additional $661 million of cash inflow in the quarter. Our outstanding financial results were driven by strong operating performance. Compared with the prior year, first quarter production volumes increased 2% for oil and 7% overall. We mitigated most of the inflationary headwinds to limit the increase to per unit cash operating costs to just 3% or $10.59 per BOE, which was more than offset by a 12% decline in the DD&A rate. Capital expenditures in the quarter of $1.5 billion came in $100 million below target. Our longstanding free cash flow priorities and cash return framework remain consistent. Our priorities are sustainable regular dividend growth, a pristine balance sheet, additional cash return options and low cost property bolt-ons. We are committed to return a minimum of 60% of the annual free cash flow to shareholders through our sustainable regular dividend, special dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. We believe the consistent application of our free cash flow priorities and transparent cash return framework positions the company to create long-term shareholder value through the cycle. In March, we strengthened the balance sheet by paying off a $1.25 billion bond at maturity with cash on hand leaving $3.8 billion of debt on the balance sheet. The next maturity is a $500 million bond due April 2025. Cash at the end of the quarter was $5 billion, yielding a net cash position of $1.2 billion, up $300 million from December 31. Yesterday, our Board declared a second regular dividend of $0.825 per share, the same as last quarter and a 10% increase from the prior year level. The $3.30 annual rate is a $1.9 billion annual commitment. On March 30, we also paid the $1 per share special dividend declared in February. EOG also repurchased $310 million of stock in the first quarter at an average price of $105 per share. For several days during the last two weeks of March, market volatility created a significant dislocation between the price of our stock and the value of the business. We were able to utilize our strong balance sheet to repurchase shares at highly accretive prices. We will continue to monitor the price and value of our stock and you should expect us to step into the market again when there are significant dislocations. We are off to a very strong start in 2023 to deliver on our full year cash return commitment of a minimum of 60% of annual free cash flow. Altogether, the full year regular dividend along with the first quarter special dividend and buyback, represents $2.8 billion of cash return, which is about 50% of the $5.5 billion of free cash flow we forecast for 2023 assuming an $80 oil price. We will continue to monitor oil and gas prices going forward and we remain committed to delivering on our cash return commitment and look forward to updating you over the rest of the year. Here's Billy to discuss operations."

            "content": "Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Strong first quarter execution from every operating team across our multi-basin portfolio has positioned the company to deliver exceptional results in 2023. Production, CapEx, cash operating costs and DD&A all beat targets, which underpinned our excellent financial performance during the first quarter. We earned $1.6 billion of adjusted net income and generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow. Free cash flow helped fund year-to-date cash return to shareholders of $1.4 billion through a combination of regular and special dividends, and share repurchases executed during the first quarter. Combined with our full year regular dividend, we have committed to return $2.8 billion to shareholders in 2023 or about 50% of our estimated 2023 free cash flow assuming an $80 oil price. We are well on our way to achieve our target minimum return of 60% of annual free cash flow to shareholders. Our first quarter results demonstrate the value of EOG's multi-basin portfolio. We have decades of low cost, high return inventory that spans oil, combo and dry natural gas basins throughout the country. Our portfolio includes the Delaware Basin, which remains the largest area of activity in the company and is delivering exceptional returns. After more than a decade of high return drilling, our Eagle Ford asset continues to deliver top tier results while operating at a steady pace. And beyond these core foundational assets, we continue to invest in our emerging Powder River Basin, Ohio Utica Combo and South Texas Dorado plays, which contribute to EOG's financial performance today, while also laying the groundwork for years of future high return investment. Our portfolio provides flexibility to invest with discipline and develop each asset at a pace that allows it to get better. It provides optionality to actively manage our investments to minimize impacts from inflation. Diversity of our investment portfolio also translates to diverse sales market options, enabling us to pursue the highest netbacks. Our shift to premium drilling several years ago has helped to decouple EOG's performance from short-term swings in the market. The result is an ability to deliver consistent, operational and financial performance that our shareholders have come to expect and that drives long-term value through the cycle. Recession risk and the near-term demand outlook for oil continues to drive volatility of prices month-to-month. However, our outlook remains positive, inventory levels currently near the five-year average are reducing as we progress through the year, global demand continues to increase and is forecast to reach record levels by year-end and new supply has moderated from pre-pandemic levels of growth. Longer term, with the reduced investment in upstream projects the last several years, we remain constructive on future pricing. For North American gas, near-term prices reflect high inventory levels due to this year's warm winter and reduced LNG demand during repairs at Freeport. As such, we are currently evaluating options to delay some activity at Dorado. The medium- and long-term outlook for natural gas, however, continues to strengthen. Currently, U.S. LNG demand is at record levels, with an additional 7 Bcf a day capacity under construction or through FID with expected startup between 2024 to 2027 that should position the U.S. as a leader in the global LNG market. Our confidence in the outlook for our business is demonstrated by our capital allocation decisions in the first quarter. Disciplined reinvestment in our high return inventory continues to lower our breakeven and expand the free cash flow potential of EOG. We strengthened our balance sheet by retiring debt, paid out nearly 100% of free cash flow in regular and special dividends, and we utilized our repurchase authorization to buy back $310 million worth of stock late in the quarter during a significant market dislocation. I am confident EOG has the assets, the technology and the people to deliver both return on capital and return of capital for years to come. In a moment, Billy will discuss why we believe our foundational assets in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford will provide higher returns, margins and free cash flow in the years ahead, and why we remain excited about the progress we are making in our emerging assets, Powder River Basin, Ohio Utica Combo and South Texas Dorado. But first, here's Tim to review our financial position. Thanks, Billy. In conclusion, I'd like to note the following important takeaways. First, strong execution from every operating team across our multi-basin portfolio has positioned the company to deliver exceptional results in 2023. Thanks goes to our employees for delivering a great first quarter with their outstanding execution. Second, our foundational assets in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford are performing exceptionally well and were a significant part of our first quarter results. Third, our first quarter performance demonstrates the value of EOG's multi-basin portfolio. We have decades of low cost, high return inventory that spans oil combo and dry natural gas basins throughout the country. And fourth, our long-term outlook for both oil and gas remains positive, and our shift to premium drilling several years ago has helped decouple EOG's performance from short-term swings in the market. The result is an ability to deliver consistent, operational and financial performance that our shareholders have come to expect and that drives long-term value through the cycle. Thanks for listening. We will now go to Q&A. Yes. Leo, this is Ezra Yacob. Good morning. I think that's -- I think you have summarized it pretty well. Our strategy hasn't really changed. We are committed to returning at least 60% of our free cash flow on an annual basis. Year-to-date, as Tim had mentioned, our cash return commitment is $2.8 billion. It's approximately 50% of our -- what would be our fiscal year free cash flow at the assumed $80 oil price there. And just to recall, the cash return priorities for us, it really begins with the regular dividend as the first priority. The excess free cash flow, as you said, will either come back in the form of special dividends, which we have paid seven quarters of the last eight quarters, we have distributed a special dividend or opportunistic buybacks. And what we saw in the first quarter when we executed a repurchase was, we really saw a dislocation dominantly associated with the banking crisis and we were able to step in to repurchase approximately $300 million of the stock. So, as you pointed out, really in line with our strategy. Now what I would say has changed over the last 18 months since putting the repurchase authorization in place is really the strength of our company. Our primary value proposition, of course, is investing in high return projects, adding lower cost reserves to our company's profile, which thereby reduces our breakevens and expands our margins. And so as we continue to execute on this strategy and we continue to strengthen the company, the way we consider dislocations certainly evolves as well. Good morning, Scott. Yes. This is Ezra. Those are all accurate to the tune of how we kind of look at these opportunities. As we have talked about in the past, it kind of begins with the macro, first of all, right? What's happening on both global and domestic supply and demand balances. As far as dislocations go, we do measure, we look at the intrinsic value of our business relative to different pricing scenarios, both short- and long-term. And we do evaluate trading multiples, not just at EOG versus the peers, but actually for the entire peer group and see what's happening. And so one comparison that could be made is the dramatic sell-off that the industry saw last summer, which was associated with a pretty dramatic pullback in oil prices, that was really fundamentally supported by a change we felt in the macro outlook. There was a significant announcement there for roughly 300 million barrels of petroleum reserves that would be hitting the market on the supply side from across the globe. What we saw in the first quarter was not really supported by a big change in the forecast on the fundamentals. Potentially really just triggered from the banking crisis, potentially an increased fear on the demand side from increased recession, but we really feel like most of that has already been priced in to the market on the demand side. And so when we saw a pullback there in a dislocation with the market, really again associated in late March there with the banking crisis. We really didn't hesitate and we have able to step into the market and do that $300 million share repurchase and we think we have really created a significant amount of value there for the shareholders. Yeah. Scott, great question. So, yeah, the design, as I talked about, it was first utilized in the Eagle Ford. It was back in -- right around 2016 and we didn't see the same uplift that we see in the Permian. It wasn't quite as extensive, but it really has to do with the difference in rock type and their geological properties between the two plays. But it did provide the application, we are really beneficial as far as helping lower well costs and reduce our completion time. So, yes, it is something that we still do employ there in the Eagle Ford, and as I said, in a lot of our emerging plays. As far as in the Delaware and our rollout, our plan is to increase, as I said, the year-over-year number by 2.5 times what we did last year. And I also did state, there's just a slight cost increase, so we want to be cognizant of how quickly we roll it out and like anything in our program, we just don't want to outrun our learnings and we want to make sure that we continue to evolve this technique as we learn. No. I'd say it's attributed to our co-development strategy. I mean it's -- really, it's been a process over time. So if you look at back in 2016 in the Wolfcamp or I should say our strategy through the whole Permian, we had six unique targets and kind of fast forward here, we have up to 18 unique targets. Obviously, with that, the spacing has changed both in zone and from a vertical perspective. So our teams have methodically obviously tested this. They have taken into account the actual spacing, how they interact, the depletion to it, and we have come up obviously with the best co-development strategy really to maximize the overall production of those intervals and then obviously maximize the economics related to it. No. It's really -- it's about maximizing the overall resource there, as you said. So we do have the optimal amount of communication that we have actually able to optimize the recovery and then like I said, really maximize those economics. Yes. Neil, this is Ezra. As I stated kind of in the opening remarks, we still remain constructive on kind of the longer term gas story for the U.S. We think that the U.S., especially Dorado being a big piece of it has really captured low cost of gas supply that can really compete on the global scale with the amount of LNG that the U.S. is exporting right now, which is at record levels right now for the U.S. combined with the number of projects that have made it through a financial or a final investment decision and then the additional projects that are still being kind of planned and discussed, the U.S. will be long-term position to be really a global leader in the LNG market. Now gas is always difficult because it is highly volatile when it comes to things like the short-term pricing on weather. And it's one reason you have heard this morning from both myself, Ken and Billy that the most important thing we look at when we develop Dorado is to really invest in that at the right pace for the long term. We want to make sure that we have not out running our learnings, that we appropriately invest to be able to keep our costs low and at the end of the day, really keep our margins wide. We want to put in the correct infrastructure to keep our low operating costs, because the margins are always pretty skinny on gas and the low-cost producer for gas is going to be able to be exposed to the global market here in the U.S. for the long-term. Yes, Josh. This is Ezra. When we came out with that cash return guidance with a minimum of 60%, we really did just mean that, but it's a minimum. In fact, last year we returned excess of this 60% free cash flow to our shareholders. And we started with that 60%, because we feel confident on that, especially when we roll in kind of almost a peer-leading regular dividend that we would be able to compete and deliver that through the cycles. So when we think about a specific target for cash on hand, I wouldn't say that we have a real target. We have spoken about some indicators and things that we strategically think about as far as holding a cash balance. The first, of course, is we like to have a bit of cash on balance just to run the business to make us allow us to stay out of commercial paper, and historically, that's around about $2 billion kind of depending at what point you are in the cycle. And then in addition to that, we do like to have cash on hand so that we can be strategic and counter cyclically invest in opportunities as they arise, whether that's at times investing in casing or line pipe or last year we were able to step in and do an acquisition in one of our emerging players there in the Utica, where we actually purchased approximately 130,000 mineral rights. And then lastly, of course, just the stock repurchase, which we exercised here in the first quarter. We have talked about being able to utilize that opportunistically and really part of our strategy, the reason that you can actually step into a dislocated market and have the confidence to do a buyback is that you have got the strength of the balance sheet, which includes cash on hand. That's really what we have going for and so I think that provides another compelling reason to carry potentially a higher cash balance than the company has historically done. I just want to thank everyone for participating on the call this morning and I especially want to thank our employees for the outstanding results they delivered in this first quarter. Thank you."

Here\u2019s Ezra.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Pearce. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Since the end of 2020, EOG has generated more than $22 billion of free cash flow and more than $25 billion in adjusted net income. We've increased our regular dividend rate 160% and including both regular and special dividends paid or committed to pay more than $13 billion directly to shareholders and $3.2 billion indirectly through share repurchases, all while reducing debt 35%. EOG has a history of delivering consistently strong financial and operational results, and the third quarter is simply more of the same. Led by our employees' commitment to operational excellence and capital discipline, we outperformed on oil, natural gas and NGL volumes for the quarter as well as beating expectations on per unit cash operating costs. We generated $1.6 billion of adjusted net income and $1.5 billion of free cash flow and returned $1.3 billion of that free cash flow back to our shareholders through a mix of our regular dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. In addition to announcing third quarter results yesterday, we demonstrated confidence in our ability to generate strong free cash flow in the future as well as our continued commitment to return a significant portion of cash to our shareholders by increasing the regular dividend 7% and boosting our share repurchase authorization by $5 billion. Cash return to shareholders begins with our focus on the regular dividend, which has never been reduced or suspended in the 27 years since we've been paying one, and it reflects our confidence in the increasing capital efficiency of our business going forward. And we continue to improve our capital efficiency by leveraging technology and innovation across both our foundational and emerging assets. That is one of the key advantages of operating in multiple basins. We are able to drive improvements to operational performance through technology transfer between those basins. We are drilling further and faster than at any time in our history, completing wells with fewer people and less equipment due to efficient operations, and we continue to capture additional value through our marketing strategy. EOG's performance is sustainable, because it's driven by our culture, empowering each employee to be a business person first, focusing on returns and seeking ways to improve the business every day. Our culture is our competitive advantage and combined with focus on sustainable value creation through the cycles, gives us confidence in our ongoing performance as we finish 2024 and position ourselves for 2025. In a moment, Jeff will provide some early commentary on our 2025 capital program, but our investment strategy always begins with capital discipline, balancing short and long-term free cash flow generation, return on capital employed and return of capital to shareholders. We also consider the macro environment in which we are operating. And currently, the overall macro environment remains dynamic. Oil inventory levels are below the five-year average with both supply and demand showing moderate growth year-over-year. We expect to finish 2024 with strong demand, slowing into a seasonally lower first quarter and then increasing throughout the rest of 2025. Domestically, while efficiency gains continue across the industry, we anticipate another year of slower US liquids growth grounded in the lower number of active drilling rigs and drilled but uncompleted wells. Regarding North American natural gas, inventory levels have moved closer to the five-year average throughout the year due to a combination of producer discipline and increased demand driven primarily by power generation. We remain optimistic on the long-term outlook for gas demand beginning in and increasing throughout 2025 from additional LNG projects coming online and ongoing increases in power generation. Finally, last month, we released our annual sustainability report for 2023, highlighting our leading environmental performance and commitment to safe operations. We achieved a GHG intensity rate below our 2025 target for the second year in a row and achieved a methane emissions percentage at/or below our 2025 target for the third consecutive year. Our in-house methane monitoring solution has progressed beyond the pilot phase and is integrated into our standard operating procedures. And our carbon capture and storage pilot project is operational, and we stand ready to deploy our learnings to future operations. Our consistent sustainability performance is a result of our empowered and collaborative workforce and our continued investment in innovation and technology to achieve not only leading environmental performance, but also strong and consistent safety performance throughout our operations. This year's report highlights our innovative culture that drives EOG's mission to be among the highest return, lowest cost and lowest emissions producers playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy. Now here's Ann with details on our financial performance.\nAnn Janssen: Thanks, Ezra. EOG continues to create long-term shareholder value. During the third quarter, we earned $1.6 billion of adjusted net income and generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow on $1.5 billion capital expenditures. Third quarter capital expenditures were in line with forecast, and we still expect our full year capital expenditures to be about $6.2 billion. Cash on the balance sheet at quarter end is temporarily higher due to the postponement of certain tax payments until the first quarter of next year from disaster relief granted for severe weather events in Texas, including Hurricane Barrel. Our ongoing marketing strategy to diversify and expand our access to premium markets also delivered exceptional results during the third quarter with peer-leading US price realizations of $76.95 per barrel of oil and $1.84 per Mcf for natural gas. Finally, we paid a $0.91 per share dividend and repurchased $758 million of shares during the quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated $4.1 billion of billion of free cash flow which helped fund $3.8 billion of cash returned to shareholders. Of that $3.8 billion, $1.6 billion was paid in regular dividends and was complemented by $2.2 billion in share repurchases through the third quarter. Taking into account our full year regular dividend, we have committed to return $4.3 billion to shareholders in 2024 and we are on track to exceed not only our minimum cash return commitment of 70% of annual free cash flow, but also last year's cash return of 85%. The EOG's commitment to high-return investments is delivering high returns to our shareholders. Yesterday, we were pleased to announce a 7% increase to what is already a top-tier regular dividend, not only for our industry but the broader market. This increase reflects our confidence in the fundamental strength of our business which continues to get better through consistent execution of EOG's value proposition. Efficiencies and technology applied throughout our multi-basin portfolio continue to sustainably improve EOG's capital efficiency. A growing sustainable regular dividend remains the foundation of our cash return commitment and we believe is the best indicator of the company's confidence in its future performance. In addition to the dividend increase, the Board approved a $5 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization to supplement the $1.8 billion remaining on the authorization as of quarter end. The total $6.8 billion buyback capacity retains our flexibility to deliver on our cash return commitment to shareholders. Over the last several quarters, we have favored buybacks to complement our regular dividend and we will continue to monitor the market for opportunities to step in and repurchase shares for the remainder of the year. EOG's balance sheet underpins the financial strength of the company and remains a strategic priority. To optimize EOG's capital structure going forward, we intend to position our balance sheet such that our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio equals less than one times at $45 WTI. We believe this is an efficient and prudent long-term capital structure for a cyclical industry that will support our commitment to deliver shareholder value. As a result, we anticipate refinancing upcoming debt maturities, increasing our debt balance to $5 billion to $6 billion range in the next 12 to 18 months and maintaining our cash balance at levels similar to what we have carried for the last two years. By managing our debt levels toward this more efficient capital structure, we are increasing our capacity to return cash to shareholders. Now here's Jeff to review operating results.\nJeff Leitzell: Thanks, Ann. We delivered another outstanding quarter, thanks to our employees and their consistent execution across our multi-basin portfolio. Their focus on continued improvement through innovation, technology advancements and operational control is why our third quarter volumes and per unit cash operating costs beat expectations. Oil volumes beat our forecast, primarily due to better-than-expected productivity from new wells, driven by continuous improvement to our completion designs. Year-over-year, we have increased our maximum pumping rate capacity by approximately 15% per frac fleet on average. The benefit is twofold: Faster pump times and better well performance. Higher pumping rates provides our team with the flexibility to tailor each high-intensity completion design around the unique geological characteristics of every target. This, in turn, has helped to maximize the stimulated rock volume in the reservoir, resulting in improved well performance. Efficiency improvements due to faster pump times, combined with stronger well performance have more than offset the additional cost for these increased pumping rates. As a result of third quarter volume performance beats, we are once again raising full year guidance. Our oil production midpoint has increased by 800 barrels per barrels per day, natural gas liquids by 2,800 day and natural gas by 24 million standard cubic feet per day. We also beat per unit cash operating cost targets during the third quarter. The primary drivers were lower lease operating expense due to less workover expense and fuel savings. We now expect our full year per unit cash operating cost to be lower than forecasted and have reduced guidance accordingly. Our capital expenditures in the third quarter were in line with our forecast with only minor differences primarily due to timing of operations. In addition, well cost deflation driven primarily by efficiencies is playing out as we had forecasted at the start of the year, resulting in a 3% to 5% year-over-year decrease in well cost. As a result, our expectations for full year CapEx remain unchanged at $6.2 billion at the midpoint. The efficiency gains we continue to realize this year demonstrate the value of our multi-basin portfolio and decentralized structure. Ideas born in one operating area are replicated across multiple basins through technology transfer. Two examples of innovation, expanding through our portfolio and driving efficiencies this year are extended laterals and our in-house motor program. Average lateral lengths for our domestic drilling program continued to increase. In the Delaware Basin, we now expect to drill more than 70 3-mile laterals this year compared to our original forecast of 50. We've also set a new lateral length record in the Eagle Ford not only for EOG, but for all of Texas. Our Aspen A 1H well was drilled in our western acreage and has a lateral length of over 22,000 feet. As we highlighted last quarter, longer laterals allow for more time focused on drilling downhole and less time moving equipment on surface, decreasing overall downtime in days to drill. In addition, longer laterals help unlock new potential from acreage that might not otherwise meet our economic thresholds. EOG's in-house motor program also continues to pay dividends. In the Delaware Basin, we are testing the limits of our drilling motors in the shallower Leonard Shale and Bone Spring formations. While drilling the production hole section, we attempt to drill as much of the vertical curve and lateral portions of the wellbore with one motor run. Historically, this operation requires a minimum of three motor runs and two trips, which is a pause in drilling to pull a motor out of the wellbore and replace it with a new one. As a result, we have eliminated over one full trip per well in the shallower Delaware Basin targets. Given that each trip can cost $150,000 or more, the cost savings and efficiency gains from using better designed higher-quality motors continues to add significant value to our drilling program. This is just one of several examples of the value the EOG Motor program has created. Looking company-wide since the start of 2023, we have increased our drilled footage per motor run by over 20% versus third-party rental options. As we continue to test, learn, and redesign our drilling motors, we see substantial upside to our future drilling performance as we expand motor innovation throughout our multi-basin portfolio. In Ohio, we've made significant progress this year transitioning the 225,000 net acres of the volatile oil window in the Utica play from delineation into development. We now have five packages online and producing for more than 100 days, three of which have been producing well over 180 days. Both oil and liquids performance continues to meet or exceed expectations demonstrating the premium quality of this play. We are also capturing sustainable operational efficiencies through multi-well pad development and continuous operations. On the drilling side, the Utica provides an ideal operational environment to make significant gains quickly. We have decreased drilling days to drill three-mile laterals 29% year-over-year and have already achieved a record of drilling more than two miles in a single day. We also have made significant gains on the completion side, achieving a nearly 13% increase in completed lateral feet per day compared to last year. Over the next few years, activity in the Utica will continue to be primarily focused in the volatile oil window, where we anticipate our well costs will average less than $650 per effective treated lateral foot with finding cost and development costs in the range of $6 to $8 per barrel of oil equivalent. For 2025, we anticipate a 50% increase in Utica activity as we continue to leverage consistent operations to achieve additional economies of scale. Our large contiguous acreage position lends itself to developing a long-life, repeatable, low-cost play competitive with the premier unconventional plays across North America. Previewing 2025 company-wide, with the outstanding performance we have delivered this year, we do not see a need to significantly adjust activity next year. We do, however, expect very minor shifts in activity between basins with a continued increase in activity in the Utica and another year of actively managing our Dorado investment with a one-rig program. This will allow us to continue to capture some economies of scale across our emerging assets and advance our technological understanding of these plays while delivering the operational and financial performance that our shareholders appreciate. Now, here's Ezra to wrap up.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks Jeff. EOG recently celebrated our 25th anniversary as an independently traded public company. And while many things have changed across our industry, EOG's fundamental strategy and commitment to creating share value for our shareholders has remained consistent. First, our commitment to capital discipline begins with reinvestment at a pace to support continuous improvement across our assets delivering returns through the cycle, generating free cash flow, and maintaining a pristine balance sheet to support a sustainable growing regular dividend. Second, our strong operational execution begins with being a first mover in exploration to maintain a low-cost, high-quality multi-basin inventory.

We take pride in our collaborative, multidisciplinary teams that drive innovation, utilizing our technology and real-time data collection to drive decision-making. Thanks for listening. Now we will go to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nSteve Richardson: Hi, good morning. I was wondering, if we could start as the optimization of the balance sheet. This is a new wrinkle from the company. And I wonder, if you could just talk about this incremental gross debt that you're looking at adding the time frame? Should we think about that $2 billion coming concurrent when you would look to refi the existing maturities? And then also the knock-on of that is -- how do you look at redeploying that cash, assuming into the buyback? And does this mean that you'll be taking shareholder returns above, sustainably above that minimum commitment for the next couple of quarters. Maybe just talk about time frame around that, please?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Steve. Good morning. Thanks for the question. The decision is aimed at really just making our capital structure more efficient. We're moving to a level of debt that's more appropriate for a company of our size and strength, still being respectful that we're in a cyclical industry. Ultimately, the move is designed to allow us to move more equity into the debt side. We've always talked about we've been pretty consistent, but the goal of our company has never been to get to a zero absolute debt. And so really, the timing right now looks pretty good as we have a couple of bonds coming into maturity in the next 12 18 months, the market is looking a little more favorable than it has in the last few quarters. And so as we step into this -- as we talked about, as Ann mentioned, our debt target will be to keep total debt to EBITDA at less than one times, leverage ratio at a $45 WTI, which if you calculate that out is approximately a $5 billion to $6 billion range. And so you're right, that will free up some additional cash. And really, what I would look for is, yes, in the near-term, that does imply that we'll definitely be in a position to exceed the 70% commitment and quite frankly, be closer to 100% and at times, more than 100% of return of free cash flow to the shareholders. But I want to put a more specific time target on it other than the next 12-month time frame, the next 12 to 15 months is we look to be opportunistic in the market, not only with share repurchases, but also the timing of reaching out on these bonds.\nSteve Richardson: That's great. Really strong choice capital allocation. Thanks. If I could maybe just a follow-up on natural gas. You have arguably the lowest cost dry gas asset in the market and with the Verde Pipeline finishing, you've got some real opportunities here. I appreciate the comments on a 1-rig program for 2025, but you mentioned off the top as how optimistic the natural gas demand outlook looks. So how should we think about the contango of the gas curve and what signal you're looking for to apply more capital there, arguably that you are at the low end of the cost curve in North America?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Steve, that's another great question on Dorado. We've highlighted last quarter that cash operating costs are right around that $1 already for the asset. And so we do consider it to be one of the lowest cost natural gas projects in all of the US and very well positioned. Verde is online, which we're very excited about. But the North American gas inventory, as you said, is it's currently about 5% above the five-year average still. And we'll see what happens with winter. But either way, whether it's warm or cold, the industry does appear to have not only some curtailed volumes, but there is also some gas DUCs that will likely come online pretty quickly. And so what we see -- and this is somewhat in line with where we've been for the last two years is that 2025 is really going to be an inflection point for North American gas demand with LNG beginning to come online and then coming online really 2025, 2026 2027. And when we think about that, it's -- as we calculated about 10 to 12 Bcf a day of LNG that's under construction and should come online in that time frame. And then above and beyond that, we actually see another almost 10 to 12 Bcf a day in demand growth between now and the end of the decade, that's really associated with power demand, a little bit of industrial, some Mexico exports, but really, it's power demand driven not only by new power demand from AI and electrification, but also coal power retirements. And so our goal with Dorado is to continue to invest at a pace where we can capture some of the economies of scale, as Jeff talked about, which in the last two years has really been a 1-rig program. And as the market starts to open up for us, we'd like to increase that. The next kind of critical point in these unconventional plays is to get to a continuous completion spread. But we're very excited about where we can go and the asset that we've captured there.\nOperator: And our next question today will come from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Securities LLC. Please go ahead.\nArun Jayaram: Yes, good morning. Ezra, I was wondering if we could talk about puts and takes in terms of 2025 capital. Jeff mentioned, that you expect to run relatively flattish activity but with the movements between some basins. So I was wondering if you could kind of characterize how capital would move. You're going to be a little bit more active at Dorado, we think, in the Utica I think your strategic infrastructure spend is going to go down on a year-over-year basis, and there's obviously some of the efficiency gains that Jeff was highlighting.\nJeff Leitzell: Yes, Arun, this is Jeff. Yes. Thanks for the question. So yes, as you talked about, and we talked about in our opening comments, the plan right now, which is still early, is to maintain relatively flat activity next year and those minor shifts, I mean, they're going to be fairly small. I mean a few wells here and there and pretty immaterial across the portfolio, which will lead to the modest increase in activity we talked about in the Utica. So what I'd first say is just about our current program and the activity levels we're at, we're extremely happy with the progress we've made. And the improvements we've seen across the whole portfolio by really focusing on that. And where we're at now is really we want to focus on the emerging plays and really getting them to that critical activity level to maximize our efficiencies, which the first step in that is getting it to one full drilling rig. And then really, the next hurdle is going to be getting those plays to one full frac fleet. So in the Utica, as we've touched on, we should be there next year. We're looking at about a 50% increase in activity. We'll be up to two full rigs and one full frac fleet by year-end. So we'll reach those critical points. And then Dorado, which you talk about we really anticipate maintaining just the one full rig that we've been running. We've been seeing outstanding performance and efficiencies from that consistent operations. But we'll continue to manage the investments in our completion activity just as we watch the natural gas market and move through the winter. So I think by doing all this, this really allows us to continue progress each one of those emerging plays, but we'll still be able to deliver another year of strong results from the portfolio. And then just real quick on infrastructure. You did hit on it. Over the last few years, we've had a little bit of additional infrastructure spend that was strategic with the Janus gas plant and the Verde pipeline. This year, it was around $400 million. And looking forward to 2025, really, we just -- we're going to be finishing up that Janus plant and a few little things from a facilities aspect on the Verde pipeline. So we expect strategic spend there next year to be somewhere around $100 million. And then as those continue to roll off and we look in the future, we'll start moving back towards that 15% to kind of 20% indirect level.\nArun Jayaram: Got it. That's helpful. Maybe just a follow-up to Steve's question on the optimization of the balance sheet. You mentioned Azure that this could maybe drive higher cash returns to investors. How much does the potential to do A&D or bolt-ons, countercyclical A&D? How did that progress in terms of your thinking terms of going to $5 billion $6 billion of gross debt?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Arun, this is Ezra. Yes, I mean, I think you're right. While we're going to be making our capital structure more efficient, we'll be very well positioned still to have what we consider industry's leading balance sheet, quite frankly. And that does going to preserve -- it's going to preserve the financial strength of the business for us. That will give us the ability to still maintain the ability to continue to invest in countercyclic, low-cost property bolt-ons, other things that we've done in the past along those same lines. And what I would say is the ability to return more than 100% of annual free cash flow the near term and deliver more cash to shareholders over time, it's really just an effect of, again, shifting some of the equity into the debt side. Where we're starting at today is such a position of strength with a cash positive position that even leveraging up on this debt side, it still puts us in a great position to be able to continue to execute on a lot of our priorities. Like I said, including low-cost property bolt-ons to be able to be in a position to opportunistically step into larger share repurchases if the opportunity presents itself. And so we really see this as a very shareholder-friendly maneuver that we're doing. And like I said, the timing of it is really just what we kind of see in the market and the fact that we do have some of the bonds maturing.\nOperator: And our next question today will come from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nScott Hanold: Thanks. And I'm going to hit on the balance sheet optimization. And as you just sort of answered part of my question there with regards to like the why now. It's definitely unique to the sector. And just kind of curious, was this a decision you've been contemplating for some time. Kind of what was the catalyst to move on it now? And also with respect to that, how much value creation from shifting to a lower cost capital structure like moving from equity to debt, some of that value. How much of a value improvement do you expect to see from that?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Scott, this is Ezra again. So, on the strategic portion, and then maybe I'll hand over to Ann to get in a little bit more of the mechanics. But yes, I think this is really in line with where the management and Board has been thinking for a long time. As I started off the Q&A session with Steve, I mentioned that I think we've been pretty consistent talking about the goal of the company has never been to go to an absolute zero debt level. But really, we like to be positioned to create long-term shareholder value and having different measures -- different abilities to do that. One thing that we love about having that pristine balance sheet that I should have just mentioned when speaking with Arun is also the peer leading regular dividend that we have. And this gives us confidence in being able to continue to grow that and maintain that dividend. As I said in my opening remarks, it's been 27 years that we've been paying that dividend without ever needing to suspend it or cut it. And that's something we're very proud about. So, we really look at the entire priority of our cash flows when we were thinking about this. And the trigger again, that's caused it right now is just where we're at in the macro environment. And not from the commodity side, but really from the financial side. If you recall, Scott, the last bond that we retired was about a $1.2 billion bond back in Q1 of 2023. And that was right decision at the time for us, but one of the reasons is not only were interest rates climbing at that time, but as we all recall, there was a -- what turned out to be a rather somewhat small banking crisis at the time, felt like it could maybe possibly balloon into something larger. So, we refinanced that -- or I'm sorry, we paid that off with cash on hand. And essentially, since then, interest rates have always been climbing up until the recent last couple of quarters where things have kind of plateaued, and we're starting to see them bend over a little bit. So, those are really the things that have kind of given us the confidence to kind of go ahead and make this decision now. As far as moving the equity onto the debt side and the impact for us, I'll hand that off to Ann.\nAnn Janssen: Yes. The way we look at it is the optimal capital structure is one where the balance sheet has more debt than what we have today. So, basically, we're looking at putting on a level of debt that is more appropriate for our company of our size and strength in this point in the cyclical industry. So, if you want to look at those parameters as we mentioned, first, we wanted to be less than 1 times total debt to EBITDA leverage ratio at approximate bottom cycle prices around $45. And if you compute that out, that gives us a yield of total debt level of about $5 billion to $6 billion. Conversely, if you look at the cash side of the business, as we look at the appropriate level of cash, we think that's currently about the level we've held for the last two years. We need about a minimum of $2 billion in cash to run the business on a daily basis. And then that additional cash allows us to backstop the regular dividend as well as support additional cash return and take advantage of those countercyclical opportunities. So, again, echoing Azar's comments, our main objective is just to create long-term value for our shareholders. And we think setting up the balance sheet the way we are, will better position us to have an appropriate level of cash to run the business, continue to make those investments as they present themselves and backs up our regular dividend through the cycle.\nScott Hanold: Understood. Thanks. My follow-up is a little bit on the election. The outcomes certainly have created a lot of volatility in the markets. And as you look at what this means to the energy industry and specifically for EOG. What are some of your initial kind of takeaways and the potential tailwinds at play?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Scott. We still got obviously, the presidential and the Senate is getting close to -- you can kind of see who's going to control those two portions of our Congress and then we'll see where the house finishes up after that. I think for us, what we really prepare for is kind of this next couple of months. Whenever there's a change of administration, this is the time period when we really start to focus in, maybe take some steps to prepare just in case things can slow down. So we're feeling very good very good with where we're at right now. As far as going forward on the industry, I think the industry has come a long way as far as our relationship with not only at the federal level, but really at the local level, working alongside policymakers, regulators and such. And I think the industry is in a spot to continue the performance that we've had over the last few years. When I know I can speak a little more directly for EOG but in the areas that we operate, even the new areas like in Ohio with our Utica play, we've really developed an outstanding relationship. I think many across industry policymakers, really just stakeholders, in general, see that there is a long -- that oil and natural gas are going to play a long -- are going to play a part of the long-term energy solution. And that working with the industry is really the best way kind of achieve the goals of low cost, reliable and lower emissions type of energy sources.\nOperator: And our next question today will come from Leo Mariani with ROTH. Please go ahead.\nLeo Mariani: Hey, guys. Wanted to just touch base a little bit here on the Utica again. So just curious, you guys talked about $6 to $8 a BOE. I think that was exclusive to the volatile oil window. Do you think there's room to kind of continue to get costs down over time? I know you guys have talked about a long-term goal of BOE finding cost, but I think that may have included some of the gassier windows as well. So where are you at in the cost cycle in the Utica? And do you think there's still significant room to take that down?\nKeith Trasko: Yes, Leo, this is Keith. The finding cost range, yes, you're right. It is specific to the volatile oil window and the 225,000 net acres we have there. The range represents the expectations for the next two to three years of development. That's the same for the well cost range. If you back out science on some of our early wells, we've hit the upper end of this range multiple times, and we'll continue to drive it down with the economies of scale. Versus the $5 finding costs we previously disclosed, that reflects the entire 445,000 acre field. That includes the up-dip oil window and the down-dip condensate window. It also incorporates full field development. So we still see line of sight to that, but what we're doing here is giving more guidance in the near-term. Overall, we've made great progress in the play, the well productivity and well cost continue to demonstrate the premium quality and it really highlights our organic exploration strategy.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. Appreciate that. I wanted to see if there was any update on the PRB. I feel like it's been a little time since we've kind of heard on that. How are you kind of viewing that play in terms of how it stacks up against others? And I think you're doing a little bit less on the well side this year than you did last year. You talked about adding a little bit of activity in the Utica for 2025. Just kind of any update in terms of how the PRB is performing and how you're kind of thinking about future activity levels there?\nJeff Leitzell: Yeah, Leo, this is Jeff. So yes, the powder is progressing nicely. As we've talked about for the past handful of years, we've really been focused on the Mowry formation, which is the deeper formation and really kind of lining out our geologic model and what our development plans are there, and we had really good success with it. So shifted over since we've gotten all that overlying geologic data in the Niobrara to where we're really doing a split program this year of about 25 wells split between the more and the Niobrara. And what I would say is we've applied the new geologic models and we're continuing to refine our completion techniques up there. And through the first part of the year, we brought on some of those diabera wells. And I mean, results are very early right now, but they're very encouraging. We are seeing an uptick of greater than probably about 10% increase in productivity versus 2023 in the Niobrara. So moving forward right now, I think we're in a very comfortable spot. We still have little to learn there in the Niobrara and kind of just our development patterns and when to offset in depletion and space. And so I think we're probably going to be pretty consistent with our program as we move into 2025 as we continue to refine those models.\nOperator: And our next question today will come from Kalei Akamine with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKalei Akamine: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for getting me on. My first question is on the gas guide. So we've seen it go up every single quarter this year, and we think that, that's the Permian. I appreciate that the Janus plant is coming online. But I'm wondering if that gas outperformance pulls forward any of your additional midstream development time lines?\nJeff Leitzell: Yeah, Kalei, this is Jeff and no, our plans are pretty secure as far as that goes. And really, there shouldn't be any advancement. I mean all of any of the kind of midstream or I should say, strategic infrastructure projects that we've talked about. I mean, they're on time and they're on pace to come online when we expected. With the Janus gas plant, as we've talked about, the plan is to complete that next year. So as we talked about, we'll have a little bit of strategic infrastructure dollars associated with that, about $100 million. But other than that, no, there will be really no acceleration in any of those projects.\nKalei Akamine: Got it. For my follow-up, I'd like to go back to Dorado. I appreciate that it's got very low cash costs. I think in the past, we've talked about $1, and that falling by $0.50 to $0.60 because of Verde. And sort of given its position on the coast, I imagine that it's going to be quite a resilient play. My question is, are you going to optimize production around that cash cost figure? Or do you think that there is a return threshold to consider that would cause you to maybe curtail production or maybe decelerate?\nEzra Yacob: Yeah, Kalei, this is Ezra. Dorado, the way we look at Dorado, quite frankly, is similar to the way that we invest in any of our basins, and it starts with the returns profile. Are we investing at the right pace to optimize the returns and the ultimate NPV of that asset. And quite frankly, what we found in Dorado, especially with its location there close to the demand center coupled with some of the strategic decisions we've been able to make on the marketing side is that this dry gas play from an economics perspective really competes with many of our oil plays. And so that's really what governs how quickly that we invest into that play. On the lower level, as we've talked about with any of these unconventional resources or these emerging assets, we like to try and get to these critical points of where you capture the economies of scale. So, the first is consistent rigs. The second point would be a consistent completion spread where you're not mobilizing in and out of basin, a lot of crews and things like that. It gives you the ability to really know the crew that you're working with and the equipment and you can really start to leverage the learnings. On the upper end of it, you can definitely outrun your pace of investment there and your ability to learn on each well and make each well a little bit better, whether it's finding cost or well performance. And then layered on top of that, obviously, is the macro environment. Now we've done a great job with Dorado by strategically allowing that gas to reach multiple markets. It's got multiple outlets and it's well-positioned along the Gulf Coast like we said. And so that does bring to it an inherent opportunity to continue to deliver that gas. And we think that it will be a significant portion of the future supply that should grow into the North American growing gas demand.\nOperator: And our next question today will come from Neal Dingmann with Truist. Please go ahead.\nNeal Dingmann: Thanks for the time guys. I'm hoping I can ask another one on the Utica specifically. I'd love to hear your latest thoughts on how you're thinking about the prospectivity more on the west side of the play, either in that black oil or volatile oil in the play? And then just one other question on this play. What's the latest on just the decline? I know it's still early, but I'm just wondering are these wells declining more like typical oil wells or like a Marcellus gas well?\nKeith Trasko: Yes. This is this is Keith. On the prospectivity overall, we are still focused mainly on the volatile oil window and trying to dial down spacing there. We will eventually jump up to the west side or to the -- also to the condensate window at some point. We're still in the data-gathering phase there. On the decline side, I'd say we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary. It's a combo play, and we see the declines like a typical tight shale well similar to the Eagle Ford.\nNeal Dingmann: Got it. Okay. Okay. And then maybe just a second one, a follow-up just on overall inventory. I'm just wondering, I understand no longer put out the well count in your slides like you previously had in the appendix. I'm just wondering -- I was hoping you could give a sense or maybe a ballpark of how many years you're thinking about of running room specifically in the Del, Eagle Ford, and Bakken at the current rig paces.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Neal, this is Ezra. What we do disclose is our resource potential in -- as far as resource and we've continued to show that we've got about 10 billion barrels of equivalents the premium resource multi-basin portfolio. The ones that you're highlighting are -- it's an interesting collection because you've got a mix of kind of -- those are foundational plays, but they're all at different kind of legacy aspects. So, in the Bakken, we run basically a one-rig program, and we're at a point where we feel that we can continue to do that and generate similar returns for a number of years to come. In the Eagle Ford, many things have changed in the Eagle Ford, and I think everyone has seen that we've slowed down our pace of investment kind of just for lack of a better data point, say, pre-COVID until post-COVID, where these days, we put the sales maybe 120 wells to sales every year or something like that. And again, the slowing down of that investment, it's less about the inventory that we have remaining, and it's more about what I was speaking with Kalei about as far as investing in each of these plays at the right pace. Slowing down there in the Eagle Ford, we've actually increased the returns and expanded the margin profile, and that's really the thing that we focus on. And then in the last one that I would mention is the Delaware Basin, of course, to be honest with the Delaware Basin, I think it's difficult. Industry has done a lot of drilling there over the past decade. But with the technology advancements, I think industry continues to unlock especially on the Delaware Basin side, unlock additional targets every year. And so to be quite honest, it's a little bit difficult to quantify just how much inventory would be left in such a robust resource as the Delaware Basin. You're talking about literally a miles worth of oil and gas saturated reservoirs in that basin. And so we feel very good about the premium resource that we have in place. We've got a very high-quality, very deep bench of assets across multiple basins. And really at the pace that we're operating in the last couple of years and where the macro environment looks right now, inventory is lack of inventory is not really something that we really ever makes our radar. What we continue to look for is improving the quality of that inventory through our organic exploration efforts which is one of the things that's driven the success there in Utica.\nOperator: And our next question today will come from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.\nCharles Meade: Yes. Good morning. Congrats to you and your whole team there. I wanted to go back to your prepared comments, you spoke a bit about the commodity macro. And you gave a thought on the U.S. supply picture. But I wonder if you could kind of share with us your point of view on what the range of possible outcomes is for 2025? And not that we're looking for specific prediction, but more of just trying to get an understanding of your thinking that's informing your approach to 2025?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Charles, let me give you a little more background on that. As you guys know, we kind of build our models. We start internally with the things that we know best, which are operationally in the field. And so the biggest thing that is driving our kind of U.S. numbers. And just for historical 2023, I think the U.S. was about 1.5 million barrels liquids growth. Last year, or I'm sorry, this year, it's looking more like it's going to be right around half of that, maybe about 700,000. And so in 2025, we see a little bit less than that, even moderated growth off of that number for the U.S. And it really begins with where the rig counts are at and where the oily drilled, but uncompleted well levels are at. Both of those are relatively low. And on the rig count side, it hasn't really moved. The rig count really hasn't moved in just about a year now. And so that's really the biggest thing that's informing our expectation for slightly less growth year-over-year in the U.S.\nCharles Meade: Got it. Got it. And then could you give us a quick rundown of how or how we're went to meet our 2025 program?\nEzra Yacob: I'm sorry, Charles, you broke up there. I didn't catch that. How or when -- what was it?\nCharles Meade: Beehive, the Australia well.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, sir. Yes, Jeff?\nJeff Leitzell: Yes. Charles, this is Jeff. Yes. So we have secured the permit there, and we're really excited to be testing prospect. The plan is to test it next year. So obviously, it's an oil prospect. It's a large untested structure there. It's really close to markets, and it's there on the Northwest Shelf of Australia. So the thing that I'd really point out is it's a prospect that's very similar in water depth and operations, the environment, I should say is Trinidad. So we'll really be able to leverage all that shallow water expertise that we have there. So at this time right now, we've got a team in place there in Australia, and we're excited to go ahead and test that prospect sometime next year.\nOperator: And our next question today will come from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: Yes, good morning. You guys have mentioned keeping activity largely consistent for 2025. Your oil volumes will be up about 2% year-on-year at the exit this year. Is that a number, we should be expecting kind of a similar figure for 2025? And then obviously, there's some concerns on the macro side. Just curious, just under what conditions would you look to dial back activity to ensure more of a flattish trend on your oil production?\nEzra Yacob: Yeah, Scott, this is Ezra. Like you said, it's -- I don't think we're at this point ready to talk about a percentage there on 2025, but you can go ahead and count on what we've talked about today with similar activity levels. I mean, the way to really think about our capital allocation is it's not a -- it doesn't begin with that growth number. It really is an output of our investment strategy. And as you highlighted, we're not really growing that much right now. I mean I think in the last 12 months, we've grown about 10,000 barrels of oil per day, which for a 490,000 barrel of oil per day company is really pretty soft. It's certainly something that we could grow more aggressively if we want to focus on it. But quite frankly, what we focus on is we invest balance returns, NPV, free cash flow generation in both the short and long-term and how we can best return that cash to shareholders. That's really the focus of our disciplined investment strategy. And when we get it correct in each of our plays, you invest at the right pace as we've talked about today, that's when you really start to realize the operational efficiencies, the cost reductions and the performance improvement that Jeff really highlighted in his opening comments, so that's what you should expect for us. When we think about the success this year of managing the investment in that way and how we manage our portfolio, the exceptional results that we're seeing across our wells, I think in just the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford alone are foundational plays. The wells that came on production in first half of 2024 actually paid back their capital investment in aggregate by July 1st. And those results are the types that are flowing straight through to the shareholders because in the first nine months of the year, we've been able to return 92% of that free cash flow to our shareholders. So that's really the way that we approach it. As far as what scenario would we do something dramatically different, we do have the flexibility to either increase or slow down our activity level. We have put out at the beginning of this year, that three-year scenario, which provides a little bit of -- I don't want to call it guidance, but it gives you some scenarios between a $65 to $85 range and the type of financial performance that we could expect if we invested it at similar levels to what we're talking about today. And you can see even at a $65 case, it's a very compelling investment scenario where we've got a low reinvestment rate, 6%, I think, is the cash flow and free cash flow growth per share, which doesn't include any share repurchases. You're talking about a 20% to 30% double-digit ROCE and free cash flow generation, not only to support our regular dividend, but excess free cash flow to support either additional special dividends or opportunistic share repurchases as well.\nScott Gruber: I appreciate all that color. I had a follow-up on your carbon capture initiative. With the pilot project up and running, can you speak to your interest in doing additional projects and would these be confined to internal projects? Or would you consider third-party projects?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Scott, that's a good question. Right now, we view our carbon capture and storage projects as something internal to help our operations and focus on that. We've had good success with our pilot project, as I talked about just briefly in the opening. And it's really just turning into more of a standard piece of our business. And we are starting to look for other opportunities across our portfolio where we might be able to deploy that technology. But as far as looking at gathering third party or something like that, we've looked at it and evaluated it. But like most things, the real value for much of the technology that we develop is usually better kept inside.\nOperator: And our next question today will come from Kevin MacCurdy with Pickering Energy Partners. Please go ahead.\nKevin MacCurdy: Hi, good morning. I think the market is appreciating the reconsideration of your capital structure. My question is on how dynamic do you plan to be on managing that capital structure? As EBITDA grows with higher production and better margins over time, it seems like you should have a more of a safety net on the downside leverage target. Would you keep \u2013 would you plan to keep returning a higher percentage of your free cash flow in the future, even if that moves you to a net debt position?\nAnn Janssen: Hi, Kevin, it's Ann. We're in a good place now. We have such a strong balance sheet that the level of debt we want to carry and the amount of cash we want to carry has some flexibility built into it. So that's the good side of it. So as we're looking at how to return that free cash flow, we're going to stay in line with what our fundamentals are and how we want to return our free cash flow. We have the cash priorities schedule on how we look at just cash on the balance sheet and how we want to return that to shareholders. And as far as the debt level we want to carry, we're comfortable going to a higher debt level, if that's what makes sense for the business at the time. But again, we have a lot of flexibility in managing those components, and we will move forward based on what the business needs are at the time.\nKevin MacCurdy: Yes. I mean it seems like you highlighted the near-term shareholder return benefit, but this structure could set you up for potentially even higher percentage of returns in the future. I guess my follow-up here is, you mentioned low cost property bolt-ons as part of your balance sheet plans. Do you have any color on where you see the most opportunities for that? And what is the dollar threshold between a low-cost bolt-on and significant M&A, which you've kind of avoided in the past?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Kevin, this is Ezra. That's a good question. It's not really defined, I think as far as a low-cost property bolt-on or significant merger and acquisition. I mean, I think on the one end, everybody knows what a significant M&A would be. It would be something corporate of magnitude like that. Really, the way we think about it is on the value driver. And so maybe that's the best way to answer it is low PDP with high upside on drilled acreage is what we really look for. And that high upside on undrilled acreage typically comes on emerging assets, to be perfectly honest, because if you're buying quality of acreage in a play that's known and it's going to be additive to the quality of our inventory, odds are you're going to be paying a big premium for that, and that's going to erode your long-term margins, not your wellhead rates of return, but your full cycle margins. So that's really what we look on. And I think that also kind of speaks to where you're at with where are the opportunities for that. Typically, we find those opportunities more often than not in some of the emerging assets, just because, again, we tend -- we think we have the ability to potentially identify and unlock value that maybe gets bypassed by others. And when you think about building out our inventory that way and continuing to improve the quality our inventory, that goes a long way to what you were just implying as far as the long-term return benefit with this capital structure. As you've seen, quite frankly, in the last couple of years is our emerging plays as we've gained more confidence in those, and those have come to fruition, we've increased the percentage of cash return from just below 70% -- down around 60% to making our commitment 70% to last year and this year basically at or exceeding 85% of the free cash flow. So as the strength of business overall improves from the operational performance, that's what ultimately flows through to the financial performance.\nOperator: This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ezra Yacob for any closing remarks.\nEzra Yacob: We appreciate everyone's time today. I just want to say thank you to our shareholders for your support and special thanks to our employees for delivering another exceptional quarter.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Pearce. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Since the end of 2020, EOG has generated more than $22 billion of free cash flow and more than $25 billion in adjusted net income. We've increased our regular dividend rate 160% and including both regular and special dividends paid or committed to pay more than $13 billion directly to shareholders and $3.2 billion indirectly through share repurchases, all while reducing debt 35%. EOG has a history of delivering consistently strong financial and operational results, and the third quarter is simply more of the same. Led by our employees' commitment to operational excellence and capital discipline, we outperformed on oil, natural gas and NGL volumes for the quarter as well as beating expectations on per unit cash operating costs. We generated $1.6 billion of adjusted net income and $1.5 billion of free cash flow and returned $1.3 billion of that free cash flow back to our shareholders through a mix of our regular dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. In addition to announcing third quarter results yesterday, we demonstrated confidence in our ability to generate strong free cash flow in the future as well as our continued commitment to return a significant portion of cash to our shareholders by increasing the regular dividend 7% and boosting our share repurchase authorization by $5 billion. Cash return to shareholders begins with our focus on the regular dividend, which has never been reduced or suspended in the 27 years since we've been paying one, and it reflects our confidence in the increasing capital efficiency of our business going forward. And we continue to improve our capital efficiency by leveraging technology and innovation across both our foundational and emerging assets. That is one of the key advantages of operating in multiple basins. We are able to drive improvements to operational performance through technology transfer between those basins. We are drilling further and faster than at any time in our history, completing wells with fewer people and less equipment due to efficient operations, and we continue to capture additional value through our marketing strategy. EOG's performance is sustainable, because it's driven by our culture, empowering each employee to be a business person first, focusing on returns and seeking ways to improve the business every day. Our culture is our competitive advantage and combined with focus on sustainable value creation through the cycles, gives us confidence in our ongoing performance as we finish 2024 and position ourselves for 2025. In a moment, Jeff will provide some early commentary on our 2025 capital program, but our investment strategy always begins with capital discipline, balancing short and long-term free cash flow generation, return on capital employed and return of capital to shareholders. We also consider the macro environment in which we are operating. And currently, the overall macro environment remains dynamic. Oil inventory levels are below the five-year average with both supply and demand showing moderate growth year-over-year. We expect to finish 2024 with strong demand, slowing into a seasonally lower first quarter and then increasing throughout the rest of 2025. Domestically, while efficiency gains continue across the industry, we anticipate another year of slower US liquids growth grounded in the lower number of active drilling rigs and drilled but uncompleted wells. Regarding North American natural gas, inventory levels have moved closer to the five-year average throughout the year due to a combination of producer discipline and increased demand driven primarily by power generation. We remain optimistic on the long-term outlook for gas demand beginning in and increasing throughout 2025 from additional LNG projects coming online and ongoing increases in power generation. Finally, last month, we released our annual sustainability report for 2023, highlighting our leading environmental performance and commitment to safe operations. We achieved a GHG intensity rate below our 2025 target for the second year in a row and achieved a methane emissions percentage at/or below our 2025 target for the third consecutive year. Our in-house methane monitoring solution has progressed beyond the pilot phase and is integrated into our standard operating procedures. And our carbon capture and storage pilot project is operational, and we stand ready to deploy our learnings to future operations. Our consistent sustainability performance is a result of our empowered and collaborative workforce and our continued investment in innovation and technology to achieve not only leading environmental performance, but also strong and consistent safety performance throughout our operations. This year's report highlights our innovative culture that drives EOG's mission to be among the highest return, lowest cost and lowest emissions producers playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy. Now here's Ann with details on our financial performance. Thanks Jeff. EOG recently celebrated our 25th anniversary as an independently traded public company. And while many things have changed across our industry, EOG's fundamental strategy and commitment to creating share value for our shareholders has remained consistent. First, our commitment to capital discipline begins with reinvestment at a pace to support continuous improvement across our assets delivering returns through the cycle, generating free cash flow, and maintaining a pristine balance sheet to support a sustainable growing regular dividend. Second, our strong operational execution begins with being a first mover in exploration to maintain a low-cost, high-quality multi-basin inventory. We leverage in-house technical expertise proprietary information technology and self-sourced materials help drive well performance and cost control, and we focus on a balanced approach to product, geographic, and pricing diversification to drive margin expansion. Third, we are committed to safe operations, leading environmental performance and stakeholder engagement. Our sustainability report highlights progress on our emissions reduction pathway, as well as overall environmental stewardship. And finally, our culture is our competitive advantage. A decentralized non-bureaucratic organization places value creation in the field at the asset level and in the hands of each of our employees. We take pride in our collaborative, multidisciplinary teams that drive innovation, utilizing our technology and real-time data collection to drive decision-making. Thanks for listening. Now we will go to Q&A. Yes, Steve. Good morning. Thanks for the question. The decision is aimed at really just making our capital structure more efficient. We're moving to a level of debt that's more appropriate for a company of our size and strength, still being respectful that we're in a cyclical industry. Ultimately, the move is designed to allow us to move more equity into the debt side. We've always talked about we've been pretty consistent, but the goal of our company has never been to get to a zero absolute debt. And so really, the timing right now looks pretty good as we have a couple of bonds coming into maturity in the next 12 18 months, the market is looking a little more favorable than it has in the last few quarters. And so as we step into this -- as we talked about, as Ann mentioned, our debt target will be to keep total debt to EBITDA at less than one times, leverage ratio at a $45 WTI, which if you calculate that out is approximately a $5 billion to $6 billion range. And so you're right, that will free up some additional cash. And really, what I would look for is, yes, in the near-term, that does imply that we'll definitely be in a position to exceed the 70% commitment and quite frankly, be closer to 100% and at times, more than 100% of return of free cash flow to the shareholders. But I want to put a more specific time target on it other than the next 12-month time frame, the next 12 to 15 months is we look to be opportunistic in the market, not only with share repurchases, but also the timing of reaching out on these bonds. Yes, Steve, that's another great question on Dorado. We've highlighted last quarter that cash operating costs are right around that $1 already for the asset. And so we do consider it to be one of the lowest cost natural gas projects in all of the US and very well positioned. Verde is online, which we're very excited about. But the North American gas inventory, as you said, is it's currently about 5% above the five-year average still. And we'll see what happens with winter. But either way, whether it's warm or cold, the industry does appear to have not only some curtailed volumes, but there is also some gas DUCs that will likely come online pretty quickly. And so what we see -- and this is somewhat in line with where we've been for the last two years is that 2025 is really going to be an inflection point for North American gas demand with LNG beginning to come online and then coming online really 2025, 2026 2027. And when we think about that, it's -- as we calculated about 10 to 12 Bcf a day of LNG that's under construction and should come online in that time frame. And then above and beyond that, we actually see another almost 10 to 12 Bcf a day in demand growth between now and the end of the decade, that's really associated with power demand, a little bit of industrial, some Mexico exports, but really, it's power demand driven not only by new power demand from AI and electrification, but also coal power retirements. And so our goal with Dorado is to continue to invest at a pace where we can capture some of the economies of scale, as Jeff talked about, which in the last two years has really been a 1-rig program. And as the market starts to open up for us, we'd like to increase that. The next kind of critical point in these unconventional plays is to get to a continuous completion spread. But we're very excited about where we can go and the asset that we've captured there. Yes, Arun, this is Ezra. Yes, I mean, I think you're right. While we're going to be making our capital structure more efficient, we'll be very well positioned still to have what we consider industry's leading balance sheet, quite frankly. And that does going to preserve -- it's going to preserve the financial strength of the business for us. That will give us the ability to still maintain the ability to continue to invest in countercyclic, low-cost property bolt-ons, other things that we've done in the past along those same lines. And what I would say is the ability to return more than 100% of annual free cash flow the near term and deliver more cash to shareholders over time, it's really just an effect of, again, shifting some of the equity into the debt side. Where we're starting at today is such a position of strength with a cash positive position that even leveraging up on this debt side, it still puts us in a great position to be able to continue to execute on a lot of our priorities. Like I said, including low-cost property bolt-ons to be able to be in a position to opportunistically step into larger share repurchases if the opportunity presents itself. And so we really see this as a very shareholder-friendly maneuver that we're doing. And like I said, the timing of it is really just what we kind of see in the market and the fact that we do have some of the bonds maturing. Yes, Scott, this is Ezra again. So, on the strategic portion, and then maybe I'll hand over to Ann to get in a little bit more of the mechanics. But yes, I think this is really in line with where the management and Board has been thinking for a long time. As I started off the Q&A session with Steve, I mentioned that I think we've been pretty consistent talking about the goal of the company has never been to go to an absolute zero debt level. But really, we like to be positioned to create long-term shareholder value and having different measures -- different abilities to do that. One thing that we love about having that pristine balance sheet that I should have just mentioned when speaking with Arun is also the peer leading regular dividend that we have. And this gives us confidence in being able to continue to grow that and maintain that dividend. As I said in my opening remarks, it's been 27 years that we've been paying that dividend without ever needing to suspend it or cut it. And that's something we're very proud about. So, we really look at the entire priority of our cash flows when we were thinking about this. And the trigger again, that's caused it right now is just where we're at in the macro environment. And not from the commodity side, but really from the financial side. If you recall, Scott, the last bond that we retired was about a $1.2 billion bond back in Q1 of 2023. And that was right decision at the time for us, but one of the reasons is not only were interest rates climbing at that time, but as we all recall, there was a -- what turned out to be a rather somewhat small banking crisis at the time, felt like it could maybe possibly balloon into something larger. So, we refinanced that -- or I'm sorry, we paid that off with cash on hand. And essentially, since then, interest rates have always been climbing up until the recent last couple of quarters where things have kind of plateaued, and we're starting to see them bend over a little bit. So, those are really the things that have kind of given us the confidence to kind of go ahead and make this decision now. As far as moving the equity onto the debt side and the impact for us, I'll hand that off to Ann. Yes, Scott. We still got obviously, the presidential and the Senate is getting close to -- you can kind of see who's going to control those two portions of our Congress and then we'll see where the house finishes up after that. I think for us, what we really prepare for is kind of this next couple of months. Whenever there's a change of administration, this is the time period when we really start to focus in, maybe take some steps to prepare just in case things can slow down. So we're feeling very good very good with where we're at right now. As far as going forward on the industry, I think the industry has come a long way as far as our relationship with not only at the federal level, but really at the local level, working alongside policymakers, regulators and such. And I think the industry is in a spot to continue the performance that we've had over the last few years. When I know I can speak a little more directly for EOG but in the areas that we operate, even the new areas like in Ohio with our Utica play, we've really developed an outstanding relationship. I think many across industry policymakers, really just stakeholders, in general, see that there is a long -- that oil and natural gas are going to play a long -- are going to play a part of the long-term energy solution. And that working with the industry is really the best way kind of achieve the goals of low cost, reliable and lower emissions type of energy sources. Yeah, Kalei, this is Ezra. Dorado, the way we look at Dorado, quite frankly, is similar to the way that we invest in any of our basins, and it starts with the returns profile. Are we investing at the right pace to optimize the returns and the ultimate NPV of that asset. And quite frankly, what we found in Dorado, especially with its location there close to the demand center coupled with some of the strategic decisions we've been able to make on the marketing side is that this dry gas play from an economics perspective really competes with many of our oil plays. And so that's really what governs how quickly that we invest into that play. On the lower level, as we've talked about with any of these unconventional resources or these emerging assets, we like to try and get to these critical points of where you capture the economies of scale. So, the first is consistent rigs. The second point would be a consistent completion spread where you're not mobilizing in and out of basin, a lot of crews and things like that. It gives you the ability to really know the crew that you're working with and the equipment and you can really start to leverage the learnings. On the upper end of it, you can definitely outrun your pace of investment there and your ability to learn on each well and make each well a little bit better, whether it's finding cost or well performance. And then layered on top of that, obviously, is the macro environment. Now we've done a great job with Dorado by strategically allowing that gas to reach multiple markets. It's got multiple outlets and it's well-positioned along the Gulf Coast like we said. And so that does bring to it an inherent opportunity to continue to deliver that gas. And we think that it will be a significant portion of the future supply that should grow into the North American growing gas demand. Yes, Neal, this is Ezra. What we do disclose is our resource potential in -- as far as resource and we've continued to show that we've got about 10 billion barrels of equivalents the premium resource multi-basin portfolio. The ones that you're highlighting are -- it's an interesting collection because you've got a mix of kind of -- those are foundational plays, but they're all at different kind of legacy aspects. So, in the Bakken, we run basically a one-rig program, and we're at a point where we feel that we can continue to do that and generate similar returns for a number of years to come. In the Eagle Ford, many things have changed in the Eagle Ford, and I think everyone has seen that we've slowed down our pace of investment kind of just for lack of a better data point, say, pre-COVID until post-COVID, where these days, we put the sales maybe 120 wells to sales every year or something like that. And again, the slowing down of that investment, it's less about the inventory that we have remaining, and it's more about what I was speaking with Kalei about as far as investing in each of these plays at the right pace. Slowing down there in the Eagle Ford, we've actually increased the returns and expanded the margin profile, and that's really the thing that we focus on. And then in the last one that I would mention is the Delaware Basin, of course, to be honest with the Delaware Basin, I think it's difficult. Industry has done a lot of drilling there over the past decade. But with the technology advancements, I think industry continues to unlock especially on the Delaware Basin side, unlock additional targets every year. And so to be quite honest, it's a little bit difficult to quantify just how much inventory would be left in such a robust resource as the Delaware Basin. You're talking about literally a miles worth of oil and gas saturated reservoirs in that basin. And so we feel very good about the premium resource that we have in place. We've got a very high-quality, very deep bench of assets across multiple basins. And really at the pace that we're operating in the last couple of years and where the macro environment looks right now, inventory is lack of inventory is not really something that we really ever makes our radar. What we continue to look for is improving the quality of that inventory through our organic exploration efforts which is one of the things that's driven the success there in Utica. Yes, Charles, let me give you a little more background on that. As you guys know, we kind of build our models. We start internally with the things that we know best, which are operationally in the field. And so the biggest thing that is driving our kind of U.S. numbers. And just for historical 2023, I think the U.S. was about 1.5 million barrels liquids growth. Last year, or I'm sorry, this year, it's looking more like it's going to be right around half of that, maybe about 700,000. And so in 2025, we see a little bit less than that, even moderated growth off of that number for the U.S. And it really begins with where the rig counts are at and where the oily drilled, but uncompleted well levels are at. Both of those are relatively low. And on the rig count side, it hasn't really moved. The rig count really hasn't moved in just about a year now. And so that's really the biggest thing that's informing our expectation for slightly less growth year-over-year in the U.S. I'm sorry, Charles, you broke up there. I didn't catch that. How or when -- what was it? Yes, sir. Yes, Jeff? Yeah, Scott, this is Ezra. Like you said, it's -- I don't think we're at this point ready to talk about a percentage there on 2025, but you can go ahead and count on what we've talked about today with similar activity levels. I mean, the way to really think about our capital allocation is it's not a -- it doesn't begin with that growth number. It really is an output of our investment strategy. And as you highlighted, we're not really growing that much right now. I mean I think in the last 12 months, we've grown about 10,000 barrels of oil per day, which for a 490,000 barrel of oil per day company is really pretty soft. It's certainly something that we could grow more aggressively if we want to focus on it. But quite frankly, what we focus on is we invest balance returns, NPV, free cash flow generation in both the short and long-term and how we can best return that cash to shareholders. That's really the focus of our disciplined investment strategy. And when we get it correct in each of our plays, you invest at the right pace as we've talked about today, that's when you really start to realize the operational efficiencies, the cost reductions and the performance improvement that Jeff really highlighted in his opening comments, so that's what you should expect for us. When we think about the success this year of managing the investment in that way and how we manage our portfolio, the exceptional results that we're seeing across our wells, I think in just the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford alone are foundational plays. The wells that came on production in first half of 2024 actually paid back their capital investment in aggregate by July 1st. And those results are the types that are flowing straight through to the shareholders because in the first nine months of the year, we've been able to return 92% of that free cash flow to our shareholders. So that's really the way that we approach it. As far as what scenario would we do something dramatically different, we do have the flexibility to either increase or slow down our activity level. We have put out at the beginning of this year, that three-year scenario, which provides a little bit of -- I don't want to call it guidance, but it gives you some scenarios between a $65 to $85 range and the type of financial performance that we could expect if we invested it at similar levels to what we're talking about today. And you can see even at a $65 case, it's a very compelling investment scenario where we've got a low reinvestment rate, 6%, I think, is the cash flow and free cash flow growth per share, which doesn't include any share repurchases. You're talking about a 20% to 30% double-digit ROCE and free cash flow generation, not only to support our regular dividend, but excess free cash flow to support either additional special dividends or opportunistic share repurchases as well. Yes, Scott, that's a good question. Right now, we view our carbon capture and storage projects as something internal to help our operations and focus on that. We've had good success with our pilot project, as I talked about just briefly in the opening. And it's really just turning into more of a standard piece of our business. And we are starting to look for other opportunities across our portfolio where we might be able to deploy that technology. But as far as looking at gathering third party or something like that, we've looked at it and evaluated it. But like most things, the real value for much of the technology that we develop is usually better kept inside. Yes, Kevin, this is Ezra. That's a good question. It's not really defined, I think as far as a low-cost property bolt-on or significant merger and acquisition. I mean, I think on the one end, everybody knows what a significant M&A would be. It would be something corporate of magnitude like that. Really, the way we think about it is on the value driver. And so maybe that's the best way to answer it is low PDP with high upside on drilled acreage is what we really look for. And that high upside on undrilled acreage typically comes on emerging assets, to be perfectly honest, because if you're buying quality of acreage in a play that's known and it's going to be additive to the quality of our inventory, odds are you're going to be paying a big premium for that, and that's going to erode your long-term margins, not your wellhead rates of return, but your full cycle margins. So that's really what we look on. And I think that also kind of speaks to where you're at with where are the opportunities for that. Typically, we find those opportunities more often than not in some of the emerging assets, just because, again, we tend -- we think we have the ability to potentially identify and unlock value that maybe gets bypassed by others. And when you think about building out our inventory that way and continuing to improve the quality our inventory, that goes a long way to what you were just implying as far as the long-term return benefit with this capital structure. As you've seen, quite frankly, in the last couple of years is our emerging plays as we've gained more confidence in those, and those have come to fruition, we've increased the percentage of cash return from just below 70% -- down around 60% to making our commitment 70% to last year and this year basically at or exceeding 85% of the free cash flow. So as the strength of business overall improves from the operational performance, that's what ultimately flows through to the financial performance. We appreciate everyone's time today. I just want to say thank you to our shareholders for your support and special thanks to our employees for delivering another exceptional quarter."

            "content": "Thanks, Ann. We delivered another outstanding quarter, thanks to our employees and their consistent execution across our multi-basin portfolio. Their focus on continued improvement through innovation, technology advancements and operational control is why our third quarter volumes and per unit cash operating costs beat expectations. Oil volumes beat our forecast, primarily due to better-than-expected productivity from new wells, driven by continuous improvement to our completion designs. Year-over-year, we have increased our maximum pumping rate capacity by approximately 15% per frac fleet on average. The benefit is twofold: Faster pump times and better well performance. Higher pumping rates provides our team with the flexibility to tailor each high-intensity completion design around the unique geological characteristics of every target. This, in turn, has helped to maximize the stimulated rock volume in the reservoir, resulting in improved well performance. Efficiency improvements due to faster pump times, combined with stronger well performance have more than offset the additional cost for these increased pumping rates. As a result of third quarter volume performance beats, we are once again raising full year guidance. Our oil production midpoint has increased by 800 barrels per barrels per day, natural gas liquids by 2,800 day and natural gas by 24 million standard cubic feet per day. We also beat per unit cash operating cost targets during the third quarter. The primary drivers were lower lease operating expense due to less workover expense and fuel savings. We now expect our full year per unit cash operating cost to be lower than forecasted and have reduced guidance accordingly. Our capital expenditures in the third quarter were in line with our forecast with only minor differences primarily due to timing of operations. In addition, well cost deflation driven primarily by efficiencies is playing out as we had forecasted at the start of the year, resulting in a 3% to 5% year-over-year decrease in well cost. As a result, our expectations for full year CapEx remain unchanged at $6.2 billion at the midpoint. The efficiency gains we continue to realize this year demonstrate the value of our multi-basin portfolio and decentralized structure. Ideas born in one operating area are replicated across multiple basins through technology transfer. Two examples of innovation, expanding through our portfolio and driving efficiencies this year are extended laterals and our in-house motor program. Average lateral lengths for our domestic drilling program continued to increase. In the Delaware Basin, we now expect to drill more than 70 3-mile laterals this year compared to our original forecast of 50. We've also set a new lateral length record in the Eagle Ford not only for EOG, but for all of Texas. Our Aspen A 1H well was drilled in our western acreage and has a lateral length of over 22,000 feet. As we highlighted last quarter, longer laterals allow for more time focused on drilling downhole and less time moving equipment on surface, decreasing overall downtime in days to drill. In addition, longer laterals help unlock new potential from acreage that might not otherwise meet our economic thresholds. EOG's in-house motor program also continues to pay dividends. In the Delaware Basin, we are testing the limits of our drilling motors in the shallower Leonard Shale and Bone Spring formations. While drilling the production hole section, we attempt to drill as much of the vertical curve and lateral portions of the wellbore with one motor run. Historically, this operation requires a minimum of three motor runs and two trips, which is a pause in drilling to pull a motor out of the wellbore and replace it with a new one. As a result, we have eliminated over one full trip per well in the shallower Delaware Basin targets. Given that each trip can cost $150,000 or more, the cost savings and efficiency gains from using better designed higher-quality motors continues to add significant value to our drilling program. This is just one of several examples of the value the EOG Motor program has created. Looking company-wide since the start of 2023, we have increased our drilled footage per motor run by over 20% versus third-party rental options. As we continue to test, learn, and redesign our drilling motors, we see substantial upside to our future drilling performance as we expand motor innovation throughout our multi-basin portfolio. In Ohio, we've made significant progress this year transitioning the 225,000 net acres of the volatile oil window in the Utica play from delineation into development. We now have five packages online and producing for more than 100 days, three of which have been producing well over 180 days. Both oil and liquids performance continues to meet or exceed expectations demonstrating the premium quality of this play. We are also capturing sustainable operational efficiencies through multi-well pad development and continuous operations. On the drilling side, the Utica provides an ideal operational environment to make significant gains quickly. We have decreased drilling days to drill three-mile laterals 29% year-over-year and have already achieved a record of drilling more than two miles in a single day. We also have made significant gains on the completion side, achieving a nearly 13% increase in completed lateral feet per day compared to last year. Over the next few years, activity in the Utica will continue to be primarily focused in the volatile oil window, where we anticipate our well costs will average less than $650 per effective treated lateral foot with finding cost and development costs in the range of $6 to $8 per barrel of oil equivalent. For 2025, we anticipate a 50% increase in Utica activity as we continue to leverage consistent operations to achieve additional economies of scale. Our large contiguous acreage position lends itself to developing a long-life, repeatable, low-cost play competitive with the premier unconventional plays across North America. Previewing 2025 company-wide, with the outstanding performance we have delivered this year, we do not see a need to significantly adjust activity next year. We do, however, expect very minor shifts in activity between basins with a continued increase in activity in the Utica and another year of actively managing our Dorado investment with a one-rig program. This will allow us to continue to capture some economies of scale across our emerging assets and advance our technological understanding of these plays while delivering the operational and financial performance that our shareholders appreciate. Now, here's Ezra to wrap up. Yes, Arun, this is Jeff. Yes. Thanks for the question. So yes, as you talked about, and we talked about in our opening comments, the plan right now, which is still early, is to maintain relatively flat activity next year and those minor shifts, I mean, they're going to be fairly small. I mean a few wells here and there and pretty immaterial across the portfolio, which will lead to the modest increase in activity we talked about in the Utica. So what I'd first say is just about our current program and the activity levels we're at, we're extremely happy with the progress we've made. And the improvements we've seen across the whole portfolio by really focusing on that. And where we're at now is really we want to focus on the emerging plays and really getting them to that critical activity level to maximize our efficiencies, which the first step in that is getting it to one full drilling rig. And then really, the next hurdle is going to be getting those plays to one full frac fleet. So in the Utica, as we've touched on, we should be there next year. We're looking at about a 50% increase in activity. We'll be up to two full rigs and one full frac fleet by year-end. So we'll reach those critical points. And then Dorado, which you talk about we really anticipate maintaining just the one full rig that we've been running. We've been seeing outstanding performance and efficiencies from that consistent operations. But we'll continue to manage the investments in our completion activity just as we watch the natural gas market and move through the winter. So I think by doing all this, this really allows us to continue progress each one of those emerging plays, but we'll still be able to deliver another year of strong results from the portfolio. And then just real quick on infrastructure. You did hit on it. Over the last few years, we've had a little bit of additional infrastructure spend that was strategic with the Janus gas plant and the Verde pipeline. This year, it was around $400 million. And looking forward to 2025, really, we just -- we're going to be finishing up that Janus plant and a few little things from a facilities aspect on the Verde pipeline. So we expect strategic spend there next year to be somewhere around $100 million. And then as those continue to roll off and we look in the future, we'll start moving back towards that 15% to kind of 20% indirect level. Yeah, Leo, this is Jeff. So yes, the powder is progressing nicely. As we've talked about for the past handful of years, we've really been focused on the Mowry formation, which is the deeper formation and really kind of lining out our geologic model and what our development plans are there, and we had really good success with it. So shifted over since we've gotten all that overlying geologic data in the Niobrara to where we're really doing a split program this year of about 25 wells split between the more and the Niobrara. And what I would say is we've applied the new geologic models and we're continuing to refine our completion techniques up there. And through the first part of the year, we brought on some of those diabera wells. And I mean, results are very early right now, but they're very encouraging. We are seeing an uptick of greater than probably about 10% increase in productivity versus 2023 in the Niobrara. So moving forward right now, I think we're in a very comfortable spot. We still have little to learn there in the Niobrara and kind of just our development patterns and when to offset in depletion and space. And so I think we're probably going to be pretty consistent with our program as we move into 2025 as we continue to refine those models. Yeah, Kalei, this is Jeff and no, our plans are pretty secure as far as that goes. And really, there shouldn't be any advancement. I mean all of any of the kind of midstream or I should say, strategic infrastructure projects that we've talked about. I mean, they're on time and they're on pace to come online when we expected. With the Janus gas plant, as we've talked about, the plan is to complete that next year. So as we talked about, we'll have a little bit of strategic infrastructure dollars associated with that, about $100 million. But other than that, no, there will be really no acceleration in any of those projects. Yes. Charles, this is Jeff. Yes. So we have secured the permit there, and we're really excited to be testing prospect. The plan is to test it next year. So obviously, it's an oil prospect. It's a large untested structure there. It's really close to markets, and it's there on the Northwest Shelf of Australia. So the thing that I'd really point out is it's a prospect that's very similar in water depth and operations, the environment, I should say is Trinidad. So we'll really be able to leverage all that shallow water expertise that we have there. So at this time right now, we've got a team in place there in Australia, and we're excited to go ahead and test that prospect sometime next year."

            "content": "Yes, Leo, this is Keith. The finding cost range, yes, you're right. It is specific to the volatile oil window and the 225,000 net acres we have there. The range represents the expectations for the next two to three years of development. That's the same for the well cost range. If you back out science on some of our early wells, we've hit the upper end of this range multiple times, and we'll continue to drive it down with the economies of scale. Versus the $5 finding costs we previously disclosed, that reflects the entire 445,000 acre field. That includes the up-dip oil window and the down-dip condensate window. It also incorporates full field development. So we still see line of sight to that, but what we're doing here is giving more guidance in the near-term. Overall, we've made great progress in the play, the well productivity and well cost continue to demonstrate the premium quality and it really highlights our organic exploration strategy. Yes. This is this is Keith. On the prospectivity overall, we are still focused mainly on the volatile oil window and trying to dial down spacing there. We will eventually jump up to the west side or to the -- also to the condensate window at some point. We're still in the data-gathering phase there. On the decline side, I'd say we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary. It's a combo play, and we see the declines like a typical tight shale well similar to the Eagle Ford."

            "name": "Ann Janssen",
            "content": "Thanks, Ezra. EOG continues to create long-term shareholder value. During the third quarter, we earned $1.6 billion of adjusted net income and generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow on $1.5 billion capital expenditures. Third quarter capital expenditures were in line with forecast, and we still expect our full year capital expenditures to be about $6.2 billion. Cash on the balance sheet at quarter end is temporarily higher due to the postponement of certain tax payments until the first quarter of next year from disaster relief granted for severe weather events in Texas, including Hurricane Barrel. Our ongoing marketing strategy to diversify and expand our access to premium markets also delivered exceptional results during the third quarter with peer-leading US price realizations of $76.95 per barrel of oil and $1.84 per Mcf for natural gas. Finally, we paid a $0.91 per share dividend and repurchased $758 million of shares during the quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated $4.1 billion of billion of free cash flow which helped fund $3.8 billion of cash returned to shareholders. Of that $3.8 billion, $1.6 billion was paid in regular dividends and was complemented by $2.2 billion in share repurchases through the third quarter. Taking into account our full year regular dividend, we have committed to return $4.3 billion to shareholders in 2024 and we are on track to exceed not only our minimum cash return commitment of 70% of annual free cash flow, but also last year's cash return of 85%. The EOG's commitment to high-return investments is delivering high returns to our shareholders. Yesterday, we were pleased to announce a 7% increase to what is already a top-tier regular dividend, not only for our industry but the broader market. This increase reflects our confidence in the fundamental strength of our business which continues to get better through consistent execution of EOG's value proposition. Efficiencies and technology applied throughout our multi-basin portfolio continue to sustainably improve EOG's capital efficiency. A growing sustainable regular dividend remains the foundation of our cash return commitment and we believe is the best indicator of the company's confidence in its future performance. In addition to the dividend increase, the Board approved a $5 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization to supplement the $1.8 billion remaining on the authorization as of quarter end. The total $6.8 billion buyback capacity retains our flexibility to deliver on our cash return commitment to shareholders. Over the last several quarters, we have favored buybacks to complement our regular dividend and we will continue to monitor the market for opportunities to step in and repurchase shares for the remainder of the year. EOG's balance sheet underpins the financial strength of the company and remains a strategic priority. To optimize EOG's capital structure going forward, we intend to position our balance sheet such that our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio equals less than one times at $45 WTI. We believe this is an efficient and prudent long-term capital structure for a cyclical industry that will support our commitment to deliver shareholder value. As a result, we anticipate refinancing upcoming debt maturities, increasing our debt balance to $5 billion to $6 billion range in the next 12 to 18 months and maintaining our cash balance at levels similar to what we have carried for the last two years. By managing our debt levels toward this more efficient capital structure, we are increasing our capacity to return cash to shareholders. Now here's Jeff to review operating results. Yes. The way we look at it is the optimal capital structure is one where the balance sheet has more debt than what we have today. So, basically, we're looking at putting on a level of debt that is more appropriate for our company of our size and strength in this point in the cyclical industry. So, if you want to look at those parameters as we mentioned, first, we wanted to be less than 1 times total debt to EBITDA leverage ratio at approximate bottom cycle prices around $45. And if you compute that out, that gives us a yield of total debt level of about $5 billion to $6 billion. Conversely, if you look at the cash side of the business, as we look at the appropriate level of cash, we think that's currently about the level we've held for the last two years. We need about a minimum of $2 billion in cash to run the business on a daily basis. And then that additional cash allows us to backstop the regular dividend as well as support additional cash return and take advantage of those countercyclical opportunities. So, again, echoing Azar's comments, our main objective is just to create long-term value for our shareholders. And we think setting up the balance sheet the way we are, will better position us to have an appropriate level of cash to run the business, continue to make those investments as they present themselves and backs up our regular dividend through the cycle. Hi, Kevin, it's Ann. We're in a good place now. We have such a strong balance sheet that the level of debt we want to carry and the amount of cash we want to carry has some flexibility built into it. So that's the good side of it. So as we're looking at how to return that free cash flow, we're going to stay in line with what our fundamentals are and how we want to return our free cash flow. We have the cash priorities schedule on how we look at just cash on the balance sheet and how we want to return that to shareholders. And as far as the debt level we want to carry, we're comfortable going to a higher debt level, if that's what makes sense for the business at the time. But again, we have a lot of flexibility in managing those components, and we will move forward based on what the business needs are at the time."

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Investor Relations Vice President of EOG Resources, Mr. Pearce Hammond. Please go ahead, sir.\nPearce Hammond: Thank you, Danielle, and good morning and thank you for joining us for the EOG Resources Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. An updated investor presentation has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, and we will reference certain slides during today's discussion. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning later today. As a reminder, this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings. This conference call may also contain certain historical and forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures.

Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chairman and CEO; Jeff Leitzell, Chief Operating Officer; Ann Janssen, Chief Financial Officer; Keith Trasko, Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production; and Lance Terveen, Senior Vice President, Marketing. Here's Ezra.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Pearce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered exceptional second quarter results, reflecting outstanding execution by our employees throughout our multi-basin portfolio. We earned $1.8 billion of adjusted net income and generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow. Every metric, production volumes, CapEx and per unit operating costs beat targets, driving another quarter of excellent financial performance. Our outstanding results year-to-date allow EOG to update our full year forecast for liquids production, cash operating costs and free cash flow. As seen on slide 5 of our investor presentation, we increased our target for full year 2024 total liquids production by 11,800 barrels per day. Increased production, coupled with a modest increase to forecasted operational efficiencies reduces per unit cash operating costs by $0.15, driving a $100 million increase to our forecasted free cash flow to $5.7 billion for the full year at the same strip prices of $80 oil and $2.50 natural gas. Illustrating the benefits of EOG's unique culture and decentralized structure. There wasn't one single operation or play that drove our second quarter out performance. Our decentralized operating teams utilize technology and apply innovation across our portfolio of assets to improve unit costs, well costs and well productivity. We made gains in both drilling and completions and every asset contributed. Our foundational Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford plays as well as our emerging Wyoming Powder River Basin, South Texas Toronto and Ohio Utica shale plays. The strength and depth of our multi-basin portfolio of premium assets is a tremendous advantage, and our focus on premium drilling means each of these assets competes against our premium price deck, measuring direct well investments against a $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas price for the life of the assets. That capital discipline provides EOG the flexibility to invest thoughtfully across all of our assets to support the pace of operations that is optimal for each individual asset to continue improve. We can adjust to dynamic market conditions such as the broader macro environment and basin-specific economic factors. As a result, we don't rely on any one basin, any one product or any one marketing outlet to drive our company's success. Capital discipline is core to EOG's value proposition, evidenced by our ability to generate free cash flow for eight years in a row and is what drives our ability to deliver the consistent performance that our shareholders have come to expect and to create long-term shareholder value through the cycle. EOG's outstanding and consistent operational and financial performance positions us to deliver on our cash return cash return commitments in 2024. Our strategy continues to be grounded in our regular dividend, which has never been suspended or reduced in 26 years and supplemented with special dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. Our disciplined and balanced investment in foundational plays, emerging assets, and strategic infrastructure, all supported with a pristine balance sheet is laying the path to increase near and long-term free cash flow. The overall macro environment remains constructive. Global oil demand continues to increase after a seasonally soft first quarter and is in line with our forecast. As anticipated, domestic oil supply growth has moderated since last year as a result of consolidation in the industry and reduced drilling and completions activity stemming from industry capital discipline. Activity levels, as reflected in rig count indicate continued lower oil production growth through at least mid-2025. We expect Lower 48 U.S. supply to exit 2024 at roughly the same level as year-end 2023, with only modest gains to total U.S. oil supply from offshore -- as offshore production increases. Regarding North American natural gas. During the second quarter, inventory levels move closer to the five-year average, and we expect this trend to continue due in part to supply curtailments and increasing year-over-year demand. We remain optimistic on the long-term outlook for gas demand beginning in 2025, as a result of additional LNG capacity coming online and continuing increases in demand from electricity generation. We will continue to prudently manage our Dorado activity as the current environment continues to highlight the importance of being a low-cost supplier of natural gas with access to multiple diverse markets. This quarter, we have further expanded our marketing outlets, capturing additional interstate pipeline capacity to deliver natural gas to demand centers in the Southeastern U.S. In a moment, Lance will provide details on this exciting opportunity as well as updates on our ongoing infrastructure projects. EOG's performance this quarter can be summed up as exceptional operational execution drives exceptional financial performance, resulting in more volumes and lower per unit operating costs for the same CapEx, yielding higher free cash flow for the year. Anne is up next to provide an update on financials and cash return to shareholders. Here's Ann.\nAnn Janssen: Thanks, Ezra. EOG continues to create long-term shareholder value. During the second quarter, we earned $1.8 billion of adjusted net income and generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow on $1.7 billion of capital expenditures. Second quarter capital expenditures finished lower than expected due to the timing of certain indirect and international projects, along with contributions from efficiency gains above what we forecasted at the start of the year. Jeff will discuss these operating efficiencies in a moment. We also paid a $0.91 per share dividend and repurchased 690 million of shares during the quarter. In the first half of 2024, we generated $2.6 billion free cash flow, helping fund cash return to shareholders of $2.5 billion. We have paid over $1 billion in regular dividends and repurchased more than $1.4 billion in stock through the second quarter while maintaining a pristine balance sheet. Taking into account our top-tier full year regular dividend, we have already committed to return $3.5 billion to shareholders in 2024. We are on track exceed not only our minimum cash return commitment of 70% of annual free cash flow, but also last year's cash return of 85%. EOG's commitment to high-return investments is delivering high return to our shareholders. A growing sustainable regular dividend remains the foundation of our cash return commitment and is the best indicator of the company's confidence in its future performance. Special dividends and share repurchases are employed opportunistically to supplement our top-tier regular dividend. Since putting the $5 billion share repurchase authorization in place over two years ago, the fundamental strength of our business has improved as demonstrated most recently by our exceptional second quarter and year-to-date performance. We continue to get better through consistent execution of EOG's value proposition. As a result, over the last several quarters, we have favored buybacks and we will continue to monitor the market for opportunities to step in and repurchase shares throughout the year. Since the authorization has been put in place, we have repurchased nearly 21 million shares, which is more than 3% of shares outstanding at an average price of about $118 per share, totaling about $2.4 billion worth of shares repurchased. Now here's Jeff to review our operating results.\nJeff Leitzell: Thanks, Anne. I'd like to first thank our employees for their outstanding execution this quarter. Your dedication to and focus on operational excellence extends our momentum from the first quarter and puts EOG in great position to finish the year strong and deliver exceptional value to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we beat targets across the board, including production volumes, per unit operating costs and CapEx. Oil volumes came in above target due to a couple of drivers. Production in our foundational Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford plays is outpacing our forecast due to better well performance on a collection of packages. Also, our base production performance continues to improve due to the application of proprietary EOG technology. Over the last several years, we have developed in-house artificial lift optimizers for several functions, including gas lift, plunger lift and rod pump operations. These state-of-the-art optimizers use algorithms to automate the set points of artificial lift and cost factors that allow for real-time adjustments to maximize production and reduce interruptions of third-party downtime. These cross-functional efforts by our production, marketing and information systems teams continue to improve and pay dividends. The final driver of our second quarter volume beat was timing. We were able to bring online a package of wells a full month earlier than anticipated. As a result of volume performance beats to date and updates to our full year forecast for Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford production, we are increasing our annual volume guidance by 1,800 barrels of oil per day and 10,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids. The volume uplift helps lower our per unit cash operating cost guidance for the full year, as well as generates additional free flow. Total well costs are trending in line with our expectations and resulting in a low single-digit year-over-year decrease. Driven by both moderate market deflation and drilling efficiency gains, we are seeing these cost improvements across our entire multi-basin portfolio. Regarding service costs, depletion is playing out as we had forecasted at the start of the year. Spot prices for certain services have trended lower, while high-spec rigs and frac equipment remain relatively stable. We have secured 50% to 60% of our service costs with contracts in 2024, primarily for high-spec high-demand services to ensure consistent performance throughout our program. By securing these resources, we're able to focus on sustainable efficiency improvements to progress each one of our plays at a measured pace. In our foundational Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford plays, Operational efficiencies are driven primarily by longer laterals, improving drilled feet per day. Longer laterals allow for more time being spent drilling downhole and less time moving equipment on the surface. In addition, the more we extend laterals, the more benefit we derive from our in-house drilling motor program. EOG motors drill faster and are more reliable, which becomes more impactful on our drilling performance as lateral length increases. In the Eagle Ford, we are on target to extend laterals by 20% on average and the year-to-date results has been a 7% increase in drilled feet per day. In the Delaware Basin, more than 50 wells or nearly 15% of our 2024 drilling program will use 3-mile laterals compared to four 3-mile laterals last year. Year-to-date, the efficiency impact from our 3-mile program in the Delaware Basin is a 10% increase in drilled feet per day. In the Utica Shale, we continue to collect data from our new packages and evaluate production history from existing wells as we test spacing patterns and completion designs across our 140-mile acreage position. Two new well packages, the Northern shadow wells and Southern White Rhino wells, as seen on Slide 12 of our investor presentation, have delivered strong initial results and continue to demonstrate the premium quality of this play. In addition to strong well results, since last quarter, we have added another 10,000 net acres to our Utica Shale position, bringing our total to 445,000, while we continue to make delineation progress, our focus in the near future for Utica development will be on the 225,000 net acres in the volatile oil window, where we have a more comprehensive geologic data set. Our large contiguous acreage position in the Utica lends itself to developing a long-life, repeatable, low-cost play competitive with the premier unconventional plays across North America. For 2024, we are on target to complete 20 net wells in the Utica across our northern, central and southern acreage, which supports a full rig program and enables significant well cost reductions. In Dorado, we continue to leverage the operational flexibility provided by our multi-basin portfolio to moderate and manage activity through the summer. Earlier this year, we decided to defer completions while retaining a full rig program to maintain operational momentum. As a result, the drilling team has achieved a 13% increase in drilled feet per day year-to-date. Maintaining a steady drilling program allows us to capture corresponding efficiencies in advance and improve the play, while we continue to monitor the natural gas market. Gas prices are improving into the second half of the year, and we remain flexible to respond to the market. As the year unfolds, we will continue to maintain capital discipline and leverage the flexibility of our multi-basin portfolio to ensure consistent execution across all operating areas. We also remain highly focused on sustainable cost reductions through innovation, operational performance and efficiency improvements to further drive down our cost structure and expand EOG's capacity to generate free cash flow. Here's Lance for a marketing update.\nLance Terveen: Thanks, Jeff. I'll be updating on our strategic infrastructure investments in the Delaware Basin and Dorado, as well as the exciting progress we have made expanding access to premium natural gas markets. First, in the Delaware Basin, our Janus Gas Processing Plant is on schedule to start up in the first half of 2025. This 300 million cubic feet per day plant will be instrumental and lowering our cash operating costs and improving netbacks. The Janus plant will have connectivity to the new Matterhorn Express Pipeline estimated to be in service the fourth quarter of this year. EOG has firm capacity on Matterhorn, which will allow us to move additional residue gas out of Waha to the Katy Houston Market Center. Most importantly, we expect our Waha gas exposure on a total company production basis to be only 5% in 2025. Furthermore, our new Matterhorn capacity already has in place term sales, along with additional downstream connectivity. Next, in our emerging South Texas Dorado natural gas play, Phase 1 of 36-inch Verde Pipeline is in service with safe, consistent operations, and we are on schedule to bring online Phase 2 in the second half of 2024. We are excited that Phase 2 of the Verde Pipelines terminus is the Agua Dulce market hub. While our current cash costs in Dorado are approximately $1 per Mcf, we expect the combination of Verde Phase 2 and the premium markets accessed at Agua Dulce will further expand our margins, positioning Dorado as one of the most competitive, lowest cost and highest return natural gas plays in North America. At Agua Dulce, we have executed agreements for three interconnects directly from our Verde pipeline, including White Water's new ADCC pipeline, supplying Cheniere's Corpus Christi LNG terminal. Enbridge's Valley Crossing pipeline with access to industrial, LNG and Mexico markets and Williams Transco pipeline expansion, the Texas to Louisiana Energy Pathway Project, or TLEPP, reaching entire Gulf Coast corridor, which is illustrated on slide 10 in our investor presentation. TLEPP received FERC approval at the end of June and is currently under construction and expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2025 EOG is contracted for the entire 364,400Btu per day of firm capacity. Through TLEP, we expand our access to a valuable liquid market center that serves robust southeastern power generation and additional future demand. Our capacity on TLEP is in path for supply from multiple EOG assets, including Dorado from our Verde pipeline and the Permian Basin from our capacity on the Matterhorn pipeline. Securing capacity on TLEP is consistent with our broader marketing strategy to diversify our end market options. We continue to expand our access to multiple premium markets, serving customers from LNG to industrials to utilities and more while optimizing our valuable transportation position. Now here's Ezra to wrap up.\nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Lance. I'd like to note the following important takeaways. EOG has delivered another outstanding quarter. Strong employee-driven operational performance produced strong financial performance. Our multi-basin asset teams continue to drive innovation and increase capital efficiency, not only on new wells, but by applying technology to our base production. We are delivering more volumes and lower per unit costs for the same CapEx resulting in higher free cash flow for the year. Capital allocation across our foundational plays, emerging assets and strategic infrastructure is delivering strong near-term free cash flow while also laying a path to future free cash flow generation. EOG continues to expand an already diverse marketing strategy. Following our announcement of a new Brent-linked gas sales agreement earlier this year, this quarter, we have announced additional natural gas pipeline connections further reducing our exposure to in-basin differentials and exposing us to multiple demand centers. And lastly, EOG continues to deliver on its cash return commitment. While our regular dividend is the foundation of our cash return strategy, we are well positioned to continue delivering additional cash return through share repurchases and special dividends, supported with the strength of our balance sheet and low-cost operations. Including our annual regular dividend and share repurchases in the first half of the year, we have already committed to $3.5 billion in cash return and are well positioned to exceed our minimum cash return commitment. Thanks for listening. We'll now go to Q&A.\nQ - Arun Jayaram: Good morning. I wanted to start in the Utica Shale, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of some of the key learnings thus far, including your initial test in the South and perhaps discuss maybe the glide path towards shifting into development mode. What are some of the key risks from here that you need to get comfortable with before shifting into development?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Arun. This is Ezra. Let me start the last part of your question there, and then I'll hand it off to Keith Trasko for a few more of the details on the Utica play. What I'd say in the Utica overall is that we're very happy with the results that we've seen to date. The Southern wells, the White Rhino's that we've talked about are right in line with the expectations in Northern Wells are consistently strong results and very repeatable. So ramping up the Utica, I mean, it's going to be like any other play that we have in our portfolio. We want to invest in it at the right pace so that we can continue to learn and embed those learnings into the next well, and Keith will mention some of those learnings here in a minute. Ultimately, as we do continue to delineate and invest more capital out there, it's going to be at a level of reinvestment that really reflects the maturity of that asset. And when we do that across our multi-basin portfolio, that's when we really start to drive down the cost of all plays and expand the margins at the corporate level.\nKeith Trasko: Yes. This is Keith. On the well results so far, the recent ones, we're very pleased overall, I feel like we're making great delineation progress. Some of the key learnings so far, White Rhino, that is our prospects down the south, the performance we're seeing to date meeting expectations has a little bit lower BOE IP30. That was something we were expecting because of a little bit of thinner reservoir down there, but it really benefits from the strategic mineral ownership which really enhances the returns by voting the royalties down there. That has a really big financial impact. The Shadow package that we just recently brought on, that's an offset to the Timberwolf\u2019s. We're seeing consistently strong results at tighter spacing there. We did a 700-foot spacing test there versus 1,000. Spacing overall, I'd say, so far so good. We're excited about the consistency so far there. We're going to keep incorporating data, as future development decisions go there. But we're still early in the play. We need a little bit longer production history. We look at a lot of different things as far as the two- and three-stream production, the pressure, we're taking a lot of real-time measurements, choke schedules, those sorts of things. And we expect this basin will probably change across the play based on geology. It's just a really large acreage position. But I'd say, with our learnings, we're constantly bringing those into our decisions. We are really pride ourselves on not getting into manufacturing mode and instead kind of developing the acreage package by package, integrating the latest data and learnings trying to maximize returns and the value capture.\nArun Jayaram: Okay. My follow-up is \u2013 maybe, Jeff, if you could elaborate on some of the technology on the artificial lift side that you've been incorporating. What are some of the potential financial implications? Does this have a positive impact on your decline rates, sustaining capital requirements, but give us a sense of the big picture in terms of the artificial lift technology?\nJeff Leitzell: Yes. Thanks, Arun. Well, as we talked about, we've been developing this technology over the last few years. And it's one of the big reasons. Obviously, we had the increase to guidance this quarter, and it really had to do with better base production kind of across the full portfolio. And it has to do with these artificial lift technologies that we're implementing. So for instance, and we've talked about it a little bit, we have a program that optimizes our gas lift. So it will basically monitor and through algorithms iterate how much gas we are injecting downhole to maximize production on the full bank of wells that it's supplying gas to. And then if we ever have any kind of downstream interruptions, it can it can divert gas and move it to the higher producing wells to make sure we're maximizing the production potential through that downtime event and then it can switch back to optimal normal operations. So -- we've done that exact same thing with a plunger lift optimization and then also on rod pump to run exactly how fast the rod pump is working and to optimize the lift of the oil on all of our wells out there. So -- yes, it's been absolutely a big mover, and we've implemented it pretty much around our multi-basin portfolio. And I think you're seeing the benefits of it right now in the base production. And we expect to obviously be moving forward to have less downtime and be able to maintain a better base production as we move into the future.\nOperator: The next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: Yeah. Thank you, Ezra and team. Ezra, I always value your perspective on the oil macro, particularly around the Lower 48. What's your view of how exit to exit is tracking? It does seem from this earnings season, whether it's you or the super majors, the execution from a production standpoint has been very good and how do you think this plays out in '25? Especially given the fact that OPEC has that spare capacity and indicating the return of supply into the market? So macro thoughts on the shale trajectory would be terrific.\nEzra Yacob: Yeah. Thanks, Neil. Appreciate the question, the opportunity to talk a little bit about the macro. If we started a little bit more of the broad level, I think what we're seeing is global demand is increasing year-over-year, essentially in line with our expectations, which is quite a bit less than 2023 over 2022. Even China, I'd say that has a lot of questions China demand is even kind of in line, demand is in line with our expectations the year. For us, on US supply, I think we've talked about on previous earnings calls for crude, we're looking -- we feel somewhere between 300,000 and 400,000 barrels a day annually would be the increase. In total liquids maybe closer to 500,000 barrels a day. When you look at what's happening in the Lower 48 specifically, as I said in the opening remarks, we think from December to December, it will be relatively flat. We've had relatively flat DUC counts for the past months. And even though, as you're highlighting, there's -- everybody seems to be reporting on the margin, some increased operational efficiency, it's really rig count that's remained flat and then completion spreads that have remained flat as well. And so when we roll all that up, we continue to see not only the effects of consolidation in the industry, but just overall industry discipline really being the drivers of that more moderate US growth. And we think that will continue not only into 2025, but really for the next few years moving forward. Immediately, as I discussed with the current rig counts where they have been for the last eight, nine months, and where they look to be finishing the rest of this year at, that should drive moderate, potentially even less growth year-over-year than what we're seeing this year. And the last thing I think I'd point out is just the amount of decline. The US has grown so much in the last decade on the oil side and many of those barrels have been switched out from conventional resources into obviously more unconventional resources that come with a bit of a steeper decline. And so after years and years of growing, the US is finally looking at a spot where we have a very steep decline year-over-year as a country that needs to be filled in before new barrels can actually add to the growth. And those are the kind of key metrics that we continue to look at. But ultimately, it starts in the field at the asset level, looking at the activity and the capital efficiency of the plays.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you, Ezra. That's really helpful perspective. And staying on the macro and then tie it into your business. On natural gas, we've seen a lot of volatility, good price to start the year, obviously, very weak prices now. This morning, we had the 6-month pushout of Golden Pass. So -- just as you think about the '25 plan, is it fair to say you're going to try keep it a little bit more oil-weighted versus gas? And how does it affect how you want to deploy capital in gassier areas?\nEzra Yacob: Neil, it's another good question. We -- at this point, Inventory levels are clearly above the 5-year average. And commensurately -- commensurate with that, the natural gas price is below the 5-year average. I will point out as we saw at the beginning of 2024, inventory levels can react very quickly on weather, specifically winter weather. But at this point, we do foresee that the inventory overhang will continue into 2025. I don't think we're alone with that idea. But we do forecast that we should bring down inventory levels to the 5-year average throughout 2025, assuming kind of a normal winter. And that's not only due to the increase in demand throughout the year from LNG and increased electricity demand. Recently -- certainly didn't help, but this summer, we did experience some off-line demand in LNG. But even with that, overall, we're still seeing an increase in year-over-year domestic demand. I think electricity is trending on about a 4.5% increase year-over-year and so all those things continue to be positive in the longer term. So specific to what we're talking about in 2025, we haven't -- we're not prepared today to talk about 2025. I'm sure heading off a question that probably comes up later on the call with that. But what I'd say is we are actively managing our Dorado program. We've done that last year, and we did that this year. Longer term, as I said, we do expect we're very bullish on pricing through there. And so we are managing the Dorado program to align with demand. We prefer to manage Dorado on the upfront kind of investment side. I think Jeff mentioned in the opening remarks, the benefits we've seen of running a consistent rig program there, increased drilled feet per day by 13% year-over-year. I think if you look at the past 2 years, it's closer to 30% over the past 2 years. But then once we get the gas molecules online, as Lance mentioned, we do have a low cash operating cost of $1 per Mcf. That's a dynamic number as we sit here today. And so that gives us a lot of confidence and flexibility on how to invest and how to think about Dorado going forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Richardson Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nSteve Richardson: Thank you. Good morning. Really impressive realizations in the quarter, particularly relative to what we're seeing from the broader industry and can't help, but think it's largely to do with how unique your marketing organization is. Ezra, I guess the -- I would wonder if you could expound a little bit on the nature of the organization, right? You don't seem shy about deploying capital either in field or as we just heard with longer-haul pipes and everything else. But if you just take from the basis that you're trying to get the highest realization for your products and getting to the best sales point. How do you organize -- how do -- how do you incentivize that organization on returns? And you think about capital deployed in that business? And how to -- and performance of that business and how it adds value to EOG?\nEzra Yacob: Steve, this is Ezra. I appreciate the remarks there and the question. Our marketing team is something we're extremely proud of and what we think is a real competitive advantage especially in a multi-basin portfolio a company such as ours. So, just maybe a few remarks by me, and then I'll hand it off to Lance to give some more details on it. Our overall marketing strategy, the first thing we always think about is really the netback pricing. And so taking on additional transportation is not a negative thing if it's getting you into premium markets, either for oil or gas. We like to have flexibility as we've talked about. Diversification, with access to multiple markets. We love to have control, where we get firm capacity from the wellhead to sales points. And then the duration. We've had times in the past where we've committed to long-term commitments, and we realize that's not what we want to do. We want to minimize those long-term kind of high cost commitments and really invest in with good partners that understand that we're trying to align our commitments with how -- we think about our growth of the individual assets. And we're consistently challenging the marketing team to think about being a low-cost operator. And that's also how we invest in some of these strategic infrastructure projects is what will they do for us over the long term with margin expansion.\nLance Terveen: Yes. Right. And Steve, this is Lance. I think where I might add a little bit additional color too, when you think about how we're differentiated. I just -- it goes back to the culture, too. I think like our marketing teams like we're integrated in with our division operations. I mean our division operations, our marketing team, that's all integrated with our fundamentals. So, when we look at -- we can look at the global markets, as we think about LNG or exporting of our products. But then also when you get to like in-basin fundamentals, we have a strong grasp of that and what we see. And so then that way, we can set up and have multiple markets, and we can get to new markets like we announced with TLEPP that gets to a new premium market for the company to just further strengthen our netbacks long term. So, I'd say all what Ezra put together with his comments and then just the integration that we have internally to, I think, is a real differentiator.\nSteve Richardson: Appreciate all that additional info. Sort of -- if I could just follow up really quickly on service costs. I appreciate the comments that you're 50% to 60% contracted for 2024. I would be curious to hear what you're seeing on the leading edge across the supply chain and thoughts on what the back half of the year could look like, at least on parts of the bill materials that isn't contracted at this point?\nJeff Leitzell: Yes, Steve, this is Jeff. Thanks for the question. When we look at service costs, what we do is we really break them down into a couple of categories. So, we have like our standard services, and then we have what we refer to as like our high-spec services, which is the majority of what we utilize as a company. On the standard kind of rig and frac pricing out there, what we saw as it started to weaken at the second half of last year. And it really varied kind of basin to basin based on activity levels. And the Permian, I would say, definitely had the most resilient pricing for service costs since ahead like over half of the rig activity. So, in general, I would say, since the middle of last year, standard rig and frac prices are down probably 15% to 20%. When you look at some of the support services over that same period, I'd say coiled tubing and wireline costs are probably down 15% and then then workover rigs have reduced about 10%. And just an additional thing that I'd point out is that through the first half of the year, we've really seen those reductions have kind of slowed as has Ezra talked about, with the rig count and the frac fleet count kind of stabilizing. So the big point out there, I'd say, is with the high-spec services that we utilize, we currently see relatively stable pricing and we probably will mostly through the rest of the year. But we have started to see a few areas of moderation and a little bit of spot availability, and it's primarily around the gas plays and outside the Permian. And then as you talked about, we're just locking up to 50% to 60% of our services. The way we do that, our contracting strategy is very strategic to where we stagger out our contracts. So we aren't rolling contracts off all at once. So we're constantly renegotiating new contracts and also renegotiating the spot market to make sure we're taking the best advantage we can of pricing that's out there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Leo Mariani from ROTH Capital. Please go ahead.\nLeo Mariani: I just wanted to follow up a little bit on your comments around how you're going to be kind of prudently managing your Dorado activity. I just wanted to get a sense, are you pretty much committed to kind of the 1 rig this year, it sounds like you want to get the wells drilled, but is there a potential to maybe defer some of those turn in lines or maybe choke back some of those volumes until later this year, just based on the weak current pricing. Obviously, I know you got the second phase of your Verde pipeline coming on, which is going to improve netbacks. But I was just hoping to get a little more color on how you kind of prudently manage that activity and how you're thinking about it?\nJeff Leitzell: Yeah, Leo. This is Jeff. And as Ezra talked about earlier, there's really no change moving forward from what we had talked about last quarter. we're obviously managing the investment timing and it's primarily on the completion side where we just pushed a handful of wells into the second half of the year because we had some flexibility there. And as he said, we'll just be able to monitor those prices through kind of summer and fall and see what happens as we move into the back end of the year. With that, though, yeah, we're going to go ahead and maintain that 1-rig program really with no changes through the rest of the year. I mean the team has just done an exceptional job on building on their existing operational efficiencies. And as Ezra stated, I mean, they're already halfway through the year, they've seen a 13% improvement in their overall footage per day. So, the big thing is, if you look at the program, I mean, it's only a 20, 25 well program right now. We really want to build on that and continue to push the great technical and operational progress that we've made so far. And so we'll continue to do that through the year and stay on course with our current plan and just continue to make the best economic decision for the play as we move forward.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. I appreciate that. And then just with respect to the Utica, you made some comments that wells are sort of performing in line with expectations, but you also mentioned the fact that you continue to kind of experiment with spacing and completion design. So don't exactly know what the internal expectations are. But are you seeing the well performance trend better? Are the last two pads showing -- maybe just better EURs per foot versus where they were in 2023? Just trying to get a sense of trends on these wells and whether or not they're getting better and maybe that was what your internal expectation was?\nKeith Trasko: Yeah, this is Keith. I'd say they've met our internal expectation. We're expecting performance to vary over the 445,000 net acre position with the 140-mile span of it. We've been focused on our activity on the 225,000 net acres that we have in the volatile oil window? And we see changes in geology along there. We see we're going to have different spacing in different areas, different type curves in different areas, but we are constructive on the play overall everywhere that we've tested, and we think the variation that we're seeing is within the norm.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nScott Hanold : Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe sticking with the Utica and how you think about like marketing gas and some of your NGLs. Can you talk about the strategy as you look to eventually get to more scale development in the Utica? How you think about marketing those gas and NGLs?\nLance Terveen: Hey, Scott, hey, good morning, this is Lance. Yes, when we look at the Utica, one of the things I like is -- I mean, it was -- it's very consistent. As we think about the early evaluation of the play. One of the things that's unique, again, I know we've commented on this in the past, but when you think about it, I mean, you don't really need a lot of major infrastructure build-out. I mean -- so what we've really been focused on from a marketing, midstream and within our division up there is really just getting the local gathering systems in place and those are both commissioned and online, and we're getting to the markets. I know we've talked a lot about there's just a lot of ample redundant processing capacity. Again, going back to my earlier comment about you don't need to make a lot of real long-term commitments. It's a place where we have measured pace, right? A lot of the acreage is all HBP. We can have a measured pace of production up there. But then from a commitment standpoint with being existing capacity and also very near to a pretty a pretty sizable local demand market on the crude oil side, too. So I think as you think about our strategy from a marketing standpoint, it will be very consistent with our other plays that we've had that have been very early in their development. So we'll be very measured. The crude oil will probably start with lease sales and then we'll kind of look at oil gathering. We're setting up and selling a lot of our crude into the local refineries today that's in that area. So I would say it aligns very much with what we've done in many of our other plays. Scott.\nScott Hanold: Yes. Yes. And I guess delving into a little bit more specific on that, do you expect to try to get the gas that you produce out of the basin to get better pricing in with the NGLs? Would you try to find a way to maybe get to the export market in that area where you get much stronger pricing? So just more so on the NGLs than in the gas, like do you expect to get those out of basin? Or what's sort of the short and longer-term plan there?\nLance Terveen : No, that's a great question. I think, again, I mean, not to kind of go back to my earlier comments, it's going to be a function of just the pace of the development there. And so commitments, we're going to be very disciplined there. But as you think about the gas markets there, especially at the tailgate from a residue standpoint, into the markets, there's a significant amount of just demand that's there kind of going through the Midwest, you have a lot of interstate connectivity. It's an extremely liquid market. So I think we're going to be pretty disciplined there, and I've been using that word quite a bit, but it's just not a need to really reach too further downstream. And then as you think about the NGL markets, there's a lot of -- it's a little bit different than other plays in that you have a lot of the local fractionation is kind of there within the state, right? And so a lot of the purity is being exported. So we're kind of already kind of participating in some of those aspects as well, just because that's some of the natural markets avenues for the products there on NGLs, Scott.\nOperator: The next question comes from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.\nCharles Meade: Yes. Good morning, Ezra, to you and the whole EOG team there, I'd like to go back to the Utica and the ShadowPad. So it looks like a really attractive IP30 you showed us there, relative to the wider space wells. But I'm curious if you could maybe offer a little bit more detail or insight on how those -- the spot rates are evolving from that pad. And if you have any sense of how long it will be before you're able to say that that the spacing policy is a success?\nKeith Trasko: This is Keith. So as far as how the -- I think the -- as far as how the rates are evolving question and talk a little bit about, like the product mix. So our IP30s are heavily oil weighted, heavily liquids weighted. We do see that in a lot of combo plays. So expect that early on, and we've seen that across all the well packages we have in the north and south. So we still estimate like a 60% to 70% liquids mix for the UR product. And so I'll tie back to a well that has a little more production history, which is the Timberwolf. So Timberwolf and also the Xavier package, that IP30 was around 55% oil cut. Those have been on for about a little over six months now, and we see closer to a 50% oil cut right now. So you see it moderate, but it's not a large drop overall. As far as how long to determine if the spacing is a success? It's going to vary in different places, but we just want to see more production data on the, I'd say, at least six months, nine months or so. And compare that to the data set that we have on some of our older packages, Timberwolf, Xavier, et cetera, and just see how they hang in there, see how the pressures look, et cetera.\nCharles Meade: Got it. That's helpful. So maybe midyear next year. And then a follow-up on the TLEPP project. I wonder if you could -- sticking on the theme with the midstream, but wondering if you could give us a narrative on how that project came together for you guys, particularly that I know a lot of people -- a lot of marketers have been trying to get east from the ship channel to markets East of there and how this came together and how it came to be that you're the 100% of capacity there?\nLance Terveen: Hi, Charles, good morning. Thanks for the question. This is Lance. We could probably spend 30 minutes on that question, but I think Ezra is going to kick me over here if I spend too much time. But I'd say I talked earlier, one of the questions kind of related to just the marketing strategy and the integration that we have and we think about like the markets. And was something that we looked at as you asked the genesis of that. I mean that started all the way back in kind of 2022, right? And so we saw kind of that station 65 when you look kind of into that market was likely going to be very much premium market long-term. And so we worked alongside Williams there, went out for their open season, and we're able to capture all the capacity there through our precedent agreement. So that took a lot of time, I mean, I think you really have to have that foresight and then looking forward like into the markets. And then I think other thing I really want to capture is just that is all in path right, Charles. So I mean, when you think about like South Texas all the way through our Eagle Ford asset, all the way up into the Gulf Coast market. I mean, we can kind of capture everything, the Delaware Basin with our existing transport, our new transport that we're going to have on Matterhorn, all that that kind of gets in the path can kind of get into that market. So that's a little bit of that all came together because, yes, you have a lot of these pipes that are coming in to the Gulf Coast. And so as you've seen on some of our slides that we have there, especially related to gas sales agreements, you have to have end markets on the other side. So we've been very forward thinking there. You can see the ramp-up that we have in terms of other term sales that we have. So you need to have the transport position, Charles, but then you also need to be thinking about having strategic sales on the other side. And I think that's another thing that really differentiates us that we've got that in place now and then also looking forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning, team. Maybe this is for Jeff or maybe Ezra. I want to go back into artificial lift. I want to see that, I mean, the technology you use and how is that different than what is commonly available in the market today by some of the oil services. So in other words, that do you think your adoption that what gives you the edge comparing to your competitor? And whether that you can quantify, you talked about the base operation become better, how that improves your base decline rate? That's the first question.\nJeff Leitzell: Thanks, Paul. This is Jeff. Yes, that's a great question. And with any of our technology that we developed. The beautiful thing about it is it's integrated within EOG with all of our different systems. So it communicates with all the data is getting all of our production data, all the all the pressures, all the flow rates, temperatures, everything real time. And so all that's flowing into the system, and you can see that, which with a lot of other third-party systems, that's not possible. On top of that, it also ties directly into our centralized control rooms, which is in each one of basins that watches our production real-time 24/7. And as these systems are optimizing at the control room can watch it, monitor and make sure that the iterated set points are correct then notify any people in the field real time to be able to go out and check on a well or make any additional changes that need to be done. So really, it has to do with the integration within our systems, it really kind of sets us apart from that aspect. And then on the decline rate side or I should say, at least from a base production and what our forecast is, you always have a certain amount of downtime that goes along with normal operations of wells. And what these optimizers really do is they help minimize that downtime. So instead of having a handful of percentage, you're able to actually knock off a percentage to downtime be able to keep these wells flowing and maximize the production across our multi-basin portfolio.\nPaul Cheng: That\u2019s great. The second question that I think, Ezra, you talked about. You guys can do quickly the rate if you want to increase activity level, what will be the precondition? I mean what do you look for in order for you to determine when is the right time for you to accelerate the rig activity or that even -- how many wells that you bring on the market?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Paul, this is Ezra. I think you broke up there just for a second. So I'm not sure if you're asking about the Bakken, Dorado or Utica, but obviously...\nPaul Cheng: I'm talking about Dorado. What will be the precondition for you to decide, okay, this is the right time, I want to increase activities and bring more gas to the market. Is it just simply price? Or are you looking for anything else? And it is simply the price or that you are looking for anything else? And increase of 5, is there price mix of that will be buying the impact trick upon?\nEzra Yacob: Yeah. Thank you, Paul. So yes, with Drato, I think the biggest thing to continue to think about with any gas play, and for us, the dominant one is Drato. And you can see right now in the current environment, how volatile gas prices are is you've got to be committed to being the low-cost supplier. You've got to be a low-cost operator on the gas side because as we all know, the margins are pretty skinny, you can make up with it with low operating costs, gas is easier to operate in liquids. But then you need to make up for it with volumes. And then the second piece of it is you've got to be exposed to diverse markets because the volatility of gas means that you'll have arbitrages come and go very quickly. And if you've got the gas they're exposed to the market, you can capture those. If you try chase those arbitrages much like we saw in 2022 and 2023, by the time you can try to get your gas in position to capture an arbitrage, it might be gone. So those are the two things that we really focus on. In general, when you start talking about capital allocation to it, those comments you should read into is why we've continued to stick with a rig activity down there, kind of a minimal level of activity. so that we can continue, as Jeff highlighted, to learn, embed those learning's in the very next well and continue to be confident that when we see the emerging demand hit, which is coming in next few years with a lot of the LNG coming online, we'll be in a position to be able to bring to market, low cost reserves -- low-cost gas reserves. Now on the -- that's on the drilling side. On the completion side, we do have a lot of flexibility there. A great way to kind of overspend is if you're bringing in a frac spread and sending it out of the basin and bringing it back picking up water lines, laying them back down and things like that. So that's why we try to keep a drilling rig going, as I've talked about in the past, that's kind of the first hurdle to capturing economies of scale. Then the second one is trying to get your packages lined up. So when you bring a completion spread in, you can actually keep it for a significant number of wells and bring that on. What we look for in general to when we could take that next step. It's not only internal learning's, it's not only the returns that we're generating. But it is also with respect to the macro market. As I said on a previous question, the price essentially follows inventory levels or it's very lined out with that. We're below the five-year average right now on pricing and above the five-year average on inventory levels. So inventory levels are a big driver of what we're looking for. But then we're also cognizant of the supply and demand fundamentals for really North America or really just the US. And again, what we see is a lot of increased demand coming in the next few years. You have 10 to 12 Bcf a day arguably under construction right now that should be on really beginning throughout 2025. And then in addition to that, as you look at the back half of the decade, I think on the last earnings call, we highlighted our forecast for potentially another 10 to 12 Bcf a day of demand increasing from things like electricity generation, coal power plant retirements, just an increase in Mexico exports and then finally, just overall industrial demand growth. So we really look at it internally. Our ability to generate higher returns and embed our learnings, so that we're investing at the right pace. And externally, we look at supply demand and ultimately, the inventory levels, Paul.\nOperator: The next question comes from Doug Leggate from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDoug Leggate: Ezra, how are you? Thanks for having me on. Can you hear me okay?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, sir, Doug, it's good to hear from you again.\nDoug Leggate: Good. I wasn\u2019t sure if I had gotten into the -- there, but I wonder if I could pull you back to the Utica just for a second. I mean, delineation is kind of a glacial event for a lot of companies. You guys have moved very quickly not only to lock down the acreage, but to demonstrably show that at least on our numbers, this is starting to look competitive relative to your Permian position. I'm just wondering how you would frame the extent to which you've derisked the play at this point and when you would anticipate a more meaningful development plan as you move forward? Is it infrastructure constrained? Or is there another reason that you're waiting? Because it looks like geologically, at least you're figuring this thing out.\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Doug, I appreciate that. I think everything you're saying is correct. It's how we feel about it, too. geologically, we're doing a great job fearing out. I will point out the only caveat, I'd maybe make is we have, as Jeff pointed out, concentrated right now in in the volatile oil window. So, roughly 225, 000 out of the 445,000 acres. But you can see our confidence the fact that we continue to put -- we continue to put together some leased acreage as we increase the footprint about 10,000 acres. And it's not overly complicated, Doug. We've got multiple packages now in the north, and we're seeing consistently strong results. So, I would say we're feeling very confident there in the North. Certainly, as Keith and Charles were speaking about, we're not 100% satisfied with a spacing number if you wanted to get down that path. But in any North American shale play, you know as well as I do, the spacing is going to -- it's going to be between 600-foot and 1,000-foot spacing, probably on average, depending on the play. And then in the South, we only have one package really with any amount of data on there. So, we're a little bit further behind on delineation down there, even though that package did come online with our expectations. So, it's too early to talk about 2025, but just to call back, we have -- basically, we're planning on this year doubling the amount of wells to sales over what we did in 2023. And I think you're spot on, Doug, that we are seeing to-date with the early-time wells that we have, we're seeing that it's competitive with parts of the Permian Basin.\nDoug Leggate: That's what we are seeing as well. And I think, to be honest, I think some of us were a little skeptical to begin with, and you're proving, as you're proving us wrong. So, congratulations on that. My follow-up, there's been a lot of questions this morning on gas and the extraordinary realizations you guys have had, I think it was pointed out earlier, but my question is on the proportion of gas that you're prepared to commit to international pricing. I think right now, I want to say if I look out to the back end of the decade at your current volume, you're about halfway locked in, whether it be Brent-related or the other things that you pointed out. But in terms of your preparedness to step up your international exposure, what are you thinking as we see incremental LNG plants start to come out of the wood work, like the Woodside deal with Wheelan [ph], for example. Where would you be comfortable in terms of international exposure? I'm losing my voice, but in terms of international exposure, Ezra, as it relates to your total proportion of your volumes?\nEzra Yacob: Yes, Doug, I appreciate that. We have -- as you've seen, we've got Slide 11 in our deck that kind of highlights what we've done with our gas sales agreements to expose us to pricing diversification, including the international. I'd point out, Doug, the biggest thing is when we entered into these agreements, as you'll recall, we entered -- we started negotiations and really entered into most of these and kind of a counter-cyclic time period. And so the first thing to keep in mind is, when we look at these opportunities, we want to make sure that we're being a low cost -- we're entering into a lower cost contract or gas sales agreement that's going to provide us with upside exposure. And then in the sales agreements that we've done to date, we feel like it limits our exposure to risk as well. One reason that we're able to enter into some of these agreements is just because of to be perfectly honest, the size and scale of what we've captured, mainly at Dorado, but also across other basins as Lance has talked about. So right now, as you pointed out, we're only really selling about 140 MMBtu per day that gets exposed to the uplift of JKM pricing. But from 2020 to 2023, as we highlighted on Slide 11, that's added about just over $1 billion worth of revenue uplift, which is outstanding. So even on small volumes, it can be a major impact on the revenue side. We're happy that, that's going to step up here in '25 and '26 as Corpus Christi brings on their Stage 3, and that will increase approximately to 720 MMBtu under a couple of different gas sales agreements that are outlined on that slide. And then as we've talked about last quarter, we made it yet another -- and I would call this countercyclic agreement because an agreement like this hasn't been done in North America for quite some time, but we actually have a Brent link now gas sales agreement. When we think about a percentage of our portfolio that we would necessarily like to have exposed to international, I'm not sure if we have a set percentage that we publicize right now because it really is dependent on the types of agreements and the marketing structures that we see available at the time. But ultimately, our strategy is to get more of our gas exposed to diverse market and to get our gas kind of offshore and exposed to the international markets.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Yacob for closing remarks.\nEzra Yacob: We appreciate everyone's time today. Thank you to our shareholders for your support and especially thanks to our employees for delivering another exceptional quarter.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded.

            "content": "Thanks, Anne. I'd like to first thank our employees for their outstanding execution this quarter. Your dedication to and focus on operational excellence extends our momentum from the first quarter and puts EOG in great position to finish the year strong and deliver exceptional value to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we beat targets across the board, including production volumes, per unit operating costs and CapEx. Oil volumes came in above target due to a couple of drivers. Production in our foundational Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford plays is outpacing our forecast due to better well performance on a collection of packages. Also, our base production performance continues to improve due to the application of proprietary EOG technology. Over the last several years, we have developed in-house artificial lift optimizers for several functions, including gas lift, plunger lift and rod pump operations. These state-of-the-art optimizers use algorithms to automate the set points of artificial lift and cost factors that allow for real-time adjustments to maximize production and reduce interruptions of third-party downtime. These cross-functional efforts by our production, marketing and information systems teams continue to improve and pay dividends. The final driver of our second quarter volume beat was timing. We were able to bring online a package of wells a full month earlier than anticipated. As a result of volume performance beats to date and updates to our full year forecast for Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford production, we are increasing our annual volume guidance by 1,800 barrels of oil per day and 10,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids. The volume uplift helps lower our per unit cash operating cost guidance for the full year, as well as generates additional free flow. Total well costs are trending in line with our expectations and resulting in a low single-digit year-over-year decrease. Driven by both moderate market deflation and drilling efficiency gains, we are seeing these cost improvements across our entire multi-basin portfolio. Regarding service costs, depletion is playing out as we had forecasted at the start of the year. Spot prices for certain services have trended lower, while high-spec rigs and frac equipment remain relatively stable. We have secured 50% to 60% of our service costs with contracts in 2024, primarily for high-spec high-demand services to ensure consistent performance throughout our program. By securing these resources, we're able to focus on sustainable efficiency improvements to progress each one of our plays at a measured pace. In our foundational Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford plays, Operational efficiencies are driven primarily by longer laterals, improving drilled feet per day. Longer laterals allow for more time being spent drilling downhole and less time moving equipment on the surface. In addition, the more we extend laterals, the more benefit we derive from our in-house drilling motor program. EOG motors drill faster and are more reliable, which becomes more impactful on our drilling performance as lateral length increases. In the Eagle Ford, we are on target to extend laterals by 20% on average and the year-to-date results has been a 7% increase in drilled feet per day. In the Delaware Basin, more than 50 wells or nearly 15% of our 2024 drilling program will use 3-mile laterals compared to four 3-mile laterals last year. Year-to-date, the efficiency impact from our 3-mile program in the Delaware Basin is a 10% increase in drilled feet per day. In the Utica Shale, we continue to collect data from our new packages and evaluate production history from existing wells as we test spacing patterns and completion designs across our 140-mile acreage position. Two new well packages, the Northern shadow wells and Southern White Rhino wells, as seen on Slide 12 of our investor presentation, have delivered strong initial results and continue to demonstrate the premium quality of this play. In addition to strong well results, since last quarter, we have added another 10,000 net acres to our Utica Shale position, bringing our total to 445,000, while we continue to make delineation progress, our focus in the near future for Utica development will be on the 225,000 net acres in the volatile oil window, where we have a more comprehensive geologic data set. Our large contiguous acreage position in the Utica lends itself to developing a long-life, repeatable, low-cost play competitive with the premier unconventional plays across North America. For 2024, we are on target to complete 20 net wells in the Utica across our northern, central and southern acreage, which supports a full rig program and enables significant well cost reductions. In Dorado, we continue to leverage the operational flexibility provided by our multi-basin portfolio to moderate and manage activity through the summer. Earlier this year, we decided to defer completions while retaining a full rig program to maintain operational momentum. As a result, the drilling team has achieved a 13% increase in drilled feet per day year-to-date. Maintaining a steady drilling program allows us to capture corresponding efficiencies in advance and improve the play, while we continue to monitor the natural gas market. Gas prices are improving into the second half of the year, and we remain flexible to respond to the market. As the year unfolds, we will continue to maintain capital discipline and leverage the flexibility of our multi-basin portfolio to ensure consistent execution across all operating areas. We also remain highly focused on sustainable cost reductions through innovation, operational performance and efficiency improvements to further drive down our cost structure and expand EOG's capacity to generate free cash flow. Here's Lance for a marketing update. Yes. Thanks, Arun. Well, as we talked about, we've been developing this technology over the last few years. And it's one of the big reasons. Obviously, we had the increase to guidance this quarter, and it really had to do with better base production kind of across the full portfolio. And it has to do with these artificial lift technologies that we're implementing. So for instance, and we've talked about it a little bit, we have a program that optimizes our gas lift. So it will basically monitor and through algorithms iterate how much gas we are injecting downhole to maximize production on the full bank of wells that it's supplying gas to. And then if we ever have any kind of downstream interruptions, it can it can divert gas and move it to the higher producing wells to make sure we're maximizing the production potential through that downtime event and then it can switch back to optimal normal operations. So -- we've done that exact same thing with a plunger lift optimization and then also on rod pump to run exactly how fast the rod pump is working and to optimize the lift of the oil on all of our wells out there. So -- yes, it's been absolutely a big mover, and we've implemented it pretty much around our multi-basin portfolio. And I think you're seeing the benefits of it right now in the base production. And we expect to obviously be moving forward to have less downtime and be able to maintain a better base production as we move into the future. Yes, Steve, this is Jeff. Thanks for the question. When we look at service costs, what we do is we really break them down into a couple of categories. So, we have like our standard services, and then we have what we refer to as like our high-spec services, which is the majority of what we utilize as a company. On the standard kind of rig and frac pricing out there, what we saw as it started to weaken at the second half of last year. And it really varied kind of basin to basin based on activity levels. And the Permian, I would say, definitely had the most resilient pricing for service costs since ahead like over half of the rig activity. So, in general, I would say, since the middle of last year, standard rig and frac prices are down probably 15% to 20%. When you look at some of the support services over that same period, I'd say coiled tubing and wireline costs are probably down 15% and then then workover rigs have reduced about 10%. And just an additional thing that I'd point out is that through the first half of the year, we've really seen those reductions have kind of slowed as has Ezra talked about, with the rig count and the frac fleet count kind of stabilizing. So the big point out there, I'd say, is with the high-spec services that we utilize, we currently see relatively stable pricing and we probably will mostly through the rest of the year. But we have started to see a few areas of moderation and a little bit of spot availability, and it's primarily around the gas plays and outside the Permian. And then as you talked about, we're just locking up to 50% to 60% of our services. The way we do that, our contracting strategy is very strategic to where we stagger out our contracts. So we aren't rolling contracts off all at once. So we're constantly renegotiating new contracts and also renegotiating the spot market to make sure we're taking the best advantage we can of pricing that's out there. Yeah, Leo. This is Jeff. And as Ezra talked about earlier, there's really no change moving forward from what we had talked about last quarter. we're obviously managing the investment timing and it's primarily on the completion side where we just pushed a handful of wells into the second half of the year because we had some flexibility there. And as he said, we'll just be able to monitor those prices through kind of summer and fall and see what happens as we move into the back end of the year. With that, though, yeah, we're going to go ahead and maintain that 1-rig program really with no changes through the rest of the year. I mean the team has just done an exceptional job on building on their existing operational efficiencies. And as Ezra stated, I mean, they're already halfway through the year, they've seen a 13% improvement in their overall footage per day. So, the big thing is, if you look at the program, I mean, it's only a 20, 25 well program right now. We really want to build on that and continue to push the great technical and operational progress that we've made so far. And so we'll continue to do that through the year and stay on course with our current plan and just continue to make the best economic decision for the play as we move forward. Thanks, Paul. This is Jeff. Yes, that's a great question. And with any of our technology that we developed. The beautiful thing about it is it's integrated within EOG with all of our different systems. So it communicates with all the data is getting all of our production data, all the all the pressures, all the flow rates, temperatures, everything real time. And so all that's flowing into the system, and you can see that, which with a lot of other third-party systems, that's not possible. On top of that, it also ties directly into our centralized control rooms, which is in each one of basins that watches our production real-time 24/7. And as these systems are optimizing at the control room can watch it, monitor and make sure that the iterated set points are correct then notify any people in the field real time to be able to go out and check on a well or make any additional changes that need to be done. So really, it has to do with the integration within our systems, it really kind of sets us apart from that aspect. And then on the decline rate side or I should say, at least from a base production and what our forecast is, you always have a certain amount of downtime that goes along with normal operations of wells. And what these optimizers really do is they help minimize that downtime. So instead of having a handful of percentage, you're able to actually knock off a percentage to downtime be able to keep these wells flowing and maximize the production across our multi-basin portfolio."

            "name": "Ann Janssen",
            "content": "Thanks, Ezra. EOG continues to create long-term shareholder value. During the second quarter, we earned $1.8 billion of adjusted net income and generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow on $1.7 billion of capital expenditures. Second quarter capital expenditures finished lower than expected due to the timing of certain indirect and international projects, along with contributions from efficiency gains above what we forecasted at the start of the year. Jeff will discuss these operating efficiencies in a moment. We also paid a $0.91 per share dividend and repurchased 690 million of shares during the quarter. In the first half of 2024, we generated $2.6 billion free cash flow, helping fund cash return to shareholders of $2.5 billion. We have paid over $1 billion in regular dividends and repurchased more than $1.4 billion in stock through the second quarter while maintaining a pristine balance sheet. Taking into account our top-tier full year regular dividend, we have already committed to return $3.5 billion to shareholders in 2024. We are on track exceed not only our minimum cash return commitment of 70% of annual free cash flow, but also last year's cash return of 85%. EOG's commitment to high-return investments is delivering high return to our shareholders. A growing sustainable regular dividend remains the foundation of our cash return commitment and is the best indicator of the company's confidence in its future performance. Special dividends and share repurchases are employed opportunistically to supplement our top-tier regular dividend. Since putting the $5 billion share repurchase authorization in place over two years ago, the fundamental strength of our business has improved as demonstrated most recently by our exceptional second quarter and year-to-date performance. We continue to get better through consistent execution of EOG's value proposition. As a result, over the last several quarters, we have favored buybacks and we will continue to monitor the market for opportunities to step in and repurchase shares throughout the year. Since the authorization has been put in place, we have repurchased nearly 21 million shares, which is more than 3% of shares outstanding at an average price of about $118 per share, totaling about $2.4 billion worth of shares repurchased. Now here's Jeff to review our operating results."

            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. I'll be updating on our strategic infrastructure investments in the Delaware Basin and Dorado, as well as the exciting progress we have made expanding access to premium natural gas markets. First, in the Delaware Basin, our Janus Gas Processing Plant is on schedule to start up in the first half of 2025. This 300 million cubic feet per day plant will be instrumental and lowering our cash operating costs and improving netbacks. The Janus plant will have connectivity to the new Matterhorn Express Pipeline estimated to be in service the fourth quarter of this year. EOG has firm capacity on Matterhorn, which will allow us to move additional residue gas out of Waha to the Katy Houston Market Center. Most importantly, we expect our Waha gas exposure on a total company production basis to be only 5% in 2025. Furthermore, our new Matterhorn capacity already has in place term sales, along with additional downstream connectivity. Next, in our emerging South Texas Dorado natural gas play, Phase 1 of 36-inch Verde Pipeline is in service with safe, consistent operations, and we are on schedule to bring online Phase 2 in the second half of 2024. We are excited that Phase 2 of the Verde Pipelines terminus is the Agua Dulce market hub. While our current cash costs in Dorado are approximately $1 per Mcf, we expect the combination of Verde Phase 2 and the premium markets accessed at Agua Dulce will further expand our margins, positioning Dorado as one of the most competitive, lowest cost and highest return natural gas plays in North America. At Agua Dulce, we have executed agreements for three interconnects directly from our Verde pipeline, including White Water's new ADCC pipeline, supplying Cheniere's Corpus Christi LNG terminal. Enbridge's Valley Crossing pipeline with access to industrial, LNG and Mexico markets and Williams Transco pipeline expansion, the Texas to Louisiana Energy Pathway Project, or TLEPP, reaching entire Gulf Coast corridor, which is illustrated on slide 10 in our investor presentation. TLEPP received FERC approval at the end of June and is currently under construction and expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2025 EOG is contracted for the entire 364,400Btu per day of firm capacity. Through TLEP, we expand our access to a valuable liquid market center that serves robust southeastern power generation and additional future demand. Our capacity on TLEP is in path for supply from multiple EOG assets, including Dorado from our Verde pipeline and the Permian Basin from our capacity on the Matterhorn pipeline. Securing capacity on TLEP is consistent with our broader marketing strategy to diversify our end market options. We continue to expand our access to multiple premium markets, serving customers from LNG to industrials to utilities and more while optimizing our valuable transportation position. Now here's Ezra to wrap up. Yes. Right. And Steve, this is Lance. I think where I might add a little bit additional color too, when you think about how we're differentiated. I just -- it goes back to the culture, too. I think like our marketing teams like we're integrated in with our division operations. I mean our division operations, our marketing team, that's all integrated with our fundamentals. So, when we look at -- we can look at the global markets, as we think about LNG or exporting of our products. But then also when you get to like in-basin fundamentals, we have a strong grasp of that and what we see. And so then that way, we can set up and have multiple markets, and we can get to new markets like we announced with TLEPP that gets to a new premium market for the company to just further strengthen our netbacks long term. So, I'd say all what Ezra put together with his comments and then just the integration that we have internally to, I think, is a real differentiator. Hey, Scott, hey, good morning, this is Lance. Yes, when we look at the Utica, one of the things I like is -- I mean, it was -- it's very consistent. As we think about the early evaluation of the play. One of the things that's unique, again, I know we've commented on this in the past, but when you think about it, I mean, you don't really need a lot of major infrastructure build-out. I mean -- so what we've really been focused on from a marketing, midstream and within our division up there is really just getting the local gathering systems in place and those are both commissioned and online, and we're getting to the markets. I know we've talked a lot about there's just a lot of ample redundant processing capacity. Again, going back to my earlier comment about you don't need to make a lot of real long-term commitments. It's a place where we have measured pace, right? A lot of the acreage is all HBP. We can have a measured pace of production up there. But then from a commitment standpoint with being existing capacity and also very near to a pretty a pretty sizable local demand market on the crude oil side, too. So I think as you think about our strategy from a marketing standpoint, it will be very consistent with our other plays that we've had that have been very early in their development. So we'll be very measured. The crude oil will probably start with lease sales and then we'll kind of look at oil gathering. We're setting up and selling a lot of our crude into the local refineries today that's in that area. So I would say it aligns very much with what we've done in many of our other plays. Scott. No, that's a great question. I think, again, I mean, not to kind of go back to my earlier comments, it's going to be a function of just the pace of the development there. And so commitments, we're going to be very disciplined there. But as you think about the gas markets there, especially at the tailgate from a residue standpoint, into the markets, there's a significant amount of just demand that's there kind of going through the Midwest, you have a lot of interstate connectivity. It's an extremely liquid market. So I think we're going to be pretty disciplined there, and I've been using that word quite a bit, but it's just not a need to really reach too further downstream. And then as you think about the NGL markets, there's a lot of -- it's a little bit different than other plays in that you have a lot of the local fractionation is kind of there within the state, right? And so a lot of the purity is being exported. So we're kind of already kind of participating in some of those aspects as well, just because that's some of the natural markets avenues for the products there on NGLs, Scott. Hi, Charles, good morning. Thanks for the question. This is Lance. We could probably spend 30 minutes on that question, but I think Ezra is going to kick me over here if I spend too much time. But I'd say I talked earlier, one of the questions kind of related to just the marketing strategy and the integration that we have and we think about like the markets. And was something that we looked at as you asked the genesis of that. I mean that started all the way back in kind of 2022, right? And so we saw kind of that station 65 when you look kind of into that market was likely going to be very much premium market long-term. And so we worked alongside Williams there, went out for their open season, and we're able to capture all the capacity there through our precedent agreement. So that took a lot of time, I mean, I think you really have to have that foresight and then looking forward like into the markets. And then I think other thing I really want to capture is just that is all in path right, Charles. So I mean, when you think about like South Texas all the way through our Eagle Ford asset, all the way up into the Gulf Coast market. I mean, we can kind of capture everything, the Delaware Basin with our existing transport, our new transport that we're going to have on Matterhorn, all that that kind of gets in the path can kind of get into that market. So that's a little bit of that all came together because, yes, you have a lot of these pipes that are coming in to the Gulf Coast. And so as you've seen on some of our slides that we have there, especially related to gas sales agreements, you have to have end markets on the other side. So we've been very forward thinking there. You can see the ramp-up that we have in terms of other term sales that we have. So you need to have the transport position, Charles, but then you also need to be thinking about having strategic sales on the other side. And I think that's another thing that really differentiates us that we've got that in place now and then also looking forward."

            "name": "Keith Trasko",
            "content": "Yes. This is Keith. On the well results so far, the recent ones, we're very pleased overall, I feel like we're making great delineation progress. Some of the key learnings so far, White Rhino, that is our prospects down the south, the performance we're seeing to date meeting expectations has a little bit lower BOE IP30. That was something we were expecting because of a little bit of thinner reservoir down there, but it really benefits from the strategic mineral ownership which really enhances the returns by voting the royalties down there. That has a really big financial impact. The Shadow package that we just recently brought on, that's an offset to the Timberwolf's. We're seeing consistently strong results at tighter spacing there. We did a 700-foot spacing test there versus 1,000. Spacing overall, I'd say, so far so good. We're excited about the consistency so far there. We're going to keep incorporating data, as future development decisions go there. But we're still early in the play. We need a little bit longer production history. We look at a lot of different things as far as the two- and three-stream production, the pressure, we're taking a lot of real-time measurements, choke schedules, those sorts of things. And we expect this basin will probably change across the play based on geology. It's just a really large acreage position. But I'd say, with our learnings, we're constantly bringing those into our decisions. We are really pride ourselves on not getting into manufacturing mode and instead kind of developing the acreage package by package, integrating the latest data and learnings trying to maximize returns and the value capture. Yeah, this is Keith. I'd say they've met our internal expectation. We're expecting performance to vary over the 445,000 net acre position with the 140-mile span of it. We've been focused on our activity on the 225,000 net acres that we have in the volatile oil window? And we see changes in geology along there. We see we're going to have different spacing in different areas, different type curves in different areas, but we are constructive on the play overall everywhere that we've tested, and we think the variation that we're seeing is within the norm. This is Keith. So as far as how the -- I think the -- as far as how the rates are evolving question and talk a little bit about, like the product mix. So our IP30s are heavily oil weighted, heavily liquids weighted. We do see that in a lot of combo plays. So expect that early on, and we've seen that across all the well packages we have in the north and south. So we still estimate like a 60% to 70% liquids mix for the UR product. And so I'll tie back to a well that has a little more production history, which is the Timberwolf. So Timberwolf and also the Xavier package, that IP30 was around 55% oil cut. Those have been on for about a little over six months now, and we see closer to a 50% oil cut right now. So you see it moderate, but it's not a large drop overall. As far as how long to determine if the spacing is a success? It's going to vary in different places, but we just want to see more production data on the, I'd say, at least six months, nine months or so. And compare that to the data set that we have on some of our older packages, Timberwolf, Xavier, et cetera, and just see how they hang in there, see how the pressures look, et cetera."

            "content": "Thanks, Pearce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered exceptional second quarter results, reflecting outstanding execution by our employees throughout our multi-basin portfolio. We earned $1.8 billion of adjusted net income and generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow. Every metric, production volumes, CapEx and per unit operating costs beat targets, driving another quarter of excellent financial performance. Our outstanding results year-to-date allow EOG to update our full year forecast for liquids production, cash operating costs and free cash flow. As seen on slide 5 of our investor presentation, we increased our target for full year 2024 total liquids production by 11,800 barrels per day. Increased production, coupled with a modest increase to forecasted operational efficiencies reduces per unit cash operating costs by $0.15, driving a $100 million increase to our forecasted free cash flow to $5.7 billion for the full year at the same strip prices of $80 oil and $2.50 natural gas. Illustrating the benefits of EOG's unique culture and decentralized structure. There wasn't one single operation or play that drove our second quarter out performance. Our decentralized operating teams utilize technology and apply innovation across our portfolio of assets to improve unit costs, well costs and well productivity. We made gains in both drilling and completions and every asset contributed. Our foundational Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford plays as well as our emerging Wyoming Powder River Basin, South Texas Toronto and Ohio Utica shale plays. The strength and depth of our multi-basin portfolio of premium assets is a tremendous advantage, and our focus on premium drilling means each of these assets competes against our premium price deck, measuring direct well investments against a $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas price for the life of the assets. That capital discipline provides EOG the flexibility to invest thoughtfully across all of our assets to support the pace of operations that is optimal for each individual asset to continue improve. We can adjust to dynamic market conditions such as the broader macro environment and basin-specific economic factors. As a result, we don't rely on any one basin, any one product or any one marketing outlet to drive our company's success. Capital discipline is core to EOG's value proposition, evidenced by our ability to generate free cash flow for eight years in a row and is what drives our ability to deliver the consistent performance that our shareholders have come to expect and to create long-term shareholder value through the cycle. EOG's outstanding and consistent operational and financial performance positions us to deliver on our cash return cash return commitments in 2024. Our strategy continues to be grounded in our regular dividend, which has never been suspended or reduced in 26 years and supplemented with special dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. Our disciplined and balanced investment in foundational plays, emerging assets, and strategic infrastructure, all supported with a pristine balance sheet is laying the path to increase near and long-term free cash flow. The overall macro environment remains constructive. Global oil demand continues to increase after a seasonally soft first quarter and is in line with our forecast. As anticipated, domestic oil supply growth has moderated since last year as a result of consolidation in the industry and reduced drilling and completions activity stemming from industry capital discipline. Activity levels, as reflected in rig count indicate continued lower oil production growth through at least mid-2025. We expect Lower 48 U.S. supply to exit 2024 at roughly the same level as year-end 2023, with only modest gains to total U.S. oil supply from offshore -- as offshore production increases. Regarding North American natural gas. During the second quarter, inventory levels move closer to the five-year average, and we expect this trend to continue due in part to supply curtailments and increasing year-over-year demand. We remain optimistic on the long-term outlook for gas demand beginning in 2025, as a result of additional LNG capacity coming online and continuing increases in demand from electricity generation. We will continue to prudently manage our Dorado activity as the current environment continues to highlight the importance of being a low-cost supplier of natural gas with access to multiple diverse markets. This quarter, we have further expanded our marketing outlets, capturing additional interstate pipeline capacity to deliver natural gas to demand centers in the Southeastern U.S. In a moment, Lance will provide details on this exciting opportunity as well as updates on our ongoing infrastructure projects. EOG's performance this quarter can be summed up as exceptional operational execution drives exceptional financial performance, resulting in more volumes and lower per unit operating costs for the same CapEx, yielding higher free cash flow for the year. Anne is up next to provide an update on financials and cash return to shareholders. Here's Ann. Thanks, Lance. I'd like to note the following important takeaways. EOG has delivered another outstanding quarter. Strong employee-driven operational performance produced strong financial performance. Our multi-basin asset teams continue to drive innovation and increase capital efficiency, not only on new wells, but by applying technology to our base production. We are delivering more volumes and lower per unit costs for the same CapEx resulting in higher free cash flow for the year. Capital allocation across our foundational plays, emerging assets and strategic infrastructure is delivering strong near-term free cash flow while also laying a path to future free cash flow generation. EOG continues to expand an already diverse marketing strategy. Following our announcement of a new Brent-linked gas sales agreement earlier this year, this quarter, we have announced additional natural gas pipeline connections further reducing our exposure to in-basin differentials and exposing us to multiple demand centers. And lastly, EOG continues to deliver on its cash return commitment. While our regular dividend is the foundation of our cash return strategy, we are well positioned to continue delivering additional cash return through share repurchases and special dividends, supported with the strength of our balance sheet and low-cost operations. Including our annual regular dividend and share repurchases in the first half of the year, we have already committed to $3.5 billion in cash return and are well positioned to exceed our minimum cash return commitment. Thanks for listening. We'll now go to Q&A. Yes, Arun. This is Ezra. Let me start the last part of your question there, and then I'll hand it off to Keith Trasko for a few more of the details on the Utica play. What I'd say in the Utica overall is that we're very happy with the results that we've seen to date. The Southern wells, the White Rhino's that we've talked about are right in line with the expectations in Northern Wells are consistently strong results and very repeatable. So ramping up the Utica, I mean, it's going to be like any other play that we have in our portfolio. We want to invest in it at the right pace so that we can continue to learn and embed those learnings into the next well, and Keith will mention some of those learnings here in a minute. Ultimately, as we do continue to delineate and invest more capital out there, it's going to be at a level of reinvestment that really reflects the maturity of that asset. And when we do that across our multi-basin portfolio, that's when we really start to drive down the cost of all plays and expand the margins at the corporate level. Yeah. Thanks, Neil. Appreciate the question, the opportunity to talk a little bit about the macro. If we started a little bit more of the broad level, I think what we're seeing is global demand is increasing year-over-year, essentially in line with our expectations, which is quite a bit less than 2023 over 2022. Even China, I'd say that has a lot of questions China demand is even kind of in line, demand is in line with our expectations the year. For us, on US supply, I think we've talked about on previous earnings calls for crude, we're looking -- we feel somewhere between 300,000 and 400,000 barrels a day annually would be the increase. In total liquids maybe closer to 500,000 barrels a day. When you look at what's happening in the Lower 48 specifically, as I said in the opening remarks, we think from December to December, it will be relatively flat. We've had relatively flat DUC counts for the past months. And even though, as you're highlighting, there's -- everybody seems to be reporting on the margin, some increased operational efficiency, it's really rig count that's remained flat and then completion spreads that have remained flat as well. And so when we roll all that up, we continue to see not only the effects of consolidation in the industry, but just overall industry discipline really being the drivers of that more moderate US growth. And we think that will continue not only into 2025, but really for the next few years moving forward. Immediately, as I discussed with the current rig counts where they have been for the last eight, nine months, and where they look to be finishing the rest of this year at, that should drive moderate, potentially even less growth year-over-year than what we're seeing this year. And the last thing I think I'd point out is just the amount of decline. The US has grown so much in the last decade on the oil side and many of those barrels have been switched out from conventional resources into obviously more unconventional resources that come with a bit of a steeper decline. And so after years and years of growing, the US is finally looking at a spot where we have a very steep decline year-over-year as a country that needs to be filled in before new barrels can actually add to the growth. And those are the kind of key metrics that we continue to look at. But ultimately, it starts in the field at the asset level, looking at the activity and the capital efficiency of the plays. Neil, it's another good question. We -- at this point, Inventory levels are clearly above the 5-year average. And commensurately -- commensurate with that, the natural gas price is below the 5-year average. I will point out as we saw at the beginning of 2024, inventory levels can react very quickly on weather, specifically winter weather. But at this point, we do foresee that the inventory overhang will continue into 2025. I don't think we're alone with that idea. But we do forecast that we should bring down inventory levels to the 5-year average throughout 2025, assuming kind of a normal winter. And that's not only due to the increase in demand throughout the year from LNG and increased electricity demand. Recently -- certainly didn't help, but this summer, we did experience some off-line demand in LNG. But even with that, overall, we're still seeing an increase in year-over-year domestic demand. I think electricity is trending on about a 4.5% increase year-over-year and so all those things continue to be positive in the longer term. So specific to what we're talking about in 2025, we haven't -- we're not prepared today to talk about 2025. I'm sure heading off a question that probably comes up later on the call with that. But what I'd say is we are actively managing our Dorado program. We've done that last year, and we did that this year. Longer term, as I said, we do expect we're very bullish on pricing through there. And so we are managing the Dorado program to align with demand. We prefer to manage Dorado on the upfront kind of investment side. I think Jeff mentioned in the opening remarks, the benefits we've seen of running a consistent rig program there, increased drilled feet per day by 13% year-over-year. I think if you look at the past 2 years, it's closer to 30% over the past 2 years. But then once we get the gas molecules online, as Lance mentioned, we do have a low cash operating cost of $1 per Mcf. That's a dynamic number as we sit here today. And so that gives us a lot of confidence and flexibility on how to invest and how to think about Dorado going forward. Steve, this is Ezra. I appreciate the remarks there and the question. Our marketing team is something we're extremely proud of and what we think is a real competitive advantage especially in a multi-basin portfolio a company such as ours. So, just maybe a few remarks by me, and then I'll hand it off to Lance to give some more details on it. Our overall marketing strategy, the first thing we always think about is really the netback pricing. And so taking on additional transportation is not a negative thing if it's getting you into premium markets, either for oil or gas. We like to have flexibility as we've talked about. Diversification, with access to multiple markets. We love to have control, where we get firm capacity from the wellhead to sales points. And then the duration. We've had times in the past where we've committed to long-term commitments, and we realize that's not what we want to do. We want to minimize those long-term kind of high cost commitments and really invest in with good partners that understand that we're trying to align our commitments with how -- we think about our growth of the individual assets. And we're consistently challenging the marketing team to think about being a low-cost operator. And that's also how we invest in some of these strategic infrastructure projects is what will they do for us over the long term with margin expansion. Yes, Paul, this is Ezra. I think you broke up there just for a second. So I'm not sure if you're asking about the Bakken, Dorado or Utica, but obviously... Yeah. Thank you, Paul. So yes, with Drato, I think the biggest thing to continue to think about with any gas play, and for us, the dominant one is Drato. And you can see right now in the current environment, how volatile gas prices are is you've got to be committed to being the low-cost supplier. You've got to be a low-cost operator on the gas side because as we all know, the margins are pretty skinny, you can make up with it with low operating costs, gas is easier to operate in liquids. But then you need to make up for it with volumes. And then the second piece of it is you've got to be exposed to diverse markets because the volatility of gas means that you'll have arbitrages come and go very quickly. And if you've got the gas they're exposed to the market, you can capture those. If you try chase those arbitrages much like we saw in 2022 and 2023, by the time you can try to get your gas in position to capture an arbitrage, it might be gone. So those are the two things that we really focus on. In general, when you start talking about capital allocation to it, those comments you should read into is why we've continued to stick with a rig activity down there, kind of a minimal level of activity. so that we can continue, as Jeff highlighted, to learn, embed those learning's in the very next well and continue to be confident that when we see the emerging demand hit, which is coming in next few years with a lot of the LNG coming online, we'll be in a position to be able to bring to market, low cost reserves -- low-cost gas reserves. Now on the -- that's on the drilling side. On the completion side, we do have a lot of flexibility there. A great way to kind of overspend is if you're bringing in a frac spread and sending it out of the basin and bringing it back picking up water lines, laying them back down and things like that. So that's why we try to keep a drilling rig going, as I've talked about in the past, that's kind of the first hurdle to capturing economies of scale. Then the second one is trying to get your packages lined up. So when you bring a completion spread in, you can actually keep it for a significant number of wells and bring that on. What we look for in general to when we could take that next step. It's not only internal learning's, it's not only the returns that we're generating. But it is also with respect to the macro market. As I said on a previous question, the price essentially follows inventory levels or it's very lined out with that. We're below the five-year average right now on pricing and above the five-year average on inventory levels. So inventory levels are a big driver of what we're looking for. But then we're also cognizant of the supply and demand fundamentals for really North America or really just the US. And again, what we see is a lot of increased demand coming in the next few years. You have 10 to 12 Bcf a day arguably under construction right now that should be on really beginning throughout 2025. And then in addition to that, as you look at the back half of the decade, I think on the last earnings call, we highlighted our forecast for potentially another 10 to 12 Bcf a day of demand increasing from things like electricity generation, coal power plant retirements, just an increase in Mexico exports and then finally, just overall industrial demand growth. So we really look at it internally. Our ability to generate higher returns and embed our learnings, so that we're investing at the right pace. And externally, we look at supply demand and ultimately, the inventory levels, Paul. Yes, sir, Doug, it's good to hear from you again. Yes, Doug, I appreciate that. I think everything you're saying is correct. It's how we feel about it, too. geologically, we're doing a great job fearing out. I will point out the only caveat, I'd maybe make is we have, as Jeff pointed out, concentrated right now in in the volatile oil window. So, roughly 225, 000 out of the 445,000 acres. But you can see our confidence the fact that we continue to put -- we continue to put together some leased acreage as we increase the footprint about 10,000 acres. And it's not overly complicated, Doug. We've got multiple packages now in the north, and we're seeing consistently strong results. So, I would say we're feeling very confident there in the North. Certainly, as Keith and Charles were speaking about, we're not 100% satisfied with a spacing number if you wanted to get down that path. But in any North American shale play, you know as well as I do, the spacing is going to -- it's going to be between 600-foot and 1,000-foot spacing, probably on average, depending on the play. And then in the South, we only have one package really with any amount of data on there. So, we're a little bit further behind on delineation down there, even though that package did come online with our expectations. So, it's too early to talk about 2025, but just to call back, we have -- basically, we're planning on this year doubling the amount of wells to sales over what we did in 2023. And I think you're spot on, Doug, that we are seeing to-date with the early-time wells that we have, we're seeing that it's competitive with parts of the Permian Basin. Yes, Doug, I appreciate that. We have -- as you've seen, we've got Slide 11 in our deck that kind of highlights what we've done with our gas sales agreements to expose us to pricing diversification, including the international. I'd point out, Doug, the biggest thing is when we entered into these agreements, as you'll recall, we entered -- we started negotiations and really entered into most of these and kind of a counter-cyclic time period. And so the first thing to keep in mind is, when we look at these opportunities, we want to make sure that we're being a low cost -- we're entering into a lower cost contract or gas sales agreement that's going to provide us with upside exposure. And then in the sales agreements that we've done to date, we feel like it limits our exposure to risk as well. One reason that we're able to enter into some of these agreements is just because of to be perfectly honest, the size and scale of what we've captured, mainly at Dorado, but also across other basins as Lance has talked about. So right now, as you pointed out, we're only really selling about 140 MMBtu per day that gets exposed to the uplift of JKM pricing. But from 2020 to 2023, as we highlighted on Slide 11, that's added about just over $1 billion worth of revenue uplift, which is outstanding. So even on small volumes, it can be a major impact on the revenue side. We're happy that, that's going to step up here in '25 and '26 as Corpus Christi brings on their Stage 3, and that will increase approximately to 720 MMBtu under a couple of different gas sales agreements that are outlined on that slide. And then as we've talked about last quarter, we made it yet another -- and I would call this countercyclic agreement because an agreement like this hasn't been done in North America for quite some time, but we actually have a Brent link now gas sales agreement. When we think about a percentage of our portfolio that we would necessarily like to have exposed to international, I'm not sure if we have a set percentage that we publicize right now because it really is dependent on the types of agreements and the marketing structures that we see available at the time. But ultimately, our strategy is to get more of our gas exposed to diverse market and to get our gas kind of offshore and exposed to the international markets. We appreciate everyone's time today. Thank you to our shareholders for your support and especially thanks to our employees for delivering another exceptional quarter."

[Operator Instructions].\n I would like to turn the call over to the Investor Relations Vice President of EOG Resources, Mr. Pearce Hammond. Please go ahead, sir. \nPearce Hammond: Good morning. And thank you for joining us for the EOG Resources First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. An updated investor presentation has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website and we will reference certain slides during today's discussion. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning later today.\n As a reminder, this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings.\n This conference call may also contain certain historical and forward-looking non-GAAP measures definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures and related discussion can be found on the Investor Relations section of EOG's website. In addition, some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves as well as estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines.\n Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, President; Jeff Leitzell, Chief Operating Officer; Ann Janssen, Chief Financial Officer; Keith Trasko, Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production; and Lance Terveen, Senior Vice President, Marketing.\n Here's Ezra. \nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Pearce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. EOG is off to a great start in 2024, both delivering value directly to our shareholders and investing in future value creation. Primary drivers of that value are EOG's commitment to capital discipline operational excellence and leading sustainability efforts, all underpinned by our unique culture.\n Strong first quarter execution from every operating team across our multi-basin portfolio has positioned the company to deliver exceptional returns. Production and total per unit cash operating costs beat targets, driving strong financial performance during the quarter. We earned $1.6 billion of adjusted net income and generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow. We paid out more than 100% of that free cash flow through our peer-leading regular dividend and $750 million of share repurchases.\n EOG's operational execution continues to translate into strong returns and cash flow generation. Our robust cash return to shareholders continues to demonstrate our confidence in the outlook and value of our business.\n Quarter after quarter, we have delivered outstanding operational performance in our core assets while also driving forward progress in our emerging plays. We have built one of the deepest, highest return and most diverse multi-basin portfolios of inventory in the industry.\n The most recent addition to our portfolio is the Utica combo play, a textbook example of our differentiated approach. Capturing highly productive rock through our organic exploration and leasing efforts is the primary way of expanding our premium inventory with a low cost of entry to drive healthy full cycle returns. Adding reserves at lower finding and development costs drive down DD&A and lowers the overall cost basis of the company. The result is continuous improvement to EOG's company-wide capital efficiency.\n Our track record of successful exploration, strong operational execution and Applied Technology has positioned the company to create shareholder value through industry cycles.\n The oil macro environment remains dynamic, but is overall constructive, and we anticipate that certain drivers will limit oil prices to a relatively narrow band this year. In the first quarter, global demand performed as expected and is on trend to increase throughout the year, led by a strong U.S. economy.\n And while U.S. production surprised to the upside in 2023, several developments have altered the U.S. supply outlook this year. Rig counts have remained flat over the past 8, 9 months, and oil drilled but uncompleted or DUC inventory has been drawn down. Current activity levels combined with M&A in the public and private sectors should lead to more moderated U.S. growth this year.\n Globally, spare capacity has kept inventory levels around the 5-year average to start the year and we forecast these barrels returning to the market throughout the second half of the year and aligned with growing demand. Overall, the result is a strong operating environment for a low-cost and returns-focused producers such as EOG.\n And while we expect the natural gas market to remain soft through the end of this quarter, much like last year, we expect it to strengthen through the second half of the year and are managing our Dorado program to align with demand. Longer term, we expect an additional 10 to 12 Bcf a day of demand for LNG feed gas and another 10 to 12 Bcf per day of demand from several areas, including overall electrification, exports to Mexico, coal power plant retirements and other industrial demand growth. So the outlook for North American natural gas by the end of this decade is bullish, both for the industry and in particular, for our Dorado dry gas play which has advantaged access to the Gulf Coast and pipeline infrastructure.\n We look forward to participating in the emerging LNG demand through our diverse sales agreements to grow from 140,000 MMBtu per day today to 900,000 MMBtu per day over the next 3 years. Through EOG's differentiated approach to organic exploration, the utilization of technology to improve operational efficiencies, vertical integration of certain parts of the supply chain and our diverse marketing strategy, EOG remains focused on being among the highest return lowest cost and lowest emissions producers, offering sustainable value creation through the cycles.\n Ann is up next to provide an update on our forecast and 3-year scenario. Here's Ann. \nAnn Janssen: Thanks, Ezra. Given the recent strength in commodity prices, we have updated our 2024 forecast to reflect $80 oil and $2.50 natural gas for the remainder of the year and now expect to generate $5.6 billion of free cash flow for the full year.\n Considering both share repurchases executed during the first quarter and our annualized regular dividend we have already committed to return about $2.9 billion this year, which represents more than 50% of that free cash flow, so we are well on our way to return a minimum of 70%. And while cash return exceeded free cash flow during the first quarter, we continue to view our return commitment on an annual basis.\n During the first quarter, we repurchased 6.4 million shares for $750 million, averaging about $118 per share. Since we began using our buyback authorization at the start of last year, we have bought back more than 15 million shares or nearly 3% of shares outstanding for an average price of about $115 per share. To date, that totals about $1.7 billion worth of shares. We will continue to monitor the market for opportunities to step in and repurchase shares throughout the year.\n Last quarter, we provided a 3-year scenario to illustrate EOG's expanded capacity to generate free cash flow and earn a strong double-digit return on capital employed to create future shareholder value. This quarter, we provided an additional price scenario to illustrate our expanded free cash flow potential over the next 3 years by assuming similar commodity prices as the past 3 years. From 2021 through 2023, oil averaged $80 and natural gas averaged $4.25. Over that 3-year time frame, we generated $18 billion of free cash flow. Applying those same commodity prices to our forecast for the next 3 years, we would expect to generate $21 billion of free cash flow. That's 17% more cumulative free cash flow than the prior 3 years at the same price deck.\n Robust cash returned to shareholders, supported by substantial free cash flow stems from EOG's strong operational execution by focusing on well performance, sustainable cost reductions and maximizing full cycle returns through organic exploration and disciplined growth EOG has driven a step change in our financial performance and capacity to create significant value for our shareholders.\n Now here's Jeff to review operating results. \nJeffrey Leitzell: Thanks, Anne. I'd like to first thank all the employees for a great start to the year with safe and efficient operational execution. Our first quarter volumes and total per unit cash operating costs beat targets while capital was in line.\n For the year, our capital forecast remains $6.2 billion and delivers 3% oil volume growth and 6% total production growth. We continue to expect that capital this year will be slightly more weighted in the first half, driven by the timing of our investments in the 2 infrastructure projects that we provided details on last quarter. These projects include the Janus gas processing plant in the Delaware Basin and the Verde pipeline that will serve our South Texas Dorado play, both highlighted on Slide 10 of our investor presentation.\n By the end of the second quarter, we expect to be on pace to have spent about 56% of our $6.2 billion capital plan. While our oil production and capital plan for the full year remains unchanged, we are actively managing activity in our Dorado asset, which is reflected in our second quarter natural gas production guidance published yesterday.\n As discussed last quarter, we moderated activity in Dorado this year in response to a weaker natural gas market and are now leveraging additional flexibility to delay well completions and manage volumes through the summer. However, we will continue to pursue a balanced development approach with this asset, which includes operating a full rig program throughout the year. This will help maintain operational momentum, capture corresponding efficiencies and continue to advance and improve the play while we continue to monitor the natural gas market.\n We remain constructive on the long-term gas outlook for the U.S., supported by LNG, power generation demand and the growing petrochemical complex on the Gulf Coast. We are especially pleased with Dorado's place in the market as one of the lowest cost supplies of natural gas in the U.S. with an advantaged location and emissions profile.\n With regards to service cost market, bids for standard spot services have been trending lower, which is consistent with our expectations of seeing some deflation this year. For high-spec rigs and frac fleets, we are still observing stable pricing. However, their availability is improving, especially in markets with less activity.\n As a reminder, we have secured 50% to 60% of our service cost in 2024, primarily with our high-spec high-demand services to ensure consistent performance throughout our program. By securing these resources, we're able to focus on sustainable efficiency improvements to progress each one of our plays at a measured pace.\n EOG's operating performance and capital efficiency continues to improve as our cross-functional teams work to drive efficiency gains throughout our multi-basin portfolio. A significant driver of efficiencies this year is longer laterals, which we expect will increase by 10% on average company-wide. The charge is being led in our foundational plays, the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford, Our operating teams in both plays have achieved consistent execution and success drilling and completing longer laterals leading to increased efficiencies, lower per foot well cost and improved well economics.\n In the Delaware Basin, we drilled 4 3-mile laterals in 2023 and have plans to drill more than 50 in 2024. In the Eagle Ford, our 24 plan includes increasing the average lateral length by about 20% to continue to unlock new potential across our 535,000 net acre footprint.\n Moving to the Powder River Basin. Our technical teams continue to make good strides with our balanced development approach between the Mowry and the Niobrara formations. In the Niobrara, we have recently transitioned into package development by applying the learnings we captured while drilling the deeper mile reformation first.\n In our first 3 Niobrara development packages this year, we've been able to increase our drilling footage per day by 25% compared to 2023 averages, while maintaining over 95% in zone targeting. This can be attributed to our refined geologic models and a better understanding of the stratigraphic variation across the play.\n With these continued efficiency gains across our diverse portfolio plays along with stable service costs, our expectations for full year well cost decrease is a low single-digit percentage. After a strong first quarter, EOG is well positioned to execute on its full year plan. Our technical teams continue to drive innovation with a focus on improved recovery, lowering costs and being a leader in sustainability.\n Now here's Keith to provide more color on the Utica. \nKeith Trasko: Thanks, Jeff. We're very happy with the results of our first 3 packages of development wells in the Utica combo play. We now have over 6 months of production data from the first 2, the Timberwolf and Xavier, which continue to outperform our expectations. Daily production rates per well have averaged more than 1,000 barrels of oil NGLs and 4 million cubic feet of gas over the first 6 months. On average, these 7 wells have produced more than 200,000 barrels of oil per well since being brought online in the second half of 2023. We recently brought on our third package, the White Rhino.\n This is our first development package in the southern portion of our acreage. The 4 White Rhino wells drilled at 1,000-foot spacing have been meeting our expectations during their first few weeks of production. Initial production also indicates a slightly higher liquids mix than our Timberwolf and Xavier wells drilled in the north and central parts of the play.\n While our Northern and Central acreage benefits from a thicker Utica, the southern area has better mechanical properties. The southern area also benefits from significant economic uplift associated with the mineral rights we secured across 135,000 net acres. The White Rhino wells add to our growing collection of data points, which includes 18 legacy wells, 4 delineation wells and now 3 development packages, which adds another 11 wells. While we expect to see performance vary across our 435,000 net acre position, well results over the past 2 years in multiple areas confirm high liquids premium productivity through the 140-mile north-south trend of the Utica's volatile oil window.\n On a per foot basis, the cumulative production in the Utica combo play compares favorably with some of the best areas of the Permian Basin with respect to both oil and total equivalents. Our large contiguous acreage position in the Utica lends itself to developing a long-life, repeatable, low-cost play competitive with the premier unconventional plays across North America.\n Our operating team continues to leverage consistent activity to increase efficiencies and drive down well costs. We recently drilled a 3.7 mile lateral on our stable pattern in the South, which is an EOG wide record lateral length. This well is scheduled to come online later this year, and we are excited to continue driving similar efficiencies as we increase our activity across this asset.\n For 2024, we are on target to drill and complete 20 net wells in the Utica across our northern, central and southern acreage, which supports a full rig program and enables significant well cost reductions.\n Now here's Ezra to wrap up. \nEzra Yacob: Thanks, Keith. I would like to note the following important takeaways: First, our differentiated business model focused on exploration and innovation has built one of the deepest highest return and most diverse multi-basin portfolios of inventory in the industry. The Utica, our most recent exploration success will be competitive with the premier unconventional plays across North America; Second, consistent execution in our core Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford assets delivers outstanding operational performance quarter after quarter, while investment in our emerging plays contributes to EOG's financial performance today and lays the groundwork for years of future high-return investment; Third, our robust cash return to shareholders continues to demonstrate our confidence in the outlook and value of our business; Finally, one of EOG's best champions of utilizing innovation to constantly improve the company as our friend and colleague, Billy Helms. Billy recently announced that he will retire at the end of this month.\n In Billy's 40-year career with EOG, he demonstrated a distinctive ability to encourage new ideas from our employees across multiple disciplines, innovative ideas to utilize infield technology, information technology and new processes to drill better wells for lower cost, more safely and with lower emissions.\n He then helped shepherd the very best of those ideas through to execution across the company. Even though well learned, the retirement of a friend and colleague is bittersweet. Best wishes to you, Billy. Thank you for your service to EOG. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today comes from Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI. \nStephen Richardson: Ezra, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the gas outlook, particularly as it regards Dorado. I appreciate that you're moderating activity in the near term. But maybe you could talk a little bit about if the forward curve, it sounds like you all are pretty bullish on demand and the forward curve certainly reflects that -- [ $3.50, $4 ] out on the curve.\n Maybe talk about what could happen in the play in terms of where that one-rig program goes. And maybe also remind us as Verde gets into Phase II, do you all need to drill to fill? Or how do I think about the flexibility up down of that play once the infrastructure is complete? \nEzra Yacob: Yes, Steve, that's a great question. This is Ezra. So you're right, gas, obviously, it's stating the obvious, but inventory levels are very high after 2 consecutive warm winters. But I will highlight in the last 2 years, we've also seen strong demand on the power side during the last 2 summers. And we expect that to obviously continue into this summer. So strong summer demand, coupled with the reduced supply, not only from some operators curtailing but just from the reduction in rig activity we see the potential inventory levels could come off quite a bit in the second half of the year.\n Now that said, overall, we're maintaining flexibility with investment into those gas plays and dominantly what we're talking about is Dorado. I would say, Steve, we really would prefer to keep some rig activity running and really continue to capture the operational efficiencies. It's always difficult when you actually completely shutter a program. Unfortunately, in some of our plays that happened obviously during COVID in 2020. So we'd prefer to continue to capture our learnings and continue having a rig operate in the area.\n But we do have a lot of flexibility on the completion side. And so you could look to us to potentially build some DUCs more so DUCs than necessarily hold back on turn-in lines, although we've done that before as well, but we prefer to be flexible on our completion schedule side.\n As far as commitments to filling the infrastructure, no, Steve, we don't have any of that for us. What's going to really determine the pace of our investment there and when we bring the gas online, it's really a returns-based question. That's one reason that we did, in fact, put the infrastructure in ourselves is it's really in line with our longer-term marketing strategy which, of course, is duration, flexibility, diversity of markets and most importantly, in a situation like this, control. And so we don't have any obligations necessarily to deal with. \nStephen Richardson: Great. And so Ezra, would you, [ hastily ] guess. I appreciate that you've got this downside flexibility in a low price environment, but in a $3.50 or $4 price environment, could we see activity go to 2 to 3 rigs or don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but -- and I appreciate that there's probably efficiencies you want to retain on the upside as well. \nEzra Yacob: Yes, Steve -- the last part you touched on is exactly the right way to think about it. It's the way that we think about it. We don't want to outrun our pace of learning. Now we are very constructive on the longer-term gas forecast for demand in North America. And we've talked about it before. We think Dorado is advantaged, not only with the cost of supply, but really with the geography where it's located, so we can service all the upcoming demand along the Gulf Coast.\n But the thing about a gas play is we're very committed to making sure that this is a low-cost asset. That's the most important thing because while we're constructive on a mid-cycle gas price increasing throughout the rest of this decade, it's easy to see that gas historically has been very volatile because no matter what you need to layer in weather on top of whatever gas supply-demand model you've created.\n And so the most important thing for us is, even in the early days of investing in this place, making sure that we're investing at a pace to optimize the returns and optimize the cost of supply and keep our cost basis low, so that we can continue to have a positive cash flow through some of those skinny times.\n So I'd say we could look to increase the activity I think we've talked in the past of being prepared to increase it with the upcoming LNG and just overall demand. But as far as assigning a hard level to it, Steve, we'll have the infrastructure in place. We have the -- not only the takeaway infrastructure but in-basin, things like sand and water -- water, mines and things of that nature. So we could ramp it up. But you should look at us to ramp it up commensurately with our learning, which would be at a more measured pace. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Securities. \nArun Jayaram: Ezra, you returned over 100% of your free cash flow this quarter, above your 70% target for the year. I was wondering what the signals to the market -- historically, you haven't returned this level of cash flow. So -- outside of the fact that you thought your stock call below $120 was dislocated, any other implications you think to the market from this -- from the buyback activity in the quarter? \nEzra Yacob: Yes, Arun. This is Ezra. I'd say last year, we did return to the market through buybacks and specials and our regular dividend, about 86% of the cash flow. So having higher quarters is not out of line. The big difference, as you highlighted is that it was all biased towards buybacks rather than specials. And that's really been the trend over the last few quarters and I think that trend will probably continue.\n The reason I say that is our business has really strengthened substantially over the past few years, as we've highlighted before, not only in our core assets like the Permian and Eagle Ford, but especially in these emerging plays, Utica, the Dorado, we're just talking about it, even the Powder River Basin. And really, it's -- the entire energy sector, EOG certainly, we think, remains undervalued relative to the broad market. And those are really the big things that provide us confidence to continue buying back our shares.\n In general, I'd say our cash flow allocation priorities remain unchanged. It is focused on the regular dividend. But we will continue to be opportunistic on share buybacks, and we'll use market volatility to our advantage. And we've really been doing that now as we've been in the market repurchasing shares for the past 5 quarters. I'd say we'll continue to evaluate the opportunities as they present themselves on how best to return cash to the shareholders.\n But the feedback that we've received is the shareholders appreciate our approach. And as I said, we've been biased to buybacks for the last couple of quarters. And for the time being, you can certainly see that probably proceeding going forward. \nArun Jayaram: Great. My follow-up, Ezra, based on the 2Q guide, you're spending around 56% of your full year CapEx in the first half. I was wondering how the timing of some of the strategic infrastructure spend you highlighted last quarter, how that's influencing the first half CapEx? And just thoughts on confidence in the hitting the $6.2 billion full year CapEx guide for 2024? \nJeffrey Leitzell: Yes, Arun, this is Jeff. Thanks for the question. What I'd first say is our 2024 plan, it's playing out as we had expected. So everything is in line as far as timing, and we still feel really confident with the total CapEx budget of $6.2 billion.\n You did -- you hit it on the head, and we talked about it in our opening statements, CapEx will slightly be higher there in that first half. at that 56% of total budget, but that's really just due to some standard indirects. And really, those strategic infrastructure spends that we have talked about with the Delaware gas plant and the Verde pipeline there.\n The nice thing about it is both projects are scheduled to come online. The gas plant, we've got planned for the first half of 2025. And the second phase of Verde pipeline is going to come on, hopefully, the back end of this year. we're really excited about it to be able to get to realize that $0.50-plus per Mcf GP&T savings that both those projects are going to bring for the life of the asset. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. \nNeil Mehta: I just love your perspective on the Eagle Ford and Bakken fields entered to more maturity. Some of your peers have talked on this earnings season about different things that they're doing to extend the life and deepen the inventory and just would love your perspective on some of the things you're doing on the ground to drive as much value as we get into the next phase of these assets. \nJeffrey Leitzell: Yes, Neil, this is Jeff again. With the Eagle Ford, we've got a really good, consistent program this year. We're going to be completing about 150 net wells there. And as far as looking at the well performance, everything has been in line and right with our expectations. With any mature asset, you're going to see some productivity degradation. I mean we started out in the East where we had a little bit more prolific geology. And then more recently, we've moved out to the West, where it's slightly lower quality pay, but the key takeaway is we've been able to continue to improve the economics in that play year-over-year. And we've really done that just through -- as you talked about, increasing operational efficiencies and focusing on drilling faster, completing faster with super zippers, longer laterals and cost reductions that have continued to improve the capital efficiency of the play.\n And what I'd say is also one of the big movements that we've had is we're actually increasing the lateral length there in the Eagle Ford, about 20% this year. So -- and you can see the activity might be down just a hair year-over-year, but we've completed the same amount of lateral length as we did in 2023 with those longer laterals. So that's just one of the ways we're really able to drive efficiency there. You can see it in the returns. I mean, really, it's got some of the highest rate of returns over the last 3 years, and we've been drilling in the Eagle Ford for 15 years.\n And then looking over to the Bakken, we are very mature in that resource. Right now, we kind of run a program of about 10 net wells there. Primarily, they're just Three Forks targets and Bakken targets. And really, we're just going in and offset and infilling around some of our existing development. We're staying ahead of depletion. And then also, we've had some areas with limited markets, but we've got some new available capacity, so we're able to bring some additional wells online there.\n So obviously, with a really oily play, the well productivity looks great on there and everything that's coming online is in line with our forecast, and we're excited about those wells this year. \nNeil Mehta: And then Billy, I just want to extend my congratulations to you on your retirement and thanks for the insight over the years. My follow-up is just on the macro, on the oil macro specifically. We've got OPEC meeting coming up here in the next couple of weeks and a lot of uncertainty on both the demand and supply side. So -- just how is this year from a commodity perspective -- oil commodity perspective trended relative to your expectations? And I know you have a big in-house operation looking at the macro. What's the crystal ball telling you, Ezra? \nEzra Yacob: Yes, Neil. Well, I'd start with the fact that Q1, I think, has really played out as most people expected. There is a bit of a pullback in demand there. And that's one thing that had prompted I think, had prompted some of the spare capacity being brought offline. But ultimately, that demand was about 102 million barrels a day. It looks to us and others out there, other models, it looks like demand should strengthen throughout the year. So we have not only seasonal demand picking up here, but also we're seeing underlying strength in the U.S. economy. Also in the China, the Chinese economy, just a little bit, namely on the manufacturing side.\n So ultimately, we see demand reaching a bit above 104 million a day in the back half of the year. And so that's on the demand side. When you think about inventory levels, obviously, first quarters with spare capacity offline, inventory levels have stayed just below that 5-year average, but products really are a bit lower. And so that shapes up for a good -- some good inventory draws potentially in the back half of the year.\n And then really on the supply side, as I spoke about in the opening comments, we think U.S. supply should be pretty moderate. We're in agreement with other estimates of kind of that 300,000 to 400,000 barrel per day growth year-over-year. And that's where we arrive in a model that would indicate we see much of the spare capacity reentering the market throughout the rest of this year. But we'll see how that depends, how that really plays out, as you said, at the next upcoming OPEC meeting. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. \nNeal Dingmann: My first question today, is on your Utica play, specifically looking at the map on Slide 12, it appears you all continue to target more so the eastern side of the volatile window, I'm just wondering. Could you talk about your thoughts maybe on the prospectivity of the black oil window? And if there's just anything that you might see this year that might cause you to change activity in the play for the remainder of the year? \nKeith Trasko: Yes. This is Keith. You're right, we have been delineating mainly north south through the valid oil trend. It's a 140-mile area. The first thing we need to -- kind of on the west is we need to acquire seismic data. We're in the process of doing that. We need to see the degree of structural complexity kind of before we don't -- before we start developing. But geologically, in general, we don't see significant changes in thickness or pay from east to west. On the West, you're going to have a little bit lower maturity, which would equate to less pressure. But in our other plays, such as the Eagle Ford, less pressure reduces the well productivity, maybe a little bit, but it also reduces costs. So your economics are still really comparable to all the other portions of the play.\n And then overall, just on activity level, he asked, we have ramped up to 1 full rig this year. We want to be able to grow at a pace where we can leverage our learnings continue to get better and also drive costs down. We need to keep getting infrastructure in place in the basin like in-basin sand and water reuse. So we are sticking to our 2024 plan laid out last quarter of 20 net wells, and it's a little too early to disclose anything for 2025. But overall, this play really competes with our best place for capital. The other great thing is with the multi-basin portfolio, we don't necessarily need to ramp it up aggressively. We'll just kind of let returns drive that. \nNeal Dingmann: Very good details, Keith. And then just a second quickly on -- look at the supplement Slide 12, I like that slide you talked about just your marketing opportunity is. Statistically, I'm looking at sort of around the oil side, the U.S. oil. Is there opportunities to increase around the export side if opportunities present? Or maybe just talk about the optionality or flexibility you might have around those markets? \nD. Terveen: Yes, Neil, this is Lance. Yes, I think what we like best is just we are advantaged. When you think about just from the supply that we have out of the Delaware Basin, the capacity, the firm capacity that we have that can come into the Gulf Coast. And then the facility that we're down in the Eagle side, it's just -- it's an outstanding facility. They recently just increased the dredging that's there. So we're actually been loading [ DLCCs ] there. So the capability that we have there and our tank position, we've actually been pushing more across the dock into the export markets in the most recent quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. \nScott Hanold: Yes, thanks. A little bit more on the Utica. I appreciate the fact that you guys do not want to outrun your learning curve. But given that. You're demonstrating some pretty good competitive economics with places like the Permian, just big picture, like what needs to happen and what do you need to see for this to be become a more meaningful part of your capital allocation and production going forward? \nEzra Yacob: Scott, this is Ezra. Yes, I think we're very happy with where we're at. It's over a 400,000-acre position. As Keith highlighted, it's 140 miles north to south. And let's be honest, we've got 2 packages on right now. Now the 2 packages are fantastic. They're exceeding what we initially had in our type curves, and they're more than confirming some of our early thoughts on the spacing test. So at this point, everything is going in the right direction.\n As Keith highlighted, to help delineate some of the other acreage that we have, the first step is to -- well, really, the first step was having some of the well-log identification. So really, maybe the second step now is to go ahead and get that seismic and see what the level of complexity is.\n As Keith talked about in his opening comments, we have brought on -- just brought on a package down in the south. Which will prove up -- it's a bit of a different geologic environment down there. It's also an area where we own the minerals, which is very exciting. You guys know the economic uplift that, that can have.\n So overall, I would say that everything is right on pace. We'd like to continue to get some in-basin -- just infrastructure and be able to start to leverage the size and scale that we have. Maybe one way to think about it, Scott, is, in all these early resource plays think about where the Utica is. And maybe it's around where the Permian was in kind of 2012, 2013 time frame. And so that's why when we all talk about not outrunning our ability to learn, the costs that you're putting in the ground today, we think about it as full cycle economics, and they're going to stay with you on the life of this asset.\n We're not at a point where we're in need of increasing the activity here. We've got a very deep high-return inventory across multiple basins, and that's really the big difference. I think our business model has changed as the company has matured, and we've built out that inventory where we don't need to lean in aggressively on any single one asset anymore. We've got the ability with this multi-basin portfolio that we can invest in each of these at a pace that really allows them to improve year-over-year.\n Now we definitely want to bring some of these capital efficiency learnings from the Eagle Ford, the Bakken, the Permian, into the Utica. But we want to do it at a place where we're not -- we don't have the misses on spacing or higher well costs or things that have plagued some of the early learnings in these other resource plays.\n So I wouldn't say we're looking for any major sign or any silver bullet that we're going to turn on a 15-rig program or anything like that, Scott. It's really the -- where our company is at, where we're at in the cycle, and it ultimately comes down to a returns-based decision not at the asset level, but really at the company level as to how to capitally allocate across the portfolio to maximize shareholder value. \nScott Hanold: And before I ask my next question, I want to extend my congrats to Bill as well. Obviously, we all appreciated your insights and expertise over the years.\n And so my follow-up question is, could you all refresh us on Trinidad a little bit? I mean, you obviously have some growth coming there that was planned, but remind us the economics and how pricing is set in that region relative to, say, like, what we're seeing with Henry Hub pricing? \nJeffrey Leitzell: Scott, this is Jeff. Yes, just on the activity in Trinidad. We're currently just running our 1-rig program there and everything is going really smooth. Earlier this year, we completed 2 of our remaining wells there in the Modified U(a) Block successfully. And brought those online. And we're currently drilling and completing a couple of exploratory wells in the SECC block. And then after that, we'll move the rig and we've got a couple of recompletes to do in our Sercan area. And then one more exploration well to finish up the year in TSP area.\n Another note that I'll point to you too is we're also installing our Mento platform. Everything has been on time and looking good there. getting the facilities in place, and that's in an SMR Block. And what that will do is that will really set us up for the program next year. So -- and as far as the marketing side, I'll hand it over to Lance to give a little color. \nD. Terveen: Yes, Scott, we've always been real pleased there in Trinidad, especially when we think about our price realizations and obviously meeting that local demand into the country. So I think you can see even with the price realizations that we had in their first quarter, they were very attractive. So we continue to see that kind of on a go-forward basis. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with RothamKM. \nLeo Mariani: I wanted to just follow up a little bit more on the exploration side. Obviously, you guys seem happy where you are in the Utica. But just wanted to kind of ask in terms of activity levels. Is there other kind of ongoing exploration still this year in some of these U.S. oil stealth plays and perhaps you can just talk about kind of levels or wells? I know you're not going to reveal necessarily any of the specific areas.\n And then just on a related point, obviously, you guys have talked about this exploration being able to kind of drive down the DD&A rates for the company. Happened to notice that your DD&A rate did go up a fair bit here in the first quarter versus where it was in fourth quarter. So maybe you could just kind of wrap it all together and give us some color around that? \nEzra Yacob: Yes. Leo, this is Ezra. I'll start with the exploration and then hand the DD&A details over to Ann for an answer. On the exploration side, yes, we do have some exploration dollars in the budget this year, as we highlighted on the first quarter call. We continue to explore for -- yes, we continue to focus on oil plays. But at the core of it, what we continue to explore for things that are going to be additive to the quality of the corporate portfolio. And that's what you're seeing with the Utica, obviously. So that's a major success for us. We're not exploring for things that are simply just going to add inventory. We really want them to be additive on a returns basis, additive on a cost of reserves or refining and development cost basis, and that's how it contributes into lowering the DD&A rate.\n This year, we are drilling a couple of what I would call initial wells or I hate to call them wildcat wells because these aren't frontier types of activities. These are in basins where there's data and there's been historic production and things like that, but let's call them, the initial wells to test some exploration ideas.\n And then we've still got another stealth player too that are a bit more in, say, a delineation phase, where we've drilled the initial well. We've seen -- we've been encouraged with the initial well results, and we're continuing to test and see if it's going to clear those hurdle rates that I talked about.\n The big thing I'd say is these days are exploration plays in these initial wells I think I've highlighted this before. In the U.S., the way we operate through exploration, there's so much data that we're not really drilling these initial wells and to see if they'll actually produce oil and natural gas. It's not like we're testing whether or not the rock is productive and could we end up with a dry hole. These days, it's really about when we get the oil and gas to surface. Is it what we expected? Is it going to be economic in such a way that it really competes with the existing portfolio? Are we exploring? Have we found something that really commands investment and taking rigs off of another play.\n And I'll hand it over to Ann. \nAnn Janssen: The DD&A, you saw an increase in the first quarter was just due to a onetime prior period adjustment due to some natural gas production being used in our gathering systems. We did come in at guidance level, and you can't expect that DD&A to moderate over the remaining 3 quarters for the year, respecting about $10.50 for the remainder of the year. \nLeo Mariani: And then I just wanted to follow up real quick. Obviously, you guys are pretty optimistic on natural gas kind of laid out some pretty big demand increases over the balance of the decade. You spoke a little bit about 2024, second half continuing to look better. Maybe if I just wanted to focus a little bit more near term. As you look at '25, strips kind of just north of [ $3.50 ] or so. Are you just increasingly bullish on '25? Do you think that strip price is pretty reasonable? Or do you think things can potentially be better than that? I think everyone is kind of on board that demand will be a lot better later this decade, but I just wanted to maybe focus a little bit more on kind of the next year or so. \nEzra Yacob: Yes, Leo, this Ezra. I don't know if I'd call it bullish on '25, but I would say that we're constructive. As I said, we've seen a surprising upside on the amount of natural gas demand for power generation over the last couple of summers, and we continue to think that's going to be true this summer. That -- a big part of that is coupled with coal retirements.\n We also think the pull on natural gas this summer because pricing is soft, will also continue to be great as well. You combine that with the reduction in rig activities over the past 8 months or so, and the fact that operators now are also starting to curtail volumes. We think that's going to bring down the supply side to a point where you could actually make some pretty good progress on those inventory levels in the back half of this year. That with a little bit of feed gas starting to be taken on the LNG. It gives us a little bit of confidence headed into in '25. But you are right, there is a bit of -- there is quite a bit of an overhang right now that we need to see come off starting with this summer. \nOperator: The next question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. \nPaul Cheng: Also I have to apologize, but I want to go back into Utica. If I'm looking at a well cost or that well productivity, what kind of improvement you need in order for you to move from the peso [indiscernible] to the -- or delineation [indiscernible] of the manufacturing or production development now?\n And also that, based on what you can see from your inventory backlog, what is the one that you feel comfortable about the delineation. What is the development program look like whether it's been the number of rig and crew or number of wells that you expect going to come from that on a per year basis. That's the first question. \nKeith Trasko: Yes. Paul, this Keith. So I'll start on the well cost. It's still early on the play that team continues to drive down the cost. We see a lot of room for further efficiencies, the consistent activity this year with 1 full rig has helped that a lot. We like that generally in the area, it's an easier operating environment compared to a lot of our other plays. That's consistent geology. It's a little bit shallower depths. Example of that is our 3.7 mile lateral we just drilled on the [indiscernible].\n We also brought in an e-frac crew for higher pump rates and increased efficiencies. And Overall, we see development costs someday getting to be a little bit lower than the Permian, even on $1 per foot. But the great thing is that this play just has the opportunity to benefit from the learnings of all of our other plays and EOG best practices.\n On the well performance side, we're really happy with the wells as I and Ezra, we kind of already touched on, we see that these compete with the best players in America, very comparable to the Permian on a production per foot basis both in oil and equivalents, really highlighting our differentiated organic exploration strategy.\n The development program as far as rigs and crews and number of wells. It goes back to growing at that pace where we can still learn and just the multi-basin portfolio. We don't necessarily have to ramp this up aggressively. So. \nPaul Cheng: I see. Before I ask my second question, I also want to add my congratulations and best wishes to Billy, thank you for the help over the past several years.\n The second question, I think, is for Ann. This year that you have about $400 million on strategic infrastructure spending. I assume that it's not every year, you will have that. But throughout the cycle, you're always going to have some strategic infrastructure spending, I suppose. So what will be a reason of [indiscernible] based for the cycle assumption for the strategic infrastructure spending and also that add to overall spending level for the infrastructure all along D&C for you guys? \nEzra Yacob: Yes, Paul, this Ezra. Yes, the $400 million of infrastructure, the strategic infrastructure that we've highlighted before, which we couldn't be more excited about because of some of the long-term margin expansion benefits that Jeff highlighted it in the opening remarks. These are projects that, historically, we look for opportunities like this, but they're very rare to present themselves where we can take on infrastructure projects that generate such a compelling rate of return. We've talked about the Verde pipeline is expected to generate about a 20% rate of return uplift. And then on top of that, we get that GP&T savings, a netback uplift of $0.50 to $0.60 per Mcf over the life of the asset.\n Similarly, on Janus, the gas processing plant in the Permian Basin, that one also has roughly an anticipated 20% rate of return. And then on that one, we have a GP&T savings, a net back uplift of about $0.50 an Mcf. If we could continue to find some of these projects with that strong of a return profile and that much value creation for the shareholders over the life of the assets, we would be interested in continuing to do them.\n But to be perfectly honest with you, Typically, those margins get squeezed down to a point where we don't want to do them. It's really more beneficial for a third party to come in and do them. But there are times in the cycle where -- and it seems to happen every 5, 8, 10 years or so, where there ends up being enough margin there where we see the opportunity to go ahead and capture that value for our shareholders. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. \nDerrick Whitfield: Leading on the Utica, it sounds like the southern part of the trend could be advantaged on returns based on the elevated NRIs and potential geology. Could you perhaps expand on the difference you're seeing in the geology between the north and the south? \nKeith Trasko: Yes. This Keith. So yes, it's still early in the play. We're learning more every day about how the geology ties to production. It's going to obviously vary over the 435,000 net acres. But in general, the Utica is thicker in the North. The South is a little bit better pay, but it has better geomechanics and rock properties. That has to do with frac barriers and keeping the frac energy more contained near the wellbore.\n So we expect, as we gather more data, different areas are going to have different type curves. Geology is also going to drive the spacing too. But we're real happy with the rail results in all of the areas. They're exceeding expectations, generating great returns and we're happy so far with these white rhinos that are down in the south.\n So they're still cleaning up. They've gone on for a couple of weeks. We're seeing a little more liquid yield compared to the Timberwolf and Xavier. And you're right, those do have the minerals, they benefit from that, and we'll be able to update you when we have a little more production data. \nDerrick Whitfield: Great. Then bigger picture question on the PRB Niobrara. Assuming further D&C optimization efficiencies based on your progress to date, could this play compete with the Delaware and Eagle Ford over time in returns? \nJeffrey Leitzell: Yes, Derrick, this Jeff. So yes, we've made a lot of really good strides there in the PRB. We started out really focusing in on that deeper Mowry really to refine our geologic models kind of throughout the whole section. And we had good success with the Mowry with that. We went into package development last year, and we saw with package development, a really good uptick in overall productivity there, about 10% in Mowry. So once we accumulate enough data, we went ahead and we're moving up in section in the package development there in the Niobrara. and just really started drilling some wells this year, having really good success operationally, and we'll look to be bringing some of those on later in the year here.\n So in comparison to the Powder and the Permian, I mean, there's not many basins that are going to be like the Permian as far as overall productivity and results. It's just a little bit different. But there are some advantages up there. It's got a really low F&D cost and there's a lot of scale there. Obviously, we've got close to 400,000 acres and we're really just focused in down on the south Powder portion of that. So we've got a lot of expansion that we can take our learnings and we can move it up to the North Powder, which we've had some delineation wells and across the acreage from that aspect.\n So we're excited about it. It's not moving as fast maybe as what the Permian Basin had but we're making really, really good strides. The returns look great on it, and the teams are continuing to make really good improvements from an operational aspect, and we are seeing premium returns on that play. \nOperator: The next question from Nitin Kumar with Mizuho Securities. \nNitin Kumar: Congrats to Bill on the retirement. Thanks for all the help over the years.\n Want to start off on Ezra, some of your peers have talked about refrac and recomplete activity in the Eagle Ford. You obviously have a long history in the basin and obviously are [indiscernible] technology. I just want to ask, what are your thoughts around refracs and could they compete with some of these new players like the Utica and others on economics? \nJeffrey Leitzell: Yes. This Jeff. We obviously keep our finger on kind of what's happening with refracs and that technology out there. We've done tests in the past in multiple basins. And what we really find is just with our robust inventory across our multi-basin portfolio. The opportunity for refracs, we're much better to either go in and offset an existing completion that was maybe poor or lesser or just go ahead and drill a new well in a new section from that aspect.\n And then the other thing that I'd point out is from refrac technology, I think there's still a long ways to go. I mean there's pretty crude approaches. To where you kind of do some Hail Mary fracs or have to install expensive additional casing strings. And you never quite get the productivity uplift that you're looking from an actual new well.\n So no, right now, we see just a lot more potential in our existing inventory in the acreage that we have out there. We will keep an eye on the refrac technology and watch it advance and see if it has application, but we feel that going ahead and drilling a new well or an infill well is a much better investment. \nNitin Kumar: Great. And I guess as a follow-up, we've talked a lot about gas macro today, but you have a pretty strong marketing arm. Are you starting to see demand pull directly from the producer from some of the AI or Mexican exports or any of these kind of tailwinds to gas macro demand that you're hearing about? \nD. Terveen: This Lance. Yes, I mean, it's still pretty early on the AI front. But I'd say when you think about us, you're right. I mean we do have a lot of capability and a lot of reach with the marketing arm. We are very pleased with the execution that we have. We talked a lot -- you heard even Ezra talk about the pillars that we have there with diversification and control the flexibility. All those things provide the reach that we need as we think about our price realizations [ sync ] into the most attractive markets. \nOperator: And our final question comes from David Deckelbaum with TD Cowen. \nDavid Deckelbaum: I just wanted to ask a follow-up just on the Utica, particularly as you fit into some of the analogs and other plays that you've been in, in the life cycle of that exploration and development program. How do you think about testing longer laterals in the Utica specifically over time? Which seems to be a play that's quite amenable to even lateral lengths beyond 3 milers versus attempting to get down your footage cost? Sort of where are we in the theoretical innings there? \nJeffrey Leitzell: Yes, David, this Jeff. We're in the very early innings there. And what I'll say operationally is the Utica sets up, I mean, almost perfectly. It's the efficiency gains that we're able to see there, we're getting better with just about every well. And as Keith had talked about in his opening statements, we drilled our longest lateral there to date at 3.7 miles. Our program right now consistently is 3 miles, and the team plans on continuing to push that out just because we can do one runs in the laterals and stay on bottom longer and not have to trip out of the hole, and we really have no problems operationally completing the wells.\n So I think the play I'm looking forward to is as far as from longer laterals is, yes, we'll continue to push the limits there. We've got a lot of other drivers. It's not just the cost per foot metric we're looking at. There's other movement that we have that we'll be able to lower cost. But I would expect as we continue on with the operational successes we have, we will be drilling longer and longer there in the Utica. \nDavid Deckelbaum: Appreciate that. And just my final question. Just as you think about the incremental few hundred million spent this year on strategic infrastructure, and some other projects along the infrastructure side. How do you think about sort of the forward capital intensity of infrastructure as you continue developing in the '25 and '26 and beyond? Is that a number that should increase with intensity every year just given some of the infrastructure calls that are out there currently? Or is this sort of what you feel is like a steady run rate as a percentage basis? \nEzra Yacob: Yes, David, this is Ezra. Those are fixed projects, the strategic infrastructure that we're talking about. And so the best kind of way to look at it, maybe is to reference that 3-year scenario that we have out there. Now that is not guidance, but it is a scenario that potentially assumes a similar macro environment to what we've seen in the last few years. And what we could do going forward.\n And what you see there is maybe not as much capital intensity, but you see there is an expansion of our cash flow and our free cash flow. And that's really the thing that we focus on. And that's the important thing to keep in mind, when we talk about these strategic infrastructure projects, and it's something I highlighted before is that when you can invest -- we're not aggressively seeking out these strategic infrastructure, these infrastructure projects. But when you have the opportunity to invest in something that offers a very compelling rate of return upfront, and it gives you the margin expansion for the life of the asset. That's definitely an opportunity that we want to grab. So one of the ways that we continue to lower the cost basis of the company. And it's one of the ways that in that 3-year scenario, you see the free cash flow margins expanding. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question session. I would like to turn the call over to Ezra Yacob. \nEzra Yacob: Thank you. We appreciate everyone's time today. I'd like to hand the call over to Billy to wrap up. \nLloyd Helms: Thank you, Ezra, and thanks to all of you for your kind remarks, and I truly have enjoyed the chance to meet all of you and work with you in the past. Let me just add, I've been blessed to be part of this company, and its unique culture for the past 43 years.\n Working beside so many talented people and watching the company grow and to become a leader in the industry. And while I certainly will miss the daily interactions, I take with me incredible memories. And I have great confidence in the leadership team and look forward to watching EOG's continued success. So thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.",

Given the recent strength in commodity prices, we have updated our 2024 forecast to reflect $80 oil and $2.50 natural gas for the remainder of the year and now expect to generate $5.6 billion of free cash flow for the full year.\n Considering both share repurchases executed during the first quarter and our annualized regular dividend we have already committed to return about $2.9 billion this year, which represents more than 50% of that free cash flow, so we are well on our way to return a minimum of 70%. And while cash return exceeded free cash flow during the first quarter, we continue to view our return commitment on an annual basis.\n During the first quarter, we repurchased 6.4 million shares for $750 million, averaging about $118 per share. Since we began using our buyback authorization at the start of last year, we have bought back more than 15 million shares or nearly 3% of shares outstanding for an average price of about $115 per share. To date, that totals about $1.7 billion worth of shares. We will continue to monitor the market for opportunities to step in and repurchase shares throughout the year.\n Last quarter, we provided a 3-year scenario to illustrate EOG's expanded capacity to generate free cash flow and earn a strong double-digit return on capital employed to create future shareholder value. This quarter, we provided an additional price scenario to illustrate our expanded free cash flow potential over the next 3 years by assuming similar commodity prices as the past 3 years. From 2021 through 2023, oil averaged $80 and natural gas averaged $4.25. Over that 3-year time frame, we generated $18 billion of free cash flow. Applying those same commodity prices to our forecast for the next 3 years, we would expect to generate $21 billion of free cash flow. That's 17% more cumulative free cash flow than the prior 3 years at the same price deck.\n Robust cash returned to shareholders, supported by substantial free cash flow stems from EOG's strong operational execution by focusing on well performance, sustainable cost reductions and maximizing full cycle returns through organic exploration and disciplined growth EOG has driven a step change in our financial performance and capacity to create significant value for our shareholders.\n Now here's Jeff to review operating results. The DD&A, you saw an increase in the first quarter was just due to a onetime prior period adjustment due to some natural gas production being used in our gathering systems. We did come in at guidance level, and you can't expect that DD&A to moderate over the remaining 3 quarters for the year, respecting about $10.50 for the remainder of the year."

            "name": "D. Terveen",
            "content": "Yes, Neil, this is Lance. Yes, I think what we like best is just we are advantaged. When you think about just from the supply that we have out of the Delaware Basin, the capacity, the firm capacity that we have that can come into the Gulf Coast. And then the facility that we're down in the Eagle side, it's just -- it's an outstanding facility. They recently just increased the dredging that's there. So we're actually been loading [ DLCCs ] there. So the capability that we have there and our tank position, we've actually been pushing more across the dock into the export markets in the most recent quarter. Yes, Scott, we've always been real pleased there in Trinidad, especially when we think about our price realizations and obviously meeting that local demand into the country. So I think you can see even with the price realizations that we had in their first quarter, they were very attractive. So we continue to see that kind of on a go-forward basis. This Lance. Yes, I mean, it's still pretty early on the AI front. But I'd say when you think about us, you're right. I mean we do have a lot of capability and a lot of reach with the marketing arm.

            "name": "Keith Trasko",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. We're very happy with the results of our first 3 packages of development wells in the Utica combo play. We now have over 6 months of production data from the first 2, the Timberwolf and Xavier, which continue to outperform our expectations. Daily production rates per well have averaged more than 1,000 barrels of oil NGLs and 4 million cubic feet of gas over the first 6 months. On average, these 7 wells have produced more than 200,000 barrels of oil per well since being brought online in the second half of 2023. We recently brought on our third package, the White Rhino.\n This is our first development package in the southern portion of our acreage. The 4 White Rhino wells drilled at 1,000-foot spacing have been meeting our expectations during their first few weeks of production. Initial production also indicates a slightly higher liquids mix than our Timberwolf and Xavier wells drilled in the north and central parts of the play.\n While our Northern and Central acreage benefits from a thicker Utica, the southern area has better mechanical properties. The southern area also benefits from significant economic uplift associated with the mineral rights we secured across 135,000 net acres. The White Rhino wells add to our growing collection of data points, which includes 18 legacy wells, 4 delineation wells and now 3 development packages, which adds another 11 wells. While we expect to see performance vary across our 435,000 net acre position, well results over the past 2 years in multiple areas confirm high liquids premium productivity through the 140-mile north-south trend of the Utica's volatile oil window.\n On a per foot basis, the cumulative production in the Utica combo play compares favorably with some of the best areas of the Permian Basin with respect to both oil and total equivalents. Our large contiguous acreage position in the Utica lends itself to developing a long-life, repeatable, low-cost play competitive with the premier unconventional plays across North America.\n Our operating team continues to leverage consistent activity to increase efficiencies and drive down well costs. We recently drilled a 3.7 mile lateral on our stable pattern in the South, which is an EOG wide record lateral length. This well is scheduled to come online later this year, and we are excited to continue driving similar efficiencies as we increase our activity across this asset.\n For 2024, we are on target to drill and complete 20 net wells in the Utica across our northern, central and southern acreage, which supports a full rig program and enables significant well cost reductions.\n Now here's Ezra to wrap up. Yes. This is Keith. You're right, we have been delineating mainly north south through the valid oil trend. It's a 140-mile area. The first thing we need to -- kind of on the west is we need to acquire seismic data. We're in the process of doing that. We need to see the degree of structural complexity kind of before we don't -- before we start developing. But geologically, in general, we don't see significant changes in thickness or pay from east to west. On the West, you're going to have a little bit lower maturity, which would equate to less pressure. But in our other plays, such as the Eagle Ford, less pressure reduces the well productivity, maybe a little bit, but it also reduces costs. So your economics are still really comparable to all the other portions of the play.\n And then overall, just on activity level, he asked, we have ramped up to 1 full rig this year. We want to be able to grow at a pace where we can leverage our learnings continue to get better and also drive costs down. We need to keep getting infrastructure in place in the basin like in-basin sand and water reuse. So we are sticking to our 2024 plan laid out last quarter of 20 net wells, and it's a little too early to disclose anything for 2025. But overall, this play really competes with our best place for capital. The other great thing is with the multi-basin portfolio, we don't necessarily need to ramp it up aggressively. We'll just kind of let returns drive that. Yes. Paul, this Keith. So I'll start on the well cost. It's still early on the play that team continues to drive down the cost. We see a lot of room for further efficiencies, the consistent activity this year with 1 full rig has helped that a lot. We like that generally in the area, it's an easier operating environment compared to a lot of our other plays. That's consistent geology. It's a little bit shallower depths. Example of that is our 3.7 mile lateral we just drilled on the [indiscernible].\n We also brought in an e-frac crew for higher pump rates and increased efficiencies. And Overall, we see development costs someday getting to be a little bit lower than the Permian, even on $1 per foot. But the great thing is that this play just has the opportunity to benefit from the learnings of all of our other plays and EOG best practices.\n On the well performance side, we're really happy with the wells as I and Ezra, we kind of already touched on, we see that these compete with the best players in America, very comparable to the Permian on a production per foot basis both in oil and equivalents, really highlighting our differentiated organic exploration strategy.\n The development program as far as rigs and crews and number of wells. It goes back to growing at that pace where we can still learn and just the multi-basin portfolio. We don't necessarily have to ramp this up aggressively. So. Yes. This Keith. So yes, it's still early in the play. We're learning more every day about how the geology ties to production. It's going to obviously vary over the 435,000 net acres. But in general, the Utica is thicker in the North. The South is a little bit better pay, but it has better geomechanics and rock properties. That has to do with frac barriers and keeping the frac energy more contained near the wellbore.\n So we expect, as we gather more data, different areas are going to have different type curves. Geology is also going to drive the spacing too. But we're real happy with the rail results in all of the areas. They're exceeding expectations, generating great returns and we're happy so far with these white rhinos that are down in the south.\n So they're still cleaning up. They've gone on for a couple of weeks. We're seeing a little more liquid yield compared to the Timberwolf and Xavier. And you're right, those do have the minerals, they benefit from that, and we'll be able to update you when we have a little more production data."

            "name": "Ezra Yacob",
            "content": "Thanks, Pearce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. EOG is off to a great start in 2024, both delivering value directly to our shareholders and investing in future value creation. Primary drivers of that value are EOG's commitment to capital discipline operational excellence and leading sustainability efforts, all underpinned by our unique culture.\n Strong first quarter execution from every operating team across our multi-basin portfolio has positioned the company to deliver exceptional returns. Production and total per unit cash operating costs beat targets, driving strong financial performance during the quarter. We earned $1.6 billion of adjusted net income and generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow. We paid out more than 100% of that free cash flow through our peer-leading regular dividend and $750 million of share repurchases.\n EOG's operational execution continues to translate into strong returns and cash flow generation. Our robust cash return to shareholders continues to demonstrate our confidence in the outlook and value of our business.\n Quarter after quarter, we have delivered outstanding operational performance in our core assets while also driving forward progress in our emerging plays. We have built one of the deepest, highest return and most diverse multi-basin portfolios of inventory in the industry.\n The most recent addition to our portfolio is the Utica combo play, a textbook example of our differentiated approach. Capturing highly productive rock through our organic exploration and leasing efforts is the primary way of expanding our premium inventory with a low cost of entry to drive healthy full cycle returns. Adding reserves at lower finding and development costs drive down DD&A and lowers the overall cost basis of the company. The result is continuous improvement to EOG's company-wide capital efficiency.\n Our track record of successful exploration, strong operational execution and Applied Technology has positioned the company to create shareholder value through industry cycles.\n The oil macro environment remains dynamic, but is overall constructive, and we anticipate that certain drivers will limit oil prices to a relatively narrow band this year. In the first quarter, global demand performed as expected and is on trend to increase throughout the year, led by a strong U.S. economy.\n And while U.S. production surprised to the upside in 2023, several developments have altered the U.S. supply outlook this year. Rig counts have remained flat over the past 8, 9 months, and oil drilled but uncompleted or DUC inventory has been drawn down. Current activity levels combined with M&A in the public and private sectors should lead to more moderated U.S. growth this year.\n Globally, spare capacity has kept inventory levels around the 5-year average to start the year and we forecast these barrels returning to the market throughout the second half of the year and aligned with growing demand. Overall, the result is a strong operating environment for a low-cost and returns-focused producers such as EOG.\n And while we expect the natural gas market to remain soft through the end of this quarter, much like last year, we expect it to strengthen through the second half of the year and are managing our Dorado program to align with demand. Longer term, we expect an additional 10 to 12 Bcf a day of demand for LNG feed gas and another 10 to 12 Bcf per day of demand from several areas, including overall electrification, exports to Mexico, coal power plant retirements and other industrial demand growth. So the outlook for North American natural gas by the end of this decade is bullish, both for the industry and in particular, for our Dorado dry gas play which has advantaged access to the Gulf Coast and pipeline infrastructure.\n We look forward to participating in the emerging LNG demand through our diverse sales agreements to grow from 140,000 MMBtu per day today to 900,000 MMBtu per day over the next 3 years. Through EOG's differentiated approach to organic exploration, the utilization of technology to improve operational efficiencies, vertical integration of certain parts of the supply chain and our diverse marketing strategy, EOG remains focused on being among the highest return lowest cost and lowest emissions producers, offering sustainable value creation through the cycles.\n Ann is up next to provide an update on our forecast and 3-year scenario. Here's Ann. Thanks, Keith. I would like to note the following important takeaways: First, our differentiated business model focused on exploration and innovation has built one of the deepest highest return and most diverse multi-basin portfolios of inventory in the industry. The Utica, our most recent exploration success will be competitive with the premier unconventional plays across North America; Second, consistent execution in our core Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford assets delivers outstanding operational performance quarter after quarter, while investment in our emerging plays contributes to EOG's financial performance today and lays the groundwork for years of future high-return investment; Third, our robust cash return to shareholders continues to demonstrate our confidence in the outlook and value of our business; Finally, one of EOG's best champions of utilizing innovation to constantly improve the company as our friend and colleague, Billy Helms. Billy recently announced that he will retire at the end of this month.\n In Billy's 40-year career with EOG, he demonstrated a distinctive ability to encourage new ideas from our employees across multiple disciplines, innovative ideas to utilize infield technology, information technology and new processes to drill better wells for lower cost, more safely and with lower emissions.\n He then helped shepherd the very best of those ideas through to execution across the company. Even though well learned, the retirement of a friend and colleague is bittersweet. Best wishes to you, Billy. Thank you for your service to EOG. Yes, Steve, that's a great question. This is Ezra. So you're right, gas, obviously, it's stating the obvious, but inventory levels are very high after 2 consecutive warm winters. But I will highlight in the last 2 years, we've also seen strong demand on the power side during the last 2 summers. And we expect that to obviously continue into this summer. So strong summer demand, coupled with the reduced supply, not only from some operators curtailing but just from the reduction in rig activity we see the potential inventory levels could come off quite a bit in the second half of the year.\n Now that said, overall, we're maintaining flexibility with investment into those gas plays and dominantly what we're talking about is Dorado. I would say, Steve, we really would prefer to keep some rig activity running and really continue to capture the operational efficiencies. It's always difficult when you actually completely shutter a program. Unfortunately, in some of our plays that happened obviously during COVID in 2020. So we'd prefer to continue to capture our learnings and continue having a rig operate in the area.\n But we do have a lot of flexibility on the completion side. And so you could look to us to potentially build some DUCs more so DUCs than necessarily hold back on turn-in lines, although we've done that before as well, but we prefer to be flexible on our completion schedule side.\n As far as commitments to filling the infrastructure, no, Steve, we don't have any of that for us. What's going to really determine the pace of our investment there and when we bring the gas online, it's really a returns-based question. That's one reason that we did, in fact, put the infrastructure in ourselves is it's really in line with our longer-term marketing strategy which, of course, is duration, flexibility, diversity of markets and most importantly, in a situation like this, control. And so we don't have any obligations necessarily to deal with. Yes, Steve -- the last part you touched on is exactly the right way to think about it. It's the way that we think about it. We don't want to outrun our pace of learning. Now we are very constructive on the longer-term gas forecast for demand in North America. And we've talked about it before. We think Dorado is advantaged, not only with the cost of supply, but really with the geography where it's located, so we can service all the upcoming demand along the Gulf Coast.\n But the thing about a gas play is we're very committed to making sure that this is a low-cost asset. That's the most important thing because while we're constructive on a mid-cycle gas price increasing throughout the rest of this decade, it's easy to see that gas historically has been very volatile because no matter what you need to layer in weather on top of whatever gas supply-demand model you've created.\n And so the most important thing for us is, even in the early days of investing in this place, making sure that we're investing at a pace to optimize the returns and optimize the cost of supply and keep our cost basis low, so that we can continue to have a positive cash flow through some of those skinny times.\n So I'd say we could look to increase the activity I think we've talked in the past of being prepared to increase it with the upcoming LNG and just overall demand. But as far as assigning a hard level to it, Steve, we'll have the infrastructure in place. We have the -- not only the takeaway infrastructure but in-basin, things like sand and water -- water, mines and things of that nature. So we could ramp it up. But you should look at us to ramp it up commensurately with our learning, which would be at a more measured pace. Yes, Arun. This is Ezra. I'd say last year, we did return to the market through buybacks and specials and our regular dividend, about 86% of the cash flow. So having higher quarters is not out of line. The big difference, as you highlighted is that it was all biased towards buybacks rather than specials. And that's really been the trend over the last few quarters and I think that trend will probably continue.\n The reason I say that is our business has really strengthened substantially over the past few years, as we've highlighted before, not only in our core assets like the Permian and Eagle Ford, but especially in these emerging plays, Utica, the Dorado, we're just talking about it, even the Powder River Basin. And really, it's -- the entire energy sector, EOG certainly, we think, remains undervalued relative to the broad market. And those are really the big things that provide us confidence to continue buying back our shares.\n In general, I'd say our cash flow allocation priorities remain unchanged. It is focused on the regular dividend. But we will continue to be opportunistic on share buybacks, and we'll use market volatility to our advantage. And we've really been doing that now as we've been in the market repurchasing shares for the past 5 quarters. I'd say we'll continue to evaluate the opportunities as they present themselves on how best to return cash to the shareholders.\n But the feedback that we've received is the shareholders appreciate our approach. And as I said, we've been biased to buybacks for the last couple of quarters. And for the time being, you can certainly see that probably proceeding going forward. Yes, Neil. Well, I'd start with the fact that Q1, I think, has really played out as most people expected. There is a bit of a pullback in demand there. And that's one thing that had prompted I think, had prompted some of the spare capacity being brought offline. But ultimately, that demand was about 102 million barrels a day. It looks to us and others out there, other models, it looks like demand should strengthen throughout the year. So we have not only seasonal demand picking up here, but also we're seeing underlying strength in the U.S. economy. Also in the China, the Chinese economy, just a little bit, namely on the manufacturing side.\n So ultimately, we see demand reaching a bit above 104 million a day in the back half of the year. And so that's on the demand side. When you think about inventory levels, obviously, first quarters with spare capacity offline, inventory levels have stayed just below that 5-year average, but products really are a bit lower. And so that shapes up for a good -- some good inventory draws potentially in the back half of the year.\n And then really on the supply side, as I spoke about in the opening comments, we think U.S. supply should be pretty moderate. We're in agreement with other estimates of kind of that 300,000 to 400,000 barrel per day growth year-over-year. And that's where we arrive in a model that would indicate we see much of the spare capacity reentering the market throughout the rest of this year. But we'll see how that depends, how that really plays out, as you said, at the next upcoming OPEC meeting. Scott, this is Ezra. Yes, I think we're very happy with where we're at. It's over a 400,000-acre position. As Keith highlighted, it's 140 miles north to south. And let's be honest, we've got 2 packages on right now. Now the 2 packages are fantastic. They're exceeding what we initially had in our type curves, and they're more than confirming some of our early thoughts on the spacing test. So at this point, everything is going in the right direction.\n As Keith highlighted, to help delineate some of the other acreage that we have, the first step is to -- well, really, the first step was having some of the well-log identification. So really, maybe the second step now is to go ahead and get that seismic and see what the level of complexity is.\n As Keith talked about in his opening comments, we have brought on -- just brought on a package down in the south. Which will prove up -- it's a bit of a different geologic environment down there. It's also an area where we own the minerals, which is very exciting. You guys know the economic uplift that, that can have.\n So overall, I would say that everything is right on pace. We'd like to continue to get some in-basin -- just infrastructure and be able to start to leverage the size and scale that we have. Maybe one way to think about it, Scott, is, in all these early resource plays think about where the Utica is. And maybe it's around where the Permian was in kind of 2012, 2013 time frame. And so that's why when we all talk about not outrunning our ability to learn, the costs that you're putting in the ground today, we think about it as full cycle economics, and they're going to stay with you on the life of this asset.\n We're not at a point where we're in need of increasing the activity here. We've got a very deep high-return inventory across multiple basins, and that's really the big difference. I think our business model has changed as the company has matured, and we've built out that inventory where we don't need to lean in aggressively on any single one asset anymore. We've got the ability with this multi-basin portfolio that we can invest in each of these at a pace that really allows them to improve year-over-year.\n Now we definitely want to bring some of these capital efficiency learnings from the Eagle Ford, the Bakken, the Permian, into the Utica. But we want to do it at a place where we're not -- we don't have the misses on spacing or higher well costs or things that have plagued some of the early learnings in these other resource plays.\n So I wouldn't say we're looking for any major sign or any silver bullet that we're going to turn on a 15-rig program or anything like that, Scott. It's really the -- where our company is at, where we're at in the cycle, and it ultimately comes down to a returns-based decision not at the asset level, but really at the company level as to how to capitally allocate across the portfolio to maximize shareholder value. Yes. Leo, this is Ezra. I'll start with the exploration and then hand the DD&A details over to Ann for an answer. On the exploration side, yes, we do have some exploration dollars in the budget this year, as we highlighted on the first quarter call. We continue to explore for -- yes, we continue to focus on oil plays. But at the core of it, what we continue to explore for things that are going to be additive to the quality of the corporate portfolio. And that's what you're seeing with the Utica, obviously. So that's a major success for us. We're not exploring for things that are simply just going to add inventory. We really want them to be additive on a returns basis, additive on a cost of reserves or refining and development cost basis, and that's how it contributes into lowering the DD&A rate.\n This year, we are drilling a couple of what I would call initial wells or I hate to call them wildcat wells because these aren't frontier types of activities. These are in basins where there's data and there's been historic production and things like that, but let's call them, the initial wells to test some exploration ideas.\n And then we've still got another stealth player too that are a bit more in, say, a delineation phase, where we've drilled the initial well. We've seen -- we've been encouraged with the initial well results, and we're continuing to test and see if it's going to clear those hurdle rates that I talked about.\n The big thing I'd say is these days are exploration plays in these initial wells I think I've highlighted this before. In the U.S., the way we operate through exploration, there's so much data that we're not really drilling these initial wells and to see if they'll actually produce oil and natural gas. It's not like we're testing whether or not the rock is productive and could we end up with a dry hole. These days, it's really about when we get the oil and gas to surface. Is it what we expected? Is it going to be economic in such a way that it really competes with the existing portfolio? Are we exploring? Have we found something that really commands investment and taking rigs off of another play.\n And I'll hand it over to Ann. Yes, Leo, this Ezra. I don't know if I'd call it bullish on '25, but I would say that we're constructive. As I said, we've seen a surprising upside on the amount of natural gas demand for power generation over the last couple of summers, and we continue to think that's going to be true this summer. That -- a big part of that is coupled with coal retirements.\n We also think the pull on natural gas this summer because pricing is soft, will also continue to be great as well. You combine that with the reduction in rig activities over the past 8 months or so, and the fact that operators now are also starting to curtail volumes. We think that's going to bring down the supply side to a point where you could actually make some pretty good progress on those inventory levels in the back half of this year. That with a little bit of feed gas starting to be taken on the LNG. It gives us a little bit of confidence headed into in '25. But you are right, there is a bit of -- there is quite a bit of an overhang right now that we need to see come off starting with this summer. Yes, Paul, this Ezra. Yes, the $400 million of infrastructure, the strategic infrastructure that we've highlighted before, which we couldn't be more excited about because of some of the long-term margin expansion benefits that Jeff highlighted it in the opening remarks. These are projects that, historically, we look for opportunities like this, but they're very rare to present themselves where we can take on infrastructure projects that generate such a compelling rate of return. We've talked about the Verde pipeline is expected to generate about a 20% rate of return uplift. And then on top of that, we get that GP&T savings, a netback uplift of $0.50 to $0.60 per Mcf over the life of the asset.\n Similarly, on Janus, the gas processing plant in the Permian Basin, that one also has roughly an anticipated 20% rate of return. And then on that one, we have a GP&T savings, a net back uplift of about $0.50 an Mcf. If we could continue to find some of these projects with that strong of a return profile and that much value creation for the shareholders over the life of the assets, we would be interested in continuing to do them.\n But to be perfectly honest with you, Typically, those margins get squeezed down to a point where we don't want to do them. It's really more beneficial for a third party to come in and do them. But there are times in the cycle where -- and it seems to happen every 5, 8, 10 years or so, where there ends up being enough margin there where we see the opportunity to go ahead and capture that value for our shareholders. Yes, David, this is Ezra. Those are fixed projects, the strategic infrastructure that we're talking about. And so the best kind of way to look at it, maybe is to reference that 3-year scenario that we have out there. Now that is not guidance, but it is a scenario that potentially assumes a similar macro environment to what we've seen in the last few years. And what we could do going forward.\n And what you see there is maybe not as much capital intensity, but you see there is an expansion of our cash flow and our free cash flow. And that's really the thing that we focus on. And that's the important thing to keep in mind, when we talk about these strategic infrastructure projects, and it's something I highlighted before is that when you can invest -- we're not aggressively seeking out these strategic infrastructure, these infrastructure projects. But when you have the opportunity to invest in something that offers a very compelling rate of return upfront, and it gives you the margin expansion for the life of the asset. That's definitely an opportunity that we want to grab. So one of the ways that we continue to lower the cost basis of the company. And it's one of the ways that in that 3-year scenario, you see the free cash flow margins expanding. Thank you. We appreciate everyone's time today. I'd like to hand the call over to Billy to wrap up."

            "name": "Jeffrey Leitzell",
            "content": "Thanks, Anne. I'd like to first thank all the employees for a great start to the year with safe and efficient operational execution. Our first quarter volumes and total per unit cash operating costs beat targets while capital was in line.\n For the year, our capital forecast remains $6.2 billion and delivers 3% oil volume growth and 6% total production growth. We continue to expect that capital this year will be slightly more weighted in the first half, driven by the timing of our investments in the 2 infrastructure projects that we provided details on last quarter. These projects include the Janus gas processing plant in the Delaware Basin and the Verde pipeline that will serve our South Texas Dorado play, both highlighted on Slide 10 of our investor presentation.\n By the end of the second quarter, we expect to be on pace to have spent about 56% of our $6.2 billion capital plan. While our oil production and capital plan for the full year remains unchanged, we are actively managing activity in our Dorado asset, which is reflected in our second quarter natural gas production guidance published yesterday.\n As discussed last quarter, we moderated activity in Dorado this year in response to a weaker natural gas market and are now leveraging additional flexibility to delay well completions and manage volumes through the summer. However, we will continue to pursue a balanced development approach with this asset, which includes operating a full rig program throughout the year. This will help maintain operational momentum, capture corresponding efficiencies and continue to advance and improve the play while we continue to monitor the natural gas market.\n We remain constructive on the long-term gas outlook for the U.S., supported by LNG, power generation demand and the growing petrochemical complex on the Gulf Coast. We are especially pleased with Dorado's place in the market as one of the lowest cost supplies of natural gas in the U.S. with an advantaged location and emissions profile.\n With regards to service cost market, bids for standard spot services have been trending lower, which is consistent with our expectations of seeing some deflation this year. For high-spec rigs and frac fleets, we are still observing stable pricing. However, their availability is improving, especially in markets with less activity.\n As a reminder, we have secured 50% to 60% of our service cost in 2024, primarily with our high-spec high-demand services to ensure consistent performance throughout our program. By securing these resources, we're able to focus on sustainable efficiency improvements to progress each one of our plays at a measured pace.\n EOG's operating performance and capital efficiency continues to improve as our cross-functional teams work to drive efficiency gains throughout our multi-basin portfolio. A significant driver of efficiencies this year is longer laterals, which we expect will increase by 10% on average company-wide. The charge is being led in our foundational plays, the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford, Our operating teams in both plays have achieved consistent execution and success drilling and completing longer laterals leading to increased efficiencies, lower per foot well cost and improved well economics.\n In the Delaware Basin, we drilled 4 3-mile laterals in 2023 and have plans to drill more than 50 in 2024. In the Eagle Ford, our 24 plan includes increasing the average lateral length by about 20% to continue to unlock new potential across our 535,000 net acre footprint.\n Moving to the Powder River Basin. Our technical teams continue to make good strides with our balanced development approach between the Mowry and the Niobrara formations. In the Niobrara, we have recently transitioned into package development by applying the learnings we captured while drilling the deeper mile reformation first.\n In our first 3 Niobrara development packages this year, we've been able to increase our drilling footage per day by 25% compared to 2023 averages, while maintaining over 95% in zone targeting. This can be attributed to our refined geologic models and a better understanding of the stratigraphic variation across the play.\n With these continued efficiency gains across our diverse portfolio plays along with stable service costs, our expectations for full year well cost decrease is a low single-digit percentage. After a strong first quarter, EOG is well positioned to execute on its full year plan. Our technical teams continue to drive innovation with a focus on improved recovery, lowering costs and being a leader in sustainability.\n Now here's Keith to provide more color on the Utica. Yes, Arun, this is Jeff. Thanks for the question. What I'd first say is our 2024 plan, it's playing out as we had expected. So everything is in line as far as timing, and we still feel really confident with the total CapEx budget of $6.2 billion.\n You did -- you hit it on the head, and we talked about it in our opening statements, CapEx will slightly be higher there in that first half. at that 56% of total budget, but that's really just due to some standard indirects. And really, those strategic infrastructure spends that we have talked about with the Delaware gas plant and the Verde pipeline there.\n The nice thing about it is both projects are scheduled to come online. The gas plant, we've got planned for the first half of 2025. And the second phase of Verde pipeline is going to come on, hopefully, the back end of this year. we're really excited about it to be able to get to realize that $0.50-plus per Mcf GP&T savings that both those projects are going to bring for the life of the asset. Yes, Neil, this is Jeff again. With the Eagle Ford, we've got a really good, consistent program this year. We're going to be completing about 150 net wells there. And as far as looking at the well performance, everything has been in line and right with our expectations. With any mature asset, you're going to see some productivity degradation. I mean we started out in the East where we had a little bit more prolific geology. And then more recently, we've moved out to the West, where it's slightly lower quality pay, but the key takeaway is we've been able to continue to improve the economics in that play year-over-year. And we've really done that just through -- as you talked about, increasing operational efficiencies and focusing on drilling faster, completing faster with super zippers, longer laterals and cost reductions that have continued to improve the capital efficiency of the play.\n And what I'd say is also one of the big movements that we've had is we're actually increasing the lateral length there in the Eagle Ford, about 20% this year. So -- and you can see the activity might be down just a hair year-over-year, but we've completed the same amount of lateral length as we did in 2023 with those longer laterals. So that's just one of the ways we're really able to drive efficiency there. You can see it in the returns. I mean, really, it's got some of the highest rate of returns over the last 3 years, and we've been drilling in the Eagle Ford for 15 years.\n And then looking over to the Bakken, we are very mature in that resource. Right now, we kind of run a program of about 10 net wells there. Primarily, they're just Three Forks targets and Bakken targets. And really, we're just going in and offset and infilling around some of our existing development. We're staying ahead of depletion. And then also, we've had some areas with limited markets, but we've got some new available capacity, so we're able to bring some additional wells online there.\n So obviously, with a really oily play, the well productivity looks great on there and everything that's coming online is in line with our forecast, and we're excited about those wells this year. Scott, this is Jeff. Yes, just on the activity in Trinidad. We're currently just running our 1-rig program there and everything is going really smooth. Earlier this year, we completed 2 of our remaining wells there in the Modified U(a) Block successfully. And brought those online. And we're currently drilling and completing a couple of exploratory wells in the SECC block. And then after that, we'll move the rig and we've got a couple of recompletes to do in our Sercan area. And then one more exploration well to finish up the year in TSP area.\n Another note that I'll point to you too is we're also installing our Mento platform. Everything has been on time and looking good there. getting the facilities in place, and that's in an SMR Block. And what that will do is that will really set us up for the program next year. So -- and as far as the marketing side, I'll hand it over to Lance to give a little color. Yes, Derrick, this Jeff. So yes, we've made a lot of really good strides there in the PRB. We started out really focusing in on that deeper Mowry really to refine our geologic models kind of throughout the whole section. And we had good success with the Mowry with that. We went into package development last year, and we saw with package development, a really good uptick in overall productivity there, about 10% in Mowry. So once we accumulate enough data, we went ahead and we're moving up in section in the package development there in the Niobrara. and just really started drilling some wells this year, having really good success operationally, and we'll look to be bringing some of those on later in the year here.\n So in comparison to the Powder and the Permian, I mean, there's not many basins that are going to be like the Permian as far as overall productivity and results. It's just a little bit different. But there are some advantages up there. It's got a really low F&D cost and there's a lot of scale there. Obviously, we've got close to 400,000 acres and we're really just focused in down on the south Powder portion of that. So we've got a lot of expansion that we can take our learnings and we can move it up to the North Powder, which we've had some delineation wells and across the acreage from that aspect.\n So we're excited about it. It's not moving as fast maybe as what the Permian Basin had but we're making really, really good strides. The returns look great on it, and the teams are continuing to make really good improvements from an operational aspect, and we are seeing premium returns on that play. Yes. This Jeff. We obviously keep our finger on kind of what's happening with refracs and that technology out there. We've done tests in the past in multiple basins. And what we really find is just with our robust inventory across our multi-basin portfolio. The opportunity for refracs, we're much better to either go in and offset an existing completion that was maybe poor or lesser or just go ahead and drill a new well in a new section from that aspect.\n And then the other thing that I'd point out is from refrac technology, I think there's still a long ways to go. I mean there's pretty crude approaches. To where you kind of do some Hail Mary fracs or have to install expensive additional casing strings. And you never quite get the productivity uplift that you're looking from an actual new well.\n So no, right now, we see just a lot more potential in our existing inventory in the acreage that we have out there. We will keep an eye on the refrac technology and watch it advance and see if it has application, but we feel that going ahead and drilling a new well or an infill well is a much better investment. Yes, David, this Jeff. We're in the very early innings there. And what I'll say operationally is the Utica sets up, I mean, almost perfectly. It's the efficiency gains that we're able to see there, we're getting better with just about every well. And as Keith had talked about in his opening statements, we drilled our longest lateral there to date at 3.7 miles. Our program right now consistently is 3 miles, and the team plans on continuing to push that out just because we can do one runs in the laterals and stay on bottom longer and not have to trip out of the hole, and we really have no problems operationally completing the wells.\n So I think the play I'm looking forward to is as far as from longer laterals is, yes, we'll continue to push the limits there. We've got a lot of other drivers. It's not just the cost per foot metric we're looking at. There's other movement that we have that we'll be able to lower cost. But I would expect as we continue on with the operational successes we have, we will be drilling longer and longer there in the Utica."
