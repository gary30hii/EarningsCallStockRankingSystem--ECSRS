At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today to Andrew Ang, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Ang: Thank you, Dillon. And good afternoon, everyone. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2020. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investors section of the Gilead website. The speakers on today's call will be Daniel O'Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Johanna Mercier, Chief Commercial Officer; Merdad Parsey, Chief Medical Officer; and Andrew Dickinson, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for Q&A will be Christi Shaw, Chief Executive Officer of Kite. Before we begin with our prepared remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including risks and uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gilead's business, financial condition and results of operations, plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, financial projections and the use of capital, and 2021 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risk and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.  A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to Dan.\nDaniel O'Day: Thank you, Andrew. And good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to have this opportunity to provide an update on our progress and answer your questions. I'll begin by offering brief remarks and then hand off to the team to go into more detail.  Before I begin, I want to thank all those who contributed to the progress we will highlight today, both our teams across the company and our many partners and collaborators worldwide.  Let me start by looking back at the fourth quarter. Our work continued across three main areas as it had throughout 2020, responding to the pandemic with our antiviral therapy, Veklury, delivering on our commitment to people with HIV, cancer, viral hepatitis, and other conditions; and thirdly, executing on our strategy. As a result of our efforts to expand and strengthen our portfolio, we're going into 2021 in a very different position to how we began 2020.  Last month, we provided updated guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2020 to ensure that you had a clear picture coming into today's earnings announcement. This updated guidance was largely based on the significant increase in the uptake of Veklury.  In the United States alone, hospitalizations quadrupled between October and January, and approximately one out of every two patients hospitalized in the US are being treated with Veklury today.  We're grateful that Veklury is able to play such an important role in getting patients out of the hospital faster, five days on average based on the NIAID ACTT-1 trial, especially as many parts of the world struggle with hospital capacity.  The higher uptake of Veklury along with the continued growth of our leading treatment for HIV, Biktarvy, helped to offset the ongoing impact of the pandemic on some parts of our business. Veklury and Biktarvy also helped to mitigate the expected impact of loss of exclusivity for Atripla and Truvada in October.  Our efforts to build out our portfolio of medicines continued in the fourth quarter, with our agreement to acquire MYR. The acquisition, which is on track to close in the first quarter of this year, subject to regulatory clearances and other closing conditions, will bring us a first in class medicine called Hepcludex for the treatment of hepatitis D or HDV.  This is the most severe form of viral hepatitis and affects some patients who are already infected with hepatitis B. Hepcludex is conditionally approved in Europe and has FDA breakthrough therapy designation as an investigational agent in the United States.  The acquisition of Immunomedics closed in the fourth quarter, bringing the most significant recent addition to our pipeline, Trodelvy. Trodelvy is a foundational medicine in our cancer portfolio with significant potential across multiple tumor types. We're very pleased with how the integration with Immunomedics is going and look forward to updating you on our progress with Trodelvy.  Andy, Johanna, and Merdad will share more detail on the quarter. I'd like to turn now to the year ahead. The first thing I would say is that we're moving forward with a clear path to growth. We have multiple opportunities in new therapeutic areas, especially oncology. We're very pleased with the strong and diverse oncology portfolio we have today. This portfolio consists of both marketed therapies such as Trodelvy and Tecartus and Yescarta from Kite and programs across various stages of the pipeline. There are currently 27 internal ongoing clinical stage programs for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.  We also have many promising opt-in opportunities. One of those options is for the anti-TIGIT program through our collaboration with Arcus Biosciences. Earlier this week, it was announced that we are increasing our investment in Arcus to help fund the continued progress of the promising Arcus pipeline.  The foundation for our near- and long-term growth is our continued leadership in antivirals. We are confident in the longevity of our HIV business. We expect Biktarvy to continue to be a mainstay of HIV treatment long into the future. And our investigational capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, could be a best-in-class, long-acting option for both treatment and prevention. Lenacapavir is highly potent, and importantly it\u2019s flexible dosing profile gives us the potential to develop multiple long-acting treatment and prevention options.  In 2021, we expect a number of important milestones in the areas I've just mentioned. Merdad will provide more detail on the regulatory milestones, and I will highlight a few for now within the broader context of what you can expect from us.  Starting with our leadership in antivirals. We will of course be focused on the continued growth of Biktarvy and maintaining its leadership as the number one prescribed treatment for HIV in major markets. We plan to file an NDA in the US for lenacapavir in the heavily treatment-experienced population. This should be in the second half of the year.  We will also continue to explore the right options for combinations. In viral hepatitis, we look forward to expanding our business in HBV and HDV by growing sales of Vemlidy in the US and Asia; and pending completion of the MYR acquisition, the anticipated filing of a BLA in the second half of the year.  For Veklury, we look to realize the full potential of the therapy as the pandemic evolves. As you know, we are studying new formulations and routes of administration for Veklury as a treatment for COVID-19.  With the strong antiviral business as our foundation, we are looking forward to the continued expansion of oncology as a new pillar of growth. Trodelvy, which will have its first full year on the market following approval will be a significant contributor to our growth this year. We expect to hear about conversion from accelerated to full approval in the coming weeks based on the FDA review of the ASCENT data.  At the same time, we'll be pursuing the many pipeline opportunities for Trodelvy. It is currently being studied in 10 different tumor types. We expect to hear from the FDA on accelerated approval for Trodelvy in metastatic urothelial cancer in the first half of the year.  And we're also anticipating a readout of the Phase III TROPiCS-02 study in hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer in the second half.  Data from the Phase III ZUMA-7 study is expected in the first half of the year for Yescarta's potential expansion into second line DLBCL. And we should see Phase I-b data from magrolimab in MDS in the second half of the year with the possibility of a regulatory submission based on these results. In addition, we'll assess opt-in opportunities throughout the year as data becomes available and continue to advance our internal programs.  I want to add that we are focused on prioritizing in order to deliver on these opportunities. We now have a portfolio that allows us to be much more selective in terms of what we take forward. This means being very disciplined about investing where there is highest potential value. You've seen some of that with our decisions around filgotinib and our investment in Trodelvy.  Just briefly on the enterprise level activities, we will continue to expand our talent base and deepen our expertise outside antivirals as we did in 2020.  We will also maintain our strong focus on inclusion and diversity. As part of this, we are strengthening our efforts to promote racial equity. Today, we announced that Gilead has become a founding member of a coalition called OneTen. This is a group of US companies that is committed to hiring and promoting 1 million black Americans into family sustaining jobs over the next 10 years.  In addition, we'll continue to advance our ESG program and targets in line with our strategy. We will update you on our progress in these areas each quarter. There's a lot of important work ahead of us in 2021. And we're very much looking forward to turning our opportunities into tangible progress that will benefit patients, communities and our shareholders.  With that, I'll now pass over the call to Andy.\nAndrew Dickinson: Thank you, Dan. And good afternoon, everyone. Our performance was strong for the fourth quarter and full-year 2020, a clear reflection of solid underlying fundamentals of our business and the increased demand we saw for Veklury, amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  You will find our detailed Q4 and full-year 2020 results in the press release and materials we have posted on our website. Today, I will review our Q4 and full-year 2020 performance and provide our guidance for 2021.  Turning now to the financial highlights. Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $7.4 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.19. This compares to total revenue of $5.9 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.10 for the same period last year. Non GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased 99% year-over-year, primarily due to higher product sales, improved gross margin driven by a prior-year inventory charge and a lower tax rate. This was partially offset by increased R&D and SG&A investments, including $190 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to amending our agreement with Galapagos. Product sales for the fourth quarter and full year were $7.3 billion and $24.4 billion, up 26% and 10%, respectively, compared to the same periods last year as the most recent COVID-19 surge drove uptake of Veklury. Sequentially, this increase was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of Atripla and Truvada in the US in October.  Veklury contributed $1.9 billion and $2.8 billion in sales for the fourth quarter and full year 2020, largely driven by increased utilization and COVID-19 hospitalizations in the US. For the full year excluding Veklury, product sales were down 3% due to the recent losses of exclusivity for Atripla, Truvada, Letairis and Ranexa in the US, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our HIV and HCV franchises. Despite the impact of the pandemic and the LOEs related to Atripla and Truvada in the US, HIV revenue grew 3% year-over-year, driven by Biktarvy and Descovy. For Q4, product sales excluding Veklury decreased 4% sequentially, primarily due to the Atripla and Truvada LOEs.  Cell therapy revenues were up 34% for the fourth quarter and 33% for the year, primarily due to the continued uptake of Yescarta in Europe and the US launch of Tecartus in July.  Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $918 million for the fourth quarter and $3.3 billion for the year, down 35% and 8% respectively compared to the same periods last year. 2020 cost of goods sold was lower primarily because of a $500 million inventory write-down charge in Q4 of 2019. Excluding this, non-GAAP product margins remain relatively flat year-over-year.  Non-GAAP R&D expense for the quarter was $1.5 billion, up 31% sequentially and up 37% year-over-year, primarily driven by the $190 million charge associated with the Galapagos amendment that I mentioned earlier and approximately $70 million in milestones paid to Pioneer as well as pipeline investments in Trodelvy and magrolimab.  For the full year, non-GAAP R&D expense was up 20% year-over-year, primarily due to our significant investment in Veklury. We also increased our investment in oncology programs, including Trodelvy and magrolimab.  These increases in investment were partially offset by lower clinical expenses from the completion of certain inflammation programs and postponement of certain clinical trials due to the pandemic.  Non-GAAP SG&A expense for the quarter was $1.5 billion, up 37% sequentially and up 25% year-over-year. The increase in the quarter was driven by the timing of marketing expenses related to Biktarvy, along with Veklury and Trodelvy commercialization efforts and higher spend on corporate grants to support philanthropic organizations.  We allocated significant additional funds to nonprofit grantees in Q4 to support racial equity and social justice efforts, help our nonprofit grantees weather the pandemic and provide for our signature giving programs, including COMPASS, RADIAN and HepConnect. For the full year, non-GAAP SG&A expense increased 10% as a result of higher costs associated with the commercialization efforts for Veklury, our continued expansion in China, increased corporate grants, remdesivir donations and a $97 million charge related to a previously disclosed legal settlement.  Turning to our balance sheet. During the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of cash flow from operations, paid $858 million in dividends, and drew down a $1 billion term loan in connection with the closing of our $21 billion acquisition of Immunomedics.  For the year, we returned approximately 67% of free cash flow to our shareholders, consisting of $3.4 billion in dividends and $1.6 billion in share repurchases. We also repaid $1 billion of debt on January 1 of this year.  Turning to our guidance for 2021. Our 2021 non-GAAP financial guidance is summarized on slides 18 and 19 in the earnings presentation available on our website. As always, our guidance is based on our current expectations for our business in 2021 and results may vary depending upon, among other things, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which remain unpredictable.  In addition, while our guidance reflects the impact of recent corporate development transactions and our planned acquisition of MYR, as well as funding for ordinary course partnering activities in 2021, our guidance does not factor in the possibility of any extraordinary business development costs or acquisitions or significant opt-ins that we may complete over the course of the coming year.  With that background, we expect that product sales excluding Veklury for 2021 will be in the range of $21.7 billion to $22.1 billion. Due to the uncertainty related to pandemic, we expect Veklury revenue to be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion, which results in total product sales range of $23.7 billion to $25.1 billion.  As we've discussed over the past quarters, Veklury in many ways acts as a hedge against the potential impacts of the continued COVID-19 pandemic. This guidance reflects anticipated revenue growth of approximately 9% to 10%, excluding LOEs and Veklury, driven by growth from Biktarvy, Trodelvy, Vemlidy and our cell therapy franchise.  And while there remains uncertainty with the pandemic, we are making certain assumptions regarding the recovery and underlying market dynamics starting in the second quarter of 2021. As COVID-19 vaccinations accelerate, any delay with the vaccine rollouts or any significant reacceleration of the global pandemic could once again adversely impact our business.  As a reminder, looking ahead to Q1, we anticipate total product sales excluding Veklury will decline by low single digit percentage, similar to what we've seen over the past three years. This is expected to be driven by customary US seasonal inventory patterns and buying patterns of public payers that negatively affect our payer mix in the first quarter.  In addition, unlike prior years, Q1 of 2021 will also be impacted by the recent loss of exclusivity of Atripla and Truvada in the United States. Despite this anticipated sequential decline in Q1 total product sales, we remain very confident in the health of our business as reflected in our guidance for the coming year.  Turning to our expectations for our product gross margins in 2021. Our non-GAAP product gross margins are expected to be in the range of 87% to 88% in 2021, consistent with our historic range.  With respect to our operating expenses in 2021, we expect that both non-GAAP R&D and non-GAAP SG&A expenses will see a flat to low single digit percentage decline through disciplined expense management, with flexibility to continue investing in our R&D pipeline and other strategic opportunities going forward.  This guidance includes the impact of our planned acquisition of MYR, as well as our allocation of approximately $350 million for future investments and ordinary course R&D collaborations.  In addition, our SG&A guidance reflects the expected impact in 2021 of our oncology build out and funding for a number of time-limited corporate initiatives related to information technology and data analytics. Our non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $11.5 billion to $12.9 billion in 2021. And our non GAAP effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 21%, which is higher than 2020, primarily due to a decrease in tax credits and settlements with tax authorities that reduced our 2020 tax rate.  Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.75 per share to $7.45 per share, driven by increased operational efficiencies as compared to 2020 and partially offset by the higher non-GAAP effective tax rate, along with greater projected interest expense and lower projected interest income as compared to 2020. Our balance sheet remains robust and our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. We remain focused on continuing to prioritize investment in our business and R&D pipeline, and maintaining a rigorous focus on disciplined expense management.  Finally, we continue to be committed to growing our dividend over time. And we are pleased to announce earlier today that we have increased our dividend by 4.4% for 2021.  Additionally, as we disclosed a few weeks ago, we plan to repay at least $4 billion of debt this year, including the $1 billion of debt we repaid at the beginning of this year. We also expect to repurchase shares to offset dilution from equity compensation plans.  I'll now turn the call over to Johanna.\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Andy. And good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin by taking you through some of the market dynamics we saw in the fourth quarter as we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact that it's had on our business.  As we entered the quarter in the US and around the world, the number of COVID-19 cases surged. This had two significant effects on our business. Recovery was dampened by our Hep C and HIV medications as people delayed visits to their health care providers. And the number of hospitalizations of patients with COVID-19 dramatically increased, leading to significant uptake of Veklury.  Driven by Veklury, we had robust growth in Q4, with a 13% increase in total product sales compared to the prior quarter. Excluding Veklury revenues, our business declined 4% amid the pandemic and loss of exclusivity for Atripla and Truvada in the US.  Overall, while we expect the pandemic to continue to cause near term uncertainty, we're confident in the strong underlying trends, which I'll highlight for you this afternoon, starting with HIV. We saw 3% growth in sales across our HIV franchise in 2020 compared with the prior year, despite the Atripla and Truvada LOE. Biktarvy continued to stand out in the HIV treatment market, growing 10% sequentially and 53% year-over-year. Biktarvy remains the number one prescribed regimen across key global markets, and in the US, where one in two new patients start on Biktarvy.  In PrEP, we ended the year with a 46% US market share for Descovy, exceeding our goal of 40% to 45%. As expected, we saw generic competitor enter the market in Q4, impacting Truvada revenues as we work to maintain strong commercial assets for Descovy. Going forward, we expect demand for PrEP to recover as the pandemic subsides, and we will stay competitive growing the business with the market. The generic competition and the surge in the pandemic led to a decline in Q4 HIV revenues of 6% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. In addition, in line with historical trends, we saw seasonal inventory build in Q4, which we expect to bleed out into Q1 of this year.  We're well positioned and confident in our leadership in HIV today and in the future. Biktarvy will continue to be a key growth driver as the go-to single tablet regimen for HIV treatment with patent protection extending to 2033 in the US, as well as the European Union.  We remain enthusiastic about the prospects of growing our leadership as we advance our long acting antiviral lenacapavir. Success in the long acting market will depend on having a product candidate with the right profile for patients. We believe lenacapavir has the potential to be that product. And Merdad will share more detail about its profile in his remarks.  Turning to Trodelvy, as Dan mentioned, we completed our acquisition of Immunomedics in October. During the quarter, Trodelvy recorded $64 million in sales, with $49 million of that revenue recognized by Gilead following the close of the acquisition, for a full year totaling $137 million in revenue.  I'm impressed with the progress the teams have made launching the medication amid the pandemic. In its first eight months, Trodelvy has become the clear number one therapy in third line metastatic triple negative breast cancer. The breath of Trodelvy adoption and recognition of the product continues to grow. And we're now seeing unaided Trodelvy awareness of about 90% among physicians and academic institutions.  Our ambition is to achieve similar awareness numbers with community providers, which will be driven by the anticipated full FDA approval of Trodelvy for metastatic triple negative breast cancer and publication of the previously presented ASCENT data in the first half of 2021. We're also on track to complete the European filing in the first quarter of this year.  Specific to hepatitis, the COVID-19 surge impacted the recovery we saw in Q3 across our HDV franchise. Our HDV business showed 9% sequential decline impacted by the pandemic and timing of purchases in markets outside of the US. We continue to maintain anywhere between 50% and 60% market share across our core market, which we believe sets us well for recovery.  In HBV, we expect to continue to grow our business and anticipate sales exceeding $1 billion by 2022, driven by the US and Asia market.  We're looking forward to closing the MYR acquisition which will bring Hepcludex to Gilead The medicine is a first in class and potentially best in class treatment for hepatitis D, or HDD, an orphan disease that has been historically under diagnosed and for which there were no approved treatment options prior to Hepcludex. HDD is the most severe form of viral hepatitis, and is associated with poor long term survival rates. We believe our experience in hepatitis and the operational synergies with respect to Gilead's existing field force in HPV will allow us to reach patients with HDD. Hepcludex already has conditional approval in Europe and remains an investigational agent in the US. Pending the close of the deal, we anticipate filing for US approval in the second half of this year.  In closing, I just want to share a few remarks about Veklury. As Dan noted, Veklury remains an important treatment option for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We're seeing utilization rates of 50% to 60% among eligible patients in the US and are very proud of the role we played in helping patients during this challenging time.  As we've seen over the past year, predicting the trajectory of the pandemic has proven difficult, to say the least. We anticipate demand will continue to fluctuate as COVID-19 cases rise and fall. While we're encouraged by the progress that our industry has made with the introduction of vaccines, we expect Veklury will remain a critical tool for patients and physicians well into the future.  And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Merdad.\nMerdad Parsey : Thanks, Johanna. And good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to share with you some updates on our pipeline as we made tremendous progress in 2020, expanding and diversifying our portfolio across our therapeutic areas.  We enter 2021 with a larger, more balanced clinical pipeline that gives us the opportunity to advance important new therapies aimed at addressing significant unmet medical needs now and in the future.  Through acquisitions, partnerships, and by advancing internal candidates, we grew our portfolio of projects by 50% last year, and I look forward to sharing more about that with you today.  I'll start with oncology. In 2020, we significantly enhanced our oncology portfolio that now has 27 internal clinical stage oncology programs aimed at patients with the greatest unmet medical needs.  At the center of our oncology portfolio is, of course, Trodelvy. As Dan and Joanna mentioned, we anticipate several key clinical milestones this year that will help us broaden Trodelvy's views and understand which patients are most likely to benefit.  With the accelerated approval for third line, metastatic, triple negative breast cancer in hand, we look forward to the anticipated full approval of Trodelvy for patients with metastatic third line triple negative breast cancers supported by the confirmatory Phase III ASCENT study.  You'll recall that these are really strong data. Despite having received a median of four prior anti-cancer regimens, patients treated with Trodelvy showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival, with a median survival of 12.1 months compared with 6.7 months for chemotherapy and a hazard ratio of 0.48. These data had been accepted for publication and we anticipate publication of these results in a peer-reviewed journal early this year. These data have set Trodelvy on the path to becoming the new standard of care for patients with third line metastatic triple negative breast cancer.  Additional data have demonstrated that Trodelvy has a potential to transform care for people with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, the most common form of bladder cancer. We've submitted an application for accelerated approval to the FDA and anticipate a decision in the first half of this year.  Next, we're looking to further expand Trodelvy for patients with hormone receptor positive HER2 negative breast cancer, which accounts for approximately 70% to 75% of all forms of breast cancer. And those study results are expected in the second half of the year.  Beyond breast and bladder cancers, we're working quickly to explore other tumors with the goal of establishing the breadth of Trodelvy's activity. We'll continue to evaluate the role of HER2 expression in tumors along the way. One of the trials we're leveraging is a TROPiCS-03 basket study where we continue to enroll patients We plan to provide an update on this study, particularly non-small cell lung cancer, in the second half of this year. We are proceeding at risk with plans to start a randomized study in lung cancer in the second half of the year as well, pending for TROPICS-03 data. We expect to begin a substantial number of new studies with Trodelvy this year, adding to the four internal and 13 ongoing investigator-sponsored studies.  Now moving on to magrolimab, we're rapidly advancing this program with the goal of helping patients with hematologic malignancies and exploring the role of CD-47 inhibition in the treatment of solid tumors. The first solid tumor studies are set to begin as early as this year.  We expect results from the Phase Ib study in MDS later this year, which will inform our ongoing discussions with the FDA. Pending these data, we could potentially file for accelerated approval.  In addition, we've begun enrolling patients in the Phase III ENHANCE study intended to support full approval and to confirm the Phase Ib data.  Moving to Kite, we're very pleased with the progress of our colleagues at Kite that has been made with the company's cell therapy medicines, bringing Yescarta and Tecartus to new diseases and to patients earlier in their treatment.  In addition to the second line DLBCL data that Dan mentioned that are expected in the first half of this year, we filed for approval to expand the use of Yescarta to patients with indolent NHL. If approved, this would be the first CAR T therapy for patients with this form of lymphoma.  We're also excited about the emerging data from our partnerships, including Arcus anti-TIGIT and CD-73 inhibitor programs, as well as our collaborations with Pioneer and Tizona to name a few.  Taken in total, these agreements in both oncology and other therapeutic areas allow us to expand the breadth of our portfolio with access to cutting edge research programs in a way that manages the risk of our internal portfolio. We've intentionally constructed a pipeline with a large number of programs in Phase I and fewer derisk programs in Phases II and III, with the goal of creating a long-term sustainable productive pipeline to fuel our future.  Turning the HIV, I want to echo Johanna's comments about the impact once a week Biktarvy has for people living with HIV. At the same time, we recognize some individuals prefer less frequent long-acting regiments. We are excited about the potential of long-acting antivirals and believe that our capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, has a number of attributes that have important possibilities for both treatment and prevention.  Beginning with treatment, people living with HIV tell us that either a weekly oral regimen or a subcutaneous injection every three to six months are preferred regimens. As we look at how we'll combine lenacapavir with other agents, the potential dosing flexibility of lenacapavir offers possibilities to explore in clinical research, both oral and subcutaneous administration.  We expect to identify an internally developed agent or an external partner for lenacapavir to move into combination trials over the next 12 to 18 months. This will complement our first lenacapavir FDA filing expected in the second half of this year for use in heavily treatment experienced individuals with HIV.  Turning to prevention, we also believe there are many people for whom subcutaneous injection possibly as infrequently as once every six months could provide a significant advantage. I'm pleased to share that we'll begin Phase III studies this year with lenacapavir as monotherapy for the prevention of HIV. We're planning two Phase III studies.  The first will be in cisgender men, transgender women and men, and gender non-binary people who have sex with men. That will begin in the first half of 2021. The second is in adolescent girls and young women, and that'll begin in the second half of 2021.  Finally, I want to close with some commentary on Veklury and our ongoing commitment to patients amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Like so many others, we're encouraged to see the progress with the approval of the first vaccines and induction of other therapeutics. Veklury continues to be a critical tool for patients and physicians in the fight against COVID-19.  Clinical data from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled NIAID ACTT-1 trial has established the efficacy and safety of remdesivir. The Gilead-sponsored simple studies and real world patient and physician experience continue to support the critical role of Veklury as a standard of care in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.  Veklury is the only antiviral medicine that has been approved or granted temporary authorization for the treatment of COVID-19 in approximately 50 countries worldwide. We welcome the addition of new medicines that are helping to ease the burden and we'll continue to work to understand how best to use Veklury and how to advance the use of Veklury in additional settings and formulations, with the goal of treating additional patients who may benefit. As Dan shared with you, you can expect to hear from us often as we look ahead toward a number of exciting milestones. A growing pipeline means we hope to have more data to share and more news about regulatory filings.  We're focused on delivering important transformative therapies to improve care for people with serious illnesses, and I look forward to discussing the expansion of Trodelvy, magrolimab data, the lenacapavir milestones and the initiation of key Phase III trials over the course of the year.  Now, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. \nMichael Yee: Congrats on a great year. My question is maybe for Andy or Dan. When you think about the various uncertainties about growth that I think has been a bit of a controversy for Gilead and a little bit muddied for Veklury recently, do you think about 2021 as a growth year into 2022? And put another way, do you think that this is a trough period and you're very confident about growth off this year? Thank you so much. \nDaniel O'Day: I'll start and then add Andy to provide a bit. Look, I think you heard us at JP Morgan. I think we reiterate our confidence that the next chapter of Gilead is here and that we are very confident in our ability to grow the business in the top and bottom line, excluding Veklury. It doesn't belie \u2013 our confidence in Veklury exists, but of course \u2013 and we're seeing it track, obviously, very well with hospitalizations. But we also want to have, and we want you to have confidence in our ability to grow the underlying business, excluding Veklury.  So, yes, we're committed to that. Yeah, I think you see that in the guidance that we delivered here today for 2021. And we're committed \u2013 and that's despite the fact that we are offsetting significant amount of generic erosion with Atripla and Truvada. So, obviously, as we head into 2022 and beyond, we don't have that headwind as well.  So, I would pass it over to Andy for some additional comments as well from your side, Andy.\nAndrew Dickinson: The simple answer to your question is yes. I think that we do see this as a really important year where we said at JP Morgan, picking up on Dan's points, we expect to grow in the short term, the medium term, and the long run from here, and we think we have all the puzzle pieces together that will allow us to do that.  Our guidance, and you see in some of the pages that we tried to help people think through the core business and the materials that we posted, and I would emphasize and focus people on the 9% to 10% growth in the core business excluding the impact of the LOEs. So, we're going to grow through the LOEs, and then we think we should have some additional momentum coming out of 2021 into the subsequent years. And we also have a very capital-efficient and efficient corporate model, as you know, Michael. So, when you talk about kind of bottom-line growth, we see a lot of potential for leverage as we're driving top line growth to really expand the EPS growth over the coming years as well. So, we're excited about where we are and where we're going and look forward to updating you throughout the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. \nMatthew Harrison: A two part on lenacapavir for me. One, can you talk a little bit in detail about what internal combinations you might be pursuing in terms of mechanisms and how you might be able to give us some idea around when we might see some initial data on those.  And second, can you just talk about the dosing frequency that you're going to be pursuing in the monotherapy studies? Are you going to look at six months only or are you going to look at other frequencies for the PrEP study? Thanks.\nDaniel O'Day: I'm going to hand it over to Merdad, obviously, but just a couple of points to kind of frame this. I think there are two points I want to make. One is, Gilead has prided itself on making sure we really understand what patients need out there every step of the way for the past couple of decades, which led us obviously to the robustness around Biktarvy as really the standard of care in the treatment setting and Descovy. And we also pursue a philosophy of having an anchor molecule. And what we're really excited about with capsid is this presents the opportunity for a true anchor molecule for long acting that meets patients' needs, the types of needs that we think are really going to move, potentially move some of the patients from a very convenient one from once a day to a less frequent dosing. So, I remind you that we've got lots of options with lenacapavir. And I'll turn it over to Merdad to go through some of those. Over to you, Merdad.\nMerdad Parsey: To your point, we haven't talked too much about it. Look, we have a number of internal assets that we can combine with lenacapavir, given that lenacapavir is a capsid inhibitor and gives us a lot of flexibility to look for what the second component could be there. So, ranging from things like bictegravir and TAF to other things in our pipeline , we believe those can all internally form part of a combination regimen going forward. We would anticipate that we'll start doing Phase I studies this year, and then data will follow from that in terms of which combination partner we would choose.  On the second part of your question whether we would look only at six months, I would say it's important to think about lenacapavir both having oral and subcutaneous approaches. So, on the oral side, we think we can dose orally about once a week. And so, that could form one regimen that we would approach to go for a once-weekly oral regimen. For subcu, it'll partly depend on what the combination molecule would be and what dosing interval we can get with that. We'd certainly like to target six months, but if necessary, we can go to every three months or something like that, so it'll really depend on what the partner is. The key issue here is that we have a lot of flexibility with lenacapavir, and it gives us a lot of options to sort of see how we can work, and that's where we're going to go.  And the last thing I'd say is for PrEP, the studies I mentioned, the ones that are getting started are going to be every six months. So, that is the regimen we're using for PrEP.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor.\nAlethia Young: Congrats on everything that you've done over the past 12 months. I kind of wanted to stay with lenacapavir a little bit. And it seems like there's a robust backbone potential. And I guess I want to get your perspective on the potential opportunity to grow the market from where you are since you could possibly use it in both treatment and prevention or do you kind of see it more like an opportunity for switches? And if so, like, what drugs do you think Biktarvy switches are a potentially likely thing? Thanks.\nDaniel O'Day: Johanna and her team have done a lot of work on it. So, I'll let her start and see if anybody else in the team wants to add. Over to you, Johanna.\nJohanna Mercier: I think the way we're looking at it, and I'll start with actually the first filing, right, which is heavily treatment experienced, which is expected to file towards the end of this year. I think that one for us was really an opportunity to go into the market, fast opportunity to get physician experience with lenacapavir and kind of create that foundation for lena.  I would split up the question between treatment and PrEP. I think in treatment, the expectation is the market will continue to grow at the 2%, 3% that we've been seeing year-over-year. And so, I think it'll be little bit of a switch from oral to long acting within the treatment. I think the real opportunity for expansion with long acting will be in the prevention market. We've said before that we've only scratched the surface at about 20%, 25% of the total market today in prevention with Truvada and Descovy. I think the opportunity really is to expand that market with long actings that would make it much more flexible for folks, people at risk of HIV. And so, I think that's a true expansion strategy, but more intervention than in treatment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets.\nBrian Abrahams: Congrats on all the progress. I'm interested in learning more about the upside and use you might expect in Yescarta with the DLBCL second line readout. And I guess I'm curious, how much of any current hurdles are related to complexity of administration and pandemic versus the labeled indication and available data. And when you do get the ZUMA-7 data, what are some of the pushes and pulls with respect to efficacy and safety that would guide how you'd look at the future growth opportunity in CAR T? Thanks. \nDaniel O'Day: We're very enthusiastic about the potential for Yescarta and obviously the second line readout. And Christi is on the line. So, I'll let her break down the different pieces of that for you between COVID and non-COVID some of the dynamics. So, over to you, Christi.\nChristi Shaw: Overall, from a cell therapy performance, we grew 33% year-over-year. As you look at Yescarta, it's growing externally, outside the US, in what we call ACE, which is Europe, Canada and Australia. Also in the US, Tecartus is growing significantly above our expectations. The dynamic in the US for Yescarta is a couple fold. As we saw with our other CAR T therapies on the market, the class overall has declined from 23% to 20%, which is significant in Q4. And the reason for that is referrals are down because of COVID, obviously, and that's driving the majority of it and also a lack of ICU beds. The lack of ICU beds does disproportionately affect Yescarta because majority of our sales are in the inpatient sites.  So, as we look at what specifically, not just COVID overall, but you dig down to under what is COVID, you have the referral aspect when the community physicians aren't seeing patients, patients aren't going into the offices and then you also have, at the ATC, the issue of ICU bed capacity, and where else can you treat those patients? So, overall, the biggest driver is the class share decline. And secondarily is a little bit of the product sales baseline, the ICU beds. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. \nGeoffrey Porges: Just have some slightly housekeeping questions. First, Andy, could just give us a sense of what your share count guidance is for 2021? Secondly, Merdad, could you tell us whether you're seeing any remdesivir resistant variants emerging and indeed whether remdesivir is active against these variants that have been identified already? And then lastly, perhaps Dan could tell us why shouldn't we look at the buy-in to Arcus as a positive indicator for your expectations for one of the upcoming readouts? Why would you have done that if you weren't positively inclined to those events?\nDaniel O'Day: Andy, why don't you start. Merdad and I'll bring us home. \nAndrew Dickinson: On the share count, we're assuming a flat share count year-over-year. So, to be clear, the EPS guidance is not being driven by share buybacks or share counts. Our base assumption is that we will just do repurchases to offset employee stock issuance over the year. We maintain, obviously, the flexibility to opportunistically repurchase more shares if we conclude over the year that that's a good use of our capital. But right now, the base case is that we will just repurchase shares to offset employee share issuance. \nMerdad Parsey: Just to follow up on your question on resistance, as you know, most of the variants that have popped up are in the spike protein. And that's been the source of the problem, which is why people are talking about sort of the vaccine issues and potentially the monoclonal antibodies because they're directed at the spike. But remdesivir targets the RNA polymerase.  So, for the RNA polymerase, we haven't seen so far mutants that would impact the efficacy of remdesivir at least when we're looking at the sequences. So far, knock wood, we haven't seen anything.\nGeoffrey Porges: Can I just follow-up? Have you sequenced any individuals who've failed remdesivir to see if there's any resistance in the virus? \nMerdad Parsey: We have not to my knowledge. \nDaniel O'Day: And, Geoff, just bringing us home, I think you asked a bit of a double negative question. Let me put it into a positive. I think you can read into our continued investment in Arcus as us viewing the entirety of their portfolio as attractive, right? Not any one asset. But I'll just mention a couple.  Of course, in the TIGIT space, there are potentially two different mechanisms, as you know, both an FC and a non-FC receptor. There's a variety of adenosine programs. There's the PERIOD-1. And there's a variety of earlier stage programs. So I think you're absolutely right to see that additional investment as an additional confidence in the science and frankly the people at Arcus. And we're very, very pleased with the way we're cooperating and collaborating. Couldn't be more seamless. And the opportunity I think to think of [technical difficulty]/  I was just going to emphasize, in addition to the Arcus portfolio, the combination potential with our other agents, we're really excited about the potential to think about two, possibly three drug combinations between what we have within our Gilead portfolio today, the Arcus portfolio and other options that we have now and in the future. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Truist. \nRobyn Karnauskas: Two ones. One on Arcus and ARC-7, obviously, if the triple works, that's game changing. You're one of the few companies that has the triple. And I was just thinking about the amount of trials you might want to begin at that point. So like, talk to me a little bit about how you're thinking about margins and maintaining margins with so many trials that you might want to begin and the robustness of that. And then also talk to me about, do you have a perspective on the likelihood of the combination, a triple combination working versus the doublet because other people have the doublet. So, I'm just getting your perspective on the confidence you have, and then also on thinking about all these trials that you may want to begin, and if you can maintain some sort of \u2013 give us some sense of margins and R&D expense going in the out years. Thanks.\nAndrew Dickinson: It's Andy. Let me start with \u2013 we lost Dave again. Sorry. Let me start with the margin question. So, we're not providing longer term guidance, but we have flexibility in the way that we structured the deals as you know. So, until we opt in, the R&D expense is borne by Arcus, as with many of our partnerships. Obviously, we're planning for success and looking at our R&D expense in the future and making sure that we have the flexibility in our capital structure and otherwise to push these programs forward if the data supports it. And we have a lot of leverage in our models. So we, again, have very strong margins. At a high level, Robyn, what I'd say is we don't expect that any of the opt-ins unless we're really opting into all of the programs across the board that we have options on would fundamentally change our margin profile. And if they did, obviously, that would be in the short term, potentially a good problem to have. So, we're really comfortable with the structure that we have, where we are with our margins today, where we see them going. We like our R&D load today in terms of the amount of scale we've added to our R&D programs and our spend levels. You see that we're going to work very hard to manage our expenses thoughtfully with our team. So, from our vantage point, we're in a good spot.  Let me hand it over to Merdad on the clinical question. \nMerdad Parsey: It's a great observation. And I think one of the things we really appreciate about the team at Arcus is they're really focused on two things, with the TIGIT asset. In particular, one is to, to try to be as fast as possible, taking the appropriate kinds of risks to make sure that we are really in the hunt. And I think what's exciting there is a possibility to be potentially second to market with that asset. And secondly, to look at combinations within the portfolio to look for evidence of even better activity that could really position us uniquely out there. So, getting back to the earlier question about Arcus and our relationship, they're a very impressive group and have been doing great work. So, we're excited to see how those data play out.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.\nCory Kasimov: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the latest trends you're seeing in the PrEP market today and how we should be thinking about that? Really thinking about Descovy going forward in the face of Truvada generics, especially given that it wasn't in your more granular sales guidance slide either up as a like a headwind or a tailwind?\nJohanna Mercier: As I mentioned, earlier, this year has been actually quite stable. So, what we've seen is really, with Truvada LOE, what we've seen is a little bit of mix within Truvada between branded and generic. But we haven't seen that impacted Descovy at all. On the contrary, it stayed strong at that level of share. And we expect that to continue to basically be anywhere between 40% and 45% or so throughout the year.  Having said that, we did see a little bit of a decline quarter over quarter, about 6% or so. And that was largely due to the contracting to maintain some commercial access. So, the one difference has been much more around \u2013 because it's TAP, because it's in prevention, it's highly commercially \u2013 commercial payers. And so therefore, we're really quite focused on just making sure that people at risk have access to Descovy in light of its strong profile and safety profile that it offers. And so, we've definitely seen erosion with Truvada, strong erosion in Q4. And that will continue as we think about coming quarters this year. But really, from a Descovy standpoint, the expectation is that we continue to maintain strong commercial access. And obviously, that might mean a little bit more contracting. So, a little bit more discount on that front. But one that's important for us to make sure that people living at risk have access to Descovy as we continue forward. So, hopefully, that kind of addresses your question on PrEP market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore. \nUmer Raffat: I have two, if I may. First, perhaps on Trodelvy, I know there's the HR positive Phase III coming up in breast. And my question was that originally the protocol allowed for an interim ORR analysis to support an accelerated approval. I'm curious if that still happening in the first half.  And secondly, curious what the observations are to date from the inhaled remdesivir's Phase Ib in early COVID. And I'm mostly wondering, given the ongoing pandemic as well as given all the Phase III safety data, what if the Phase Ib data form the basis for a potential EUA along with the safety data that exists? Thank you very much.\nMerdad Parsey: So, on Trodelvy, you're right that there was a planned ORR. But we don't think that the ORR evaluation, the interim analysis was actually going to form substantive enough data to get an approval in HR positive. So what we did is we looked initially at the study as part of the evaluation together with the team in Immunomedics. We resized the study to power it appropriately for overall survival. And at the end of the year, we'll read out PFS, which we think has a much better opportunity for reading out and giving us a fileable endpoint. So, I think that was really the \u2013 our conclusion was essentially that the ORR was only just going to cost us alphabet, not really get us something that we could file with. And we have not unblinded any data. It was not based on anything other than wanting to get to the PFS.  So, on the inhaled remdesivir, it's going well. That study is moving through Phase I and has moved move forward nicely. And, no, the Phase I study is probably not adequate \u2013 not probably, it's not adequate for approval. When you move from parenteral to an inhaled approach, it's effectively moving it to a drug device combination approach. And so, all the issues there \u2013 a PK bridge is usually when you can show that the exposure is the same, but since the exposure will be very different systemically, it will be \u2013 primarily, the exposure will be in the lung. You can't do a bridging for PK. So, it ends up being a clinical efficacy question as opposed to just a PK question. So, the studies are designed to \u2013 will be designed to go forward with evidence of clinical efficacy for approval.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. \nTerence Flynn: I was just wondering if you can comment at all about breadth of prescribing with Trodelvy, what you're currently seeing out there, how you expect that to change over the course of the year. And then the randomized lung cancer trial that you mentioned, Merdad, would that be a Phase II or Phase III trial? And then just one for Andy on the expense cadence in 2021, what that looks like if you were to exclude kind of underlying remdesivir spend? Thank you.\nJohanna Mercier: I think we're really pleased to see the evolution of Trodelvy, right? It's only eight months in, so they haven't had a full year yet. And what we're seeing in 2020 is very encouraging. As of last October, more than one out of four patients were initiated on Trodelvy in third line metastatic triple negative breast cancer. What we also are seeing is, in December, when physicians were actually asked to report their own prescribing, so a little bit of an ATU type approach, they were suggesting somewhere north of 40% of their third line metastatic triple negative breast cancer patients were receiving Trodelvy. And so, we're seeing a nice uptake. I think we have an opportunity to continue that uptake as we think about expanding not only in the academic centers, but also with our community providers. And I think that's the opportunity as we think in the next little while. And I think that'll be driven mostly with the fact that we'll be able to promote the overall survival data soon with the FDA approval, the full approval for the ASCENT data and the publication. So, all of those things will be important inflection points for us as we move forward. But we're very excited as we see positions and really getting physician feedback around making sure that they can get through their second line options pretty quickly to get to third line and we have very strong payer support as well in reimbursement. So there's been no barriers on that front either. So good shape so far. I'll turn it over to Merdad on the lung cancer question.\nMerdad Parsey: Just to be clear, maybe I'll just say both. So, the study I was referencing that will read out for PFS is a hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative study. That is a Phase III study. For lung cancer, right now, it's a Phase I study, the TROPiCS-03 studies, a Phase I basket trial. And pending those data, we would \u2013 our plan is that we would open a Phase III trial in lung cancer in the second half of the year. \nAndrew Dickinson: Terrence, on your last question, we haven't provided specific expense guidance on any of our products. As you know, what we've said on remdesivir is that there still will be a meaningful amount of expenses in 2021, as you'd expect, but the expense load is lower than it was in 2020. And we're not providing more specific guidance, but it's real. It's important. We continue to see the significant potential for the product for patients. So, we're continuing to invest appropriately. And it is baked into our guidance, but it's a reduction year-over-year.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company.\nPhil Nadeau: Congrats on the progress. Just two follow up questions for me. First for Johanna on Descovy. You suggested that maybe there's a little price compression because of renegotiations with commercial plans with the availability of Truvada generic. As we're doing our modeling, should we expect another round of negotiations after more generics enter in Q2 and could that impact price in the second half of 2021? Merdad, a question for you on Trodelvy. Just to follow up on that Phase III lung cancer study. I believe this is the first time we've heard you're kind of committing to moving forward there. What gave rise to that? Is the data you're seeing from the basket study or something you saw at World Lung. And what do you need to see from TROPiCS-03 in order to stick with that plan? Thank you. \nJohanna Mercier: So exactly what you described. I think we're going to be very choiceful. And obviously, it needs to make sense. But there could be continued pressures. I think we've seen many of them. And we've been managing it as best we can to make sure that people living at risk do have access to Descovy as it really is quite differentiated.  I think as you think about your model for 2021, there's two pieces. One is, as you know, the market in prevention was quite depressed because of the pandemic. And we started to see us coming out of it in Q3. But of course, in Q4, with a surge of cases in hospitalization, we saw that dampening again. Assuming that we come back to some new normal this year, we should see that market pick up again. So between the market pickup, as well as some continued smaller price contractions, I think those two things will balance each other out quite nicely.\nMerdad Parsey: And then on the Trodelvy, so the way we're thinking about it is that \u2013 Phil, is that, as you know, the disclosed data from Immunomedics on lung have been promising. Because of the competitive situation right now with other molecules in lung, our own interest in lung, and the fact that we'll see additional data from tropics three, we are planning at risk to do a Phase III study. Now, that will depend entirely on how the data read out and the strength of the data. We may need to or want to adapt from there. But we want to be aggressive and make sure that we don't lose any advantage that we may have. So, we're just being aggressive based on our conviction on the molecule and MOA. \nDaniel O'Day: And it just leaves me to just say a few things at the end. I know I speak on behalf of the entire leadership team that we are clearly behind this next chapter of growth in Gilead. And it's here. And it's a variety of things. Of course, it's a clear path to growth in a sustainable and diverse portfolio. It's also the fact that we have a stable dividend that we're committed to growing over time with an industry leading dividend yield, consistently strong cash flow, robust balance sheet.  So, we're entering 2021 with confidence on this clear path to growth. And I think you'll see us deliver on our new opportunities in oncology and sustain our leadership in HIV. And we look forward to updating you every quarter on our progress throughout 2021.  So, thank you all for joining. I'll let Andrew have the last word here. But I also want to make sure we thank all the colleagues at Gilead and our partners that made all this possible.  So, Andrew, over to you. \nAndrew Dickinson: Thank you to them. And thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and the team here looks forward to providing you with the updates on our future progress. Thanks again.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Merdad Parsey",
            "content": "Thanks, Johanna. And good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to share with you some updates on our pipeline as we made tremendous progress in 2020, expanding and diversifying our portfolio across our therapeutic areas.  We enter 2021 with a larger, more balanced clinical pipeline that gives us the opportunity to advance important new therapies aimed at addressing significant unmet medical needs now and in the future.  Through acquisitions, partnerships, and by advancing internal candidates, we grew our portfolio of projects by 50% last year, and I look forward to sharing more about that with you today.  I'll start with oncology. In 2020, we significantly enhanced our oncology portfolio that now has 27 internal clinical stage oncology programs aimed at patients with the greatest unmet medical needs.  At the center of our oncology portfolio is, of course, Trodelvy. As Dan and Joanna mentioned, we anticipate several key clinical milestones this year that will help us broaden Trodelvy's views and understand which patients are most likely to benefit.  With the accelerated approval for third line, metastatic, triple negative breast cancer in hand, we look forward to the anticipated full approval of Trodelvy for patients with metastatic third line triple negative breast cancers supported by the confirmatory Phase III ASCENT study.  You'll recall that these are really strong data. Despite having received a median of four prior anti-cancer regimens, patients treated with Trodelvy showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival, with a median survival of 12.1 months compared with 6.7 months for chemotherapy and a hazard ratio of 0.48. These data had been accepted for publication and we anticipate publication of these results in a peer-reviewed journal early this year. These data have set Trodelvy on the path to becoming the new standard of care for patients with third line metastatic triple negative breast cancer.  Additional data have demonstrated that Trodelvy has a potential to transform care for people with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, the most common form of bladder cancer. We've submitted an application for accelerated approval to the FDA and anticipate a decision in the first half of this year.  Next, we're looking to further expand Trodelvy for patients with hormone receptor positive HER2 negative breast cancer, which accounts for approximately 70% to 75% of all forms of breast cancer. And those study results are expected in the second half of the year.  Beyond breast and bladder cancers, we're working quickly to explore other tumors with the goal of establishing the breadth of Trodelvy's activity. We'll continue to evaluate the role of HER2 expression in tumors along the way. One of the trials we're leveraging is a TROPiCS-03 basket study where we continue to enroll patients We plan to provide an update on this study, particularly non-small cell lung cancer, in the second half of this year. We are proceeding at risk with plans to start a randomized study in lung cancer in the second half of the year as well, pending for TROPICS-03 data. We expect to begin a substantial number of new studies with Trodelvy this year, adding to the four internal and 13 ongoing investigator-sponsored studies.  Now moving on to magrolimab, we're rapidly advancing this program with the goal of helping patients with hematologic malignancies and exploring the role of CD-47 inhibition in the treatment of solid tumors. The first solid tumor studies are set to begin as early as this year.  We expect results from the Phase Ib study in MDS later this year, which will inform our ongoing discussions with the FDA. Pending these data, we could potentially file for accelerated approval.  In addition, we've begun enrolling patients in the Phase III ENHANCE study intended to support full approval and to confirm the Phase Ib data.  Moving to Kite, we're very pleased with the progress of our colleagues at Kite that has been made with the company's cell therapy medicines, bringing Yescarta and Tecartus to new diseases and to patients earlier in their treatment.  In addition to the second line DLBCL data that Dan mentioned that are expected in the first half of this year, we filed for approval to expand the use of Yescarta to patients with indolent NHL. If approved, this would be the first CAR T therapy for patients with this form of lymphoma.  We're also excited about the emerging data from our partnerships, including Arcus anti-TIGIT and CD-73 inhibitor programs, as well as our collaborations with Pioneer and Tizona to name a few.  Taken in total, these agreements in both oncology and other therapeutic areas allow us to expand the breadth of our portfolio with access to cutting edge research programs in a way that manages the risk of our internal portfolio. We've intentionally constructed a pipeline with a large number of programs in Phase I and fewer derisk programs in Phases II and III, with the goal of creating a long-term sustainable productive pipeline to fuel our future.  Turning the HIV, I want to echo Johanna's comments about the impact once a week Biktarvy has for people living with HIV. At the same time, we recognize some individuals prefer less frequent long-acting regiments. We are excited about the potential of long-acting antivirals and believe that our capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, has a number of attributes that have important possibilities for both treatment and prevention.  Beginning with treatment, people living with HIV tell us that either a weekly oral regimen or a subcutaneous injection every three to six months are preferred regimens. As we look at how we'll combine lenacapavir with other agents, the potential dosing flexibility of lenacapavir offers possibilities to explore in clinical research, both oral and subcutaneous administration.  We expect to identify an internally developed agent or an external partner for lenacapavir to move into combination trials over the next 12 to 18 months. This will complement our first lenacapavir FDA filing expected in the second half of this year for use in heavily treatment experienced individuals with HIV.  Turning to prevention, we also believe there are many people for whom subcutaneous injection possibly as infrequently as once every six months could provide a significant advantage. I'm pleased to share that we'll begin Phase III studies this year with lenacapavir as monotherapy for the prevention of HIV. We're planning two Phase III studies.  The first will be in cisgender men, transgender women and men, and gender non-binary people who have sex with men. That will begin in the first half of 2021. The second is in adolescent girls and young women, and that'll begin in the second half of 2021.  Finally, I want to close with some commentary on Veklury and our ongoing commitment to patients amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Like so many others, we're encouraged to see the progress with the approval of the first vaccines and induction of other therapeutics. Veklury continues to be a critical tool for patients and physicians in the fight against COVID-19.  Clinical data from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled NIAID ACTT-1 trial has established the efficacy and safety of remdesivir. The Gilead-sponsored simple studies and real world patient and physician experience continue to support the critical role of Veklury as a standard of care in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.  Veklury is the only antiviral medicine that has been approved or granted temporary authorization for the treatment of COVID-19 in approximately 50 countries worldwide. We welcome the addition of new medicines that are helping to ease the burden and we'll continue to work to understand how best to use Veklury and how to advance the use of Veklury in additional settings and formulations, with the goal of treating additional patients who may benefit. As Dan shared with you, you can expect to hear from us often as we look ahead toward a number of exciting milestones. A growing pipeline means we hope to have more data to share and more news about regulatory filings.  We're focused on delivering important transformative therapies to improve care for people with serious illnesses, and I look forward to discussing the expansion of Trodelvy, magrolimab data, the lenacapavir milestones and the initiation of key Phase III trials over the course of the year.  Now, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator? To your point, we haven't talked too much about it. Look, we have a number of internal assets that we can combine with lenacapavir, given that lenacapavir is a capsid inhibitor and gives us a lot of flexibility to look for what the second component could be there. So, ranging from things like bictegravir and TAF to other things in our pipeline , we believe those can all internally form part of a combination regimen going forward. We would anticipate that we'll start doing Phase I studies this year, and then data will follow from that in terms of which combination partner we would choose.  On the second part of your question whether we would look only at six months, I would say it's important to think about lenacapavir both having oral and subcutaneous approaches. So, on the oral side, we think we can dose orally about once a week. And so, that could form one regimen that we would approach to go for a once-weekly oral regimen. For subcu, it'll partly depend on what the combination molecule would be and what dosing interval we can get with that. We'd certainly like to target six months, but if necessary, we can go to every three months or something like that, so it'll really depend on what the partner is. The key issue here is that we have a lot of flexibility with lenacapavir, and it gives us a lot of options to sort of see how we can work, and that's where we're going to go.  And the last thing I'd say is for PrEP, the studies I mentioned, the ones that are getting started are going to be every six months. So, that is the regimen we're using for PrEP. Just to follow up on your question on resistance, as you know, most of the variants that have popped up are in the spike protein. And that's been the source of the problem, which is why people are talking about sort of the vaccine issues and potentially the monoclonal antibodies because they're directed at the spike. But remdesivir targets the RNA polymerase.  So, for the RNA polymerase, we haven't seen so far mutants that would impact the efficacy of remdesivir at least when we're looking at the sequences. So far, knock wood, we haven't seen anything. We have not to my knowledge. It's a great observation. And I think one of the things we really appreciate about the team at Arcus is they're really focused on two things, with the TIGIT asset. In particular, one is to, to try to be as fast as possible, taking the appropriate kinds of risks to make sure that we are really in the hunt. And I think what's exciting there is a possibility to be potentially second to market with that asset. And secondly, to look at combinations within the portfolio to look for evidence of even better activity that could really position us uniquely out there. So, getting back to the earlier question about Arcus and our relationship, they're a very impressive group and have been doing great work. So, we're excited to see how those data play out. So, on Trodelvy, you're right that there was a planned ORR. But we don't think that the ORR evaluation, the interim analysis was actually going to form substantive enough data to get an approval in HR positive. So what we did is we looked initially at the study as part of the evaluation together with the team in Immunomedics. We resized the study to power it appropriately for overall survival. And at the end of the year, we'll read out PFS, which we think has a much better opportunity for reading out and giving us a fileable endpoint. So, I think that was really the \u2013 our conclusion was essentially that the ORR was only just going to cost us alphabet, not really get us something that we could file with. And we have not unblinded any data. It was not based on anything other than wanting to get to the PFS.  So, on the inhaled remdesivir, it's going well. That study is moving through Phase I and has moved move forward nicely. And, no, the Phase I study is probably not adequate \u2013 not probably, it's not adequate for approval. When you move from parenteral to an inhaled approach, it's effectively moving it to a drug device combination approach. And so, all the issues there \u2013 a PK bridge is usually when you can show that the exposure is the same, but since the exposure will be very different systemically, it will be \u2013 primarily, the exposure will be in the lung. You can't do a bridging for PK. So, it ends up being a clinical efficacy question as opposed to just a PK question. So, the studies are designed to \u2013 will be designed to go forward with evidence of clinical efficacy for approval. Just to be clear, maybe I'll just say both. So, the study I was referencing that will read out for PFS is a hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative study. That is a Phase III study. For lung cancer, right now, it's a Phase I study, the TROPiCS-03 studies, a Phase I basket trial. And pending those data, we would \u2013 our plan is that we would open a Phase III trial in lung cancer in the second half of the year. And then on the Trodelvy, so the way we're thinking about it is that \u2013 Phil, is that, as you know, the disclosed data from Immunomedics on lung have been promising. Because of the competitive situation right now with other molecules in lung, our own interest in lung, and the fact that we'll see additional data from tropics three, we are planning at risk to do a Phase III study. Now, that will depend entirely on how the data read out and the strength of the data. We may need to or want to adapt from there. But we want to be aggressive and make sure that we don't lose any advantage that we may have. So, we're just being aggressive based on our conviction on the molecule and MOA."

            "name": "Daniel O'Day",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew. And good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to have this opportunity to provide an update on our progress and answer your questions. I'll begin by offering brief remarks and then hand off to the team to go into more detail.  Before I begin, I want to thank all those who contributed to the progress we will highlight today, both our teams across the company and our many partners and collaborators worldwide.  Let me start by looking back at the fourth quarter. Our work continued across three main areas as it had throughout 2020, responding to the pandemic with our antiviral therapy, Veklury, delivering on our commitment to people with HIV, cancer, viral hepatitis, and other conditions; and thirdly, executing on our strategy. As a result of our efforts to expand and strengthen our portfolio, we're going into 2021 in a very different position to how we began 2020.  Last month, we provided updated guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2020 to ensure that you had a clear picture coming into today's earnings announcement. This updated guidance was largely based on the significant increase in the uptake of Veklury.  In the United States alone, hospitalizations quadrupled between October and January, and approximately one out of every two patients hospitalized in the US are being treated with Veklury today.  We're grateful that Veklury is able to play such an important role in getting patients out of the hospital faster, five days on average based on the NIAID ACTT-1 trial, especially as many parts of the world struggle with hospital capacity.  The higher uptake of Veklury along with the continued growth of our leading treatment for HIV, Biktarvy, helped to offset the ongoing impact of the pandemic on some parts of our business. Veklury and Biktarvy also helped to mitigate the expected impact of loss of exclusivity for Atripla and Truvada in October.  Our efforts to build out our portfolio of medicines continued in the fourth quarter, with our agreement to acquire MYR. The acquisition, which is on track to close in the first quarter of this year, subject to regulatory clearances and other closing conditions, will bring us a first in class medicine called Hepcludex for the treatment of hepatitis D or HDV.  This is the most severe form of viral hepatitis and affects some patients who are already infected with hepatitis B. Hepcludex is conditionally approved in Europe and has FDA breakthrough therapy designation as an investigational agent in the United States.  The acquisition of Immunomedics closed in the fourth quarter, bringing the most significant recent addition to our pipeline, Trodelvy. Trodelvy is a foundational medicine in our cancer portfolio with significant potential across multiple tumor types. We're very pleased with how the integration with Immunomedics is going and look forward to updating you on our progress with Trodelvy.  Andy, Johanna, and Merdad will share more detail on the quarter. I'd like to turn now to the year ahead. The first thing I would say is that we're moving forward with a clear path to growth. We have multiple opportunities in new therapeutic areas, especially oncology. We're very pleased with the strong and diverse oncology portfolio we have today. This portfolio consists of both marketed therapies such as Trodelvy and Tecartus and Yescarta from Kite and programs across various stages of the pipeline. There are currently 27 internal ongoing clinical stage programs for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.  We also have many promising opt-in opportunities. One of those options is for the anti-TIGIT program through our collaboration with Arcus Biosciences. Earlier this week, it was announced that we are increasing our investment in Arcus to help fund the continued progress of the promising Arcus pipeline.  The foundation for our near- and long-term growth is our continued leadership in antivirals. We are confident in the longevity of our HIV business. We expect Biktarvy to continue to be a mainstay of HIV treatment long into the future. And our investigational capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, could be a best-in-class, long-acting option for both treatment and prevention. Lenacapavir is highly potent, and importantly it's flexible dosing profile gives us the potential to develop multiple long-acting treatment and prevention options.  In 2021, we expect a number of important milestones in the areas I've just mentioned. Merdad will provide more detail on the regulatory milestones, and I will highlight a few for now within the broader context of what you can expect from us.  Starting with our leadership in antivirals. We will of course be focused on the continued growth of Biktarvy and maintaining its leadership as the number one prescribed treatment for HIV in major markets. We plan to file an NDA in the US for lenacapavir in the heavily treatment-experienced population. This should be in the second half of the year.  We will also continue to explore the right options for combinations. In viral hepatitis, we look forward to expanding our business in HBV and HDV by growing sales of Vemlidy in the US and Asia; and pending completion of the MYR acquisition, the anticipated filing of a BLA in the second half of the year.  For Veklury, we look to realize the full potential of the therapy as the pandemic evolves. As you know, we are studying new formulations and routes of administration for Veklury as a treatment for COVID-19.  With the strong antiviral business as our foundation, we are looking forward to the continued expansion of oncology as a new pillar of growth. Trodelvy, which will have its first full year on the market following approval will be a significant contributor to our growth this year. We expect to hear about conversion from accelerated to full approval in the coming weeks based on the FDA review of the ASCENT data.  At the same time, we'll be pursuing the many pipeline opportunities for Trodelvy. It is currently being studied in 10 different tumor types. We expect to hear from the FDA on accelerated approval for Trodelvy in metastatic urothelial cancer in the first half of the year.  And we're also anticipating a readout of the Phase III TROPiCS-02 study in hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer in the second half.  Data from the Phase III ZUMA-7 study is expected in the first half of the year for Yescarta's potential expansion into second line DLBCL. And we should see Phase I-b data from magrolimab in MDS in the second half of the year with the possibility of a regulatory submission based on these results. In addition, we'll assess opt-in opportunities throughout the year as data becomes available and continue to advance our internal programs.  I want to add that we are focused on prioritizing in order to deliver on these opportunities. We now have a portfolio that allows us to be much more selective in terms of what we take forward. This means being very disciplined about investing where there is highest potential value. You've seen some of that with our decisions around filgotinib and our investment in Trodelvy.  Just briefly on the enterprise level activities, we will continue to expand our talent base and deepen our expertise outside antivirals as we did in 2020.  We will also maintain our strong focus on inclusion and diversity. As part of this, we are strengthening our efforts to promote racial equity. Today, we announced that Gilead has become a founding member of a coalition called OneTen. This is a group of US companies that is committed to hiring and promoting 1 million black Americans into family sustaining jobs over the next 10 years.  In addition, we'll continue to advance our ESG program and targets in line with our strategy. We will update you on our progress in these areas each quarter. There's a lot of important work ahead of us in 2021. And we're very much looking forward to turning our opportunities into tangible progress that will benefit patients, communities and our shareholders.  With that, I'll now pass over the call to Andy. I'll start and then add Andy to provide a bit. Look, I think you heard us at JP Morgan. I think we reiterate our confidence that the next chapter of Gilead is here and that we are very confident in our ability to grow the business in the top and bottom line, excluding Veklury. It doesn't belie \u2013 our confidence in Veklury exists, but of course \u2013 and we're seeing it track, obviously, very well with hospitalizations. But we also want to have, and we want you to have confidence in our ability to grow the underlying business, excluding Veklury.  So, yes, we're committed to that. Yeah, I think you see that in the guidance that we delivered here today for 2021. And we're committed \u2013 and that's despite the fact that we are offsetting significant amount of generic erosion with Atripla and Truvada. So, obviously, as we head into 2022 and beyond, we don't have that headwind as well.  So, I would pass it over to Andy for some additional comments as well from your side, Andy. I'm going to hand it over to Merdad, obviously, but just a couple of points to kind of frame this. I think there are two points I want to make. One is, Gilead has prided itself on making sure we really understand what patients need out there every step of the way for the past couple of decades, which led us obviously to the robustness around Biktarvy as really the standard of care in the treatment setting and Descovy. And we also pursue a philosophy of having an anchor molecule. And what we're really excited about with capsid is this presents the opportunity for a true anchor molecule for long acting that meets patients' needs, the types of needs that we think are really going to move, potentially move some of the patients from a very convenient one from once a day to a less frequent dosing. So, I remind you that we've got lots of options with lenacapavir. And I'll turn it over to Merdad to go through some of those. Over to you, Merdad. Johanna and her team have done a lot of work on it. So, I'll let her start and see if anybody else in the team wants to add. Over to you, Johanna. We're very enthusiastic about the potential for Yescarta and obviously the second line readout. And Christi is on the line. So, I'll let her break down the different pieces of that for you between COVID and non-COVID some of the dynamics. So, over to you, Christi. Andy, why don't you start. Merdad and I'll bring us home. And, Geoff, just bringing us home, I think you asked a bit of a double negative question. Let me put it into a positive. I think you can read into our continued investment in Arcus as us viewing the entirety of their portfolio as attractive, right? Not any one asset. But I'll just mention a couple.  Of course, in the TIGIT space, there are potentially two different mechanisms, as you know, both an FC and a non-FC receptor. There's a variety of adenosine programs. There's the PERIOD-1. And there's a variety of earlier stage programs. So I think you're absolutely right to see that additional investment as an additional confidence in the science and frankly the people at Arcus. And we're very, very pleased with the way we're cooperating and collaborating. Couldn't be more seamless. And the opportunity I think to think of [technical difficulty]/  I was just going to emphasize, in addition to the Arcus portfolio, the combination potential with our other agents, we're really excited about the potential to think about two, possibly three drug combinations between what we have within our Gilead portfolio today, the Arcus portfolio and other options that we have now and in the future. And it just leaves me to just say a few things at the end. I know I speak on behalf of the entire leadership team that we are clearly behind this next chapter of growth in Gilead. And it's here. And it's a variety of things. Of course, it's a clear path to growth in a sustainable and diverse portfolio. It's also the fact that we have a stable dividend that we're committed to growing over time with an industry leading dividend yield, consistently strong cash flow, robust balance sheet.  So, we're entering 2021 with confidence on this clear path to growth. And I think you'll see us deliver on our new opportunities in oncology and sustain our leadership in HIV. And we look forward to updating you every quarter on our progress throughout 2021.  So, thank you all for joining. I'll let Andrew have the last word here. But I also want to make sure we thank all the colleagues at Gilead and our partners that made all this possible.  So, Andrew, over to you."

            "name": "Andrew Dickinson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan. And good afternoon, everyone. Our performance was strong for the fourth quarter and full-year 2020, a clear reflection of solid underlying fundamentals of our business and the increased demand we saw for Veklury, amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  You will find our detailed Q4 and full-year 2020 results in the press release and materials we have posted on our website. Today, I will review our Q4 and full-year 2020 performance and provide our guidance for 2021.  Turning now to the financial highlights. Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $7.4 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.19. This compares to total revenue of $5.9 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.10 for the same period last year. Non GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased 99% year-over-year, primarily due to higher product sales, improved gross margin driven by a prior-year inventory charge and a lower tax rate. This was partially offset by increased R&D and SG&A investments, including $190 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to amending our agreement with Galapagos. Product sales for the fourth quarter and full year were $7.3 billion and $24.4 billion, up 26% and 10%, respectively, compared to the same periods last year as the most recent COVID-19 surge drove uptake of Veklury. Sequentially, this increase was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of Atripla and Truvada in the US in October.  Veklury contributed $1.9 billion and $2.8 billion in sales for the fourth quarter and full year 2020, largely driven by increased utilization and COVID-19 hospitalizations in the US. For the full year excluding Veklury, product sales were down 3% due to the recent losses of exclusivity for Atripla, Truvada, Letairis and Ranexa in the US, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our HIV and HCV franchises. Despite the impact of the pandemic and the LOEs related to Atripla and Truvada in the US, HIV revenue grew 3% year-over-year, driven by Biktarvy and Descovy. For Q4, product sales excluding Veklury decreased 4% sequentially, primarily due to the Atripla and Truvada LOEs.  Cell therapy revenues were up 34% for the fourth quarter and 33% for the year, primarily due to the continued uptake of Yescarta in Europe and the US launch of Tecartus in July.  Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $918 million for the fourth quarter and $3.3 billion for the year, down 35% and 8% respectively compared to the same periods last year. 2020 cost of goods sold was lower primarily because of a $500 million inventory write-down charge in Q4 of 2019. Excluding this, non-GAAP product margins remain relatively flat year-over-year.  Non-GAAP R&D expense for the quarter was $1.5 billion, up 31% sequentially and up 37% year-over-year, primarily driven by the $190 million charge associated with the Galapagos amendment that I mentioned earlier and approximately $70 million in milestones paid to Pioneer as well as pipeline investments in Trodelvy and magrolimab.  For the full year, non-GAAP R&D expense was up 20% year-over-year, primarily due to our significant investment in Veklury. We also increased our investment in oncology programs, including Trodelvy and magrolimab.  These increases in investment were partially offset by lower clinical expenses from the completion of certain inflammation programs and postponement of certain clinical trials due to the pandemic.  Non-GAAP SG&A expense for the quarter was $1.5 billion, up 37% sequentially and up 25% year-over-year. The increase in the quarter was driven by the timing of marketing expenses related to Biktarvy, along with Veklury and Trodelvy commercialization efforts and higher spend on corporate grants to support philanthropic organizations.  We allocated significant additional funds to nonprofit grantees in Q4 to support racial equity and social justice efforts, help our nonprofit grantees weather the pandemic and provide for our signature giving programs, including COMPASS, RADIAN and HepConnect. For the full year, non-GAAP SG&A expense increased 10% as a result of higher costs associated with the commercialization efforts for Veklury, our continued expansion in China, increased corporate grants, remdesivir donations and a $97 million charge related to a previously disclosed legal settlement.  Turning to our balance sheet. During the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of cash flow from operations, paid $858 million in dividends, and drew down a $1 billion term loan in connection with the closing of our $21 billion acquisition of Immunomedics.  For the year, we returned approximately 67% of free cash flow to our shareholders, consisting of $3.4 billion in dividends and $1.6 billion in share repurchases. We also repaid $1 billion of debt on January 1 of this year.  Turning to our guidance for 2021. Our 2021 non-GAAP financial guidance is summarized on slides 18 and 19 in the earnings presentation available on our website. As always, our guidance is based on our current expectations for our business in 2021 and results may vary depending upon, among other things, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which remain unpredictable.  In addition, while our guidance reflects the impact of recent corporate development transactions and our planned acquisition of MYR, as well as funding for ordinary course partnering activities in 2021, our guidance does not factor in the possibility of any extraordinary business development costs or acquisitions or significant opt-ins that we may complete over the course of the coming year.  With that background, we expect that product sales excluding Veklury for 2021 will be in the range of $21.7 billion to $22.1 billion. Due to the uncertainty related to pandemic, we expect Veklury revenue to be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion, which results in total product sales range of $23.7 billion to $25.1 billion.  As we've discussed over the past quarters, Veklury in many ways acts as a hedge against the potential impacts of the continued COVID-19 pandemic. This guidance reflects anticipated revenue growth of approximately 9% to 10%, excluding LOEs and Veklury, driven by growth from Biktarvy, Trodelvy, Vemlidy and our cell therapy franchise.  And while there remains uncertainty with the pandemic, we are making certain assumptions regarding the recovery and underlying market dynamics starting in the second quarter of 2021. As COVID-19 vaccinations accelerate, any delay with the vaccine rollouts or any significant reacceleration of the global pandemic could once again adversely impact our business.  As a reminder, looking ahead to Q1, we anticipate total product sales excluding Veklury will decline by low single digit percentage, similar to what we've seen over the past three years. This is expected to be driven by customary US seasonal inventory patterns and buying patterns of public payers that negatively affect our payer mix in the first quarter.  In addition, unlike prior years, Q1 of 2021 will also be impacted by the recent loss of exclusivity of Atripla and Truvada in the United States. Despite this anticipated sequential decline in Q1 total product sales, we remain very confident in the health of our business as reflected in our guidance for the coming year.  Turning to our expectations for our product gross margins in 2021. Our non-GAAP product gross margins are expected to be in the range of 87% to 88% in 2021, consistent with our historic range.  With respect to our operating expenses in 2021, we expect that both non-GAAP R&D and non-GAAP SG&A expenses will see a flat to low single digit percentage decline through disciplined expense management, with flexibility to continue investing in our R&D pipeline and other strategic opportunities going forward.  This guidance includes the impact of our planned acquisition of MYR, as well as our allocation of approximately $350 million for future investments and ordinary course R&D collaborations.  In addition, our SG&A guidance reflects the expected impact in 2021 of our oncology build out and funding for a number of time-limited corporate initiatives related to information technology and data analytics. Our non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $11.5 billion to $12.9 billion in 2021. And our non GAAP effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 21%, which is higher than 2020, primarily due to a decrease in tax credits and settlements with tax authorities that reduced our 2020 tax rate.  Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.75 per share to $7.45 per share, driven by increased operational efficiencies as compared to 2020 and partially offset by the higher non-GAAP effective tax rate, along with greater projected interest expense and lower projected interest income as compared to 2020. Our balance sheet remains robust and our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. We remain focused on continuing to prioritize investment in our business and R&D pipeline, and maintaining a rigorous focus on disciplined expense management.  Finally, we continue to be committed to growing our dividend over time. And we are pleased to announce earlier today that we have increased our dividend by 4.4% for 2021.  Additionally, as we disclosed a few weeks ago, we plan to repay at least $4 billion of debt this year, including the $1 billion of debt we repaid at the beginning of this year. We also expect to repurchase shares to offset dilution from equity compensation plans.  I'll now turn the call over to Johanna. The simple answer to your question is yes. I think that we do see this as a really important year where we said at JP Morgan, picking up on Dan's points, we expect to grow in the short term, the medium term, and the long run from here, and we think we have all the puzzle pieces together that will allow us to do that.  Our guidance, and you see in some of the pages that we tried to help people think through the core business and the materials that we posted, and I would emphasize and focus people on the 9% to 10% growth in the core business excluding the impact of the LOEs. So, we're going to grow through the LOEs, and then we think we should have some additional momentum coming out of 2021 into the subsequent years. And we also have a very capital-efficient and efficient corporate model, as you know, Michael. So, when you talk about kind of bottom-line growth, we see a lot of potential for leverage as we're driving top line growth to really expand the EPS growth over the coming years as well. So, we're excited about where we are and where we're going and look forward to updating you throughout the year. On the share count, we're assuming a flat share count year-over-year. So, to be clear, the EPS guidance is not being driven by share buybacks or share counts. Our base assumption is that we will just do repurchases to offset employee stock issuance over the year. We maintain, obviously, the flexibility to opportunistically repurchase more shares if we conclude over the year that that's a good use of our capital. But right now, the base case is that we will just repurchase shares to offset employee share issuance. It's Andy. Let me start with \u2013 we lost Dave again. Sorry. Let me start with the margin question. So, we're not providing longer term guidance, but we have flexibility in the way that we structured the deals as you know. So, until we opt in, the R&D expense is borne by Arcus, as with many of our partnerships. Obviously, we're planning for success and looking at our R&D expense in the future and making sure that we have the flexibility in our capital structure and otherwise to push these programs forward if the data supports it. And we have a lot of leverage in our models. So we, again, have very strong margins. At a high level, Robyn, what I'd say is we don't expect that any of the opt-ins unless we're really opting into all of the programs across the board that we have options on would fundamentally change our margin profile. And if they did, obviously, that would be in the short term, potentially a good problem to have. So, we're really comfortable with the structure that we have, where we are with our margins today, where we see them going. We like our R&D load today in terms of the amount of scale we've added to our R&D programs and our spend levels. You see that we're going to work very hard to manage our expenses thoughtfully with our team. So, from our vantage point, we're in a good spot.  Let me hand it over to Merdad on the clinical question. Terrence, on your last question, we haven't provided specific expense guidance on any of our products. As you know, what we've said on remdesivir is that there still will be a meaningful amount of expenses in 2021, as you'd expect, but the expense load is lower than it was in 2020. And we're not providing more specific guidance, but it's real. It's important. We continue to see the significant potential for the product for patients. So, we're continuing to invest appropriately. And it is baked into our guidance, but it's a reduction year-over-year. Thank you to them. And thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and the team here looks forward to providing you with the updates on our future progress. Thanks again."

I'll begin by taking you through some of the market dynamics we saw in the fourth quarter as we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact that it's had on our business.  As we entered the quarter in the US and around the world, the number of COVID-19 cases surged. This had two significant effects on our business. Recovery was dampened by our Hep C and HIV medications as people delayed visits to their health care providers. And the number of hospitalizations of patients with COVID-19 dramatically increased, leading to significant uptake of Veklury.  Driven by Veklury, we had robust growth in Q4, with a 13% increase in total product sales compared to the prior quarter. Excluding Veklury revenues, our business declined 4% amid the pandemic and loss of exclusivity for Atripla and Truvada in the US.  Overall, while we expect the pandemic to continue to cause near term uncertainty, we're confident in the strong underlying trends, which I'll highlight for you this afternoon, starting with HIV. We saw 3% growth in sales across our HIV franchise in 2020 compared with the prior year, despite the Atripla and Truvada LOE. Biktarvy continued to stand out in the HIV treatment market, growing 10% sequentially and 53% year-over-year. Biktarvy remains the number one prescribed regimen across key global markets, and in the US, where one in two new patients start on Biktarvy.  In PrEP, we ended the year with a 46% US market share for Descovy, exceeding our goal of 40% to 45%. As expected, we saw generic competitor enter the market in Q4, impacting Truvada revenues as we work to maintain strong commercial assets for Descovy. Going forward, we expect demand for PrEP to recover as the pandemic subsides, and we will stay competitive growing the business with the market. The generic competition and the surge in the pandemic led to a decline in Q4 HIV revenues of 6% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. In addition, in line with historical trends, we saw seasonal inventory build in Q4, which we expect to bleed out into Q1 of this year.  We're well positioned and confident in our leadership in HIV today and in the future. Biktarvy will continue to be a key growth driver as the go-to single tablet regimen for HIV treatment with patent protection extending to 2033 in the US, as well as the European Union.  We remain enthusiastic about the prospects of growing our leadership as we advance our long acting antiviral lenacapavir. Success in the long acting market will depend on having a product candidate with the right profile for patients. We believe lenacapavir has the potential to be that product. And Merdad will share more detail about its profile in his remarks.  Turning to Trodelvy, as Dan mentioned, we completed our acquisition of Immunomedics in October. During the quarter, Trodelvy recorded $64 million in sales, with $49 million of that revenue recognized by Gilead following the close of the acquisition, for a full year totaling $137 million in revenue.  I'm impressed with the progress the teams have made launching the medication amid the pandemic. In its first eight months, Trodelvy has become the clear number one therapy in third line metastatic triple negative breast cancer. The breath of Trodelvy adoption and recognition of the product continues to grow. And we're now seeing unaided Trodelvy awareness of about 90% among physicians and academic institutions.  Our ambition is to achieve similar awareness numbers with community providers, which will be driven by the anticipated full FDA approval of Trodelvy for metastatic triple negative breast cancer and publication of the previously presented ASCENT data in the first half of 2021. We're also on track to complete the European filing in the first quarter of this year.  Specific to hepatitis, the COVID-19 surge impacted the recovery we saw in Q3 across our HDV franchise. Our HDV business showed 9% sequential decline impacted by the pandemic and timing of purchases in markets outside of the US. We continue to maintain anywhere between 50% and 60% market share across our core market, which we believe sets us well for recovery.  In HBV, we expect to continue to grow our business and anticipate sales exceeding $1 billion by 2022, driven by the US and Asia market.  We're looking forward to closing the MYR acquisition which will bring Hepcludex to Gilead The medicine is a first in class and potentially best in class treatment for hepatitis D, or HDD, an orphan disease that has been historically under diagnosed and for which there were no approved treatment options prior to Hepcludex. HDD is the most severe form of viral hepatitis, and is associated with poor long term survival rates. We believe our experience in hepatitis and the operational synergies with respect to Gilead's existing field force in HPV will allow us to reach patients with HDD. Hepcludex already has conditional approval in Europe and remains an investigational agent in the US. Pending the close of the deal, we anticipate filing for US approval in the second half of this year.  In closing, I just want to share a few remarks about Veklury. As Dan noted, Veklury remains an important treatment option for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We're seeing utilization rates of 50% to 60% among eligible patients in the US and are very proud of the role we played in helping patients during this challenging time.  As we've seen over the past year, predicting the trajectory of the pandemic has proven difficult, to say the least. We anticipate demand will continue to fluctuate as COVID-19 cases rise and fall. While we're encouraged by the progress that our industry has made with the introduction of vaccines, we expect Veklury will remain a critical tool for patients and physicians well into the future.  And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Merdad. I think the way we're looking at it, and I'll start with actually the first filing, right, which is heavily treatment experienced, which is expected to file towards the end of this year. I think that one for us was really an opportunity to go into the market, fast opportunity to get physician experience with lenacapavir and kind of create that foundation for lena.  I would split up the question between treatment and PrEP. I think in treatment, the expectation is the market will continue to grow at the 2%, 3% that we've been seeing year-over-year. And so, I think it'll be little bit of a switch from oral to long acting within the treatment. I think the real opportunity for expansion with long acting will be in the prevention market. We've said before that we've only scratched the surface at about 20%, 25% of the total market today in prevention with Truvada and Descovy. I think the opportunity really is to expand that market with long actings that would make it much more flexible for folks, people at risk of HIV. And so, I think that's a true expansion strategy, but more intervention than in treatment. As I mentioned, earlier, this year has been actually quite stable. So, what we've seen is really, with Truvada LOE, what we've seen is a little bit of mix within Truvada between branded and generic. But we haven't seen that impacted Descovy at all. On the contrary, it stayed strong at that level of share. And we expect that to continue to basically be anywhere between 40% and 45% or so throughout the year.  Having said that, we did see a little bit of a decline quarter over quarter, about 6% or so. And that was largely due to the contracting to maintain some commercial access. So, the one difference has been much more around \u2013 because it's TAP, because it's in prevention, it's highly commercially \u2013 commercial payers. And so therefore, we're really quite focused on just making sure that people at risk have access to Descovy in light of its strong profile and safety profile that it offers. And so, we've definitely seen erosion with Truvada, strong erosion in Q4. And that will continue as we think about coming quarters this year. But really, from a Descovy standpoint, the expectation is that we continue to maintain strong commercial access. And obviously, that might mean a little bit more contracting. So, a little bit more discount on that front. But one that's important for us to make sure that people living at risk have access to Descovy as we continue forward. So, hopefully, that kind of addresses your question on PrEP market. I think we're really pleased to see the evolution of Trodelvy, right? It's only eight months in, so they haven't had a full year yet. And what we're seeing in 2020 is very encouraging. As of last October, more than one out of four patients were initiated on Trodelvy in third line metastatic triple negative breast cancer. What we also are seeing is, in December, when physicians were actually asked to report their own prescribing, so a little bit of an ATU type approach, they were suggesting somewhere north of 40% of their third line metastatic triple negative breast cancer patients were receiving Trodelvy. And so, we're seeing a nice uptake. I think we have an opportunity to continue that uptake as we think about expanding not only in the academic centers, but also with our community providers. And I think that's the opportunity as we think in the next little while. And I think that'll be driven mostly with the fact that we'll be able to promote the overall survival data soon with the FDA approval, the full approval for the ASCENT data and the publication. So, all of those things will be important inflection points for us as we move forward. But we're very excited as we see positions and really getting physician feedback around making sure that they can get through their second line options pretty quickly to get to third line and we have very strong payer support as well in reimbursement. So there's been no barriers on that front either. So good shape so far. I'll turn it over to Merdad on the lung cancer question. So exactly what you described. I think we're going to be very choiceful. And obviously, it needs to make sense. But there could be continued pressures. I think we've seen many of them. And we've been managing it as best we can to make sure that people living at risk do have access to Descovy as it really is quite differentiated.  I think as you think about your model for 2021, there's two pieces. One is, as you know, the market in prevention was quite depressed because of the pandemic. And we started to see us coming out of it in Q3. But of course, in Q4, with a surge of cases in hospitalization, we saw that dampening again. Assuming that we come back to some new normal this year, we should see that market pick up again. So between the market pickup, as well as some continued smaller price contractions, I think those two things will balance each other out quite nicely."

            "content": "Overall, from a cell therapy performance, we grew 33% year-over-year. As you look at Yescarta, it's growing externally, outside the US, in what we call ACE, which is Europe, Canada and Australia. Also in the US, Tecartus is growing significantly above our expectations. The dynamic in the US for Yescarta is a couple fold. As we saw with our other CAR T therapies on the market, the class overall has declined from 23% to 20%, which is significant in Q4. And the reason for that is referrals are down because of COVID, obviously, and that's driving the majority of it and also a lack of ICU beds. The lack of ICU beds does disproportionately affect Yescarta because majority of our sales are in the inpatient sites.  So, as we look at what specifically, not just COVID overall, but you dig down to under what is COVID, you have the referral aspect when the community physicians aren't seeing patients, patients aren't going into the offices and then you also have, at the ATC, the issue of ICU bed capacity, and where else can you treat those patients? So, overall, the biggest driver is the class share decline. And secondarily is a little bit of the product sales baseline, the ICU beds."

I will now turn the call over to Dan.\nDaniel O'Day: Thank you, Doug, and good afternoon, everyone. This has really been a pivotal quarter for Gilead. With last week\u2019s closing of the Immunomedics acquisition, we\u2019ve effectively transformed our near and long-term growth story. Trodelvy, an approved medicine for third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer has tremendous potential for patients today and significant pan-tumor potential for the future. We're all excited to deliver on that potential along with the teams from Immunomedics who became a part of the Gilead family last week. I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone at Immunomedics for the extraordinary work that you've done on Trodelvy to-date. It's an honor to work with all of you now to build on those efforts to the benefit of patients with cancer around the world. The acquisition is undoubtedly an inflection point in terms of our growth and adds to the growing pipeline of transformational medicines that we've been strengthening over the course of the year. All of this is building on the strong foundation of our core business. We've seen the strength and durability of our HIV business once again in the past quarter, and we're confident in our long-term leadership. I'd like to briefly talk about the changing nature of our growth prospects, driven primarily by the acquisition of Immunomedics. I'll also touch on our core business and I'll share a few words about Veklury or remdesivir, which just gained FDA approval, and then Johanna and Merdad will pick up with more details. I'll start with Immunomedics and Trodelvy. The acquisition of Immunomedics is the largest transaction in Gilead's history and undoubtedly marked a turning point for the Company. As you know, Trodelvy is already approved in the U.S. for third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. The recent data at ESMO underscored its transformative potential for this particularly challenging form of cancer, as well as the potential for treating bladder cancer. We will explore expansion into earlier lines of therapy in the short term, and overall we see Trodelvy as a pipeline and a product. The prevalence of Trop-2 in multiple cancer types means Trodelvy has pan-tumor potential. Secondly, in addition to its extensive potential as a monotherapy, Trodelvy stands out because of the way it lends itself to combinations. The early data are promising and we look forward to exploring combinations with various types of agents going forward. The acquisition gives us an immediate presence in the field of solid tumors and brings us a significant expertise of the teams from Immunomedics. We're complementing our existing strengths in hematologic cancers, through our combined Kite and Gilead pipelines, and building on the important progress we've already made this year in building our oncology pipeline. Including Immunomedics, we've completed a total of 10 transactions in oncology so far this year. I'll just mention two of the significant opportunities that are the results of those transactions. Magrolimab is now in Phase 3 for MDS [and offers a] [ph] potential first-in-class option utilizing the CD47 pathway to activate the innate immune system. Our partnership with Arcus is progressing well. We are particularly excited by the potential of the TIGIT compound, as well as other work that's coming out of that collaboration. In cell therapy, we're now the only company with two FDA approved therapies, Yescarta and Tecartus from Kite. Earlier this month, we received a positive opinion for KTE-X19 from the European Medicines Agency, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. I'm also pleased to announce that the FDA has accepted the Yescarta sBLA for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. The agency also granted priority review for this application. ZUMA-7, the industry's first ever randomized trial in cell therapy and the only cell therapy in second-line with overall survival as an endpoint will be delayed slightly due to the slowdown in the rates of events. However, we expect the data in the first half of 2021, and based upon that data, we're ready to submit quickly after. In summary, we made great progress in building out and advancing our pipelines to drive growth this year. And Trodelvy represents a true growth inflection point, changing our outlook significantly, and positioning Gilead as an important contributor in the field of oncology. The foundation for all this additional growth is our durable core business. In HIV, we saw a solid rebound in the third quarter with 14% quarterly sequential growth in the global franchise. While COVID-19 continued to impact our business, there were clear signs of recovery in the third quarter. Moreover, the underlying demand is strong as Biktarvy continues to be the treatment of choice for patients and providers. On the prevention side, we exceeded the goal we set at the beginning of the year of switching 40% to 45% of clinically appropriate at-risk individuals on PrEP to Descovy. As of October 1st, we were at 46%. Johanna will share more perspectives on our third quarter sales in a few moments. Finally, I'd like to briefly comment on remdesivir, what we now refer to by its brand name of Veklury. Veklury received full FDA approval this month for treating hospitalized patients of COVID-19. It\u2019s the only FDA approved therapy for COVID-19 in addition to being authorized or approved for use in more than 50 countries worldwide. We are also now in a position to meet global demand because of the work we've done since January to ramp up our supply. It's worth stepping back for just a moment to recognize how remarkable it is that we are in this position today. At the start of the year, most of the world had not even heard of COVID-19. The scientific community knew very little about the virus or its devastating potential. Today, less than 10 months later, we have an FDA approved therapy that is helping patients around the world to recover faster, and for some groups of patients Veklury is lowering the risk of death. All of this comes at a time when the rates of hospitalization sadly in many places are increasing. We have repeatedly seen the clinical benefits of Veklury across multiple clinical trials. In the past quarter, these benefits have been unequivocally demonstrated by the gold standard of global clinical trials. The definitive results from the fully powered double-blind placebo-controlled and randomized NIAID ACTT-1 trial showed an average reduction in recovery time of five days. I sometimes imagine how I would feel if a family member was hospitalized for COVID-19. And I'm sure many of you think of this as well. I'm extremely grateful that a therapy exists that has been validated with all of the rigor required for an FDA approval and whose benefits have been demonstrated in peer-reviewed data from a trial that is without question the pinnacle of clinical studies today. Merdad will talk about all the recent data on Veklury, including what we've seen from the WHO study and the ongoing development program, shortly. Johanna will talk about the recent move to a commercial distribution model in the U.S., which is going very well. I'd just like to close on Veklury by expressing my gratitude once again to all the Gilead employees who've put their hearts and souls into this work since January, along with our many partners. On behalf of all of us, I want to say how privileged we feel to play a role in helping with the pandemic and be able to put our antiviral expertise to work for patients with COVID-19. I also want to emphasize that we will continue to do all it takes to fulfill our responsibility with Veklury. To wrap up my prepared remarks, I want to emphasize that our portfolio and pipeline are much stronger going into the fourth quarter and 2021. By executing on our strategy in a disciplined way throughout the past 12 months, we have significantly changed the nature of our growth process, especially following the acquisition of Immunomedics, and we have maintained the long-term durability of our core HIV franchise. We're not done, of course, but we made significant progress. And for that, I want to thank all the teams at Gilead and Kite, and our many partners worldwide. With this, I'll hand the call now over to Johanna.\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to begin by building on Dan's comments about our durable core business. Our results through Q3 amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have been strong. And as anticipated, we continue to see signs of recovery during the quarter in underlying demand trends across our core franchises in U.S. and Europe. Looking at our HIV business. We continue to make great progress in both treatment and prevention. Biktarvy in treatment and Descovy for prevention continue to gain share quarter-over-quarter. In treatment, Biktarvy remains the number one regimen across key global markets. In the U.S., one in two new patients start on Biktarvy and roughly one in two patients switching to Biktarvy do so from a non-Gilead single tablet regimen, growing overall Gilead share. In PrEP, despite COVID dynamics, we continue to make progress with Descovy with 46% conversion of clinically appropriate individuals at risk at the end of September, exceeding our stated goal of 40% to 45%. Our overall HIV revenue in Q3 was very strong with 14% sequential growth over Q2 and 8% year-over-year growth, driven by both, strong demand fundamentals and normalized inventory dynamics. The unique quarterly phasing of inventory dynamics this year and the recent Truvada loss of exclusivity will impact our sequential quarterly revenue dynamics in the fourth quarter. With 91% of Gilead's U.S. patients having converted to TAF-based regimens, we will continue to build on our strength in HIV, including long-acting formulations for both, treatment and prevention. Now, briefly on HCV. Our HCV business showed 4% sequential growth over Q2 while down 31% from Q3 last year due to lower patient starts year-on-year. As markets started to reopen in the U.S. and Europe, we saw an increase in diagnosis and patient starts in Q3. Our stock market share across core markets puts us in a position of strength as patients return through the rest of the year and into 2021. I'd like to now highlight some specifics on the initial commercialization of Veklury, which began in the third quarter. As our teams have begun reaching out to physicians and hospital systems, it has been incredibly inspiring to hear their stories of how they have used this medication and what it meant to patients as well as their loved ones. As a reminder, the commercial model in the third quarter was governed by an agreement with the U.S. government to allocate 90% of our supply to patients in the U.S. through a partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. During the quarter, we recorded Veklury sales of $873 million. A portion of inventory that will be consumed in Q4 was recognized as revenue in the third quarter. As Dan mentioned, we have now pivoted beginning October 1st to a more traditional commercial model, working directly with AmerisourceBergen to provide Veklury directly to U.S. hospitals. AmerisourceBergen will remain our sole distributor of Veklury through the end of the year to ensure consistency and continuity. In Europe, we signed a joint procurement agreement with the European Commission on October 8th that enables participating countries in the EU, the European Economic Area and UK to purchase Veklury to meet both, real-time demand and stockpiling needs, coordinated by the European Commission. This agreement temporarily removes the need for country-by-country reimbursement processes that typically follow marketing authorization, recognizing the urgency of the current health crisis. It encompasses purchases of Veklury over the next six months and can be extended, if needed. Predicting the underlying demand of core Veklury continues to be challenging, given so many variables, including incidence rates, hospitalization rate as well as future vaccines and emerging treatments. Now, turning to Trodelvy. As you know, the Immunomedics deal closed less than a week ago, and we're already working closely with the joint team to ensure the continuity of Trodelvy's strong launch in third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and accelerate its future potential. It is a true catalyst for growth, and the joint team is energized as we continue to accelerate the work on this transformational therapy together as one team. While not part of our third quarter results, I'd like to highlight Immunomedics Q3 results for Trodelvy in the U.S. Trodelvy achieved $53 million in net sales in Q3, the first full quarter of commercial availability. Total net sales were $73 million in the first five months of commercial launch in the midst of a pandemic. Over 1,000 accounts ordered Trodelvy in the first five months of commercial launch, and of those about 488 were new and unique in Q3. We've seen robust adoption continue in Q3 in both, community and academic centers. We look forward to expanding commercialization to Europe and other markets around the world as quickly as possible, starting with an EU submission in Q1 of next year. And to close, a few words on Jyseleca, which is the brand name for filgotinib. Jyseleca has now launched in Germany, and launch planning is well underway across Europe as well as Japan. We anticipate sales in both regions during the fourth quarter. Despite a crowded and competitive marketplace, the teams are well-prepared to differentiate Jyseleca. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the future. Merdad will provide a little bit more color on the ongoing regulatory considerations and our thinking there. And so, with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Merdad.\nMerdad Parsey: Thanks, Johanna, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to share some perspectives on several clinical pipeline-related updates and progress. Starting with Veklury. We're very pleased with the recent full approval of Veklury by the FDA. Veklury is now approved in the U.S. for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19-based disease on a strong and consistent body of evidence from three rigorous, randomized, controlled clinical trials over the past six months to inform us about the profile of Veklury. It's the first antiviral treatment proven to help patients hospitalized with COVID-19, recover and leave the hospital more quickly, a significant benefit for patients, their families and society. The results include the double-blind, placebo-controlled NIAID Phase 3 ACTT-1 trial, published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study met its primary endpoint of time to clinical recovery through day 29, demonstrating Veklury plus standard of care, reduced the time of recovery through day 29 compared with placebo plus standard of care from 15 to 10 days with a P-value of less than 0.001. The key secondary endpoint of clinical status at day 15 was also met. Patients receiving Veklury were 50% more likely to have it improved by day 15 compared with those receiving placebo, and the effect was maintained through day 29. The secondary mortality endpoint in the overall population only showed a trend towards reduced mortality with a P-value of 0.07. Recall that when we started these trials with the NIAID, we knew very little about the disease itself and didn't know which patients might be most likely to benefit from Veklury. Given the range of disease severity in the overall study population and the emerging understanding that clinical outcomes are highly dependent on a patient's requirement for oxygen at baseline, an exploratory post-hoc analysis was conducted to determine whether there were differences in mortality based on patients' baseline clinical status with respect to the requirement for oxygen support. In this post-hoc analysis, in patients requiring low flow oxygen at baseline, the largest subgroup of patients in the trial, over 40% of patients, those who received Veklury had a 72% reduction in mortality at day 15 and a 70% reduction in mortality at day 29, with confidence intervals that do not cross one. These results are what we would have expected and hoped for with an antiviral therapy that should have the most impact when given earlier in the course of the disease before the inflammatory cascade leads to critical illness. These data add to the breadth of evidence from two additional randomized controlled clinical trials, establishing the use of Veklury as a standard of care for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. All three of these Phase 3 trials have been published in peer-reviewed journals, and the raw data was shared with the FDA as part of the NDA review process for them to perform their own independent analyses as is their standard approach. We continue to pursue other ways to expand the utility of remdesivir as a backbone of treatment, including exploring how combinations could be more effective and new means of administering the drug that don't require intravenous administration. Now, last week, interim results from the World Health Organization Solidarity trial were released through a preprint server. These results don't alter the demonstration of efficacy observed with remdesivir in the studies I just described. That trial was intentionally designed to be pragmatic and enable participation across a wide range of healthcare settings. They are components of the study design and data that should provide pause. These may be clarified or placed into appropriate context during the peer review process. Given that we haven't received the data, nor have there been peer reviewed -- nor have these data been peer reviewed, it's difficult for us to discuss the study. Some of the issues we and others have identified in WHO study include the lack of a PCR confirmation of COVID-19 at the time of enrollment, the lack of distinction between patients requiring low-flow or high-flow oxygen in the results, no data monitoring, no data verification, and 20% of the data being reported as missing from the preliminary analysis. We can only speculate at this point that these factors may have contributed to the negative outcomes reported in this study. It is, however, important to note that the totality of data generated thus far for Veklury suggests that antivirals are most effective earlier in the disease course. As you get sicker, inflammation, such as ARDS or fibrosis, potentially things like vascular blood clots and bacterial pneumonias could kick in. The NIAID data suggests that patients on low-flow oxygen are those that show the greatest benefit in time to discharge and mortality. An antiviral doesn't clear inflammation or blood clots once they're formed. So, this makes sense. Sicker patients on high-flow oxygen and mechanical ventilation may need an antiviral, but it will be insufficient to treat the inflammation. In those patients, treatment in addition to antivirals such as dexamethasone may be beneficial and have been demonstrated to be that way, using WHO data. We look forward to learning more about the Solidarity trial results and sharing this information with regulators, once we have the data in hand. Most importantly, at this moment, the world is combating a pandemic that isn't going away. As we see infections once again on the rise across the U.S. and Europe, it's critical that physicians have every tool possible at their disposal, and that patients are encouraged to seek care for what we know can be a rapidly progressing and deadly virus. We're proud of the role Veklury has played in this pandemic, and I'm proud of and profoundly grateful to the team who's worked so hard to advance this medicine for patients, including those collaborators at the NIAID, the investigators and patients who've been integral to the conduct of these studies. We regularly receive letters of gratitude from people who've been treated with Veklury, and we're grateful for the opportunity to provide this important treatment during this time. So, now, I'd like to turn to oncology. As Dan mentioned, we're very excited now to have the Trodelvy program in-house with the closing of the Immunomedics transaction. We're excited to welcome the impressive Immunomedics team to Gilead. As Dan and Johanna both mentioned, Trodelvy represents a growth inflection point for the Company, and I'd like to highlight recent progress that has us excited about the full potential of this medicine. You may have seen the ESMO data that Immunomedics presented from the confirmatory Phase 3 ASCENT study. In this study, despite having received a median of four prior anticancer treatments, patients treated with Trodelvy showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival with a median of 12.1 months versus 6.7 months for chemotherapy and a hazard ratio of 0.48 and a P-value of less than 0.0001. Trodelvy also demonstrated statistically significant improvement in ORR, 35% versus 5%, and CBR, 45% versus 9%, when compared with chemotherapy. These remarkable results should establish Trodelvy as a new standard of care in patients with third-line metastatic TNBC. In urothelial cancer, another area of focus, as reported at ESMO last month, Immunomedics released the positive results from cohort one of the pivotal Phase 2 TROPHY U-01 study of Trodelvy in cisplatin-eligible patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. These results confirm the interim findings in prior Phase 1/2 study results, showing Trodelvy has significant activity and is well tolerated in patients with heavily pretreated metastatic urothelial cancer who progressed despite platinum-based chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors. Trodelvy has a potential to be an important new treatment for patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. Based on these exciting data, in terms of the path forward for Trodelvy, the BLA -- supplemental BLA seeking expansion of Trodelvy's label to include the ASCENT result is expected to be submitted in Q4 to the FDA under the RTOR program. The sBLA submission to the FDA for an accelerated approval of Trodelvy in metastatic urothelial cancer is expected in Q4 as well. In addition, the MAA for Trodelvy in metastatic TNBC in Europe is planned for submission to the EMA in the first quarter of 2021. The potential for Trodelvy in earlier lines of therapy and additional tumor types is something we're really excited to explore. Results from studies with combinations of PARP inhibitors and separately checkpoint inhibitors give us even more options to explore the potential of this new treatment for patients. Beyond Trodelvy, I'd like to highlight other opportunities in our oncology pipeline that continue to excite us. On magrolimab, our anti-CD47 asset, we continue to pursue options for filing an accelerated approval pathway from magrolimab in addition to azacitidine and MDS in 2021 based on the ongoing single-arm study. As with all single arm studies, the risk and the FDA will make a decision based on the totality of the data and whether the data support a substantial benefit from available standard of care. The recent breakthrough designation for magrolimab provides recognition by the FDA the potential for magrolimab, and enables us to have more frequent FDA interactions. We also have obtained prime designation from magrolimab, another recognition of the potential for magrolimab. We've initiated our enhanced randomized Phase 3 study comparing magrolimab plus azacitidine versus azacitidine alone in higher risk MDS patients to confirm the Phase 1 results for potential full approval. The emerging data from our partner, Arcus, is very exciting, and we look forward to updating you in due course. Moving to antivirals. We continue to be excited about lenacapavir, the Company's investigational long-acting HIV1 capsid inhibitor, an injectable administered every six months. The study evaluating lenacapavir in highly treatment-experienced HIV patients is progressing, and we're on track for a planned filing in 2021. We also recently announced the addition of a new study arm of lenacapavir to the women's -- to the existing planned women's HIV prevention study, evaluating Descovy and Truvada in women at risk of HIV. In parallel, we will also initiate a study of lenacapavir for HIV prevention in men and transgender people who have sex with men. Turning to filgotinib. We're excited about the launch of Jyseleca for rheumatoid arthritis in Europe. During the quarter, we shared data from the Phase 2b/3 selection trial in ulcerative colitis showing filgotinib 200 milligrams, induced remission at week 10 and achieved endoscopic, histologic and six-month corticosteroid free remission at week 58 with a consistent safety profile. We plan to file filgotinib for ulcerative colitis in Europe before the year-end and Japan early next year. As we previously shared, in August, the FDA issued a complete response letter for filgotinib in rheumatoid arthritis, requesting data from the MANTA and MANTA-RAy studies and expressing concerns regarding the benefit risk profile of the 200-milligram dose. We met with the FDA for a Type C meeting to discuss MANTA, and we'll meet again for a Type A meeting in Q4 to further discuss the CRL. In the meantime, we're pausing screening and enrollment for ongoing trials in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and uveitis as we believe the FDA meeting will inform the broader filgotinib development program. We continue to believe in the benefit risk profile of filgotinib. I'd also like to highlight that we remain committed to inflammation into our long-term collaboration with Galapagos. Finally, I wanted to highlight that we are focused on ongoing strategic portfolio review and disciplined prioritization of our overall portfolio. We've shared a summary of important upcoming milestones across the pipeline in the materials we've provided. I'll turn over the call to Andy now.\nAndrew Dickinson: Thanks, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter performance was strong, and it reflects the solid underlying fundamentals in our core HIV franchise and the start of the post donation phase for Veklury. It also reflects the ongoing and dynamic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. You will find our detailed Q3 results in the press release and materials we have posted. In my following remarks, I will review elements of our Q3 performance and provide you with an update on our full year guidance. Turning now to the financial highlights. Total revenues for the third quarter of 2020 were $6.6 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.11. This compares to total revenue of $5.6 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.64 for the same period last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2020 increased 29% year-over-year, primarily due to higher operating income driven by growth in HIV product sales and our initial Veklury sales as well as lower non-GAAP tax rate. As noted in the earnings press release, on a GAAP basis, the third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.29, primarily due to $1.2 billion in charges related to our collaborations and equity investments in building out our oncology pipeline as well as a $900 million loss from unfavorable changes in the fair value of our equity investment in Galapagos. Product sales for the third quarter of 2020 were $6.5 billion, up 28% sequentially and up 18% year-over-year, primarily due to Veklury sales and our core HIV products driven by stronger demand as well as higher volume as channel inventory continues to normalize in the United States. HIV revenues grew sequentially 14%, driven by a continued patient uptake of Biktarvy and Descovy for PrEP and increased channel inventory purchases in the United States. HIV revenues increased 8% year-over-year, primarily due to higher demand driven by Biktarvy, and as I said earlier, the normalization of inventory purchases in the U.S., partially offset by lower sales of Truvada. HCV revenues grew 4% sequentially, primarily due to higher patient starts in the United States and Europe, but the revenues were down 31% year-over-year, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on patient starts. Cell therapy revenues were down 6% sequentially due to COVID-19 and up 25% year-over-year, driven by continued patient uptake and expansion of Yescarta in Europe. Now, sturning to our expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $1.2 billion for the quarter, down 3% sequentially and up 12% year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by lower investments in remdesivir in the third quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher investments in remdesivir, partially offset by pauses or deferrals of certain clinical trials due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $1.1 billion, down 6% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year. The sequential decrease in expenses was primarily driven by the second quarter accrual of $97 million related to a Department of Justice matter, which subsequently settled in the third quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by headcount growth, partially offset by lower marketing spend due to COVID-19. Now, moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We finished the quarter with $26 billion in cash and marketable debt securities. During the quarter, we generated $2.3 billion in cash flow from operations. We paid dividends of $861 million. We repaid $2 billion of maturing debt, and we repurchased $201 million of stock. In addition, we issued $7.25 billion of senior notes and arranged a $1 billion term loan, which we drew down in Q4 to partially fund the acquisition of Immunomedics. After closing the Immunomedics acquisition, our balance sheet remains strong and our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We have, however, curtailed our share repurchase program in the near term as we focus on paying down debt incurred in the acquisition. As Dan indicated, the acquisition will immediately accelerate our revenue growth and is expected to be neutral to accretive to our non-GAAP EPS in 2023 -- by 2023 and significantly accretive thereafter. Turning now to COVID and its continued impact on our business and the broader business environment. As we do every quarter, we've updated our base case utilizing external projections and views. As you know, the pandemic continues to progress in unpredictable ways. The recent uptick of infection and hospitalization rates in the U.S. and Europe is obviously of concern to all and will potentially impact the business environment during the fourth quarter and into 2021. Globally, external views suggest widespread vaccination will not become a reality until late in 2021. As a result, we expect the pandemic to continue to impact our business and broader market dynamics, including in particular, HCV, HIV PrEP and Veklury demand into 2021 and potentially beyond. We also expect that our HIV treatment business will continue to remain largely unaffected and that the remainder of our core business will continue to recover in the fourth quarter and into the first half of 2021. With that as context, let me turn to our updated full year 2020 guidance. It's important to reiterate that we are operating in a highly complex and dynamic environment and that projections are subject to greater uncertainty than it\u2019s historically been the case. We have reaffirmed and narrowed our revenue guidance range to $23 billion to $23.5 billion, reflecting the latest estimates for Veklury. The guidance range provided during our second quarter earnings reflected underlying uncertainty in demand -- in the demand dynamics for Veklury, given the nature of this pandemic, and as Johanna mentioned earlier, factors such as the rate of infections by region, severity, hospitalizations and stockpiling demand, all of which have been difficult to forecast. On the expense side, we're raising our SG&A expense guidance to low-double-digit percentage growth, reflecting the Immunomedics acquisition. Our full year operating income guidance range is reaffirmed and narrowed and is now US$10.7 billion to US$11.2 billion. Our full year non-GAAP EPS range is also reaffirmed and narrowed and is now 6.25 to -- $6.25 to $6.60 per share. As we think about our performance to date and our guidance, we are encouraged by the significant process we've made in such a challenging environment this year. Before we hand the call off for Q&A, we would like to express our gratitude to our 12,000 Gilead and Kite employees globally. Their spirit, dedication and resilience make it possible for us to have a meaningful impact on patients with some of the world's hardest to treat diseases. We'd now like to open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] I show our first question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Harrison: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, on filgotinib, can you guys maybe just describe what you're thinking in terms of the potential outcomes here once you have that Type A meeting? Is this something where you could decide not to launch the drug in the U.S. at all, or is this more a nuanced approach where maybe you won't move forward with RA, but move forward with the IBD indication? Thanks very much.\nMerdad Parsey: Hi. Matthew, it's Merdad. Yes. I think, the outcomes -- it's hard to predict what the outcomes are. I do think that both the options you suggested are possible. And I would sort of tend towards your latter approach, which is that we would -- if things aren't able to move forward with RA, we'd like to keep the door open for us to continue to move forward in IBD and continue those discussions, obviously, dependent on the MANTA and the MANTA-RAy data outcome.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nEvan Seigerman: So, with the recent review of Galapagos' Toledo program, Merdad, what do you really need to see from the proof-of-concept trials to opt in and be comfortable, potentially incorporating this into your portfolio, given your focus on portfolio optimization? Thank you.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes. Thanks. Great question. They're doing a really great job of exploring the potential of that program in multiple indications. And they have a great approach of trying to get there quickly, looking for early signals of activity. On our end, obviously, we would like to see the programs de-risked to the appropriate level at the time that we opt in. That will vary based on the signals we see and the magnitude of the improvement that we see. So, obviously, if you saw, hypothetically, a huge response in one indication that was really unexpected and blew it out of the water, we might opt-in more early. Whereas if it's more nuanced in a small trial, we might want to flush that out a little bit more before we opt in. Our contract allows us to continue to work with them as the programs are de-risked. And our desire is to opt in and move as quickly as possible once we have an appropriate level of risk.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan.\nCory Kasimov: I wanted to ask about remdesivir and the change to guidance now. I guess, I'm just trying to better understand kind of what has changed since your guidance in 2Q that leads to the lowering of fiscal year guidance by $1.5 billion. And I mean, just given the pace of infections that we're seeing across the country, can you just kind of go into a little bit more detail on why this -- why the lowering and kind of how this market is evolving, in your eyes?\nAndrew Dickinson: Cory, it's Andy. I'll start, and Johanna can jump in as well. I think, it's relatively straightforward. I mean, it's a dynamic situation. It's very difficult to forecast, as we've discussed. And as I think most people understand, the rate of hospitalizations is the biggest factor that has moved around a lot over the last six months, and it continues to move today. So, what you're seeing is our -- the latest estimate based on the information that we have we're pleased with the uptake in the third quarter, obviously, with the formal U.S. approval, the joint procurement agreement in place, Johanna and her team, I think, have a better sense of where we see the year, but it's still very dynamic and is unusual compared to what you have to typically forecast. Johanna, if you want to add anything to that?\nJohanna Mercier: Yes. Maybe just to add to that, Andy, I think, what we're also seeing is the severity of the disease. So, I think as you saw through the summer months, even though there were surges, going through the U.S. mostly, some of those were younger patient population. And therefore, the hospitalization rates really dropped over the summer months. We were seeing closer to 12% to 15% late Q2. And as you go into Q3, they're closer to 5%. So, we're really tracking those very closely. It's not just the incidence. It's really, to Andy's point, the hospitalization rates. And obviously, the assumption is, in light of the surge this fall, both in Europe as well as in the U.S., that those numbers will pop back up a little bit. So, that would be one piece of the puzzle. The other piece, I would say, is we looked at some of our assumptions around stockpiling, and although we've seen some stockpiling, not at the level that we had originally projected. And so, we're adapting to that as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nMichael Yee: I wanted to follow up a little more on filgotinib. Obviously, it's an important driver, and you said you'll have a Type A meeting and you'll make some decisions. Can you just clarify what you would actually learn from a Type A? And if you were to, as you said, maybe keep IBD, isn't 200-milligram is really important, and so that would tie together with RA being approved at 200? So, maybe just explain a little bit where these scenarios would evolve from. And could you just make tough decisions to not go forward at all? Thank you.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Sure, Michael. Yes, couldn't agree more. Look, I think, the conversation we\u2019ll have in the Type A meeting will center around really what level of evidence the FDA would be looking for on both of those issues, right, in terms of trying to get to a better benefit risk understanding. And so, that will depend -- so we need to find that out from the 200-milligram standpoint, and we need to find it out from the MANTA and MANTA-RAy standpoint. So, those two things we will get guidance from the FDA at the Type A meeting. And then, based on that outcome, we will make some decisions how to go forward, whether it's -- whether there's a clear path, whether we have to only go forward in IBD or whether 200 milligrams is not viable until MANTA reads out -- MANTA-RAy readout. All those are possibilities. So, it's hard to speculate what the outcome of that will be. We'll be transparent obviously as we have that discussion with how we'll proceed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.\nGeoffrey Porges: One question -- a multipart question on Veklury and then a quick one on Trodelvy. So, on Veklury, could you give us a sense of how many patients have been treated so far or at least in the quarter and disclose for us what the inventory stocking was? And then, a little bit of color about what proportion of hospitalized patients are getting remdesivir because we get the sense the standard of care. And then, Merdad, could you just talk a little bit about the profile of Trodelvy and combinations? It does have some significant safety and tolerability liabilities. So, which of the combinations do you think it makes the most sense to use it in? Thanks.\nJohanna Mercier: So, let me start, Geoff, with the Veklury question around usage. So, what we've seen is, obviously, in Q3, a little bit of a interesting dynamic in light of most of the supply was committed through the HHS to U.S. patient population. So, there was a bit of an inventory build through the Q3 that you're going to see play out in Q4 in the U.S. specifically. We're also in a situation due to the incredible work that's been done by our manufacturing teams to be in a situation where our current supply now is at a level where it is exceeding global demand. So, we feel very confident in making sure we can -- global demand around the world, namely in Europe right now, in light of not only the drug procurement agreement, but in light of the recent surge that you're seeing across countries in Europe. I think, to your point about percentage of patients, it really varies across countries but also regions. And I do think that that percentage is increasing as we speak. As the FDA approval came out last week, we're already seeing a lot more noise around that, but also in light of the fact that we have a field team. So medical and commercial that are now going out to make sure that physicians are aware and educated on where best to use Veklury. And I think that's one of the pieces that's the most important. So, that's playing out as we speak. But, we have seen probably out of hospitalization rates in many countries anywhere between 40% to 50% in the U.S. usage of remdesivir. And of course, that number will only grow as people better understand the data now that it's been published as well as approved through the FDA. And maybe, Merdad, on Trodelvy.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes. And I'll take the Trodelvy question, Geoffrey. Yes. Look, I think, what we know so far with the Trodelvy [indiscernible] combo is a couple of things. One is just looking at the combos where it's been tested, there's data with the parts and there's data with checkpoint inhibitors. And so far, those data seem to support the ability to go forward with combos. And that obviously opens a number of doors there for us to investigate. When we look at the adverse event profile and we look at what -- and we talk to the investigators about what they're seeing and how they're managing it, the tox is largely the neutropenia and the diarrhea, and often that the investigators are saying that toxicity seems to be manageable, something they're comfortable managing. And we're getting a lot of encouragement to move earlier in lines of therapy, based on that adverse event profile. The individual combinations will be dictated by the indication that we're in, right, whether it's breast, urothelial, lung, those combinations will depend. But, I think a big one will probably be the checkpoint inhibitors where I think we're optimistic and have reasonably good data about being able to combine there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nAlethia Young: I just wanted to talk a little bit about kind of big picture immunology. So, maybe depending on what you decide with filgotinib next year based on some of the conversations, like how are you thinking about the space? Are you still committed? Would you consider doing M&A or do you have an internal pipeline that continues to drive potential revenues there? Thanks\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Alethia. I'll start and then maybe Merdad can add as well. But first of all, I mean, nothing has changed about our dedication to our three disease areas. As you know, I mean, our strategy that we announced at the beginning of the year was based upon two really strong scientific disciplines that we have from a discovery perspective at Gilead and with our partners, and that is antivirals and immunomodulation. And we've been firmly focused on that strategy in terms of how it plays out in both, antivirals, inflammation and fibrosis, and then also oncology. So, we think there's a lot of synergies associated with that science. Obviously, immunology, as you know, Alethia, goes across so many disease states. Immunology plays in the antivirals, for instance, particularly when we look at some of our HBV cure programs. But clearly, in the field of inflammation, we've already spoken about where we stand with filgotinib. We have a variety of follow-on agents within our Gilead research, with our partners with Galapagos, and we'll maintain an external view on opportunities to continue to advance our inflammation portfolio in-house. And you can see, of course, what we've done in the oncology field, predominantly immuno-oncology over the past year, really building up our oncology base based upon -- largely based upon immuno-oncology. Trodelvy allows us to have a really strong footprint now into solid tumors in a pan-tumor way, which we think will be very complementary to our first-in-class, best-in-class immuno-oncology portfolio. Merdad, maybe you want to add as well, your view on the -- on that question as well.\nMerdad Parsey: I think, you hit all the key points, Dan. I think, we -- the only thing I'd add is I think we really have a great team here. And I think that team is going to be really great about charting our future in immunology. But as Dan said, we remain committed to that. And we'll continue to look at both near and long-term opportunities there that makes sense for us in the portfolio.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: I mean, maybe, Merdad, it's just important to emphasize the unmet medical need in that area. It's still a very significant.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes. And we look at -- maybe the only other thing I'd add is that we look at it through a fairly broad lens of what immunology means. There are a lot of indications with a lot of unmet need that persist in that space. And we'll be looking for that transformative profile.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays.\nCarter Gould: Maybe just to follow up on that same sort of question on portfolio construction. Historically, old Gilead was routinely criticized for not being as disciplined with many of its mid-stage assets. Clearly, the pipeline is much broader. You guys highlighted sort of a return to discipline. Yet, it doesn't seem to be apparent, I guess, when we look to the pipeline side. When you think about the size and breadth of the pipeline today, are you comfortable with that? And I guess, will we start to see some of those prioritization decisions start to manifest soon, or if there's things you can point to today? That would be helpful.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Yes, Carter. Again, I think. the entire team here is dedicated to putting together a portfolio management process that's state of the art. I think, your question is very well taken. It's a work in progress, right? So, we're -- first of all, we've hired a lot of new people into the organization with terrific expertise in different therapeutic areas. We're putting processes into place across research and development, into our commercial organization to help us make decisions accordingly. And I think, you'll see some of those play out in the near term as well. But, the philosophy that Merdad and Johanna and the rest of the team and I are firmly committed to is drawing the line at a level that makes sure that the programs that hurdle that line are really first and best-in-class. And I'm really pleased with how the organizations progress, both from an operational perspective, but then also from a scientific perspective over the course of the past year. But, as you know, I mean, this is a continual process. And we need to make sure that we're constantly looking at the outside environment, looking at the unmet medical need, going back to where that line is drawn in our organization and making consequential decisions on the portfolio. And we intend to do that. We intend to make tough decisions and fund those most attractive opportunities. I would also say, the other thing we're looking very hard at is a balance in our portfolio. I think, in the past, Gilead has also been -- seen as a company that went after a lot of high-risk, high-reward projects. In some cases, those were not successful in the late stages. I think, we're firmly committed to having a balanced portfolio where we're always holding the bar high for innovation, but making sure we derisk as much as possible earlier in the stages of development such that when you get into the late-stage investments in Phase 3, things have been de-risked, and therefore, your ability to succeed rises as well. So, these are all very conscious things we're working on together. Merdad, again, I apologize if -- you've trained me well. You [indiscernible] things to add on that as one of the leaders in organizing this portfolio.\nMerdad Parsey: The only thing I'd add, Carter, it's a really insightful question. And it's something that we -- as Dan said, we're really committed to doing. And, what I would say is that you will see us exercising that discipline. That will be something that will be apparent sooner than later. And recognize that there are a lot of things that are in-flight that they don't make sense to deprioritize because they're already ongoing. So, we'll let those things read out. So, it'll probably take a little bit longer for everything to get taken care of in the wash, if you will. But you will definitely see that playing out with us as data get read out and as new things enter into the portfolio that we'll be exercising that discipline to make sure we're making some tough decisions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets.\nBrian Abrahams: A question on HIV, inventory and stockpiling. I'm wondering if you could quantify if what you observed in the third quarter was a benefit or just normalization. And if you look to fourth quarter and beyond, what should we expect with respect to potential stockpiling, just given the newest COVID spike versus inventory drawdowns?\nJohanna Mercier: So, maybe I'll take that one, Brian. I think, that as we're seeing Q3 -- this whole year, and I'm sure everybody kind of seeing this full year has been really interesting when it comes to inventory because we've seen a pattern that's very different than prior years, obviously, due to COVID-19. The expectation that we have this year is, as you normally see in Q4, you actually do have a lift in product supply at the end of December that plays into our total inventory for 2020. Having said that that's a little bit also impacted by the fact that Truvada\u2019s LOE, and there's now a generic on the market with Teva as of early October. And so, we believe that number is a little lower than the norm that we've seen in the past. We haven't assumed a -- stockpiling to your point about COVID-19 because it's already -- usually, Q4 is already on the rise versus other quarters. So, we've assumed that. What we've seen in Q3, to the first part of your question, I think, it\u2019s just normalization of the last couple of quarters. And you kind of -- if you recall, Q1 usually draws down on Q4 supply. What we saw is a pickup in March because of COVID-19 that then kind of bled out in Q2, and then we saw a pickup again in Q3, which I think is really the normalization of those two quarters. So assuming Q4 is like other quarters in the past, that's what's currently in our current projection. Hopefully, that addresses the thinking there for HIV.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nTyler Van Buren: I was just hoping to get a little bit more precision on the Veklury guidance. I guess if you take the midpoint of the updated guidance relative to the guidance in the beginning of the year and the Q3 sales, it could suggest that sales could be down significantly in Q4 quarter-over-quarter. So -- but then obviously, the core business has been impacted a bit by the pandemic, which could offset and make it more flat. So, I wanted to understand what you\u2019re modeling for Veklury in Q4 or what your guidance incorporates. And then, the second part of the question is, on the outpatient and the inhaled studies, can you give any more granularity on when we should expect that data? And how much do you think demand could increase if those studies are successful?\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Great. Thanks, Tyler. So, Andy, why don't you handle the guidance, and maybe we'll go to Diana for the updates on Veklury's next generation?\nAndrew Dickinson: Sure. Hi, Tyler. Thanks for the question. I appreciate it. We're not providing specific product guidance, as you know, and we typically don't. But, as you suggested and as we mentioned earlier, the revision in guidance is tied not entirely, but almost entirely to expectations around Veklury. Johanna also mentioned that there was some excess inventory in the channel as a result of the terrific work that our manufacturing team did. And you'll see in our materials that we're on track to meet the expectation that we had set in terms of 2 million treatment courses by the end of the year. So, as inventory was moving into the channel in the third quarter, at the same time that hospitalization rates and the severity of the outbreak in the U.S., at least at that time, was coming down, there was less demand in the third quarter than expected. And then, you see that play through in the fourth quarter. So, we didn't recognize revenue for all of the Veklury that was shipped in the third quarter, to be clear. Some of that was constrained, and then you see that playing through in the fourth quarter and the full year guidance. So, we can't be more specific than that. Happy to provide any additional color that we can, but we're not going to provide specific product level guidance. Maybe over to Diana.\nDiana Brainard: Hi, Tyler. So, our outpatient study is ongoing. We're recruiting actively. And in terms of our predictions, we think that that study will wrap up early next year, and we should have results in the first quarter. It is harder than is typical to predict the dynamics of trial enrollment for COVID-19. So much depends on the number of cases, the competition with other clinical trials. So, we're going to have to kind of take it month-by-month and see how the dynamics go. As you know, we're approved with Veklury for hospitalized patients or patients in equivalent in-patient setting. So, in terms of then what that does for us once we have the trial results, if it were successful, we would then look to getting an expanded label for that population. So, that would be further down the line. But our first step is to get the study enrolled and see how Veklury performs in the outpatient setting where we're trying to present hospitalization rather than hasten recovery in the hospital.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nUmer Raffat: Just two very quick ones. First, on Biktarvy perhaps, the IMS trends don't appear particularly encouraging for the last six months or so. I know it's growing, but not the way it was in the past. I would love to get your take on that. And secondly, on the capsid inhibitor, Merdad, how are you thinking about possible candidates for a combo? I know, there are other companies with HIV candidates as well, and this has been an ongoing question. Where are you guys headed at?\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Sure. Johanna can start, and then take it from there. Johanna, do you want to start?\nJohanna Mercier: Yes. Thanks, Umer. So, listen, we're really proud of actually Biktarvy growth. And I think that if you look at the share growth, it's basically 8 points of share year-on-year when you think about as Q3 '19 to Q3 '20. And when you look at Q2 to Q3, it's a point of share. So, we do think that the growth continues. Where we've seen a little bit more of an impact is from a market standpoint because if you think about the impact of COVID-19, it had a larger impact in our HIV treatment business really when it comes to switches. And so, it'll impact disproportionately newer agents in the market because physicians aren't switching to newer agents. But obviously, Biktarvy is part of that pool. The overall share of Gilead still remains really strong because of that because we -- more than 75% of patients are actually on a Gilead compound. And so, therefore, they're just remaining. There's less switches. We've seen that rebound a little bit in Q3. We expect that to continue through Q4. But I think, overall, if you think about it in the U.S., which is our larger business, right now, 1 out of 2 -- actually, more than 1 out of 2 patients starts on Biktarvy. We have about a 56% share of naive patients. And when you think about the switches, although the market for switches is a little bit lower, we're still roughly about 1 in 2 patients going to Biktarvy, and they're going to Biktarvy from a non-Gilead single treatment regimen, which I also think is a great place to be. So, we continue to feel extremely confident in Biktarvy's continued growth because you're seeing it basically happen across all of the markets around the world to really consolidate around Biktarvy. In addition to the fact that COVID-19 is actually for na\u00efve patients, a real advantage with Biktarvy because of the rapid start. And that's something that even guidelines are recognizing in light of the fact that you don't need to -- there's no genotype testing, there's no HLA testing, et cetera. So, that's also helping to continue to grow our share in the naive patient population. So with that, Merdad or Diana on the capsid.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes. I have to take that. Hey, Umer. As you mentioned, look, we have both, internal candidates for combining with lenacapavir, and we remain open. As you said, there are other agents out there that could potentially be combination partners. And we remain definitely open to figuring out what's in the best interest of patients. And we'll continue to be diligent on that front. So, I think both possibilities remain there.\nOperator: And I show our last question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nGeoff Meacham: I just had a couple on remdesivir. Dan, you've talked about likely not making a major long-term contribution. So, I just wanted to ask, are the investments in nebulized or next-gen programs still a priority in the near term? And the second one related is, how do you manage your inventories for when the infection step down happens, which is hopefully sometime next year?\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Geoff, for the question. Really helpful, I mean, to hear your context on that. I mean, let me say a couple of things, first of all. I mean, we think Veklury remdesivir will make a significant contribution certainly to Gilead. I mean, it already has, as you've seen in the sales to date, and we think through the end of this year and into 2021. And potentially, on a seasonal basis, beyond, I mean, one has to -- there's a lot we still don't know about the pandemic, of course. But I think what we do know is that in order to get us all back to normal, this is going to take a variety of approaches. Of course, it's going to take vaccines. It's going to take therapeutics in the hospital. It's going to potentially take combinations of therapies in the hospitals. And then, it's going to need therapeutics pre-hospitals. So, I think we're proud to be at the front end of this with a very potent antiviral, which is a bedrock I think of any approach to a pandemic. But, we'll continue to need investment. We're fully committed to the investment in line extensions here and in seeing where else we might be able to play in that continuum from pre-hospital setting to hospitalized patients. Obviously, we're not going to play in the area of vaccines, but in area of therapeutics. We think there's a very good return on that investment. I think, the challenge we have is -- by the way, we used to have a Tamiflu when I was at Roche, is it becomes difficult to predict. And you've seen it already in our -- at the half year, of course, we gave quite wide guidance to give us opportunities to understand where the pandemic was going and exactly how this into play a role in it. And now, what we've done is we've reaffirmed that guidance, but we've narrowed it. And I think as we go into next year and the year after, we're just going to need to stay adaptable and flexible on how much of a contributor Veklury is to us, but we do feel very strongly that Veklury will contribute to our overall sales, be an important source of cash for our business and allow us to pay down debt and make sure that we continue to invest in the routine part of our business in antivirals and beyond. I think, the other statement I would make though, Geoff, is that as a result of both the internal and external portfolio development over the past year, and in particular, the Immunomedics and Trodelvy transaction, excluding Veklury, we're now very confident in our ability to grow in the short and midterm. So I think, Veklury will come on top of that and may have year-to-year variability. But, I think that's really the story of today's call and the evolution of the course of the past year. And thanks for giving me the opportunity to kind of put that into context.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Douglas Maffei for closing remarks.\nDouglas Maffei: Thank you, Dillon, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead. And the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on our future progress.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. This concludes today's presentation. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Merdad Parsey",
            "content": "Thanks, Johanna, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to share some perspectives on several clinical pipeline-related updates and progress. Starting with Veklury. We're very pleased with the recent full approval of Veklury by the FDA. Veklury is now approved in the U.S. for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19-based disease on a strong and consistent body of evidence from three rigorous, randomized, controlled clinical trials over the past six months to inform us about the profile of Veklury. It's the first antiviral treatment proven to help patients hospitalized with COVID-19, recover and leave the hospital more quickly, a significant benefit for patients, their families and society. The results include the double-blind, placebo-controlled NIAID Phase 3 ACTT-1 trial, published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study met its primary endpoint of time to clinical recovery through day 29, demonstrating Veklury plus standard of care, reduced the time of recovery through day 29 compared with placebo plus standard of care from 15 to 10 days with a P-value of less than 0.001. The key secondary endpoint of clinical status at day 15 was also met. Patients receiving Veklury were 50% more likely to have it improved by day 15 compared with those receiving placebo, and the effect was maintained through day 29. The secondary mortality endpoint in the overall population only showed a trend towards reduced mortality with a P-value of 0.07. Recall that when we started these trials with the NIAID, we knew very little about the disease itself and didn't know which patients might be most likely to benefit from Veklury. Given the range of disease severity in the overall study population and the emerging understanding that clinical outcomes are highly dependent on a patient's requirement for oxygen at baseline, an exploratory post-hoc analysis was conducted to determine whether there were differences in mortality based on patients' baseline clinical status with respect to the requirement for oxygen support. In this post-hoc analysis, in patients requiring low flow oxygen at baseline, the largest subgroup of patients in the trial, over 40% of patients, those who received Veklury had a 72% reduction in mortality at day 15 and a 70% reduction in mortality at day 29, with confidence intervals that do not cross one. These results are what we would have expected and hoped for with an antiviral therapy that should have the most impact when given earlier in the course of the disease before the inflammatory cascade leads to critical illness. These data add to the breadth of evidence from two additional randomized controlled clinical trials, establishing the use of Veklury as a standard of care for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. All three of these Phase 3 trials have been published in peer-reviewed journals, and the raw data was shared with the FDA as part of the NDA review process for them to perform their own independent analyses as is their standard approach. We continue to pursue other ways to expand the utility of remdesivir as a backbone of treatment, including exploring how combinations could be more effective and new means of administering the drug that don't require intravenous administration. Now, last week, interim results from the World Health Organization Solidarity trial were released through a preprint server. These results don't alter the demonstration of efficacy observed with remdesivir in the studies I just described. That trial was intentionally designed to be pragmatic and enable participation across a wide range of healthcare settings. They are components of the study design and data that should provide pause. These may be clarified or placed into appropriate context during the peer review process. Given that we haven't received the data, nor have there been peer reviewed -- nor have these data been peer reviewed, it's difficult for us to discuss the study. Some of the issues we and others have identified in WHO study include the lack of a PCR confirmation of COVID-19 at the time of enrollment, the lack of distinction between patients requiring low-flow or high-flow oxygen in the results, no data monitoring, no data verification, and 20% of the data being reported as missing from the preliminary analysis. We can only speculate at this point that these factors may have contributed to the negative outcomes reported in this study. It is, however, important to note that the totality of data generated thus far for Veklury suggests that antivirals are most effective earlier in the disease course. As you get sicker, inflammation, such as ARDS or fibrosis, potentially things like vascular blood clots and bacterial pneumonias could kick in. The NIAID data suggests that patients on low-flow oxygen are those that show the greatest benefit in time to discharge and mortality. An antiviral doesn't clear inflammation or blood clots once they're formed. So, this makes sense. Sicker patients on high-flow oxygen and mechanical ventilation may need an antiviral, but it will be insufficient to treat the inflammation. In those patients, treatment in addition to antivirals such as dexamethasone may be beneficial and have been demonstrated to be that way, using WHO data. We look forward to learning more about the Solidarity trial results and sharing this information with regulators, once we have the data in hand. Most importantly, at this moment, the world is combating a pandemic that isn't going away. As we see infections once again on the rise across the U.S. and Europe, it's critical that physicians have every tool possible at their disposal, and that patients are encouraged to seek care for what we know can be a rapidly progressing and deadly virus. We're proud of the role Veklury has played in this pandemic, and I'm proud of and profoundly grateful to the team who's worked so hard to advance this medicine for patients, including those collaborators at the NIAID, the investigators and patients who've been integral to the conduct of these studies. We regularly receive letters of gratitude from people who've been treated with Veklury, and we're grateful for the opportunity to provide this important treatment during this time. So, now, I'd like to turn to oncology. As Dan mentioned, we're very excited now to have the Trodelvy program in-house with the closing of the Immunomedics transaction. We're excited to welcome the impressive Immunomedics team to Gilead. As Dan and Johanna both mentioned, Trodelvy represents a growth inflection point for the Company, and I'd like to highlight recent progress that has us excited about the full potential of this medicine. You may have seen the ESMO data that Immunomedics presented from the confirmatory Phase 3 ASCENT study. In this study, despite having received a median of four prior anticancer treatments, patients treated with Trodelvy showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival with a median of 12.1 months versus 6.7 months for chemotherapy and a hazard ratio of 0.48 and a P-value of less than 0.0001. Trodelvy also demonstrated statistically significant improvement in ORR, 35% versus 5%, and CBR, 45% versus 9%, when compared with chemotherapy. These remarkable results should establish Trodelvy as a new standard of care in patients with third-line metastatic TNBC. In urothelial cancer, another area of focus, as reported at ESMO last month, Immunomedics released the positive results from cohort one of the pivotal Phase 2 TROPHY U-01 study of Trodelvy in cisplatin-eligible patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. These results confirm the interim findings in prior Phase 1/2 study results, showing Trodelvy has significant activity and is well tolerated in patients with heavily pretreated metastatic urothelial cancer who progressed despite platinum-based chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors. Trodelvy has a potential to be an important new treatment for patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. Based on these exciting data, in terms of the path forward for Trodelvy, the BLA -- supplemental BLA seeking expansion of Trodelvy's label to include the ASCENT result is expected to be submitted in Q4 to the FDA under the RTOR program. The sBLA submission to the FDA for an accelerated approval of Trodelvy in metastatic urothelial cancer is expected in Q4 as well. In addition, the MAA for Trodelvy in metastatic TNBC in Europe is planned for submission to the EMA in the first quarter of 2021. The potential for Trodelvy in earlier lines of therapy and additional tumor types is something we're really excited to explore. Results from studies with combinations of PARP inhibitors and separately checkpoint inhibitors give us even more options to explore the potential of this new treatment for patients. Beyond Trodelvy, I'd like to highlight other opportunities in our oncology pipeline that continue to excite us. On magrolimab, our anti-CD47 asset, we continue to pursue options for filing an accelerated approval pathway from magrolimab in addition to azacitidine and MDS in 2021 based on the ongoing single-arm study. As with all single arm studies, the risk and the FDA will make a decision based on the totality of the data and whether the data support a substantial benefit from available standard of care. The recent breakthrough designation for magrolimab provides recognition by the FDA the potential for magrolimab, and enables us to have more frequent FDA interactions. We also have obtained prime designation from magrolimab, another recognition of the potential for magrolimab. We've initiated our enhanced randomized Phase 3 study comparing magrolimab plus azacitidine versus azacitidine alone in higher risk MDS patients to confirm the Phase 1 results for potential full approval. The emerging data from our partner, Arcus, is very exciting, and we look forward to updating you in due course. Moving to antivirals. We continue to be excited about lenacapavir, the Company's investigational long-acting HIV1 capsid inhibitor, an injectable administered every six months. The study evaluating lenacapavir in highly treatment-experienced HIV patients is progressing, and we're on track for a planned filing in 2021. We also recently announced the addition of a new study arm of lenacapavir to the women's -- to the existing planned women's HIV prevention study, evaluating Descovy and Truvada in women at risk of HIV. In parallel, we will also initiate a study of lenacapavir for HIV prevention in men and transgender people who have sex with men. Turning to filgotinib. We're excited about the launch of Jyseleca for rheumatoid arthritis in Europe. During the quarter, we shared data from the Phase 2b/3 selection trial in ulcerative colitis showing filgotinib 200 milligrams, induced remission at week 10 and achieved endoscopic, histologic and six-month corticosteroid free remission at week 58 with a consistent safety profile. We plan to file filgotinib for ulcerative colitis in Europe before the year-end and Japan early next year. As we previously shared, in August, the FDA issued a complete response letter for filgotinib in rheumatoid arthritis, requesting data from the MANTA and MANTA-RAy studies and expressing concerns regarding the benefit risk profile of the 200-milligram dose. We met with the FDA for a Type C meeting to discuss MANTA, and we'll meet again for a Type A meeting in Q4 to further discuss the CRL. In the meantime, we're pausing screening and enrollment for ongoing trials in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and uveitis as we believe the FDA meeting will inform the broader filgotinib development program. We continue to believe in the benefit risk profile of filgotinib. I'd also like to highlight that we remain committed to inflammation into our long-term collaboration with Galapagos. Finally, I wanted to highlight that we are focused on ongoing strategic portfolio review and disciplined prioritization of our overall portfolio. We've shared a summary of important upcoming milestones across the pipeline in the materials we've provided. I'll turn over the call to Andy now. Hi. Matthew, it's Merdad. Yes. I think, the outcomes -- it's hard to predict what the outcomes are. I do think that both the options you suggested are possible. And I would sort of tend towards your latter approach, which is that we would -- if things aren't able to move forward with RA, we'd like to keep the door open for us to continue to move forward in IBD and continue those discussions, obviously, dependent on the MANTA and the MANTA-RAy data outcome. Yes. Thanks. Great question. They're doing a really great job of exploring the potential of that program in multiple indications. And they have a great approach of trying to get there quickly, looking for early signals of activity. On our end, obviously, we would like to see the programs de-risked to the appropriate level at the time that we opt in. That will vary based on the signals we see and the magnitude of the improvement that we see. So, obviously, if you saw, hypothetically, a huge response in one indication that was really unexpected and blew it out of the water, we might opt-in more early. Whereas if it's more nuanced in a small trial, we might want to flush that out a little bit more before we opt in. Our contract allows us to continue to work with them as the programs are de-risked. And our desire is to opt in and move as quickly as possible once we have an appropriate level of risk. Yes. And I'll take the Trodelvy question, Geoffrey. Yes. Look, I think, what we know so far with the Trodelvy [indiscernible] combo is a couple of things. One is just looking at the combos where it's been tested, there's data with the parts and there's data with checkpoint inhibitors. And so far, those data seem to support the ability to go forward with combos. And that obviously opens a number of doors there for us to investigate. When we look at the adverse event profile and we look at what -- and we talk to the investigators about what they're seeing and how they're managing it, the tox is largely the neutropenia and the diarrhea, and often that the investigators are saying that toxicity seems to be manageable, something they're comfortable managing. And we're getting a lot of encouragement to move earlier in lines of therapy, based on that adverse event profile. The individual combinations will be dictated by the indication that we're in, right, whether it's breast, urothelial, lung, those combinations will depend. But, I think a big one will probably be the checkpoint inhibitors where I think we're optimistic and have reasonably good data about being able to combine there. I think, you hit all the key points, Dan. I think, we -- the only thing I'd add is I think we really have a great team here. And I think that team is going to be really great about charting our future in immunology. But as Dan said, we remain committed to that. And we'll continue to look at both near and long-term opportunities there that makes sense for us in the portfolio. Yes. And we look at -- maybe the only other thing I'd add is that we look at it through a fairly broad lens of what immunology means. There are a lot of indications with a lot of unmet need that persist in that space. And we'll be looking for that transformative profile. The only thing I'd add, Carter, it's a really insightful question. And it's something that we -- as Dan said, we're really committed to doing. And, what I would say is that you will see us exercising that discipline. That will be something that will be apparent sooner than later. And recognize that there are a lot of things that are in-flight that they don't make sense to deprioritize because they're already ongoing. So, we'll let those things read out. So, it'll probably take a little bit longer for everything to get taken care of in the wash, if you will. But you will definitely see that playing out with us as data get read out and as new things enter into the portfolio that we'll be exercising that discipline to make sure we're making some tough decisions. Yes. I have to take that. Hey, Umer. As you mentioned, look, we have both, internal candidates for combining with lenacapavir, and we remain open. As you said, there are other agents out there that could potentially be combination partners. And we remain definitely open to figuring out what's in the best interest of patients. And we'll continue to be diligent on that front. So, I think both possibilities remain there."

            "name": "Daniel O'Day",
            "content": "Thank you, Doug, and good afternoon, everyone. This has really been a pivotal quarter for Gilead. With last week's closing of the Immunomedics acquisition, we've effectively transformed our near and long-term growth story. Trodelvy, an approved medicine for third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer has tremendous potential for patients today and significant pan-tumor potential for the future. We're all excited to deliver on that potential along with the teams from Immunomedics who became a part of the Gilead family last week. I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone at Immunomedics for the extraordinary work that you've done on Trodelvy to-date. It's an honor to work with all of you now to build on those efforts to the benefit of patients with cancer around the world. The acquisition is undoubtedly an inflection point in terms of our growth and adds to the growing pipeline of transformational medicines that we've been strengthening over the course of the year. All of this is building on the strong foundation of our core business. We've seen the strength and durability of our HIV business once again in the past quarter, and we're confident in our long-term leadership. I'd like to briefly talk about the changing nature of our growth prospects, driven primarily by the acquisition of Immunomedics. I'll also touch on our core business and I'll share a few words about Veklury or remdesivir, which just gained FDA approval, and then Johanna and Merdad will pick up with more details. I'll start with Immunomedics and Trodelvy. The acquisition of Immunomedics is the largest transaction in Gilead's history and undoubtedly marked a turning point for the Company. As you know, Trodelvy is already approved in the U.S. for third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. The recent data at ESMO underscored its transformative potential for this particularly challenging form of cancer, as well as the potential for treating bladder cancer. We will explore expansion into earlier lines of therapy in the short term, and overall we see Trodelvy as a pipeline and a product. The prevalence of Trop-2 in multiple cancer types means Trodelvy has pan-tumor potential. Secondly, in addition to its extensive potential as a monotherapy, Trodelvy stands out because of the way it lends itself to combinations. The early data are promising and we look forward to exploring combinations with various types of agents going forward. The acquisition gives us an immediate presence in the field of solid tumors and brings us a significant expertise of the teams from Immunomedics. We're complementing our existing strengths in hematologic cancers, through our combined Kite and Gilead pipelines, and building on the important progress we've already made this year in building our oncology pipeline. Including Immunomedics, we've completed a total of 10 transactions in oncology so far this year. I'll just mention two of the significant opportunities that are the results of those transactions. Magrolimab is now in Phase 3 for MDS [and offers a] [ph] potential first-in-class option utilizing the CD47 pathway to activate the innate immune system. Our partnership with Arcus is progressing well. We are particularly excited by the potential of the TIGIT compound, as well as other work that's coming out of that collaboration. In cell therapy, we're now the only company with two FDA approved therapies, Yescarta and Tecartus from Kite. Earlier this month, we received a positive opinion for KTE-X19 from the European Medicines Agency, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. I'm also pleased to announce that the FDA has accepted the Yescarta sBLA for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. The agency also granted priority review for this application. ZUMA-7, the industry's first ever randomized trial in cell therapy and the only cell therapy in second-line with overall survival as an endpoint will be delayed slightly due to the slowdown in the rates of events. However, we expect the data in the first half of 2021, and based upon that data, we're ready to submit quickly after. In summary, we made great progress in building out and advancing our pipelines to drive growth this year. And Trodelvy represents a true growth inflection point, changing our outlook significantly, and positioning Gilead as an important contributor in the field of oncology. The foundation for all this additional growth is our durable core business. In HIV, we saw a solid rebound in the third quarter with 14% quarterly sequential growth in the global franchise. While COVID-19 continued to impact our business, there were clear signs of recovery in the third quarter. Moreover, the underlying demand is strong as Biktarvy continues to be the treatment of choice for patients and providers. On the prevention side, we exceeded the goal we set at the beginning of the year of switching 40% to 45% of clinically appropriate at-risk individuals on PrEP to Descovy. As of October 1st, we were at 46%. Johanna will share more perspectives on our third quarter sales in a few moments. Finally, I'd like to briefly comment on remdesivir, what we now refer to by its brand name of Veklury. Veklury received full FDA approval this month for treating hospitalized patients of COVID-19. It's the only FDA approved therapy for COVID-19 in addition to being authorized or approved for use in more than 50 countries worldwide. We are also now in a position to meet global demand because of the work we've done since January to ramp up our supply. It's worth stepping back for just a moment to recognize how remarkable it is that we are in this position today. At the start of the year, most of the world had not even heard of COVID-19. The scientific community knew very little about the virus or its devastating potential. Today, less than 10 months later, we have an FDA approved therapy that is helping patients around the world to recover faster, and for some groups of patients Veklury is lowering the risk of death. All of this comes at a time when the rates of hospitalization sadly in many places are increasing. We have repeatedly seen the clinical benefits of Veklury across multiple clinical trials. In the past quarter, these benefits have been unequivocally demonstrated by the gold standard of global clinical trials. The definitive results from the fully powered double-blind placebo-controlled and randomized NIAID ACTT-1 trial showed an average reduction in recovery time of five days. I sometimes imagine how I would feel if a family member was hospitalized for COVID-19. And I'm sure many of you think of this as well. I'm extremely grateful that a therapy exists that has been validated with all of the rigor required for an FDA approval and whose benefits have been demonstrated in peer-reviewed data from a trial that is without question the pinnacle of clinical studies today. Merdad will talk about all the recent data on Veklury, including what we've seen from the WHO study and the ongoing development program, shortly. Johanna will talk about the recent move to a commercial distribution model in the U.S., which is going very well. I'd just like to close on Veklury by expressing my gratitude once again to all the Gilead employees who've put their hearts and souls into this work since January, along with our many partners. On behalf of all of us, I want to say how privileged we feel to play a role in helping with the pandemic and be able to put our antiviral expertise to work for patients with COVID-19. I also want to emphasize that we will continue to do all it takes to fulfill our responsibility with Veklury. To wrap up my prepared remarks, I want to emphasize that our portfolio and pipeline are much stronger going into the fourth quarter and 2021. By executing on our strategy in a disciplined way throughout the past 12 months, we have significantly changed the nature of our growth process, especially following the acquisition of Immunomedics, and we have maintained the long-term durability of our core HIV franchise. We're not done, of course, but we made significant progress. And for that, I want to thank all the teams at Gilead and Kite, and our many partners worldwide. With this, I'll hand the call now over to Johanna. Sure, Michael. Yes, couldn't agree more. Look, I think, the conversation we'll have in the Type A meeting will center around really what level of evidence the FDA would be looking for on both of those issues, right, in terms of trying to get to a better benefit risk understanding. And so, that will depend -- so we need to find that out from the 200-milligram standpoint, and we need to find it out from the MANTA and MANTA-RAy standpoint. So, those two things we will get guidance from the FDA at the Type A meeting. And then, based on that outcome, we will make some decisions how to go forward, whether it's -- whether there's a clear path, whether we have to only go forward in IBD or whether 200 milligrams is not viable until MANTA reads out -- MANTA-RAy readout. All those are possibilities. So, it's hard to speculate what the outcome of that will be. We'll be transparent obviously as we have that discussion with how we'll proceed. Thanks, Alethia. I'll start and then maybe Merdad can add as well. But first of all, I mean, nothing has changed about our dedication to our three disease areas. As you know, I mean, our strategy that we announced at the beginning of the year was based upon two really strong scientific disciplines that we have from a discovery perspective at Gilead and with our partners, and that is antivirals and immunomodulation. And we've been firmly focused on that strategy in terms of how it plays out in both, antivirals, inflammation and fibrosis, and then also oncology. So, we think there's a lot of synergies associated with that science. Obviously, immunology, as you know, Alethia, goes across so many disease states. Immunology plays in the antivirals, for instance, particularly when we look at some of our HBV cure programs. But clearly, in the field of inflammation, we've already spoken about where we stand with filgotinib. We have a variety of follow-on agents within our Gilead research, with our partners with Galapagos, and we'll maintain an external view on opportunities to continue to advance our inflammation portfolio in-house. And you can see, of course, what we've done in the oncology field, predominantly immuno-oncology over the past year, really building up our oncology base based upon -- largely based upon immuno-oncology. Trodelvy allows us to have a really strong footprint now into solid tumors in a pan-tumor way, which we think will be very complementary to our first-in-class, best-in-class immuno-oncology portfolio. Merdad, maybe you want to add as well, your view on the -- on that question as well. I mean, maybe, Merdad, it's just important to emphasize the unmet medical need in that area. It's still a very significant. Yes, Carter. Again, I think. the entire team here is dedicated to putting together a portfolio management process that's state of the art. I think, your question is very well taken. It's a work in progress, right? So, we're -- first of all, we've hired a lot of new people into the organization with terrific expertise in different therapeutic areas. We're putting processes into place across research and development, into our commercial organization to help us make decisions accordingly. And I think, you'll see some of those play out in the near term as well. But, the philosophy that Merdad and Johanna and the rest of the team and I are firmly committed to is drawing the line at a level that makes sure that the programs that hurdle that line are really first and best-in-class. And I'm really pleased with how the organizations progress, both from an operational perspective, but then also from a scientific perspective over the course of the past year. But, as you know, I mean, this is a continual process. And we need to make sure that we're constantly looking at the outside environment, looking at the unmet medical need, going back to where that line is drawn in our organization and making consequential decisions on the portfolio. And we intend to do that. We intend to make tough decisions and fund those most attractive opportunities. I would also say, the other thing we're looking very hard at is a balance in our portfolio. I think, in the past, Gilead has also been -- seen as a company that went after a lot of high-risk, high-reward projects. In some cases, those were not successful in the late stages. I think, we're firmly committed to having a balanced portfolio where we're always holding the bar high for innovation, but making sure we derisk as much as possible earlier in the stages of development such that when you get into the late-stage investments in Phase 3, things have been de-risked, and therefore, your ability to succeed rises as well. So, these are all very conscious things we're working on together. Merdad, again, I apologize if -- you've trained me well. You [indiscernible] things to add on that as one of the leaders in organizing this portfolio. Great. Thanks, Tyler. So, Andy, why don't you handle the guidance, and maybe we'll go to Diana for the updates on Veklury's next generation? Sure. Johanna can start, and then take it from there. Johanna, do you want to start? Thanks, Geoff, for the question. Really helpful, I mean, to hear your context on that. I mean, let me say a couple of things, first of all. I mean, we think Veklury remdesivir will make a significant contribution certainly to Gilead. I mean, it already has, as you've seen in the sales to date, and we think through the end of this year and into 2021. And potentially, on a seasonal basis, beyond, I mean, one has to -- there's a lot we still don't know about the pandemic, of course. But I think what we do know is that in order to get us all back to normal, this is going to take a variety of approaches. Of course, it's going to take vaccines. It's going to take therapeutics in the hospital. It's going to potentially take combinations of therapies in the hospitals. And then, it's going to need therapeutics pre-hospitals. So, I think we're proud to be at the front end of this with a very potent antiviral, which is a bedrock I think of any approach to a pandemic. But, we'll continue to need investment. We're fully committed to the investment in line extensions here and in seeing where else we might be able to play in that continuum from pre-hospital setting to hospitalized patients. Obviously, we're not going to play in the area of vaccines, but in area of therapeutics. We think there's a very good return on that investment. I think, the challenge we have is -- by the way, we used to have a Tamiflu when I was at Roche, is it becomes difficult to predict. And you've seen it already in our -- at the half year, of course, we gave quite wide guidance to give us opportunities to understand where the pandemic was going and exactly how this into play a role in it. And now, what we've done is we've reaffirmed that guidance, but we've narrowed it. And I think as we go into next year and the year after, we're just going to need to stay adaptable and flexible on how much of a contributor Veklury is to us, but we do feel very strongly that Veklury will contribute to our overall sales, be an important source of cash for our business and allow us to pay down debt and make sure that we continue to invest in the routine part of our business in antivirals and beyond. I think, the other statement I would make though, Geoff, is that as a result of both the internal and external portfolio development over the past year, and in particular, the Immunomedics and Trodelvy transaction, excluding Veklury, we're now very confident in our ability to grow in the short and midterm. So I think, Veklury will come on top of that and may have year-to-year variability. But, I think that's really the story of today's call and the evolution of the course of the past year. And thanks for giving me the opportunity to kind of put that into context."

            "content": "Thanks, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter performance was strong, and it reflects the solid underlying fundamentals in our core HIV franchise and the start of the post donation phase for Veklury. It also reflects the ongoing and dynamic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. You will find our detailed Q3 results in the press release and materials we have posted. In my following remarks, I will review elements of our Q3 performance and provide you with an update on our full year guidance. Turning now to the financial highlights. Total revenues for the third quarter of 2020 were $6.6 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.11. This compares to total revenue of $5.6 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.64 for the same period last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2020 increased 29% year-over-year, primarily due to higher operating income driven by growth in HIV product sales and our initial Veklury sales as well as lower non-GAAP tax rate. As noted in the earnings press release, on a GAAP basis, the third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.29, primarily due to $1.2 billion in charges related to our collaborations and equity investments in building out our oncology pipeline as well as a $900 million loss from unfavorable changes in the fair value of our equity investment in Galapagos. Product sales for the third quarter of 2020 were $6.5 billion, up 28% sequentially and up 18% year-over-year, primarily due to Veklury sales and our core HIV products driven by stronger demand as well as higher volume as channel inventory continues to normalize in the United States. HIV revenues grew sequentially 14%, driven by a continued patient uptake of Biktarvy and Descovy for PrEP and increased channel inventory purchases in the United States. HIV revenues increased 8% year-over-year, primarily due to higher demand driven by Biktarvy, and as I said earlier, the normalization of inventory purchases in the U.S., partially offset by lower sales of Truvada. HCV revenues grew 4% sequentially, primarily due to higher patient starts in the United States and Europe, but the revenues were down 31% year-over-year, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on patient starts. Cell therapy revenues were down 6% sequentially due to COVID-19 and up 25% year-over-year, driven by continued patient uptake and expansion of Yescarta in Europe. Now, sturning to our expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $1.2 billion for the quarter, down 3% sequentially and up 12% year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by lower investments in remdesivir in the third quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher investments in remdesivir, partially offset by pauses or deferrals of certain clinical trials due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $1.1 billion, down 6% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year. The sequential decrease in expenses was primarily driven by the second quarter accrual of $97 million related to a Department of Justice matter, which subsequently settled in the third quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by headcount growth, partially offset by lower marketing spend due to COVID-19. Now, moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We finished the quarter with $26 billion in cash and marketable debt securities. During the quarter, we generated $2.3 billion in cash flow from operations. We paid dividends of $861 million. We repaid $2 billion of maturing debt, and we repurchased $201 million of stock. In addition, we issued $7.25 billion of senior notes and arranged a $1 billion term loan, which we drew down in Q4 to partially fund the acquisition of Immunomedics. After closing the Immunomedics acquisition, our balance sheet remains strong and our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We have, however, curtailed our share repurchase program in the near term as we focus on paying down debt incurred in the acquisition. As Dan indicated, the acquisition will immediately accelerate our revenue growth and is expected to be neutral to accretive to our non-GAAP EPS in 2023 -- by 2023 and significantly accretive thereafter. Turning now to COVID and its continued impact on our business and the broader business environment. As we do every quarter, we've updated our base case utilizing external projections and views. As you know, the pandemic continues to progress in unpredictable ways. The recent uptick of infection and hospitalization rates in the U.S. and Europe is obviously of concern to all and will potentially impact the business environment during the fourth quarter and into 2021. Globally, external views suggest widespread vaccination will not become a reality until late in 2021. As a result, we expect the pandemic to continue to impact our business and broader market dynamics, including in particular, HCV, HIV PrEP and Veklury demand into 2021 and potentially beyond. We also expect that our HIV treatment business will continue to remain largely unaffected and that the remainder of our core business will continue to recover in the fourth quarter and into the first half of 2021. With that as context, let me turn to our updated full year 2020 guidance. It's important to reiterate that we are operating in a highly complex and dynamic environment and that projections are subject to greater uncertainty than it's historically been the case. We have reaffirmed and narrowed our revenue guidance range to $23 billion to $23.5 billion, reflecting the latest estimates for Veklury. The guidance range provided during our second quarter earnings reflected underlying uncertainty in demand -- in the demand dynamics for Veklury, given the nature of this pandemic, and as Johanna mentioned earlier, factors such as the rate of infections by region, severity, hospitalizations and stockpiling demand, all of which have been difficult to forecast. On the expense side, we're raising our SG&A expense guidance to low-double-digit percentage growth, reflecting the Immunomedics acquisition. Our full year operating income guidance range is reaffirmed and narrowed and is now US$10.7 billion to US$11.2 billion. Our full year non-GAAP EPS range is also reaffirmed and narrowed and is now 6.25 to -- $6.25 to $6.60 per share. As we think about our performance to date and our guidance, we are encouraged by the significant process we've made in such a challenging environment this year. Before we hand the call off for Q&A, we would like to express our gratitude to our 12,000 Gilead and Kite employees globally. Their spirit, dedication and resilience make it possible for us to have a meaningful impact on patients with some of the world's hardest to treat diseases. We'd now like to open the call for questions. Cory, it's Andy. I'll start, and Johanna can jump in as well. I think, it's relatively straightforward. I mean, it's a dynamic situation. It's very difficult to forecast, as we've discussed. And as I think most people understand, the rate of hospitalizations is the biggest factor that has moved around a lot over the last six months, and it continues to move today. So, what you're seeing is our -- the latest estimate based on the information that we have we're pleased with the uptake in the third quarter, obviously, with the formal U.S. approval, the joint procurement agreement in place, Johanna and her team, I think, have a better sense of where we see the year, but it's still very dynamic and is unusual compared to what you have to typically forecast. Johanna, if you want to add anything to that? Sure. Hi, Tyler. Thanks for the question. I appreciate it. We're not providing specific product guidance, as you know, and we typically don't. But, as you suggested and as we mentioned earlier, the revision in guidance is tied not entirely, but almost entirely to expectations around Veklury. Johanna also mentioned that there was some excess inventory in the channel as a result of the terrific work that our manufacturing team did. And you'll see in our materials that we're on track to meet the expectation that we had set in terms of 2 million treatment courses by the end of the year. So, as inventory was moving into the channel in the third quarter, at the same time that hospitalization rates and the severity of the outbreak in the U.S., at least at that time, was coming down, there was less demand in the third quarter than expected. And then, you see that play through in the fourth quarter. So, we didn't recognize revenue for all of the Veklury that was shipped in the third quarter, to be clear. Some of that was constrained, and then you see that playing through in the fourth quarter and the full year guidance. So, we can't be more specific than that. Happy to provide any additional color that we can, but we're not going to provide specific product level guidance. Maybe over to Diana."

            "content": "Hi, Tyler. So, our outpatient study is ongoing. We're recruiting actively. And in terms of our predictions, we think that that study will wrap up early next year, and we should have results in the first quarter. It is harder than is typical to predict the dynamics of trial enrollment for COVID-19. So much depends on the number of cases, the competition with other clinical trials. So, we're going to have to kind of take it month-by-month and see how the dynamics go. As you know, we're approved with Veklury for hospitalized patients or patients in equivalent in-patient setting. So, in terms of then what that does for us once we have the trial results, if it were successful, we would then look to getting an expanded label for that population. So, that would be further down the line. But our first step is to get the study enrolled and see how Veklury performs in the outpatient setting where we're trying to present hospitalization rather than hasten recovery in the hospital."

            "name": "Johanna Mercier",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to begin by building on Dan's comments about our durable core business. Our results through Q3 amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have been strong. And as anticipated, we continue to see signs of recovery during the quarter in underlying demand trends across our core franchises in U.S. and Europe. Looking at our HIV business. We continue to make great progress in both treatment and prevention. Biktarvy in treatment and Descovy for prevention continue to gain share quarter-over-quarter. In treatment, Biktarvy remains the number one regimen across key global markets. In the U.S., one in two new patients start on Biktarvy and roughly one in two patients switching to Biktarvy do so from a non-Gilead single tablet regimen, growing overall Gilead share. In PrEP, despite COVID dynamics, we continue to make progress with Descovy with 46% conversion of clinically appropriate individuals at risk at the end of September, exceeding our stated goal of 40% to 45%. Our overall HIV revenue in Q3 was very strong with 14% sequential growth over Q2 and 8% year-over-year growth, driven by both, strong demand fundamentals and normalized inventory dynamics. The unique quarterly phasing of inventory dynamics this year and the recent Truvada loss of exclusivity will impact our sequential quarterly revenue dynamics in the fourth quarter. With 91% of Gilead's U.S. patients having converted to TAF-based regimens, we will continue to build on our strength in HIV, including long-acting formulations for both, treatment and prevention. Now, briefly on HCV. Our HCV business showed 4% sequential growth over Q2 while down 31% from Q3 last year due to lower patient starts year-on-year. As markets started to reopen in the U.S. and Europe, we saw an increase in diagnosis and patient starts in Q3. Our stock market share across core markets puts us in a position of strength as patients return through the rest of the year and into 2021. I'd like to now highlight some specifics on the initial commercialization of Veklury, which began in the third quarter. As our teams have begun reaching out to physicians and hospital systems, it has been incredibly inspiring to hear their stories of how they have used this medication and what it meant to patients as well as their loved ones. As a reminder, the commercial model in the third quarter was governed by an agreement with the U.S. government to allocate 90% of our supply to patients in the U.S. through a partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. During the quarter, we recorded Veklury sales of $873 million. A portion of inventory that will be consumed in Q4 was recognized as revenue in the third quarter. As Dan mentioned, we have now pivoted beginning October 1st to a more traditional commercial model, working directly with AmerisourceBergen to provide Veklury directly to U.S. hospitals. AmerisourceBergen will remain our sole distributor of Veklury through the end of the year to ensure consistency and continuity. In Europe, we signed a joint procurement agreement with the European Commission on October 8th that enables participating countries in the EU, the European Economic Area and UK to purchase Veklury to meet both, real-time demand and stockpiling needs, coordinated by the European Commission. This agreement temporarily removes the need for country-by-country reimbursement processes that typically follow marketing authorization, recognizing the urgency of the current health crisis. It encompasses purchases of Veklury over the next six months and can be extended, if needed. Predicting the underlying demand of core Veklury continues to be challenging, given so many variables, including incidence rates, hospitalization rate as well as future vaccines and emerging treatments. Now, turning to Trodelvy. As you know, the Immunomedics deal closed less than a week ago, and we're already working closely with the joint team to ensure the continuity of Trodelvy's strong launch in third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and accelerate its future potential. It is a true catalyst for growth, and the joint team is energized as we continue to accelerate the work on this transformational therapy together as one team. While not part of our third quarter results, I'd like to highlight Immunomedics Q3 results for Trodelvy in the U.S. Trodelvy achieved $53 million in net sales in Q3, the first full quarter of commercial availability. Total net sales were $73 million in the first five months of commercial launch in the midst of a pandemic. Over 1,000 accounts ordered Trodelvy in the first five months of commercial launch, and of those about 488 were new and unique in Q3. We've seen robust adoption continue in Q3 in both, community and academic centers. We look forward to expanding commercialization to Europe and other markets around the world as quickly as possible, starting with an EU submission in Q1 of next year. And to close, a few words on Jyseleca, which is the brand name for filgotinib. Jyseleca has now launched in Germany, and launch planning is well underway across Europe as well as Japan. We anticipate sales in both regions during the fourth quarter. Despite a crowded and competitive marketplace, the teams are well-prepared to differentiate Jyseleca. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the future. Merdad will provide a little bit more color on the ongoing regulatory considerations and our thinking there. And so, with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Merdad. Yes. Maybe just to add to that, Andy, I think, what we're also seeing is the severity of the disease. So, I think as you saw through the summer months, even though there were surges, going through the U.S. mostly, some of those were younger patient population. And therefore, the hospitalization rates really dropped over the summer months. We were seeing closer to 12% to 15% late Q2. And as you go into Q3, they're closer to 5%. So, we're really tracking those very closely. It's not just the incidence. It's really, to Andy's point, the hospitalization rates. And obviously, the assumption is, in light of the surge this fall, both in Europe as well as in the U.S., that those numbers will pop back up a little bit. So, that would be one piece of the puzzle. The other piece, I would say, is we looked at some of our assumptions around stockpiling, and although we've seen some stockpiling, not at the level that we had originally projected. And so, we're adapting to that as well. So, let me start, Geoff, with the Veklury question around usage. So, what we've seen is, obviously, in Q3, a little bit of a interesting dynamic in light of most of the supply was committed through the HHS to U.S. patient population. So, there was a bit of an inventory build through the Q3 that you're going to see play out in Q4 in the U.S. specifically. We're also in a situation due to the incredible work that's been done by our manufacturing teams to be in a situation where our current supply now is at a level where it is exceeding global demand. So, we feel very confident in making sure we can -- global demand around the world, namely in Europe right now, in light of not only the drug procurement agreement, but in light of the recent surge that you're seeing across countries in Europe. I think, to your point about percentage of patients, it really varies across countries but also regions. And I do think that that percentage is increasing as we speak. As the FDA approval came out last week, we're already seeing a lot more noise around that, but also in light of the fact that we have a field team. So medical and commercial that are now going out to make sure that physicians are aware and educated on where best to use Veklury. And I think that's one of the pieces that's the most important. So, that's playing out as we speak. But, we have seen probably out of hospitalization rates in many countries anywhere between 40% to 50% in the U.S. usage of remdesivir. And of course, that number will only grow as people better understand the data now that it's been published as well as approved through the FDA. And maybe, Merdad, on Trodelvy. So, maybe I'll take that one, Brian. I think, that as we're seeing Q3 -- this whole year, and I'm sure everybody kind of seeing this full year has been really interesting when it comes to inventory because we've seen a pattern that's very different than prior years, obviously, due to COVID-19. The expectation that we have this year is, as you normally see in Q4, you actually do have a lift in product supply at the end of December that plays into our total inventory for 2020. Having said that that's a little bit also impacted by the fact that Truvada's LOE, and there's now a generic on the market with Teva as of early October. And so, we believe that number is a little lower than the norm that we've seen in the past. We haven't assumed a -- stockpiling to your point about COVID-19 because it's already -- usually, Q4 is already on the rise versus other quarters. So, we've assumed that. What we've seen in Q3, to the first part of your question, I think, it's just normalization of the last couple of quarters. And you kind of -- if you recall, Q1 usually draws down on Q4 supply. What we saw is a pickup in March because of COVID-19 that then kind of bled out in Q2, and then we saw a pickup again in Q3, which I think is really the normalization of those two quarters. So assuming Q4 is like other quarters in the past, that's what's currently in our current projection. Hopefully, that addresses the thinking there for HIV. Yes. Thanks, Umer. So, listen, we're really proud of actually Biktarvy growth. And I think that if you look at the share growth, it's basically 8 points of share year-on-year when you think about as Q3 '19 to Q3 '20. And when you look at Q2 to Q3, it's a point of share. So, we do think that the growth continues. Where we've seen a little bit more of an impact is from a market standpoint because if you think about the impact of COVID-19, it had a larger impact in our HIV treatment business really when it comes to switches. And so, it'll impact disproportionately newer agents in the market because physicians aren't switching to newer agents. But obviously, Biktarvy is part of that pool. The overall share of Gilead still remains really strong because of that because we -- more than 75% of patients are actually on a Gilead compound. And so, therefore, they're just remaining. There's less switches. We've seen that rebound a little bit in Q3. We expect that to continue through Q4. But I think, overall, if you think about it in the U.S., which is our larger business, right now, 1 out of 2 -- actually, more than 1 out of 2 patients starts on Biktarvy. We have about a 56% share of naive patients. And when you think about the switches, although the market for switches is a little bit lower, we're still roughly about 1 in 2 patients going to Biktarvy, and they're going to Biktarvy from a non-Gilead single treatment regimen, which I also think is a great place to be. So, we continue to feel extremely confident in Biktarvy's continued growth because you're seeing it basically happen across all of the markets around the world to really consolidate around Biktarvy. In addition to the fact that COVID-19 is actually for nai\u0308ve patients, a real advantage with Biktarvy because of the rapid start. And that's something that even guidelines are recognizing in light of the fact that you don't need to -- there's no genotype testing, there's no HLA testing, et cetera. So, that's also helping to continue to grow our share in the naive patient population. So with that, Merdad or Diana on the capsid."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Mr. Douglas Maffei, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nDouglas Maffei: Thank you, Liz. And good afternoon everyone. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the first half and second quarter 2020. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. The speakers on today's call will be: Daniel O'Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Johanna Mercier, Chief Commercial Officer; Merdad Parsey, Chief Medical Officer; and Andrew Dickinson, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for Q&A will be Christi Shaw, Chief Executive Officer of Kite; and Diana Brainard, SVP and Head of our Virology Therapeutic Area. Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements including risks and uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gilead's business, financial condition and results of operations, plans and expectations with regards to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, financial projections and the use of capital and 2020 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to Dan.\nDaniel O'Day: Thank you, Doug, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking our Gillian employees worldwide, who along with our partners, continue to go above and beyond to meet our many responsibilities at this time. Those responsibilities include advancing remdesivir, supporting work across our other medicines that are helping patients today and building our pipeline of future therapies. We'll cover each of those during today's call. I'm pleased to have the team with me here to provide an overview, and we all look forward to answering your questions. I\u2019ll start things off with some of my perspectives. The first thing I want to comment on is the continued strength and durability of our core HIV business. We've grown market share even as we navigated the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we're already seeing early signs of recovery from that impact in some markets. We are confident in our long-term leadership in HIV. People living with HIV depend on innovative therapies that meet their needs and Gilead is and has always been focused on meeting those needs. Like TAVI has become the gold standard in HIV treatment and we're on track with our conversion to discovery for priory treatment. The principles that have driven our HR&D growth to date still apply and will continue to drive our growth in the future. The second area I want to comment on is our role in fighting the pandemic with remdesivir. There's a growing body of clinical and real world data that continues to shape our understanding of the medicine. The data tell a consistent story of clinical benefit for patients suffering from COVID-19 across our SIMPLE studies, the NIAID data, compassionate use data, and more recently the comparative analysis that use real world data. I'd also like to highlight some details in our efforts to ensure a broad access to remdesivir in the second half of the year and beyond. As we discussed last time, we feel the full weight of our responsibilities with remdesivir and that applies to the price we set following the donation period. We price remdesivir well below the value it provides to enable access at this critical time and ensure that we continue to meet our responsibilities in the future, with further investment in remdesivir and in research that will help us to prepare for any future pandemics. The extensive clinical development work continues on remdesivir so that we can potentially extend the treatment to many more patient groups. We have begun clinical work on an inhaled solution that could be used outside of the hospital. And we'll also conduct clinical trials using the intravenous formulation in the outpatient setting, such as nursing homes. Merdad will talk more about the development program later.  As you know, we've agreed to the U.S. Government requests, following discussions about the significant rise of COVID-19 infections in the United States, the U.S. patients will receive 500 million treatment courses of our supply until the end of September, when we expect to have enough remdesivir to meet real time global demand. As announced yesterday, we are pleased to reach an agreement with the European Commission where they will centrally purchase remdesivir for patients in the European Union and the UK. European Commission will be responsible for all decisions regarding allocation among member states. The remaining supply of remdesivir will be allocated to other countries with significant rates of COVID-19 infection. We will see a significant increase in supplies in October as expected. The third theme I want to touch on is the progress we're making and shaping Gilead's growth story. You may recall that we previously shared a framework outlining the three pillars that will shape Gilead's next chapter. And you'll see these in the slides on our website today as well. I've already touched on the first pillar, which is our durable core business. And Johanna will describe our achievements on this front in more detail in a moment. Pillar two is our pipeline. And we made important progress across several potentially transformational assets in a relatively short period of time with a balance of both internal innovation and acquired investigational compounds. Pillar three is our strategy to drive future growth by accessing the highest quality external innovation in order to serve more patients. The pace of our corporate development activities has not slowed down a bit during this pandemic time. I'd like to highlight the progress we made this year on executing on our immuno-oncology strategy. Our goal is to grow or immuno-oncology pipeline and our expertise both through external opportunities and by advancing our internal efforts. The range of immuno-oncology deals we've announced this year represents significant progress towards this goal. These deals bring complimentary scientific approaches and provide access to clinical and preclinical assets with a view to both mid and long-term growth. Before I hand over to the team for the detailed comments in our progress, I want to briefly mention something that we see as another key area of responsibility for the company, the work against racial injustice. We are passionately committed to using Gilead's platform for what we see as a global issue that calls on everyone to play a role. The leadership team and I have spent the past week listening carefully to black employees as they've started to share with us how they, their families and their communities experience racial injustice in various forums. Gilead is committed to both immediate and long-term action that will have a lasting impact for our employees and the communities that we serve. Let me now hand the call off to Johanna, who will walk us through some of the key details related to our business performance. Over to you Johanna.\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Dan. And good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by saying that despite the anticipated impact of the pandemic, our business is solid and remains resilient. While COVID-19 has had an impact on parts of our business, this past quarter, we're built to withstand this kind of challenge, we remain confident in the strength of our core business. No one can actually predict the progression of this pandemic, but we do see signs of recovery and partial return to normal in Europe, as well as some parts of Asia. And we're confident that this will also play out in the U.S. once the incident stabilizes. Turning out to the specifics of Q2 in the first half for business performance, starting with HIV. Our HIV franchise is strong and durable. In both treatment and prevention we have a patient focused history of innovation and believe both will continue to be important drivers for the company over the next decade. In June, we hit our stated year-end goal this conversion to TAF-based regimens on the treatment side and are now at 90% of our total portfolio. Biktarvy uptake continues to remain strong across geographies and is the number one HIV treatment regimen across the U.S., EU5 and other key global markets in those na\u00efve and switch. For PrEP, we achieved our goal of 40% to 45% Descovy conversion with 43% at the end of June. We continue to believe that physicians and patients are benefiting from choice and are increasingly seeing Biktarvy for treatment and Descovy for PrEP as the preferred option for their patients. The quarter overall was down year-on-year, 1% and quarter-over-quarter by 3%. The impact on our HIV revenue, including Biktarvy was primarily driven by inventory dynamics. In Q2, we saw a reversal of the pandemic related stocking that happened in March during the onset of COVID across U.S. and Europe. Also on the treatment side as expected, we're seeing reduced switches due to the decline in patient visits and physicians not wanting to initiate new therapies during the pandemic. We're also seeing unfavorable shift in payer mix from commercial to government segments. Despite this, our overall demand remained robust with both the overall Gilead\u2019s portfolio and Biktarvy gaining share quarter-over-quarter and year-on-year. The pandemic impacted PrEP demand as expected, and we saw reduced initiations and therapy discontinuations due to fewer people seeing their health care providers and social dynamics. We're starting to see gradual recovery across our markets, including in the U.S., where we saw improving PrEP churns in June. Sound Biktarvy uptake and Descovy for PrEP conversion during the quarter underscores the confidence we have in our core HIV business, as we expect to recover from the pandemic over the remainder of the year and going into 2021. If we look at our HIV business comparing the first half of revenues this year versus 2019, we see the robust underlying business with 6% growth. The half year view normalizes the inventory dynamic associated with the pandemic. So now, if we turn into HBV, our HBV business, which is more like an acute business was down 47% from Q2 in 2019 and down 39% from Q1 this year. As we discussed during the Q1 call reduced or delayed physician visits naturally decrease both diagnosis and patient starts. U.S. HBV starts for down 42% quarter-over-quarter. However, overall US HBV share has held strong at about 60% across segments, which is up 11 points from Q2 to 2019. Similarly, we are seeing strong and consistent share in Europe as well. As other markets start to reopen, similar to what we saw in June and July across Europe, it's likely we will see many patients return throughout the rest of the year and into 2021. As an example of this in Italy, which was heavily impacted by COVID earlier this year, we saw recovery in June as more patients, especially the higher risk patients, started to return to their physicians and begin treatment. Before I close, just let me highlight for you a range of commercial opportunities on the horizon that make us also excited to be part of the Gilead team. In the near term we're pleased with the significant volume growth we're seeing in China, despite the impact of COVID as we received foreign RDL approvals at the end of 2019. This also served as a basis for expanding HBV business, which we expect to hit one billion globally, by the end of 2022. We're preparing to launch filgotinib in RA in the coming months and are excited about the recent CHMP positive opinion. As we look to the mid-to-long-term, we're accelerating our efforts to build our portfolio and expertise in immuno-oncology. We see strong potential for magrolimab, where we recently highlighted key data at ASCO. Magrolimab could be a very important therapy for MDS patients. And lastly, on HIV and lenacapavir, we believe that long-acting will play a role in the future HIV market and see the potential for this compound to best meet patient needs. Merdad will share more on the clinical progress on lenacapavir in a moment. So let me end where I started. Our core business is durable, the fundamental demand drivers of our HIV treatment and prevention businesses remain real, and we're optimistic heading into the second half of the year. We have an incredible core portfolio driven by HIV, and we're building a compelling set of opportunities as we continue on our journey. And lastly, I just want to thank all 12,000 of our colleagues who have demonstrated that they can continue to deliver for patients who need our medicines, both in our base business and more recently with remdesivir. It's the first time in my career, I've seen a company go from an investigational compound to a launch product serving hundreds of thousands of patients in a matter of months, but it just reinforces for me, Gilead history and commitment to patient focused innovation. I'm very proud to be part of this team. Merdad, turned it over to you.\nMerdad Parsey: Thanks, Johanna, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm excited to be here and share with you some of the perspectives on our pipeline that continues to both progress and to grow despite these challenging times. As you've seen, our pipeline expansion continued during this period driven by the strategy that Dan referenced earlier. Of course remdesivir is an important part of this story and while managing the added responsibility of working as diligently as possible on remdesivir, we're also able to make great strides across the rest of the pipeline. Let me share some of those highlights with you. We look at a pipeline for three key things. We'd like to see that the level of diversification across the different therapeutic areas is good. The balance across the phases of development and the quality of the assets we have in development along with our associated risk. That's where I'd like to turn now. We continue to build in each of our therapeutic areas as reflected in other exciting set of clinical data readouts and presentations at scientific meetings during this quarter. This includes data that further validate our belief in some of our key assets including the magrolimab, lenacapavir and of course remdesivir. Let me share a few specific highlights in each of our strategic areas. In HIV, we continue to make progress on the next chapter of our commitment to people living with HIV by working on a long acting option. Lenacapavir, our investigational capsid inhibitor continues to show promise as a potential agent, both for long acting treatment and for prevention. The Phase II, III study that has continued to enroll during the pandemic, and we look forward to data from this trial for highly treatment-experienced people with HIV, who often have few, if any other options. People living with HIV tell us that the most desirable long-acting regimens are either a weekly oral or in every three to six months subcutaneous injection, preferably that can be self administered. The profile lenacapavir gives it the potential to achieve both of these options, and for the potential to be a key therapeutic component for both treatment and prevention. Now turning to remdesivir. A lot of the data have been generated over the past six months that all inform us about the profile of remdesivir. As Dan pointed out, the thing that stands out as a consistency across these data, and I like to take a step back and highlight a few key pieces of the story. One piece is that we see the recovery time for patients in the hospital is short. Another is at the five-day course of treatment is appropriate for those patients. And finally the drug can be [indiscernible]. We've now published data that demonstrate a benefit and mortality compared with standard of care using a comparative analysis of real world data. As you know, there was a trend towards benefit and mortality at day 14 and ID study. And we now wait the final day 28 data from that trial as well. We also continue to pursue other ways to expand the utility of remdesivir, including new formulations and exploring how combinations could be more effective. We'll begin our Phase I study on an inhaled version of remdesivir that uses commercially available nebulizers. Beyond that, we're working on the feasibility of a dry powder formulation for inhalation and a subcutaneous formulation. We're also supporting several clinical trials exploring potential combinations. In each of those studies, remdesivir is being used as a back-bone standard of care agent. We are really proud of the role, remdesivir has played in this pandemic and I couldn\u2019t be prouder the team worked so hard. As you remainder, Diana Brainard, who leads our virology team is here with us today, and she will be happy to share additional insights during the Q&A. Moving on to filgotinib. We continue to believe that this selective JAK inhibitor has a potential to provide a new option for patients suffering from a variety of inflammatory diseases. I'd like to update you on recent discussions with regulators on rheumatoid arthritis. In Europe, we're pleased to receive the positive CHMP opinion for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. The opinion includes both 100 and 200 milligram doses and indicates use is appropriate as monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate. As a reminder, anticipates a scientific recommendation to the European Commission to grant marketing authorization in Europe. We continue to have ongoing dialogue with the FDA. We've been informed that there will be an Advisory Committee meeting and the PDUFA date remains unchanged. Moving on to oncology. We made strides during the quarter, and throughout the first half of the year in advancing our pipeline and accelerating our efforts to build our portfolio and expertise in immuno-oncology with several key transactions. First, we completed the acquisition of Forty Seven that we announced during the first quarter. This brings filgotinib into a core pipeline investing compound currently being developed for [indiscernible] as well as much of the impressive 17 will now complement our internal team. We're also very excited about the Arcus partnership, which provides our ability to have tail tractions that work both for us and our partners. This partnership brings us a potentially differentiated major compound as well as investigational high PD-1 monoclonal antibody. We're also excited to work with the excellent experienced clinical team at Arcus for the development of these programs. This partnership gives the caution on everything in their pipeline and allows the Arcus team to continue to pursue groundbreaking signs. Tizona and Pionyr are deals that give us options targeting other immuno-oncology approaches. And in each of these transactions, we have the option to acquire the entire company based on clinical data. These new programs build on our existing partnerships and our internal pipeline. In cell therapy, we all congratulate Christi Shaw, our colleagues at Kite for the recent approval of Yescarta for relapsed/refractory MCL. Kite and Gilead are now the first company have multiple approved cell therapy products that will bring benefit to even more patients with difficult-to-treat cancers. The Kite team also reached a major milestone with the successful approval and launch in June of the NCCN manufacturing site with the end-to-end production that expands the ability to treat more patients. Christi is with us here today and happy to share more thoughts during the Q&A. Materials we've provided. We've shared a summary of important upcoming milestones across the pipeline. In closing, our senior R&D team continues to build with the addition of leaders in data science, clinical biomarkers, pharmacology, clinical operations, portfolio management, inflammation and oncology. All of these leaders bring added expertise to an already world-class team, and we're excited to have them join us. Let me turn the call now over to Andy.\nAndrew Dickinson: Thanks, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to cover three topics to round out our commentary before turning to Q&A. First, I'll provide a summary of our financial highlights for the quarter and the first half of 2020. Second, I will provide some additional color on the potential implications of COVID on the second half of 2020 based on updated assumptions drawn from external experts and outside thinking. Finally, I'd like to pull all this together and review our revised 2020 financial guidance. As a reminder, the earnings materials posted on our website contain additional information, including the details of our 2020 revised financial guidance. Turning now to our financial highlights. Total revenues for the second quarter were $5.1 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.11. As noted in the earnings press release on a GAAP basis, we recorded a diluted loss per share of $2.66, primarily due to a $4.5 billion in-process research and development charge related to our acquisition of Forty Seven. This compares to revenue of $5.7 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.72 for the same period last year. Product sales for the second quarter were $5.1 billion, down 7% sequentially and down 10% year-over-year. As anticipated, the second quarter product revenues were unfavorably impacted by COVID-19. The year-over-year quarterly decline was also impacted by approximately $160 million of favorable adjustments recorded in the second quarter of 2019 for statutory rebates, primarily to HCV and HIV prior year sales in Europe. This decline was partially offset by HIV growth driven by Biktarvy in the United States. As Johanna mentioned, the quarter-over-quarter decreases in HIV revenues was primarily driven by the reversal of the Q1 increased buying patterns due to the pandemic as well as lower U.S. PrEP demand and unfavorable U.S. payer mix. Sequentially, the decrease was partially offset by treatment growth and seasonable higher net price in the U.S. and inventory patterns. The decrease in HCV revenues sequentially and year-over-year primarily reflects lower volume due to lower diagnoses and patient starts due to the pandemic. Yescarta revenues grew sequentially and year-over-year, primarily driven by the continued patient uptake in Europe. Overall product sales for the first half of the year were $10.5 billion compared to our $10.8 billion for 2019. Excluding recent LOE products for Ranexa and Letairis, our business grew year-over-year despite the impact of the pandemic. If we compare the first half of 2020 versus the same time period in 2019, we the HIV inventory dynamics associated with COVID-19 are normalized and our first half results demonstrate strong underlying HIV demand growth, with the business up 6% over 2019. This reflects a strong and encouraging start to the year in our core HIV franchise despite the impact of COVID-19. You can find more information, including the geographic breakdown of revenues in the materials we have posted. Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $1.2 billion for the quarter, up 19% compared to the same period last year and up 18% sequentially, primarily due to our investment in remdesivir, including clinical trials and manufacturing scale-up costs. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $1.2 billion, up 6% compared to the same period last year and up 8% sequentially, primarily due to a $97 million accrual related to a previously disclosed Department of Justice investigation. From a liquidity standpoint, we continue to be very well positioned. During the quarter, we generated $2.6 billion in cash from operations, and we ended the quarter with $21.2 billion in cash and marketable debt securities. We completed our acquisition of Forty Seven this quarter for $4.7 billion, net of cash acquired, we paid cash dividends of $856 million, and we repurchased 700,000 shares of stock for $54 million. Our strong balance sheet investment portfolio are built to withstand macroeconomic events like COVID-19, and our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to focus on investment to augment internal and external innovation in support of continued pipeline expansion. In addition, we intend to support and grow our dividend over time, provided that any dividend increase is, of course, subject to approval from our Board. Finally, as it relates to repurchase of shares in 2020, we're on track relative to the directional guidance we provided in our fourth quarter 2019 and year-end earnings call in February. Turning now to the COVID-19 impact on our revised guidance. Importantly, as you heard earlier in the call, the fundamentals and durability of our long-term outlook remains very strong. We expect that our core business will gradually recover starting in Q3, following peak pandemic impact on underlying treatment initiations and switch dynamics that we observed in the second quarter. We continue to expect minimal impact on our HIV treatment business over time with maintenance of high market share. In HCV, we expect patient starts to regain momentum in the third quarter and beyond. In addition, since our first quarter earnings call, we have established global pricing for remdesivir, and we have refined our expectation for remdesivir for the year. As you would expect, there are still many uncertainties concerning the shape and duration of the recovery in the second half of the year as well as the availability and uptake of remdesivir. With that as context, let me summarize the details of our revised full year guidance. Our revised top line revenue range, including expected sales of remdesivir in 2020 is US$23 billion to US$25 billion. We're increasing our 2020 R&D and SG&A expense expectations. Our guidance on expected product gross margin and effective tax rate for 2020 remained unchanged. Our updated operating income range is $10.7 billion to $13 billion. And finally, our updated non-GAAP EPS range is $6.25 to $7.65. I'd like to highlight a few additional points that will give you more color on the assumptions that drove this updated guidance. On the expense side, R&D and SG&A guidance increase to reflect expected expenses for remdesivir, Forty Seven and the litigation accrual that I mentioned earlier. On remdesivir, as we've previously stated, we expect to manufacture 2 million or more treatment courses cumulatively in 2020. Our revenue guidance reflects that we expect to sell 1 million to 1.5 million treatment courses of remdesivir this year. We expect that remdesivir demand will be skewed towards the U.S. in the third quarter and that the proportion of ex-U.S. sales will increase in the fourth quarter and beyond. That said, the progression of the pandemic, the global economic backdrop our supply expectations, the potential uptake of remdesivir in related matters continue to be dynamic and uncertain. We expect to learn more over the coming months, and we'll update you on our latest thinking on our Q3 earnings call. Before I hand the call off for Q&A, I'd like to express my gratitude as well to our 12,000 Gilead employees globally. Without their spirit, dedication and resilience, nothing we strive to achieve for patients would be possible. Now I'd like to open the call for questions. Liz?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tyler Van Buren with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nTyler Van Buren: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess with respect to the HCV and HIV share increases that you saw during the pandemic, you talked about coming out of the pandemic stronger. So could you just provide a little bit more color on that?\nDaniel O'Day: Sure, Tyler. I\u2019ll turn right away to Johanna.\nJohanna Mercier: Okay. Thanks, Tyler. Yes. So for example, in HIV, when you think about Biktarvy and Descovy, which is our two lead brands both for treatment and prevention, Biktarvy grew share. So it's been growing here year-on-year but even quarter-over-quarter. So we grew share to 33% in Q2 for Biktarvy. And then when you think about on a very large basis, you can appreciate, so that's about a 1% share increase. And then when you think about Descovy, we were \u2013 we closed the quarter Q1 at about 37% and in the PrEP market and we ended up at the end of June at 43%. So I do think that despite some of the dynamics because of COVID-19 and some of the decrease in patient visits and screening, I still do think that that the brands are solid because of their portfolio, because of what they offer for patients. And one of the things, both of those brands are actually brands that in COVID-19 environment are actually probably the best choice for patients because if you think about Biktarvy and you think about no monitoring, no HLA testing, et cetera, those are really the rapid start with Biktarvy is critical for patients. And I think that, that's also helping to support Biktarvy throughout this transition with the pandemic.\nTyler Van Buren: And just as a quick follow-up. With respect to the Biktarvy share gains, are those share gains or switches? Are they different during the pandemic as they were prior to the pandemic? Are they coming from \u2013 is the regimens that they're taking share change at all?\nJohanna Mercier: Yes, the sourcing of business is actually about the same. The only difference I would say is our \u2013 the switch in treatment is obviously a little bit slower than what we've seen in the past just because physicians don't want to switch there's actually guidelines that suggest no switching during the pandemic from drug to drug. So it's more the naive patient population that's feeding Biktarvy right now versus the switch population and older compounds are keeping share. So since Gilead has about 75% within HIV, basically what you are seeing is some of our older brands are keeping higher share versus then switching over to newer compounds like Biktarvy.\nTyler Van Buren: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Tyler. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from comes from Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. Your line is now open.\nGeoffrey Porges: Thank you very much. So, maybe a couple of questions on remdesivir. Andy, you indicated, I think you're going to sell 1 million to 1.5 million courses, but it sounds as though you're supplying 0.5 million courses just in Q3. So could you give us a sense of what your upside capacity is given the capacity initiatives that you have in place for the year? And secondly, how you see the demand beyond those 500,000 courses in Q3 are you on an allocated basis already in Q4? Or is there some uncertainty about the demand? And then could you just give us a sense of how you've incorporated that into your guidance? There must be there's a huge range in your operating income. So I presume that's being driven by remdesivir. But could you kind of give us more color on that? \nAndrew Dickinson: Yes. Maybe I\u2019ll start with one final point and ask Johanna. Oh, go ahead, Dan. I'm sorry.\nDaniel O'Day: Perfect. No, that\u2019s great. Thank you.\nAndrew Dickinson: Maybe I\u2019ll ask Johanna to comment on the upside of the supply and the demand in Q3 and Q4. The \u2013 there is a wide range, and it is driven by our remdesivir expectations. So Johanna mentioned we're learning more week by week. We just started commercializing recently. So we do expect that we'll be able to narrow our thinking and give you an update on the \u2013 in the third quarter, Geoff, as you would expect. Johanna, do you want to touch base on the supply and demand issue?\nJohanna Mercier: Sure. Yes. Sure. So maybe just add to what Andy was saying for Q4 specifically. I think the uncertainties are multiple, and it's not just our supply actually is less of an uncertainty because I think we have a pretty good idea, and the ramp-up has been impressive. The team has done incredible job ramping up, and you really see that ramp up through in Q4. We feel that \u2013 and I think Dan mentioned this \u2013 we feel that by early October, we should be in a place, assuming somewhat, I don't know if stable is the right word, but some stability within this pandemic globally across the numbers, we should be in a situation where global supply meets global demand, and that's a great place to be in. We can't wait because it's been challenging thus far. The \u2013 in Q4, the uncertainties are more around the pandemic itself and not really understanding does it stabilize, does it come to an all-time low, like we've seen in Europe? We really don't know. And so that's why it's a little bit tougher to manage on that front. As mentioned before from a supply standpoint by the end of December of this year, we should be in a position to have cumulatively of over 2 million treatment courses. And some of those, obviously were used during the donation and some are being used in Q3. So the balance of that will be in play for Q4, and we're just working with all the different governments, not just the U.S. but governments around the world to better understand what they think their real-time need is, and that's really our focus right now is the real-time need.\nGeoffrey Porges: Okay. Thanks very much.\nDaniel O'Day: Geoff, and we'll update you and everybody else in quarter three, obviously. So this is our best estimate at this stage.\nGeoffrey Porges: Okay. Thank you.\nDaniel O'Day: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nMichael Yee: Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. Following up on remdesivir, two questions. One is maybe you can make a comment about thinking about the actual demand and sales that you've actually done versus actually utilization. We've done some math around actual utilization, and it sounds like a lot of this could actually be a former stockpiling. So maybe you could just comment on that type of dynamic. That would help us think about future use? And then the second is just looking forward even a little bit, you've made some comments about injectable and inhaled. Is this just a PK question? What do you have to look for in Phase I data? And what are the challenges? And would you have this data and know this by, say, fourth quarter? Thanks.\nDaniel O'Day: Sure. I\u2019ll start, and then Johanna, you add and then we'll go to Merdad the injectable. So first of all, Michael, I think really, the vast majority of the remdesivir that we have today is being used. The allocation process with the U.S. government has gotten better over time, and they really are allocating basically at least twice a month, sometimes more frequently to where the hotspots are in the United States, and that's the vast majority of the supply. So we think there's probably very little demand that is not being utilized at this stage. Of course, it's not completely efficient, and there are some pockets where you might have some hospitals that have more remdesivir than patients. But right now, given the tremendous human need in the United States, in particular, and a variety of other countries we're working with, we're really just working on the real-time demand right now. So that's being utilized. Johanna, do you have anything else you want to add to that.\nJohanna Mercier: Yes. Maybe, Dan, just to add to that, Michael, I would just add the fact that it's also based on incidents in epidemiology. Everything we are doing, working with the U.S. government, working with ex-U.S. governments as well, governments around the world, it's really based on the incidents. And what we've seen so far is that because of the way we're managing it with the HHS, a lot \u2013 some hospitals have actually said, \"no, thank you. Give it to somebody who needs it. We don't need it right now.\" So I do think that people are coming together to work through this, understanding that there is a shortage of supply and understanding that it really needs to go to patients in need, and the worst thing that could ever happen is products sitting idle somewhere. So we're being very, very careful to make sure that doesn't happen anywhere in the world.\nDaniel O'Day: I think the earliest is October, Michael, that we would start to see actual demand and utilization perhaps be different and perhaps the opportunity for stockpiling, but not before October. Merdad, over to you on Michael\u2019s question.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes. Yes. So what I'd say is, as I mentioned, we're working on both being inhaled in the subcu. The inhaled ahead and, as I mentioned, in Phase I right now in the dose escalation phase. Our \u2013 the hypothesis here is that the virus in many patients, especially early is primarily in the one. And so the question is for a patient, can we treat an outpatient with an inhaled or [indiscernible] or potentially even an inpatient. With inhaled version get where it needs to be a narrowing in the lung and whether that would have a benefit for those patients. So that's the extent we're going to be running with the inhaled version. As far as subcutaneous, we'll continue to work on that. That currently is not in the clinic. And as I mentioned, we're looking at feasibility and other parameters of bringing that online.\nMichael Yee: Thank you.\nDaniel O'Day: Michael. Good, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nTerence Flynn: Hi, thanks for taking the question and thank you for all the work on the COVID front. I was wondering, first, just on the financials, if you could try to quantify the impact from COVID on a dollar basis that you saw in the quarter? And then I was wondering, as you think about capsid, obviously, important long-term opportunity for you guys. Just conceptually, are you focused on finding a partner for that internally to continue to dominate the market in terms of share? Or are you open to looking for an external partner? And as a result, splitting the economics on the future market? Thank you.\nDaniel O'Day: Great. So why don\u2019t Andy you take the financials, and we'll have Diana take the capsid question.\nAndrew Dickinson: Yes. Thanks, Dan. And hi, Terence. Thanks for the question. As you know, we don't provide specific \u2013 we didn't provide a specific guidance in terms of the COVID impact. I would say, at a high level, it impacted our business exactly in the way that we expected, so it hit predominantly. As you heard from Johanna in the HCV treatment and HIV PrEP business, the impact was substantially less than $0.5 billion on our top-line revenue in the first half. So rather than thinking about it on a quarterly basis, Terence, I think it's easier to think about it on the first half basis as you've heard from other companies as well, given the pull forward of inventory at the end of the first quarter. Hopefully, that's helpful.\nDiana Brainard: Great. And I can speak to our capsid inhibitor and our vision of our long-acting HIV franchise. And there, what I would say is we're looking at our past success, and it's really been driven by focusing on trying to meet the needs of patients and doing that agnostic to where we come up with the compounds of the regimen. And so in the past, that's been through acquisitions. It's been through partnerships, and it's, of course, been through internal discovery. And we really do have unparalleled excellence in terms of our internal discovery, and we're doing a lot of work there to try to find a partner for capsid. So we are also open and always looking externally as well with the idea that we will be successful if we create the best regimen for patients.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Terence for the question. Okay, can we go to the next one please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Market. Your line is now open.\nBrian Abrahams: Hi, there. Thanks very much for taking my question. Question on filgotinib. With the PDUFA upcoming and the current state of the pandemic, I'm curious, your latest thoughts on launch approach and potential for differentiation through the label or otherwise, how that shapes your commercial strategy. And then I'm also wondering if there's any reason that why the CHMP recommendations on dosing and indication. Wouldn't necessarily be illustrative of global positioning for the product? Do you think FDA and EMA are still looking at the JAK benefit risk profiles differently? Thanks.\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks. Maybe I can start...\nDaniel O'Day: Yes. Go ahead Johanna, why don\u2019t you start and Merdad wants\u2019 to add anything as well. But go ahead, please.\nJohanna Mercier: Okay. Thanks for the question. So yes, so obviously, pleased with the recent positive CHMP opinion, and we are working \u2013 we've been working diligently with the teams around the world to prepare for launch with filgotinib. We are looking at the COVID situation. And in assessing the situation, to be honest with you, maybe a couple of months back, we were thinking virtual, not virtual. But I think in light of kind of what \u2013 where we're seeing the dynamics of the market, I think virtual is the way to go. And so we're looking at how we do this and the best approach. So more to come on that front, a lot of work going on to make sure that we do this as competitively as possible. From a differentiation standpoint, it's in line with what we've talked about before. We believe in the profile of filgotinib and the differentiation that it offers. And so therefore that that's really an opportunity medically to make sure that to our medical teams, that conversation, that education happens with physicians. Merdad, do you want to comment on the regulatory piece?\nDaniel O'Day: I think Merdad is having a bit of an audio issue, so I'll feed in here Brian. I think it's kind of premature to anticipate exactly what's going to happen in different regulatory authorities around the world. We continue to have discussions with all regulatory authorities, obviously Europe was the first one out of the gate. We're pleased with that. And as soon as we have some additional information, we'll let you know, but difficult to speculate. Thanks.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.\nAlethia Young: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. And congrats on everything that you guys have been doing here, it's incredible. I guess I just wanted you to kind of maybe talk big picture about like, of course, there's some remdesivir, which could have some earlier kind of utility beyond in the treatment cycle, but just where we are with that things as well and kind of how you think about the positioning of remdesivir, maybe perhaps over the next couple of years? Even though I know I'm asking to look at a crystal ball. Thank you.\nDaniel O'Day: You're a great cheerleader for us. Thank you very much Alethia. So yes obviously, I think, our general position on this is that you will always need effective therapeutics and effective vaccines to control any type of a viral outbreak of any type and certainly one in a pandemic. So I think we're firmly committed to working to expand remdesivir's impact. We\u2019re really pleased at every piece of data in our hands or in other people's hands has been consistent, consistent about the effect in terms of reduction in hospital space, consistent around the ability to use it earlier in hospitals space and get even bigger impacts. And I think that will continue regardless of vaccination. Now our hope obviously is like you have the normal influenza that with an effective vaccine appropriately administered to as many patients as will take a vaccine around the globe that you could reduce the number of patients that ever have to enter the hospital. But, as we know, vaccines are never a hundred percent effective, they are never a hundred percent utilized, so there will always be patients that need therapeutics. And what we're excited about in terms of the potency of remdesivir is the ability to use it earlier on patients to get them out of the hospital faster. And also to make sure that the types of work we're doing now using remdesivir outside the hospital could prevent patients from ever having to go in. Of course that's all to be determined. So I think it will be hand in glove with vaccines. And obviously we're looking forward also to the work that's going on in terms of looking at antiviral, a potent antiviral that has been proven like remdesivir in patients to be used, perhaps in combination with other therapeutics to get an even stronger treatment effect. But that continues to be, I think, our view and we're hoping, and I'm really proud to be working in this industry at this stage because my colleagues around the industry, I know are doing everything possible, including the collaboration that they have with us in remdesivir to bring new therapeutics and vaccines to patients. And so we're excited about that. So thank you very much for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. And this is Matthew on for Cory. So just to go back to Biktarvy, are you able to quantify how much of the 2Q weakness was due to inventory pull through versus other factors that you mentioned? And should we expect these other factors such as a shift in payor mix and slow down in patients, which is to persist for the remainder of 2020?\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks. Over to you, Johanna. Thanks, Matthew.\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks Matthew for their questions. If I understood it, sorry you broke up a little bit, but if I understood it correctly, it was specific to the Biktarvy and the shift in what's driving it and it's really the inventory fluctuations, that's what's driving the shift from Q1 to Q2. And you can appreciate Q4 always a little bit higher, it plays out in Q1, it bleeds out in Q1, but then we saw the uptake because of COVID-19 in late March and we saw that bleed out in Q2. So it's really what's driving the Biktarvy piece. We have seen a payer mix shift in the last two quarters, where due to unemployment we're seeing a shift from commercial payers to government channels, specifically PHF and Medicaid, but at this point in time that's really not impacting or modestly impacting our business overall. So it's really inventory-driven.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.\nJohanna Mercier: Hopefully I answered your question.\nUnidentified Analyst : Yes.\nJohanna Mercier: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nGeoff Meacham: Hey guys, thanks for the question. I had a strategic one for Dan or even Andy. Dan, when you took over the narrative for Gilead was a return to growth as hep C was stabilizing. And of course, I get the headwinds from COVID, but sustainable growth has still been evasive. So the question is, do you view remdesivir as new product that anchors your long-term growth, or do you feel like you need other assets, obviously recognize that filgo and Kite are also in growth mode, but you need other assets to help drive sustainable more long-term growth. Thank you very much.\nDaniel O'Day: Yes, sorry about that Geoff I was chatting the way there. Let me say, it's certainly the latter to your question, Jeff. And that is that as happy as we are, that we can have an impact on patients in the COVID crisis with remdesivir. We completely understand that hopefully by the way for the world, that we'll get to a stage where the pandemic is much more predictable and remdesivir is playing a role. But not what we're relying upon for our mid-to long-term growth in the company.  So we believe that rather the continued emphasis on our core business to make sure that we not only continue to lead with HIV today, but also tomorrow with the next generation of medicines combined with what we have in our internal pipeline. And then growing our overall immuno-oncology business, both Kite and outside of Kite. And I think that's what you see as we think about now outside of virology, moving into inflammation, moving more deeply into oncology, particularly outside of Kite. You are going to continue to see, I think, more of what you've seen in the first half of this year, which is an ability to both optimize our current portfolio in house and continue to do smart, targeted deals that allow us to bring transformational medicine innovation into our house at different stages of development. And obviously that goes along with different risk profiles, right? And that's, I think, where BD team under Andy's leadership has done a really good job of making sure we're doing fit-for-purpose transactions, where when we're going after first or best-in-class, there's risk associated with it. We're trying to be prudent about how much capital we deploy upfront particularly on the earlier stage assets and kind of pay for success over that period of time. And there are others where we've seen the late-stage data like Forty Seven where we feel quite confident and bullish about bringing that in and using the breadth and depth of Gilead to look at expense of life cycle management on a medicine like magrolimab that has a leading position in a competitive environment to allow us to think about multiple different indications in hematologic malignancies, and possibly also looking at solid tumors. So that type of a strategy is absolutely fundamental to grounding us and continuing to build on our mid-to long-term growth story. Andy, anything which you'd like to add from your side?\nAndrew Dickinson: I think you said it well, that captures it.\nGeoff Meacham: Thanks Dan.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nEvan Seigerman: Thank you so much for taking the question. I actually have one for Christi. I know you haven't spoken much on the call and congrats on your very recent approval of Tecartus. Can you help us better understand kind of how you view the commercial's potential for this asset? And have you seen the reversal in trends around CAR-T used this month versus say June or May? And how should we think about the trajectory over the course of the year?\nChristi Shaw: Thanks for the question, making sure I'm wide awake and listening. We\u2019re so pleased about being the first company to be able to deliver for mantle cell lymphoma patients, Tecartus that has a curative intent. And so, although it's not a huge opportunity relative to DLBCL or some of our other studies that will be coming up like second line, it really is a differentiator for us in the marketplace to continue to demonstrate our leadership. Just like with Yescarta, our manufacturing footprint, we're gearing up. We have a ready to go in seven days, authorized sites \u2013 authorized for the new product within 30 days. So we're very hopeful that all of these patients that have nothing else to keep them alive, actually have something that can help them with such great efficacy. When we look at what happened in Q2, I'd say we were maybe pleasantly surprised that more patients were treated than we thought would be, based on COVID. And I will say that with what's happening now with the states in the U.S. we continue to see slowdown versus what we saw in the Q1 in terms of registrations. So I do think we're not going to see huge uplift in Q3, and we could be a flat and I don't know if we maybe lose some growth. But right now it's too early to tell. But I'm not as optimistic about Q3 and hopefully, when we come out of this situation we\u2019ll get better. And I'm really proud of the Kite team, because as you can imagine with all of the flights being canceled early on, and with having to figure out which ATC is to bring T cells back to where you didn't originate being able to hold T-cells where we haven't before, the team hasn't missed a beat and hasn't missed a delivery. So as I look at the whole of Kite and we look at the whole of the opportunity, it's really multiple indications in a very short period of time with mantle cell lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's, indolent Hodgkin's lymphoma by the end of this year being submitted. We have ALL being submitted and with priority review next year being approved. And we also have the big indication of second line DLBCL to be submitted next year. So as you look at that combination, I do think it gives us the best opportunity for growth and to potentially cure more patients of their cancer.\nEvan Seigerman: Thank you so much.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Evan, and we're looking forward to hearing more from Christi as that Kite business develops. More to hear from you. Thanks Evan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Harrison: Great, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask a little bit more about filgotinib and MANTA. So it sounds like you've finished enrollment, I think, it's either about three months when you take the primary end point there. So I'm just wondering how the timing of getting the data from MANTA, which it sounds like it could come towards the end of this year versus the approval timeline for filgotinib. How those two work and your ability to get that data to the FDA or how that influences the application? Thanks.\nDaniel O'Day : Hey thanks Matt we'll turn it right over to Merdad. \nMerdad Parsey: Hi Matthew its Merdad. I hope everybody can hear me. Sorry I got disconnected earlier. So you are right in some regards Matthew, the patients are all enrolled. I don't \u2013 we don't anticipate that the three months is going to be the duration necessarily that will be sufficient for the regulators, in terms of looking at both onset and recovery. So while that first three months is a critical period, we think that's the blinded period, there's probably longer to be that's necessary. So we're looking at probably late in this year, early next year for us to have the data and then for us to submit it to the agency in the first half of next year. Those are the kinds of timelines we're looking at.\nMatthew Harrison: Okay. Thanks very much for your question.\nMerdad Parsey: That\u2019s it or do you have a question, thanks, Matthew.\nMatthew Harrison: Yes, no, that's it. Thanks Dan.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks. Next please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Hi guys. Thank you for taking the question. First one Dan, any thoughts on what you think about the executive orders being implemented and how you might run the business if they were to do so going forward, especially on business development? And for Christi, what would you like to augment your CAR-T portfolio? It\u2019s done a lot of deals in IO. What else do you think you might need to be competitive in the space with the biospecifics and other things moving forward? Thanks.\nDaniel O'Day: Yes, thanks Robyn. I mean, first of all, let me just take a big step back from the executive orders. I mean, I know that we all agree at Gilead that the current system in the U.S. needs to change. And we're leaning into that in a variety of different fronts have been now for a couple of years. What's really important is that when we look at changes in the U.S. system that is done in a way that ensures that patients are the one to benefit and at the same time that we maintain the U.S. innovation model. So, the types of things that we've been working with the different packages within the Congress and the Senate have all reflected that. And now, as we look at these executive orders, we'll be looking forward to engaging with the White House and with others to have the very principles that I just mentioned articulated and that's where we\u2019ll go. In terms of how that impacts, how we think about the future business, I would say that we have so many healthcare systems around the world, I think, that we're working with of course the U.S. is disproportionally important to us. But our belief firmly is that if you hold the bar high enough on transformational medicine, so in other words, if you really think hard about first-in-class and best-in-class and keep the bar high regard, because remember our cycle time is so long, our capital investment is in a decade that we can't be pivoting to one or the other particular governmental action. The bottom line is that we keep that bar high enough under any system under any scenario. I think we'll do first of all, well for patients and we'll do well for shareholders as a result of that. So that's my firm belief. Christi, over to you on Robyn\u2019s question please.\nChristi Shaw: Yes. Thanks Robin. So I think in the short term, we're looking at how do we cure those patients that aren't getting the effects of CAR T cell that we'd like. Yescarta is the only CAR-T that's been able to show the longest duration of over three years with almost 50% of patients being alive and how do we help the other 50% of the patients. So as you look at some of the portfolio that Gilead is building and being able to actually combine in the future other therapies, non-cell therapies with cell therapies would be one of our strategies to build on the strengths of both of the companies together. And then as we look at the mid to longer term, we've got three studies that are in solid tumor. Have INDs Phase 1s, and that would be our biggest long-term bets in terms of being able to really penetrate the solid tumor area. And there's specific areas that are kind of the low-hanging fruit, where the science is a little bit easier and others where it's very complex and the bar is just too high compared to standard of care. So those two areas in terms of launching success today, being able to get more efficacy and lead in hematological malignancies, and then moving to solid tumor. I will tell you, in addition though that we're not keeping our eyes closed, or head in the sand, as we look at possible disruptors with allogeneic iPSC technology, NK cells and that's what you see a lot of the business development deals that we did, some of them Kite alone with cell therapy, and some of them with Gilead where we can both partake in the potential positive outcomes that could come from that. So as we look at different ways off-the-shelf that were the first movers in that arena, both internally and as we look at some of our partners externally.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Thank you.\nChristi Shaw: Sure.\nDaniel O'Day: Thank you, Robyn. So I now that we\u2019re kind of at time, if there is one more question, we could take that in respect for everybody's time Liz.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nUmer Raffat: Hi guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I have two if I may. First Merdad, curious what the feedback is from your team on the lung exposure of remdesivir with the IV form and how many fold higher can you get with the inhaled form at the highest dose? I'd be very curious. And secondly, I know there's this Phase 2 trial coming up in the multidrug resistant patients on HIV for your capsid inhibitor. My question is if that hits, why shouldn't it form the basis for an accelerated filing, given the unmet need in multidrug resistant patients? Thank you very much.\nDaniel O'Day: Umer terrific. Merdad I\u2019ll decide \u2013 you decide if you or Diana want to feed the numbers. That's great. Thanks.\nMerdad Parsey: Sure. Well, I'll do the lung exposure Diana, and you can talk about capsid. So we are targeting to get with inhaled version as good as it and hopefully greater exposure in the lung, than we did with the IV. We think we get obviously great exposure with the IV version and we think we can do at least that good if not better depending on how high you can go and what the lung deposition is. That's a very empiric thing we need to see how the trials go, but that's our goal. Diana, would you want to talk about the capsid?\nDiana Brainard: Yes, that would be great. So Umer in terms of that study in highly treatment experienced patients, it's actually a Phase 2/3 because of the urgent unmet need in that patient population, the agency granted us breakthrough designation, and they agreed that we could move directly from Phase 1b to a registrational trial in that population. And so this study that's ongoing right now, should the results pan out, will form the basis for an application for approval in the highly treatment experienced patients with lenacapavir dosed every six months.\nUmer Raffat: Thank you so much.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Douglas Maffei for closing remarks.\nDouglas Maffei: Thank you, Liz. And thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead. And the team here looked forward to providing you with updates on our future progress.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Merdad Parsey",
            "content": "Thanks, Johanna, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm excited to be here and share with you some of the perspectives on our pipeline that continues to both progress and to grow despite these challenging times. As you've seen, our pipeline expansion continued during this period driven by the strategy that Dan referenced earlier. Of course remdesivir is an important part of this story and while managing the added responsibility of working as diligently as possible on remdesivir, we're also able to make great strides across the rest of the pipeline. Let me share some of those highlights with you. We look at a pipeline for three key things. We'd like to see that the level of diversification across the different therapeutic areas is good. The balance across the phases of development and the quality of the assets we have in development along with our associated risk. That's where I'd like to turn now. We continue to build in each of our therapeutic areas as reflected in other exciting set of clinical data readouts and presentations at scientific meetings during this quarter. This includes data that further validate our belief in some of our key assets including the magrolimab, lenacapavir and of course remdesivir. Let me share a few specific highlights in each of our strategic areas. In HIV, we continue to make progress on the next chapter of our commitment to people living with HIV by working on a long acting option. Lenacapavir, our investigational capsid inhibitor continues to show promise as a potential agent, both for long acting treatment and for prevention. The Phase II, III study that has continued to enroll during the pandemic, and we look forward to data from this trial for highly treatment-experienced people with HIV, who often have few, if any other options. People living with HIV tell us that the most desirable long-acting regimens are either a weekly oral or in every three to six months subcutaneous injection, preferably that can be self administered. The profile lenacapavir gives it the potential to achieve both of these options, and for the potential to be a key therapeutic component for both treatment and prevention. Now turning to remdesivir. A lot of the data have been generated over the past six months that all inform us about the profile of remdesivir. As Dan pointed out, the thing that stands out as a consistency across these data, and I like to take a step back and highlight a few key pieces of the story. One piece is that we see the recovery time for patients in the hospital is short. Another is at the five-day course of treatment is appropriate for those patients. And finally the drug can be [indiscernible]. We've now published data that demonstrate a benefit and mortality compared with standard of care using a comparative analysis of real world data. As you know, there was a trend towards benefit and mortality at day 14 and ID study. And we now wait the final day 28 data from that trial as well. We also continue to pursue other ways to expand the utility of remdesivir, including new formulations and exploring how combinations could be more effective. We'll begin our Phase I study on an inhaled version of remdesivir that uses commercially available nebulizers. Beyond that, we're working on the feasibility of a dry powder formulation for inhalation and a subcutaneous formulation. We're also supporting several clinical trials exploring potential combinations. In each of those studies, remdesivir is being used as a back-bone standard of care agent. We are really proud of the role, remdesivir has played in this pandemic and I couldn't be prouder the team worked so hard. As you remainder, Diana Brainard, who leads our virology team is here with us today, and she will be happy to share additional insights during the Q&A. Moving on to filgotinib. We continue to believe that this selective JAK inhibitor has a potential to provide a new option for patients suffering from a variety of inflammatory diseases. I'd like to update you on recent discussions with regulators on rheumatoid arthritis. In Europe, we're pleased to receive the positive CHMP opinion for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. The opinion includes both 100 and 200 milligram doses and indicates use is appropriate as monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate. As a reminder, anticipates a scientific recommendation to the European Commission to grant marketing authorization in Europe. We continue to have ongoing dialogue with the FDA. We've been informed that there will be an Advisory Committee meeting and the PDUFA date remains unchanged. Moving on to oncology. We made strides during the quarter, and throughout the first half of the year in advancing our pipeline and accelerating our efforts to build our portfolio and expertise in immuno-oncology with several key transactions. First, we completed the acquisition of Forty Seven that we announced during the first quarter. This brings filgotinib into a core pipeline investing compound currently being developed for [indiscernible] as well as much of the impressive 17 will now complement our internal team. We're also very excited about the Arcus partnership, which provides our ability to have tail tractions that work both for us and our partners. This partnership brings us a potentially differentiated major compound as well as investigational high PD-1 monoclonal antibody. We're also excited to work with the excellent experienced clinical team at Arcus for the development of these programs. This partnership gives the caution on everything in their pipeline and allows the Arcus team to continue to pursue groundbreaking signs. Tizona and Pionyr are deals that give us options targeting other immuno-oncology approaches. And in each of these transactions, we have the option to acquire the entire company based on clinical data. These new programs build on our existing partnerships and our internal pipeline. In cell therapy, we all congratulate Christi Shaw, our colleagues at Kite for the recent approval of Yescarta for relapsed/refractory MCL. Kite and Gilead are now the first company have multiple approved cell therapy products that will bring benefit to even more patients with difficult-to-treat cancers. The Kite team also reached a major milestone with the successful approval and launch in June of the NCCN manufacturing site with the end-to-end production that expands the ability to treat more patients. Christi is with us here today and happy to share more thoughts during the Q&A. Materials we've provided. We've shared a summary of important upcoming milestones across the pipeline. In closing, our senior R&D team continues to build with the addition of leaders in data science, clinical biomarkers, pharmacology, clinical operations, portfolio management, inflammation and oncology. All of these leaders bring added expertise to an already world-class team, and we're excited to have them join us. Let me turn the call now over to Andy. Yes. Yes. So what I'd say is, as I mentioned, we're working on both being inhaled in the subcu. The inhaled ahead and, as I mentioned, in Phase I right now in the dose escalation phase. Our \u2013 the hypothesis here is that the virus in many patients, especially early is primarily in the one. And so the question is for a patient, can we treat an outpatient with an inhaled or [indiscernible] or potentially even an inpatient. With inhaled version get where it needs to be a narrowing in the lung and whether that would have a benefit for those patients. So that's the extent we're going to be running with the inhaled version. As far as subcutaneous, we'll continue to work on that. That currently is not in the clinic. And as I mentioned, we're looking at feasibility and other parameters of bringing that online. Hi Matthew its Merdad. I hope everybody can hear me. Sorry I got disconnected earlier. So you are right in some regards Matthew, the patients are all enrolled. I don't \u2013 we don't anticipate that the three months is going to be the duration necessarily that will be sufficient for the regulators, in terms of looking at both onset and recovery. So while that first three months is a critical period, we think that's the blinded period, there's probably longer to be that's necessary. So we're looking at probably late in this year, early next year for us to have the data and then for us to submit it to the agency in the first half of next year. Those are the kinds of timelines we're looking at. That's it or do you have a question, thanks, Matthew. Sure. Well, I'll do the lung exposure Diana, and you can talk about capsid. So we are targeting to get with inhaled version as good as it and hopefully greater exposure in the lung, than we did with the IV. We think we get obviously great exposure with the IV version and we think we can do at least that good if not better depending on how high you can go and what the lung deposition is. That's a very empiric thing we need to see how the trials go, but that's our goal. Diana, would you want to talk about the capsid?"

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Daniel O'Day",
            "content": "Thank you, Doug, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking our Gillian employees worldwide, who along with our partners, continue to go above and beyond to meet our many responsibilities at this time. Those responsibilities include advancing remdesivir, supporting work across our other medicines that are helping patients today and building our pipeline of future therapies. We'll cover each of those during today's call. I'm pleased to have the team with me here to provide an overview, and we all look forward to answering your questions. I'll start things off with some of my perspectives. The first thing I want to comment on is the continued strength and durability of our core HIV business. We've grown market share even as we navigated the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we're already seeing early signs of recovery from that impact in some markets. We are confident in our long-term leadership in HIV. People living with HIV depend on innovative therapies that meet their needs and Gilead is and has always been focused on meeting those needs. Like TAVI has become the gold standard in HIV treatment and we're on track with our conversion to discovery for priory treatment. The principles that have driven our HR&D growth to date still apply and will continue to drive our growth in the future. The second area I want to comment on is our role in fighting the pandemic with remdesivir. There's a growing body of clinical and real world data that continues to shape our understanding of the medicine. The data tell a consistent story of clinical benefit for patients suffering from COVID-19 across our SIMPLE studies, the NIAID data, compassionate use data, and more recently the comparative analysis that use real world data. I'd also like to highlight some details in our efforts to ensure a broad access to remdesivir in the second half of the year and beyond. As we discussed last time, we feel the full weight of our responsibilities with remdesivir and that applies to the price we set following the donation period. We price remdesivir well below the value it provides to enable access at this critical time and ensure that we continue to meet our responsibilities in the future, with further investment in remdesivir and in research that will help us to prepare for any future pandemics. The extensive clinical development work continues on remdesivir so that we can potentially extend the treatment to many more patient groups. We have begun clinical work on an inhaled solution that could be used outside of the hospital. And we'll also conduct clinical trials using the intravenous formulation in the outpatient setting, such as nursing homes. Merdad will talk more about the development program later.  As you know, we've agreed to the U.S. Government requests, following discussions about the significant rise of COVID-19 infections in the United States, the U.S. patients will receive 500 million treatment courses of our supply until the end of September, when we expect to have enough remdesivir to meet real time global demand. As announced yesterday, we are pleased to reach an agreement with the European Commission where they will centrally purchase remdesivir for patients in the European Union and the UK. European Commission will be responsible for all decisions regarding allocation among member states. The remaining supply of remdesivir will be allocated to other countries with significant rates of COVID-19 infection. We will see a significant increase in supplies in October as expected. The third theme I want to touch on is the progress we're making and shaping Gilead's growth story. You may recall that we previously shared a framework outlining the three pillars that will shape Gilead's next chapter. And you'll see these in the slides on our website today as well. I've already touched on the first pillar, which is our durable core business. And Johanna will describe our achievements on this front in more detail in a moment. Pillar two is our pipeline. And we made important progress across several potentially transformational assets in a relatively short period of time with a balance of both internal innovation and acquired investigational compounds. Pillar three is our strategy to drive future growth by accessing the highest quality external innovation in order to serve more patients. The pace of our corporate development activities has not slowed down a bit during this pandemic time. I'd like to highlight the progress we made this year on executing on our immuno-oncology strategy. Our goal is to grow or immuno-oncology pipeline and our expertise both through external opportunities and by advancing our internal efforts. The range of immuno-oncology deals we've announced this year represents significant progress towards this goal. These deals bring complimentary scientific approaches and provide access to clinical and preclinical assets with a view to both mid and long-term growth. Before I hand over to the team for the detailed comments in our progress, I want to briefly mention something that we see as another key area of responsibility for the company, the work against racial injustice. We are passionately committed to using Gilead's platform for what we see as a global issue that calls on everyone to play a role. The leadership team and I have spent the past week listening carefully to black employees as they've started to share with us how they, their families and their communities experience racial injustice in various forums. Gilead is committed to both immediate and long-term action that will have a lasting impact for our employees and the communities that we serve. Let me now hand the call off to Johanna, who will walk us through some of the key details related to our business performance. Over to you Johanna. Sure, Tyler. I'll turn right away to Johanna. Thanks, Tyler. Next question please. Perfect. No, that's great. Thank you. Geoff, and we'll update you and everybody else in quarter three, obviously. So this is our best estimate at this stage. Thank you. Sure. I'll start, and then Johanna, you add and then we'll go to Merdad the injectable. So first of all, Michael, I think really, the vast majority of the remdesivir that we have today is being used. The allocation process with the U.S. government has gotten better over time, and they really are allocating basically at least twice a month, sometimes more frequently to where the hotspots are in the United States, and that's the vast majority of the supply. So we think there's probably very little demand that is not being utilized at this stage. Of course, it's not completely efficient, and there are some pockets where you might have some hospitals that have more remdesivir than patients. But right now, given the tremendous human need in the United States, in particular, and a variety of other countries we're working with, we're really just working on the real-time demand right now. So that's being utilized. Johanna, do you have anything else you want to add to that. I think the earliest is October, Michael, that we would start to see actual demand and utilization perhaps be different and perhaps the opportunity for stockpiling, but not before October. Merdad, over to you on Michael's question. Michael. Good, thanks. Great. So why don't Andy you take the financials, and we'll have Diana take the capsid question. Thanks, Terence for the question. Okay, can we go to the next one please. Yes. Go ahead Johanna, why don't you start and Merdad wants' to add anything as well. But go ahead, please. I think Merdad is having a bit of an audio issue, so I'll feed in here Brian. I think it's kind of premature to anticipate exactly what's going to happen in different regulatory authorities around the world. We continue to have discussions with all regulatory authorities, obviously Europe was the first one out of the gate. We're pleased with that. And as soon as we have some additional information, we'll let you know, but difficult to speculate. Thanks. You're a great cheerleader for us. Thank you very much Alethia. So yes obviously, I think, our general position on this is that you will always need effective therapeutics and effective vaccines to control any type of a viral outbreak of any type and certainly one in a pandemic. So I think we're firmly committed to working to expand remdesivir's impact. We're really pleased at every piece of data in our hands or in other people's hands has been consistent, consistent about the effect in terms of reduction in hospital space, consistent around the ability to use it earlier in hospitals space and get even bigger impacts. And I think that will continue regardless of vaccination. Now our hope obviously is like you have the normal influenza that with an effective vaccine appropriately administered to as many patients as will take a vaccine around the globe that you could reduce the number of patients that ever have to enter the hospital. But, as we know, vaccines are never a hundred percent effective, they are never a hundred percent utilized, so there will always be patients that need therapeutics. And what we're excited about in terms of the potency of remdesivir is the ability to use it earlier on patients to get them out of the hospital faster. And also to make sure that the types of work we're doing now using remdesivir outside the hospital could prevent patients from ever having to go in. Of course that's all to be determined. So I think it will be hand in glove with vaccines. And obviously we're looking forward also to the work that's going on in terms of looking at antiviral, a potent antiviral that has been proven like remdesivir in patients to be used, perhaps in combination with other therapeutics to get an even stronger treatment effect. But that continues to be, I think, our view and we're hoping, and I'm really proud to be working in this industry at this stage because my colleagues around the industry, I know are doing everything possible, including the collaboration that they have with us in remdesivir to bring new therapeutics and vaccines to patients. And so we're excited about that. So thank you very much for the question. Thanks. Over to you, Johanna. Thanks, Matthew. Yes, sorry about that Geoff I was chatting the way there. Let me say, it's certainly the latter to your question, Jeff. And that is that as happy as we are, that we can have an impact on patients in the COVID crisis with remdesivir. We completely understand that hopefully by the way for the world, that we'll get to a stage where the pandemic is much more predictable and remdesivir is playing a role. But not what we're relying upon for our mid-to long-term growth in the company.  So we believe that rather the continued emphasis on our core business to make sure that we not only continue to lead with HIV today, but also tomorrow with the next generation of medicines combined with what we have in our internal pipeline. And then growing our overall immuno-oncology business, both Kite and outside of Kite. And I think that's what you see as we think about now outside of virology, moving into inflammation, moving more deeply into oncology, particularly outside of Kite. You are going to continue to see, I think, more of what you've seen in the first half of this year, which is an ability to both optimize our current portfolio in house and continue to do smart, targeted deals that allow us to bring transformational medicine innovation into our house at different stages of development. And obviously that goes along with different risk profiles, right? And that's, I think, where BD team under Andy's leadership has done a really good job of making sure we're doing fit-for-purpose transactions, where when we're going after first or best-in-class, there's risk associated with it. We're trying to be prudent about how much capital we deploy upfront particularly on the earlier stage assets and kind of pay for success over that period of time. And there are others where we've seen the late-stage data like Forty Seven where we feel quite confident and bullish about bringing that in and using the breadth and depth of Gilead to look at expense of life cycle management on a medicine like magrolimab that has a leading position in a competitive environment to allow us to think about multiple different indications in hematologic malignancies, and possibly also looking at solid tumors. So that type of a strategy is absolutely fundamental to grounding us and continuing to build on our mid-to long-term growth story. Andy, anything which you'd like to add from your side? Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Evan, and we're looking forward to hearing more from Christi as that Kite business develops. More to hear from you. Thanks Evan. Hey thanks Matt we'll turn it right over to Merdad. Thanks. Next please. Yes, thanks Robyn. I mean, first of all, let me just take a big step back from the executive orders. I mean, I know that we all agree at Gilead that the current system in the U.S. needs to change. And we're leaning into that in a variety of different fronts have been now for a couple of years. What's really important is that when we look at changes in the U.S. system that is done in a way that ensures that patients are the one to benefit and at the same time that we maintain the U.S. innovation model. So, the types of things that we've been working with the different packages within the Congress and the Senate have all reflected that. And now, as we look at these executive orders, we'll be looking forward to engaging with the White House and with others to have the very principles that I just mentioned articulated and that's where we'll go. In terms of how that impacts, how we think about the future business, I would say that we have so many healthcare systems around the world, I think, that we're working with of course the U.S. is disproportionally important to us. But our belief firmly is that if you hold the bar high enough on transformational medicine, so in other words, if you really think hard about first-in-class and best-in-class and keep the bar high regard, because remember our cycle time is so long, our capital investment is in a decade that we can't be pivoting to one or the other particular governmental action. The bottom line is that we keep that bar high enough under any system under any scenario. I think we'll do first of all, well for patients and we'll do well for shareholders as a result of that. So that's my firm belief. Christi, over to you on Robyn's question please. Thank you, Robyn. So I now that we're kind of at time, if there is one more question, we could take that in respect for everybody's time Liz. Umer terrific. Merdad I'll decide \u2013 you decide if you or Diana want to feed the numbers. That's great. Thanks."

            "name": "Andrew Dickinson",
            "content": "Thanks, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to cover three topics to round out our commentary before turning to Q&A. First, I'll provide a summary of our financial highlights for the quarter and the first half of 2020. Second, I will provide some additional color on the potential implications of COVID on the second half of 2020 based on updated assumptions drawn from external experts and outside thinking. Finally, I'd like to pull all this together and review our revised 2020 financial guidance. As a reminder, the earnings materials posted on our website contain additional information, including the details of our 2020 revised financial guidance. Turning now to our financial highlights. Total revenues for the second quarter were $5.1 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.11. As noted in the earnings press release on a GAAP basis, we recorded a diluted loss per share of $2.66, primarily due to a $4.5 billion in-process research and development charge related to our acquisition of Forty Seven. This compares to revenue of $5.7 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.72 for the same period last year. Product sales for the second quarter were $5.1 billion, down 7% sequentially and down 10% year-over-year. As anticipated, the second quarter product revenues were unfavorably impacted by COVID-19. The year-over-year quarterly decline was also impacted by approximately $160 million of favorable adjustments recorded in the second quarter of 2019 for statutory rebates, primarily to HCV and HIV prior year sales in Europe. This decline was partially offset by HIV growth driven by Biktarvy in the United States. As Johanna mentioned, the quarter-over-quarter decreases in HIV revenues was primarily driven by the reversal of the Q1 increased buying patterns due to the pandemic as well as lower U.S. PrEP demand and unfavorable U.S. payer mix. Sequentially, the decrease was partially offset by treatment growth and seasonable higher net price in the U.S. and inventory patterns. The decrease in HCV revenues sequentially and year-over-year primarily reflects lower volume due to lower diagnoses and patient starts due to the pandemic. Yescarta revenues grew sequentially and year-over-year, primarily driven by the continued patient uptake in Europe. Overall product sales for the first half of the year were $10.5 billion compared to our $10.8 billion for 2019. Excluding recent LOE products for Ranexa and Letairis, our business grew year-over-year despite the impact of the pandemic. If we compare the first half of 2020 versus the same time period in 2019, we the HIV inventory dynamics associated with COVID-19 are normalized and our first half results demonstrate strong underlying HIV demand growth, with the business up 6% over 2019. This reflects a strong and encouraging start to the year in our core HIV franchise despite the impact of COVID-19. You can find more information, including the geographic breakdown of revenues in the materials we have posted. Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $1.2 billion for the quarter, up 19% compared to the same period last year and up 18% sequentially, primarily due to our investment in remdesivir, including clinical trials and manufacturing scale-up costs. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $1.2 billion, up 6% compared to the same period last year and up 8% sequentially, primarily due to a $97 million accrual related to a previously disclosed Department of Justice investigation. From a liquidity standpoint, we continue to be very well positioned. During the quarter, we generated $2.6 billion in cash from operations, and we ended the quarter with $21.2 billion in cash and marketable debt securities. We completed our acquisition of Forty Seven this quarter for $4.7 billion, net of cash acquired, we paid cash dividends of $856 million, and we repurchased 700,000 shares of stock for $54 million. Our strong balance sheet investment portfolio are built to withstand macroeconomic events like COVID-19, and our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to focus on investment to augment internal and external innovation in support of continued pipeline expansion. In addition, we intend to support and grow our dividend over time, provided that any dividend increase is, of course, subject to approval from our Board. Finally, as it relates to repurchase of shares in 2020, we're on track relative to the directional guidance we provided in our fourth quarter 2019 and year-end earnings call in February. Turning now to the COVID-19 impact on our revised guidance. Importantly, as you heard earlier in the call, the fundamentals and durability of our long-term outlook remains very strong. We expect that our core business will gradually recover starting in Q3, following peak pandemic impact on underlying treatment initiations and switch dynamics that we observed in the second quarter. We continue to expect minimal impact on our HIV treatment business over time with maintenance of high market share. In HCV, we expect patient starts to regain momentum in the third quarter and beyond. In addition, since our first quarter earnings call, we have established global pricing for remdesivir, and we have refined our expectation for remdesivir for the year. As you would expect, there are still many uncertainties concerning the shape and duration of the recovery in the second half of the year as well as the availability and uptake of remdesivir. With that as context, let me summarize the details of our revised full year guidance. Our revised top line revenue range, including expected sales of remdesivir in 2020 is US$23 billion to US$25 billion. We're increasing our 2020 R&D and SG&A expense expectations. Our guidance on expected product gross margin and effective tax rate for 2020 remained unchanged. Our updated operating income range is $10.7 billion to $13 billion. And finally, our updated non-GAAP EPS range is $6.25 to $7.65. I'd like to highlight a few additional points that will give you more color on the assumptions that drove this updated guidance. On the expense side, R&D and SG&A guidance increase to reflect expected expenses for remdesivir, Forty Seven and the litigation accrual that I mentioned earlier. On remdesivir, as we've previously stated, we expect to manufacture 2 million or more treatment courses cumulatively in 2020. Our revenue guidance reflects that we expect to sell 1 million to 1.5 million treatment courses of remdesivir this year. We expect that remdesivir demand will be skewed towards the U.S. in the third quarter and that the proportion of ex-U.S. sales will increase in the fourth quarter and beyond. That said, the progression of the pandemic, the global economic backdrop our supply expectations, the potential uptake of remdesivir in related matters continue to be dynamic and uncertain. We expect to learn more over the coming months, and we'll update you on our latest thinking on our Q3 earnings call. Before I hand the call off for Q&A, I'd like to express my gratitude as well to our 12,000 Gilead employees globally. Without their spirit, dedication and resilience, nothing we strive to achieve for patients would be possible. Now I'd like to open the call for questions. Liz? Yes. Maybe I'll start with one final point and ask Johanna. Oh, go ahead, Dan. I'm sorry. Maybe I'll ask Johanna to comment on the upside of the supply and the demand in Q3 and Q4. The \u2013 there is a wide range, and it is driven by our remdesivir expectations. So Johanna mentioned we're learning more week by week. We just started commercializing recently. So we do expect that we'll be able to narrow our thinking and give you an update on the \u2013 in the third quarter, Geoff, as you would expect. Johanna, do you want to touch base on the supply and demand issue? Yes. Thanks, Dan. And hi, Terence. Thanks for the question. As you know, we don't provide specific \u2013 we didn't provide a specific guidance in terms of the COVID impact. I would say, at a high level, it impacted our business exactly in the way that we expected, so it hit predominantly. As you heard from Johanna in the HCV treatment and HIV PrEP business, the impact was substantially less than $0.5 billion on our top-line revenue in the first half. So rather than thinking about it on a quarterly basis, Terence, I think it's easier to think about it on the first half basis as you've heard from other companies as well, given the pull forward of inventory at the end of the first quarter. Hopefully, that's helpful. I think you said it well, that captures it."

            "name": "Diana Brainard",
            "content": "Great. And I can speak to our capsid inhibitor and our vision of our long-acting HIV franchise. And there, what I would say is we're looking at our past success, and it's really been driven by focusing on trying to meet the needs of patients and doing that agnostic to where we come up with the compounds of the regimen. And so in the past, that's been through acquisitions. It's been through partnerships, and it's, of course, been through internal discovery. And we really do have unparalleled excellence in terms of our internal discovery, and we're doing a lot of work there to try to find a partner for capsid. So we are also open and always looking externally as well with the idea that we will be successful if we create the best regimen for patients. Yes, that would be great. So Umer in terms of that study in highly treatment experienced patients, it's actually a Phase 2/3 because of the urgent unmet need in that patient population, the agency granted us breakthrough designation, and they agreed that we could move directly from Phase 1b to a registrational trial in that population. And so this study that's ongoing right now, should the results pan out, will form the basis for an application for approval in the highly treatment experienced patients with lenacapavir dosed every six months."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Johanna Mercier",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan. And good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by saying that despite the anticipated impact of the pandemic, our business is solid and remains resilient. While COVID-19 has had an impact on parts of our business, this past quarter, we're built to withstand this kind of challenge, we remain confident in the strength of our core business. No one can actually predict the progression of this pandemic, but we do see signs of recovery and partial return to normal in Europe, as well as some parts of Asia. And we're confident that this will also play out in the U.S. once the incident stabilizes. Turning out to the specifics of Q2 in the first half for business performance, starting with HIV. Our HIV franchise is strong and durable. In both treatment and prevention we have a patient focused history of innovation and believe both will continue to be important drivers for the company over the next decade. In June, we hit our stated year-end goal this conversion to TAF-based regimens on the treatment side and are now at 90% of our total portfolio. Biktarvy uptake continues to remain strong across geographies and is the number one HIV treatment regimen across the U.S., EU5 and other key global markets in those nai\u0308ve and switch. For PrEP, we achieved our goal of 40% to 45% Descovy conversion with 43% at the end of June. We continue to believe that physicians and patients are benefiting from choice and are increasingly seeing Biktarvy for treatment and Descovy for PrEP as the preferred option for their patients. The quarter overall was down year-on-year, 1% and quarter-over-quarter by 3%. The impact on our HIV revenue, including Biktarvy was primarily driven by inventory dynamics. In Q2, we saw a reversal of the pandemic related stocking that happened in March during the onset of COVID across U.S. and Europe. Also on the treatment side as expected, we're seeing reduced switches due to the decline in patient visits and physicians not wanting to initiate new therapies during the pandemic. We're also seeing unfavorable shift in payer mix from commercial to government segments. Despite this, our overall demand remained robust with both the overall Gilead's portfolio and Biktarvy gaining share quarter-over-quarter and year-on-year. The pandemic impacted PrEP demand as expected, and we saw reduced initiations and therapy discontinuations due to fewer people seeing their health care providers and social dynamics. We're starting to see gradual recovery across our markets, including in the U.S., where we saw improving PrEP churns in June. Sound Biktarvy uptake and Descovy for PrEP conversion during the quarter underscores the confidence we have in our core HIV business, as we expect to recover from the pandemic over the remainder of the year and going into 2021. If we look at our HIV business comparing the first half of revenues this year versus 2019, we see the robust underlying business with 6% growth. The half year view normalizes the inventory dynamic associated with the pandemic. So now, if we turn into HBV, our HBV business, which is more like an acute business was down 47% from Q2 in 2019 and down 39% from Q1 this year. As we discussed during the Q1 call reduced or delayed physician visits naturally decrease both diagnosis and patient starts. U.S. HBV starts for down 42% quarter-over-quarter. However, overall US HBV share has held strong at about 60% across segments, which is up 11 points from Q2 to 2019. Similarly, we are seeing strong and consistent share in Europe as well. As other markets start to reopen, similar to what we saw in June and July across Europe, it's likely we will see many patients return throughout the rest of the year and into 2021. As an example of this in Italy, which was heavily impacted by COVID earlier this year, we saw recovery in June as more patients, especially the higher risk patients, started to return to their physicians and begin treatment. Before I close, just let me highlight for you a range of commercial opportunities on the horizon that make us also excited to be part of the Gilead team. In the near term we're pleased with the significant volume growth we're seeing in China, despite the impact of COVID as we received foreign RDL approvals at the end of 2019. This also served as a basis for expanding HBV business, which we expect to hit one billion globally, by the end of 2022. We're preparing to launch filgotinib in RA in the coming months and are excited about the recent CHMP positive opinion. As we look to the mid-to-long-term, we're accelerating our efforts to build our portfolio and expertise in immuno-oncology. We see strong potential for magrolimab, where we recently highlighted key data at ASCO. Magrolimab could be a very important therapy for MDS patients. And lastly, on HIV and lenacapavir, we believe that long-acting will play a role in the future HIV market and see the potential for this compound to best meet patient needs. Merdad will share more on the clinical progress on lenacapavir in a moment. So let me end where I started. Our core business is durable, the fundamental demand drivers of our HIV treatment and prevention businesses remain real, and we're optimistic heading into the second half of the year. We have an incredible core portfolio driven by HIV, and we're building a compelling set of opportunities as we continue on our journey. And lastly, I just want to thank all 12,000 of our colleagues who have demonstrated that they can continue to deliver for patients who need our medicines, both in our base business and more recently with remdesivir. It's the first time in my career, I've seen a company go from an investigational compound to a launch product serving hundreds of thousands of patients in a matter of months, but it just reinforces for me, Gilead history and commitment to patient focused innovation. I'm very proud to be part of this team. Merdad, turned it over to you. Okay. Thanks, Tyler. Yes. So for example, in HIV, when you think about Biktarvy and Descovy, which is our two lead brands both for treatment and prevention, Biktarvy grew share. So it's been growing here year-on-year but even quarter-over-quarter. So we grew share to 33% in Q2 for Biktarvy. And then when you think about on a very large basis, you can appreciate, so that's about a 1% share increase. And then when you think about Descovy, we were \u2013 we closed the quarter Q1 at about 37% and in the PrEP market and we ended up at the end of June at 43%. So I do think that despite some of the dynamics because of COVID-19 and some of the decrease in patient visits and screening, I still do think that that the brands are solid because of their portfolio, because of what they offer for patients. And one of the things, both of those brands are actually brands that in COVID-19 environment are actually probably the best choice for patients because if you think about Biktarvy and you think about no monitoring, no HLA testing, et cetera, those are really the rapid start with Biktarvy is critical for patients. And I think that, that's also helping to support Biktarvy throughout this transition with the pandemic. Yes, the sourcing of business is actually about the same. The only difference I would say is our \u2013 the switch in treatment is obviously a little bit slower than what we've seen in the past just because physicians don't want to switch there's actually guidelines that suggest no switching during the pandemic from drug to drug. So it's more the naive patient population that's feeding Biktarvy right now versus the switch population and older compounds are keeping share. So since Gilead has about 75% within HIV, basically what you are seeing is some of our older brands are keeping higher share versus then switching over to newer compounds like Biktarvy. Sure. Yes. Sure. So maybe just add to what Andy was saying for Q4 specifically. I think the uncertainties are multiple, and it's not just our supply actually is less of an uncertainty because I think we have a pretty good idea, and the ramp-up has been impressive. The team has done incredible job ramping up, and you really see that ramp up through in Q4. We feel that \u2013 and I think Dan mentioned this \u2013 we feel that by early October, we should be in a place, assuming somewhat, I don't know if stable is the right word, but some stability within this pandemic globally across the numbers, we should be in a situation where global supply meets global demand, and that's a great place to be in. We can't wait because it's been challenging thus far. The \u2013 in Q4, the uncertainties are more around the pandemic itself and not really understanding does it stabilize, does it come to an all-time low, like we've seen in Europe? We really don't know. And so that's why it's a little bit tougher to manage on that front. As mentioned before from a supply standpoint by the end of December of this year, we should be in a position to have cumulatively of over 2 million treatment courses. And some of those, obviously were used during the donation and some are being used in Q3. So the balance of that will be in play for Q4, and we're just working with all the different governments, not just the U.S. but governments around the world to better understand what they think their real-time need is, and that's really our focus right now is the real-time need. Yes. Maybe, Dan, just to add to that, Michael, I would just add the fact that it's also based on incidents in epidemiology. Everything we are doing, working with the U.S. government, working with ex-U.S. governments as well, governments around the world, it's really based on the incidents. And what we've seen so far is that because of the way we're managing it with the HHS, a lot \u2013 some hospitals have actually said, \"no, thank you. Give it to somebody who needs it. We don't need it right now.\" So I do think that people are coming together to work through this, understanding that there is a shortage of supply and understanding that it really needs to go to patients in need, and the worst thing that could ever happen is products sitting idle somewhere. So we're being very, very careful to make sure that doesn't happen anywhere in the world. Thanks. Maybe I can start... Okay. Thanks for the question. So yes, so obviously, pleased with the recent positive CHMP opinion, and we are working \u2013 we've been working diligently with the teams around the world to prepare for launch with filgotinib. We are looking at the COVID situation. And in assessing the situation, to be honest with you, maybe a couple of months back, we were thinking virtual, not virtual. But I think in light of kind of what \u2013 where we're seeing the dynamics of the market, I think virtual is the way to go. And so we're looking at how we do this and the best approach. So more to come on that front, a lot of work going on to make sure that we do this as competitively as possible. From a differentiation standpoint, it's in line with what we've talked about before. We believe in the profile of filgotinib and the differentiation that it offers. And so therefore that that's really an opportunity medically to make sure that to our medical teams, that conversation, that education happens with physicians. Merdad, do you want to comment on the regulatory piece? Thanks Matthew for their questions. If I understood it, sorry you broke up a little bit, but if I understood it correctly, it was specific to the Biktarvy and the shift in what's driving it and it's really the inventory fluctuations, that's what's driving the shift from Q1 to Q2. And you can appreciate Q4 always a little bit higher, it plays out in Q1, it bleeds out in Q1, but then we saw the uptake because of COVID-19 in late March and we saw that bleed out in Q2. So it's really what's driving the Biktarvy piece. We have seen a payer mix shift in the last two quarters, where due to unemployment we're seeing a shift from commercial payers to government channels, specifically PHF and Medicaid, but at this point in time that's really not impacting or modestly impacting our business overall. So it's really inventory-driven. Hopefully I answered your question. Okay."

Just like with Yescarta, our manufacturing footprint, we're gearing up. We have a ready to go in seven days, authorized sites \u2013 authorized for the new product within 30 days. So we're very hopeful that all of these patients that have nothing else to keep them alive, actually have something that can help them with such great efficacy. When we look at what happened in Q2, I'd say we were maybe pleasantly surprised that more patients were treated than we thought would be, based on COVID. And I will say that with what's happening now with the states in the U.S. we continue to see slowdown versus what we saw in the Q1 in terms of registrations. So I do think we're not going to see huge uplift in Q3, and we could be a flat and I don't know if we maybe lose some growth. But right now it's too early to tell. But I'm not as optimistic about Q3 and hopefully, when we come out of this situation we'll get better. And I'm really proud of the Kite team, because as you can imagine with all of the flights being canceled early on, and with having to figure out which ATC is to bring T cells back to where you didn't originate being able to hold T-cells where we haven't before, the team hasn't missed a beat and hasn't missed a delivery. So as I look at the whole of Kite and we look at the whole of the opportunity, it's really multiple indications in a very short period of time with mantle cell lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's, indolent Hodgkin's lymphoma by the end of this year being submitted. We have ALL being submitted and with priority review next year being approved. And we also have the big indication of second line DLBCL to be submitted next year. So as you look at that combination, I do think it gives us the best opportunity for growth and to potentially cure more patients of their cancer. Yes. Thanks Robin. So I think in the short term, we're looking at how do we cure those patients that aren't getting the effects of CAR T cell that we'd like. Yescarta is the only CAR-T that's been able to show the longest duration of over three years with almost 50% of patients being alive and how do we help the other 50% of the patients. So as you look at some of the portfolio that Gilead is building and being able to actually combine in the future other therapies, non-cell therapies with cell therapies would be one of our strategies to build on the strengths of both of the companies together. And then as we look at the mid to longer term, we've got three studies that are in solid tumor. Have INDs Phase 1s, and that would be our biggest long-term bets in terms of being able to really penetrate the solid tumor area. And there's specific areas that are kind of the low-hanging fruit, where the science is a little bit easier and others where it's very complex and the bar is just too high compared to standard of care. So those two areas in terms of launching success today, being able to get more efficacy and lead in hematological malignancies, and then moving to solid tumor. I will tell you, in addition though that we're not keeping our eyes closed, or head in the sand, as we look at possible disruptors with allogeneic iPSC technology, NK cells and that's what you see a lot of the business development deals that we did, some of them Kite alone with cell therapy, and some of them with Gilead where we can both partake in the potential positive outcomes that could come from that. So as we look at different ways off-the-shelf that were the first movers in that arena, both internally and as we look at some of our partners externally. Sure."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce Senior Director of Investor Relations, Doug Maffei.\nDoug Maffei: Thank you, Andrew, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for first quarter 2020. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead Web site. The speakers on today's call will be Daniel O'Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Andrew Dickinson, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the will be Johanna Mercier, Chief Commercial Officer; Merdad Parsey, Chief Medical Officer; Christi Shaw, Chief Executive Officer of Kite; and Diana Brainard, SVP and Head of HIV and Emerging Viruses Therapeutic Area. Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including risks and uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gilead's business and results of operations. Plans and expectations with regards to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital and 2020 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on the information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statement. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the Company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, as well as on Gilead Web site. I will now turn the call over to Dan.\nDaniel O'Day: Thank you very much, Doug, and good afternoon, everyone. Well, as you can imagine it's been an extraordinary week for Gilead given the terrific news on our investigational antiviral drug Remdesivir. The news shared yesterday that the data showed the potential of Remdesivir to help ease some of the burden of the pandemic, is the outcome that we had all hoped would be possible. We're incredibly humbled to think about what this news could mean for patients and communities. I'd like to start by sharing my thanks to everyone who has helped to bring Remdesivir to this point, including all those involved in the collaborative clinical trials, the trial investigators, governments, hospitals and above all, the patients who participated. I want to acknowledge our internal teams that have been working day and night on Remdesivir for the past three months, following many years of research long before the outbreak began. Because of their Remdesivir news, the original focus for today's call has somewhat shifted. I'm sure you have a lot of questions on the results and the next steps. We'll provide an overview of what was a strong first quarter for Gilead, but with an abbreviated set of opening comments so we can leave more time for questions. I'll speak briefly about the quarter and Remdesivir before turning the call over to Andy to discuss financial details and the impact of COVID-19 on our business. As Doug noted in the opening, Christie, Joanna, Mehrdad and Diana have joined us today to answer your questions at the end of the call. Gilead has been built to withstand significant challenge. There's a short-term uncertainty for all of us, but the solid foundations that Gilead has laid over the past 30 years and our focus on transformational therapeutics give us confidence in the long-term durability of the business. We'll do our best to provide you with a clear picture of where we are and what we expect as far as the near-term impact of COVID-19, while acknowledging that, as we all know, these are uncertain times with many unknowns, not least of which is how long the pandemic will last. So, turning to the quarter. I'll use the framework we introduced at the start of the year with the three pillars that will shape our future; our strong core business, our internal pipeline and supplemental growth opportunities that are being enabled through our strategies. Our performance in the first quarter demonstrated the strength of our foundational business once again with double-digit growth in HIV. We reached and in fact exceeded all of our targets. Revenues for our HIV franchise were up 14% year-over-year. This was driven by both treatment and prevention as Biktarvy remain the number one prescribed HIV regimen in the U. S. during the quarter and approximately 38% of individuals on PrEP are now taking Descovy. What I would say in general about where we stand in HIV is this. We are very confident in the underlying competitiveness of our products and our position as the leader in HIV. Completing the picture in our core antivirals business, we saw sustained revenues from our HCV franchise in the last quarter. Since the introduction of authorized generics in the U. S. we've regained market share and now hold around 61% of share through Asegua and Gilead. So moving from our core business to advancing our pipeline, I\u2019ll provide just a brief overview. More detailed information is available as part of our first quarter earnings materials in the investor relations sections of our Web site. Filgotinib, as you're aware, is under regulatory review in the United States, Europe and Japan as a potential treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Our teams are preparing for a competitive launch and remain in close contact with regulators to understand the effect COVID-19 could have on reviewed timelines. In HIV, we made progress across our pipeline, sharing important data at the virtual CROI conference. With our innovative long-acting anti viral and HIV cure programs, reinforcing our long term commitment to people living with HIV. In cell therapy, the FDA accepted Kite BLA, for KTE-X19 as a treatment for relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma during the first quarter and granted a priority review designation. As you might recall, the European Medicines Agency validated our application in January. This represents really important progress patients with relapsed refractory mantle cell lymphoma, a rare form of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, are in need of new therapies. If approved, Kite would be the first company with two cell therapies on the market. So I\u2019ve touched on our strong core business and advancing our pipeline. Now I want to say a few words about the work we are doing to expand our pipeline through business development, including of course the acquisition of Forty Seven completed earlier this month. Acquiring Forty Seven is a great early example of our strategy in action. We said we would build on our core area of expertise, which as you know are virology and immuno-modulation that we would keep a high bar and then our business development efforts will focus on clinical stage assets, such as magrolimab, which we gained as a part of this acquisition. We're working to integrate the teams in the program. It\u2019s a joint effort which I'm leading with Mark McCamish, the CEO of Forty Seven with the objectives of keeping things moving smoothly with magrolimab and defining a working model that supports continued innovation. Next month researchers will present data on our next generation cancer therapies virtually at ASCO, including magrolimab and a number of abstracts that highlight the Kite cell therapy portfolio. The presentations at ASCO underscore the strength of our scientific approach in immunooncology, and we look forward to sharing this latest research. Beyond Forty Seven, our business development team remains as active as ever. In the last month, we've announced three partnerships, a collaboration with Second Genome to identify biomarkers and potential new drug targets in inflammation, a licensing agreement between Kite and Teneobio covering a dual targeting CAR-T therapies, and a three year collaboration with oNKo-innate to discover cancer immunotherapies. Overall, we continue to maintain our momentum and I'm pleased with all the progress we've made this quarter. I'll now turn to Remdesivir. The study results shared yesterday from the randomized placebo controlled Phase 3 NIAID study and from our own open label Phase 3 SIMPLE study in patients with severe disease, are important progress as we seek to understand the role that Remdesivir might play in easing the burden of COVID-19 around the world. These trials are part of a suite of clinical trials investigating the effects of Remdesivir. We designed the clinical research program to ask multiple questions in parallel, including what groups of patients are most likely to respond and when to treat and for how long. Various study designs were used from placebo controlled to open label to answer very specific questions in each case. We expected that the answers would emerge around the same time and that taken together, they would form a clear picture of how Remdesivir might best be used for patients. Yesterday, we answered important questions with the initial results of the NIAID trial and SIMPLE trials. The NIAID data demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 who received Remdesivir recovered faster than similar patients who received placebo. The results from the Gilead-sponsored SIMPLE study address a critical question about dosing. The data from the first of the SIMPLE studies showed similar clinical improvements in patients with severe symptoms with COVID-19 regardless of whether they received 5 or 10 days of treatment. The ability to shorten duration for severely ill patients is very important. It means patients can go home earlier, hospital resources can be freed up and it has a positive impact of course on our supply. We had calculated having 1.5 million doses by the end of May, amounting to 140,000 treatment courses at a 10 day treatment duration. The Gilead SIMPLE study suggests we may now be able to significantly increase the number of courses available with a 5 day treatment duration for certain patients. As we announced previously, we are donating our entire existing supply, frankly because this is the right thing to do at this time and the human health need in the pandemic. As you know, we've been ramping up production since January. We\u2019ve significantly reduced lead times and expanded our global network of partners. As additional raw materials come available, we'll have an exponential increase in supplies towards the latter half of this year. We hope to have produced enough supplies to treat over a million patients by year end. We are also working to build a global consortium of pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturers to expand global capacity and production. It will be essential for countries to work together to create enough supply for people all over the world, and we look forward to these collaborative efforts. For access and allocation, we'll work closely with government and healthcare system to provide access. We intend to allocate our available supply based on guiding principles that aim to direct global access for appropriate patients in urgent need of treatment. We recognize there's a lot of work left to be done and a long way to go in finding medical solutions to end the pandemic, and we'll continue to work with regulatory authorities and the best path forward for Remdesivir. At the same time, all of us at Gilead are relieved and grateful that our efforts in Remdesivir have led to this important progress at a time when we all need a beacon of hope. Before I turn the call over to Andy, I want to re reiterate how grateful we are for the partnership with many groups outside Gilead to support the work on Remdesivir. Our collaboration throughout this pandemic has been critical [Technical Difficulty].\nAndrew Dickinson: Sounds like we lost Dan. I'll just finish Dan's comments. We also want to say how proud we are of the way our employees have demonstrated such dedication to meeting the needs of patients those with COVID-19, as well as those with conditions, including HIV, viral hepatitis and cancer who depend on us for their medications. So with that, I will turn to our financial comments and then we'll move to Q&A. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Andrew Dickinson. I'm the company's CFO. Before I start, I'd also like to acknowledge the incredible work of our 12,000 employees and what they're doing during these challenging times. Their dedication and resilience is really inspiring. In addition from the outset, I'd like to emphasize that our core business is very strong, durable, and provides a solid foundation to navigate the current environment. We continue to have confidence in 2020 and beyond. The pandemic has not diminished that view at all, and we remain confident in our long term outlook. I'd like to first briefly share some commentary on our very strong first quarter results. And I'll remind you that the earnings materials posted on our Web site can help all of the details, including preliminary color on the impact of COVID-19 on our business to date, as well as our preliminary expectations for the coming months. We are happy to walk through the results and the impact of COVID-19 on our business today in detail during the Q&A session. Starting with our revenues for the quarter. Total revenues for the first quarter were $5.5 billion with non-GAAP earnings of $1.68 per diluted share. This compares to revenue of $5.3 billion with non-GAAP earnings of $1.67 per diluted share for the same period last year. Product sales for the first quarter were $5.5 billion, down 6% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year. I'd like to call out that we believe approximately $200 million of revenues were pulled forward in Q1, primarily for our HIV franchise due to the COVID-19 pandemic across the U. S. and Europe. This was the result of payers and pharmacies providing greater access to medicines by allowing 90 day refills and in some cases, early refills among other operators. We expect this to reverse itself out over subsequent quarters. Now, turning to our expenses, non-GAAP R&D expense was $1 billion for the quarter, up 8% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the ramp up of Remdesivir, including manufacturing scale up and clinical trial costs. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $1.1 billion, up 4% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher promotional expenses in the United States related to our HIV products. As Dan highlighted, we completed our acquisition of Forty Seven this month. We currently expect to incur approximately $120 million in expenses this year related to Forty Seven, primarily in research and development. In addition, I'd like to highlight that the acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition. And as a result, we currently expect to incur approximately $4.8 billion in GAAP R&D expense, primarily related to in process research and development. Turning to our strong balance sheet. During the quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations. We ended the quarter with $24.3 billion in cash and marketable debt securities. We repaid $500 million of debt, paid cash dividends of $874 million and repurchased $19 million shares of stock for $1.3 billion. I want to note that we paid approximately $4.9 billion in cash upon closing the Forty Seven in April. Our strong balance sheet and disciplined allocation of capital has positioned us to continue to grow and build our business despite current environment and associated risks. We remain very confident in the durability of our business, and expect to generate significant operating cash flow during 2020. I'll turn now to COVID-19 and its impact on our business. Like others, we have anticipated that there could be a short-term financial impact to our company and to the sector as a whole. We continue to carefully review our results to assess the potential magnitude of that impact. Towards the end of the quarter ending April, we did begin to see some effects on our business, primarily as fewer patients access healthcare and the number of new starts in HCV and HIV prevention began to slow. However, to-date, the overall effect on our business has been modest and it remains unclear what the ultimate impact will be. Given this significant uncertainty regarding the duration and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are actively planning for a number of scenarios. And we'd like to focus on our base case assumptions today, which we are making from data drawn from a number of sources, including epidemiologists, economists and public health officials. First, these base case assumptions suggest the pandemic will peak between March and July. We would point the recent data from Johns Hopkins would show trends reflecting a slowing of the rate of new cases since late March in the United States, and a declining number of new patients in some critically affected regions of the world. Second, if the virus returns in the fall or winter, the impact will be lessened due to preparedness and hopefully the emergence of therapeutics, including potentially our own Remdesivir. Third, the global economy will begin recovery late in Q2 and a return to the pre-COVID dynamics will be underway by year end. We have of course considered external views that anticipate more or -- and less favorable scenarios, but we believe this base case provides the best foundation at this time to plan in this uncertain situation. Let me share a few qualitative perspectives on potential business implications of this scenario. Please bear in mind the forward-looking statement disclosures we shared at the beginning of the call. I'd also like to highlight again that we have added significant commentary throughout the investor presentation that's posted on our Web site and we would encourage you to review those materials. There are three key takeaways from our perspective; first, we had a very strong quarter; second, to-date, the impact on our business has been modest; and third, we remain very confident in our long-term outlook. That said, on the commercial side driven by lessened healthcare provider access and fewer patient visits, we may see revenues adversely impacted in Q2 and potentially beyond. This would likely be different across our franchises with our HCV franchise disproportionately affected due to the acute care nature of the therapy. We believe that the majority of any revenue decrease in HCV revenue due to the pandemic could be recouped in a warehousing type effect later in 2020 or into 2021. In HIV, early signals suggest that switches both for treatment and prevention patients maybe impacted by COVID-19 as people defer healthcare visits. Specifically, in April, we are observing reductions in Descovy for PrEP initiations and lower switch volume. PrEP refills may also be effected, but it's still too early to fully understand any trends here. In contrast, our HIV treatment business is less likely to be significantly impacted as we believe patients will continue to prioritize refilling their prescriptions and access their physicians through telemedicine. In cell therapy, reduced access to authorized treatment centers could unfortunately result in critically ill patients having access challenges, which would impact the business. Turning to clinical development. Like many others in our industry, we are pausing enrollment for most trials. The exception to this is studies where patient outcomes are critically impacted, such as trials of our HIV Capsid inhibitor in heavily pretreated individuals who have few other treatment options and some of our study programs that have enrolled patients with cancer who are critically ill. Enrollment in these studies is at the discretion of the investigators. Overall, we expect reduced clinical development expenses in the short term. In addition, the dynamic could lead to delays and potential approvals for pipeline assets over the longer run. With challenge brings opportunity to help. And as Dan described earlier, we are excited by emerging results in Remdesivir as a potential therapy for COVID-19. As we ramp up further development and manufacturing of Remdesivir, we will incur additional costs beyond those forecasts the beginning of the year. The magnitude of this investment is dependent on the continued evolution of the data, the duration of the pandemic and other factors. The potential range of this investment for 2020 is up to $1 billion and the accounting treatment of this investment is dependent upon a number of factors, including potential regulatory approvals. We\u2019re authorized by regulatory authorities that Gilead will focus on making Remdesivir both accessible and affordable to governments and patients around the world. Given the continued uncertainty in the trajectory of the pandemic and in Remdesivir clinical data, it's premature to define what the right post donation business model is to create a sustainable long term supply for global needs. In the context of strong underlying business and Q1 results, we will continue to monitor the situation and expect to provide additional insights and outlook on our Q2 earnings call. I'd like to close by thanking our team for their extraordinary efforts and for delivering a very strong first quarter during these challenging times. We can now turn the call over to Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you [Operator instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies.\nMichael Yee: So my question is for you guys on Remdesivir as it relates to [Technical Difficulty]. One, can you just describe the inputs into how to think about what revenue [impact] [ph] to the positive Remdesivir could have this year [Technical Difficulty] what are the impacts on that, inputs into that? And on expenses you guys obviously don't [Technical Difficulty] guidance you kind of walk through that, you described [Technical Difficulty] dollars for Remdesivir. Maybe just walk through the inputs there and how to think about why would it be on the lower end and a comment on that, because [indiscernible] model you're [Technical Difficulty]? Thanks.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Michael. Appreciate the questions and sorry guys that I got cut off there before. Thanks, Andy, for picking up. I want to conclude with my comments is probably the most important comment is to really thank the colleagues throughout Gilead that are working on Remdesivir and non-Remdesivir projects alike, they've really kept the momentum going in quarter one. And I'm humbled and proud to be working with them. So Michael, thank you for the call. On the revenue side, it is just as Andy mentioned also and I mentioned, it's too premature. You know there's a lot of moving parts right now. Our focus will be on making sure we come up with a sustainable model that allows us to provide Remdesivir to patients around the globe that is intent on providing access and affordability. We're just now going through the clinical data, the demand scenarios, the regulatory approvals, all these things are essential for us to put inputs into our plan about how that will work post the donation. So we can't really give more insight into that at this stage, but certainly when we can we will. On the expense side, Andy, I mean, obviously you had mentioned already that up to $1 billion and unclear on how the accounting will occur. But perhaps you want to add something else to Michael's question.\nAndrew Dickinson: At this point, it's too early to tell you where that's going to [fall on the] [ph] P&L because there\u2019re number of scenarios. Those expenses could fall into cost of goods sold. As you know, there could be R&D expenses and in some scenarios, a portion of them could also be SG&A expenses. So at a high level, the expenses that we're referencing as you would expect come from manufacturing predominantly and to a lesser extent clinical trials. And I think that's our best good faith estimate at this time based on what we know in terms of the expenses that we see as we ramp up over the year. And we'll do everything we can to provide more color and commentary in particular on our Q2 earnings call.\nMichael Yee: I appreciate it. [A billion] [ph] of expenses and not knowing the revenue, its an interesting position. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JP Morgan.\nCory Kasimov: I wanted to also ask on Remdesivir, no surprise. I was wondering if you could talk about the formulation work that's underway to potentially develop an oral and/or an inhaled version of the product. How far along might you be on this front and when can we expect to see something more there?\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks Corey. I'll start it out and maybe others on the call want to add. But our focus, as you can imagine since January, has been on ramping up the supply, particularly so that we have the lyophilized version that's appropriate for an intravenous administration, the clinical program, all of that. So, it's really where we have been. At the same time though, we have had a team just as with everything with this program, including the supply we've had teams that have been really since the very day one in January have been focusing on success. And so if successful, how else could we potentially develop this medicine? I think that's been taken into account from the totality of the clinical trial program, looking at those critical, severe and moderate patients. But likewise, we've done the same thing with other alternative delivery mechanisms, presuming success that might make it more convenient for patients or allowed us to broaden the patient groups that could benefit from a successful antiviral. And that work is, as you can imagine, still early. But we can say a couple of things. It's not, this particular medicine, because it's heavily first half metabolized in the liver, is not really appropriate as an oral formulation. We've known that for years, probably a decade. But we are looking into things like subcutaneous formulations and potentially inhaled formulations. And although, it's too premature to give you timelines on that, rest assured that we've been actively working on those. And as soon as we can give some timelines, we will see now particularly because of the efficacy that we've seen this week, we'll continue to pursue those with a great sense of urgency. But timeline is a little premature. Just know that we've been working on it now for several months. I don't know Merdad, if you want to add anything. You\u2019re okay, good. Merdad is okay. Okay, Cory, I know you need more, but we'll give you more as soon as we can.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets.\nBrian Abrahams: Two questions on Remdesivir if I could and appreciate all the work that you guys are doing to bring this treatment to patients, first off on the NIAID study. Can you give us any sense of the proportion of patients who are involved in the interim? Is there any additional update that we should be expecting that could be a gating factor to availability, and your level of confidence that differences and baseline risk factors didn't influence those results as may have happened in the China study? And then secondly, related to supply, any particular subsets of patients across the studies where you may be seeing the most optimal benefits where you might consider working regulators to direct the [indiscernible] while you're scaling up? Thanks.\nDaniel O'Day: Just to be clear on your second one related to supply, you said is there any subset of patients. Can you just complete that one more time?\nBrian Abrahams: Yes, any subset of patients where you might be seeing more benefits, more optimal benefits across the study, where you might consider working with regulators to try and direct the [indiscernible] initially as supply gets [Multiple Speakers]...\nDaniel O'Day: I get it . In terms of like an allocation. Yes, with limited allocation or limited [Multiple Speakers]\u2026\nBrian Abrahams: Exactly\u2026\nDaniel O'Day: Yes, got it. Okay, I'm going to turn it over to Merdad and I'll let Merdad take a stab at both of those.\nMerdad Parsey: On the first question, we've not seen a lot of the baseline demography and the sorts of data that would help in terms of answering your question on the NIAID study. So I think we're all going to have to wait for those data to get published and put out for us all for review. So, I think that's pending and we'll look for that to come out. In terms of patient subsets, I think our data and if you look at who's been enrolled in the trials overall, I think we're clearly looking at the hospitalized patient population and we're looking at patients who are requiring supplemental oxygen is the primary population that we're after, including those that may either become ventilated or may start out mechanically ventilated. Certainly, our data support that from our open label trials, the NIAID study enrolled that breadth of patients but we have not seen subgroup analyses of the different patient populations to give you clarity there. But we believe it'll be in that fairly broad population early on.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: Just want to say great job for the whole team really for Remdesivir development. A couple of points here on COVID-19. Have you guys looked at other nukes for earlier stage patients? Just thinking about 938 or [indiscernible]. I know you guys have a lot probably that is there that could be more applicable to some mild to moderate patients. And then on Remdesivir access, is there a model to license out IP and their manufacturing? I'm just thinking about how to accelerate perhaps broader access outside the U. S. Thank you.\nDaniel O'Day: Yes, thanks so much, Jeff for the thoughts. Everybody at Gilead will appreciate your sentiment. Let's start with COVID and the other nukes. I didn't know whether Merdad or Andy you want to handle that, I'm not sure how you want to.\nMerdad Parsey: Sure. I think right now. This is Merdad again, Jeff. Thanks for the question. Right now, we do believe that Remdesivir is the best molecule and has the best potency against the coronavirus. Anything we do we look at and you know both we and others have been looking for other molecules that could have potency here. But Remdesivir is certainly the most potent molecule that we have and that's been our focus. We'll certainly keep looking there. One of the reasons we are focused on looking at alternative formulations for Remdesivir is to address the question that you asked is just how can we get to other patient populations who may benefit from the drug as outpatients, for example. And I think in the short run, I believe that that's going to be the -- short to medium-term, I think that will be the best approach for us to go. And then I think your second question was about manufacturing, right?\nGeoff Meacham: Yes.\nDaniel O'Day: I mean, Andy, maybe you want take this question as well, because you\u2019re leading the group on this.\nAndrew Dickinson: On the manufacturing side, I'd say a couple of things at a high level. Again, our primary focus is on providing access to patients around the world. So, just like we did with our HIV medicines and HCV medicines, we are deeply focused on this. We have two separate work streams. One is working on our internal supply chain and making sure that we have the robust supply of starting materials, intermediate and a strong manufacturing consortium to build with companies around the world. You've seen some of the references to that in Dan, CEO's letters and I would expect it will provide some additional information over the coming weeks and months. We do have a second work stream, where we are in discussions with large sophisticated companies around the globe exploring the potential for other companies to help establish separate end-to-end manufacturing supply chains. The difficulty there, as you might imagine, is that given the scarcity of some of the starting materials, we want to make sure that we don't do anything to impact our supply chain, given that that is the quickest route to getting product to patients who need it all around the world. But we are looking at alternatives. It's too early to give you any specific guidance or to tell you where we're going to land on it. But we are working with a number of companies around the world that you and others know well to see what we could do together and if there's an opportunity to benefit patients in that way. So I'll leave it at that and then we will see\u2026\nDaniel O'Day: That's great Andy, and appreciate your leadership there with your business development head on, working with manufacturing. I would just add that we've been a student of other small molecules in this type of setting, whether it's [Tamiflu] in the past and some of the scale up and stockpiling that occurred there, or students of our own work, if you like, within our HIV portfolio between the developed and the developing world. So we're putting all that knowledge to work as we think about moving fast and wide in terms of our ability to produce supply, but also thinking very thoughtfully about a global footprint here, which would allow for this to, as Andy said, have different geographic representation, which we think is going to be really important. So more to come on that but we've had teams really focused on that day and night for the past several months, just to give you an idea of that.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink.\nGeoffrey Porges: Thank you very much, and echo the comments and appreciate all the great communication as well from down on down. So on Remdesivir, I'll ask a controversial question, that's no surprise. But Dan, Gilead has generated effective returns for investors and effective return on capital from treating hepatitis C and potentially nearly eliminating hepatitis C from treating HIV and turning it into a chronic disease, and to building a really important global stockpile of antiviral for influenza. So, what's special about COVID. Should we assume that the capital returns with the profitability for providing global treatment for COVID long-term after the first 200,000 or 300,000 courses of provided on a donation basis. Should we assume the returns are going to be similar to the returns that you've generated in other parts of the business? And then just quickly, can you give us an filgotinib? And can you launch this on a virtual basis or do you expect to be out of the virtual basis by the time that approval comes?\nDaniel O'Day: So, Johanna, I\u2019ll let you handle the filgotinib. But let me start with your first question, Jeff and thanks again. Obviously, we are conscious of the fact that this is unique and this is different. You mentioned some parallels to HIV, HCV even Tamiflu. But there's been no other time like this in the history of the planet than any of us have been alive. In terms of the far reaching effect of this pandemic, both medically from a patient perspective most importantly but also economically. And so I think there is no guidebook out there. There is no rulebook out there, other than that we need to be very thoughtful about how we can make sure we provide access of our medicines to patients around the globe. And do that in a sustainable way for the company for you as shareholders and we acknowledge that. And so points well taken and I would, I guess the short answer to your question is, I don't think there is a precedent to this. And so we understand our responsibility and we understand our responsibility to arrive at different audiences as we approach this. So, we'll be working back with you and we'll certainly be getting feedback from different individuals as we evolve this and as we understand for data around this. But rest assured, we understand our responsibility. With that I'm going to turn it over to Johanna please to talk a little bit filgotinib.\nJohanna Mercier: So, Geoffrey, I think just a quick update on filgo. We basically have hired all of our home office personnelj, both from a commercial medical standpoint, we've hired our sales leadership, field leadership as well and we're monitoring the situation really closely to be honest with you, because nobody really knows when this ends or what's the new normal and when not begin. And so we're just kind of monitoring that and planning for success to be honest with you to make sure that we are ready for launch for the second half of 2020 across all of the markets where we hope to get regulatory approval with the U. S., Japan, as well as Europe towards the end of this year. I think from a virtual launch standpoint, I think those are considerations that we're looking at in scenario planning and we haven't made a decision obviously that will be linked to the timing of this pandemic. Having said that, I will also tell you that a lot of our teams are doing virtual right now, many of the markets are doing remote detailing, virtual speaker programs, et cetera. And working through this environment despite obviously the opposites and patients not being open at this point in time. So, we're working through all that and looking at the different scenarios. But I think we need to know a little bit more information on the timing of this pandemic and how that plays out towards the end of this year.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Harrison: I'm going to ask two on HIV. One, can you just talk a little bit about PrEP conversion with Descovy? I think you said you were 38%, which is actually fairly close to the target you guys were talking about. Do you think you can do better than that or not this year? And then I also noticed in the back of the slides, you were talking about a long acting Biktarvy that you\u2019re putting into clinical studies. Maybe you could comment on that. Thanks.\nDaniel O'Day: Thank you so much Matthew for the comments. So Joanna, why don't you start and perhaps Diana can add on the development side.\nJohanna Mercier: So HIV overall business have of course another solid quarter again this year. It's the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, and that's obviously driven by both the treatment and the PrEP business. So your question specific to Descovy. Yes, so we just hit 38%. And so, tracking exactly to our plan, right. We had said anywhere between 40% to 45% towards the end of this year. So, we feel confident with that number. Obviously, as Andy mentioned in his opening comments, there has been a little bit of a slowdown from a switch standpoint in the PrEP market for obvious reasons, because patients are not going there to the physicians offices. But it's modest thus far and we think a lot of those will be able to recoup towards the end of this year, when the pandemic does left. So, we feel still very confident that, yes, we think we're going to be in the range of that 40%, 45% that we had originally set out and maybe even, if all goes well and we can get out of this pandemic a little bit earlier, maybe a little bit north of that. So Diana, maybe to address the long acting.\nDiana Brainard: So, as you probably know, we're really pursuing multiple shots on goals for developing a partner for capsid inhibitor. We are looking at molecules across different classes, and part of that is looking at the integrase inhibitor class, and we've got really what's the best-in-class, ideal integrase inhibitor right now with Biktarvy. And so, one of our efforts has been in formulating that such that it could be a long-acting injectable and that potential sort of first-generation partner for capsid inhibitor. We've made a lot of progress. As you know, we've got a great formulation team here and we're on the verge of getting that into the clinic. Now, most Phase 1 centers globally really have been shut down or paused. So, the timing there is a little bit uncertain but we're ready and hoping to have data by the end of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore.\nUmer Raffat: Dan, we really admire Gilead\u2019s efforts during the pandemic and the drug donations et cetera. But as we go beyond that, it does seem like there will be a commercial business in the broader COVID landscape. And I don't want to peg you to $1 number but I do want to ask this. Do you envision Gilead\u2019s product offerings for COVID been beyond them Remdesivir? For example, PI combinations and/or even partnering with vaccine companies of sorts. I'm just trying to understand how you envision this category for Gilead, if I may. And Merdad, if I may ask you a quick two part question. First, do you have a certain lung concentrations in mind that you're targeting, and is that much less than the 20 micro molar as laid out in the New England Journal paper? And do you have any data from humans on what lung concentrations are we actually seeing with Remdesivir with the dose that\u2019s in the clinic? Thank you so much.\nDaniel O'Day: Getting back to Remdesivir and I would see this playing out over time. Again, I'm going to have to come back to some of the basis of what I said before, which is we really need some time now to reflect upon a very volatile changing situation to determine, both on a clinical side, regulatory side and pandemic side, epidemiology, what's the right sustainable model is. Rest assured that we'll come back to you as soon as we can digest that and as soon as actually a little bit more time passes, which was also one of the important reasons for the donation to allow us to obtain more information as well, what that sustainable plan a model is. But I'll just make a couple of comments on what we said in the results, so record Dr. Fauci yesterday, which is with the NIAID results and the highly statistically significant reduction in time to recovery, this now changes the landscape of your life for drug development within COVID-19. Being that one has to now think about comparing to Remdesivir and/or looking at adding to Remdesivir, which I think is exactly what the NIAID trial is going to do now. And I'm sure all of our collaborators within the drug development space, we have been working with them, we're going to continue to work with them on the most thoughtful hypotheses around how we might be fitter, just as one reflects upon the HIV building decades ago, that Remdesivir become kind of the base therapy and one looks to try to improve symptomology improvements, mortality improvements, expanding patient populations. And so that is yet another factor that will go into how we determine how best to create a sustainable solution for Remdesivir. But clearly, all those things we have been thinking about and now we have to accelerate now that we have these trial results. So, more to come on that. I will have, Merdad, you answer the lung question, if you could, please for Umer.\nMerdad Parsey: So what I would say is the concentration that we're looking for, as you know, we think our EASL50 in human cells is in the 10s of nanomolar range, and we know our serum concentration gets in the micromolar range. And so we should be more than adequately covered by achieving those levels with the current dosing paradigm that we have, probably by an order of magnitude or two. And certainly in the serum and based on model data in nonhuman primates, as well as mice, we see more than adequate concentrations getting into the lung of those animals and in vivo efficacy in those animals. And I think, the clinical benefits we're seeing suggests that, that's exactly what's happening in humans as well. So I think we're pretty comfortable with where we are in terms of both dosing and exposure, including in the lung.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald.\nAlethia Young: Thanks for taking my question, and thank you for your contribution in solving the world's problems. Maybe just one and a half from me. Were you surprised just with Remdesivir kind of working as it did with an antiretroviral that you kind of think that you might need to have people kind of earlier on virus for it to work, and do you think it worked better there? And then the second question is just a little bit around HIV. Are you seeing buying patterns changing in the public market? So like the Medicaid, the presence, et cetera, et cetera. Thanks.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks a lot again for your comments. I'm going to turn the first question over to Mehrdad and the second one over to Joanna. But just as I do on your first question, and I think Merdad can fill in the details here. But, there's been a surprising consistency across all the different data elements in our clinical program from compassionate use, to interrogating what we know about the China trial, to the severe trial to the NIAID trial. And I think that is maybe not something that's completely well understood out there. And I think, Merdad, it\u2019s a part of your response, I think it'd be helpful for you to reflect upon that as well, if it's okay.\nMerdad Parsey: No, of course. I think, Alethia, we all were using the parallel construct of influenza for our thinking around Remdesivir, which was, you got to get in really early, given the viral kinetics and influenza and getting into late probably won't have much of an impact. And I remember at investor call a couple of months ago where I said that as well, and that was certainly our expectation. However, the wild card here and I think we're still learning is what are the viral kinetics in patients with this virus? How long does that last? And how quickly does it go up? And how quickly can we have an impact on it? So, I think the data or the data essentially that we are seeing efficacy across both patient populations, but also across trials that are really all tracking in the same direction as Dan alluded to. So even if you look at for the China data, the hazard ratios for improvement are consistently positive. The study was underpowered and I think the hazard ratios we\u2019ll probably see from the NIAID study, are going to be in the same ballpark. But with an appropriate sample size, they're highly statistically significant. Similarly, I think when we look at the mortality data, when we look at all of those different factors, this virus seems to be behaving differently. Remdesivir seems to be having efficacy in relatively broad patient population. And so, I think we're learning as we go. We'll learn more as more data are generated. We have our moderate data coming up where we\u2019ll be looking at an even less severely ill patient population. So there will be more data coming out in that population that may add to our knowledge base here to understand the spectrum. And as we talked about earlier, understanding the efficacy in the subgroups and the NIAID study will be really interesting in this and we don't have that information yet. So, I think all of those data will contribute to our overall understanding of how early do you need to be in new patients who have symptoms for less time do better. Those are certainly the trends. But there certainly seems to be benefit even in patients who have longer duration of symptoms right now. So, I'll hand it off to Johanna for the HIV question.\nJohanna Mercier: So Alethia, just a couple of things. We have a couple of moving pieces in the first quarter for HIV. So, I just want to -- because it's not just one piece that's making the difference here. And so the first one is obviously your seasonal inventory. So there\u2019s Q4 load off and then Q1 draw down, so that's definitely happening in Q1. Then we also had towards late March, like I'm sure many did as well, the prescription, number of days for prescription rise and inventories rise towards the end of March. We've had a bit of a mix of those two things. And specifically to government channels that you're asking the buying pattern, we do normally seem to run a little bit more of a higher mix towards government channels in the first quarter, and that obviously may negatively impacts our payer mix. So that is definitely happening in the first quarter of this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Citigroup.\nMohit Bansal: Great, thanks for taking my question. And I would also add my appreciation for your efforts against COVID-19. A quick one from my side, if you can help me. If you can update us on your collaboration programs with Galapagos timelines at this point, both for IPF as well as osteoarthritis, and specifically on osteoarthritis program? How important is it for Gilead to see the improvement in pain than we see the data for you to take a decision to opt in there? Thank you.\nMerdad Parsey: So with the IPF program, there is a scheduled interim analysis that will be coming up early next year and we think things will stay on track. Again, I'll put some error bars around the pandemic, but I don't think that should be impacted at least today. So, that will be something that we\u2019ll be clearly looking forward to and will be important to how we proceed there. In terms of the osteoarthritis, it's a great question. I think while seeing structural improvement is going to be really important and interesting. Certainly, thus far the regulatory guidance has included looking at symptoms like pain for improvement. So we can push on that. Obviously, if we see special improvement and we haven't been powered for example for pain then we'll have to look at that and think about what the implications of that are and discuss it with the regulators. So, I think what we'll be looking for is directionality on all the endpoints that we will be measuring to make a smart decision in terms of moving forward with that program.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with SunTrust.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Hey, guys thanks for taking my questions. And again, great work on all the things you're doing to help it help us with COVID. So, there's a lot of talk about the Remdesivir being approved for emergency use, and can you just clarify. Does that mean that at that point in time versus now where it's compassionate you actually could charge for the drug? And when you say affordable, does that mean a positive margin for the product? And lastly, from a science point of view, help me understand what would it take first in these drugs, or your drug on top of other drugs to work in a ventilator patient do you think theoretically? Thank you.\nDaniel O'Day: So, I'll turn the ventilator question over to Merdad in just a second, but thanks. So to clarify the EUA. So, yes, I mean, under an emergency use authorization, one could charge for the product. We made a decision, as you know, to donate 1.5 million vials, which has the entirety of our supplies through the early summer and that's for a variety of uses, right. I mean that's for clinical trials as one would expect not to charge for those of course, compassionate use, [EAP] in other countries, but also available is that supply for regulatory approvals around the world, and then we'll allocate accordingly as those regulatory approvals come online. So yes, it is possible to charge. I would just say that our goal here is to get a full approval for Remdesivir. We feel the data supports that and then EUA therefore is a step to really a more formalized approval. The reason the agency and we are talking about that is these are extraordinary times. So, weeks would make a difference to be able to get medicine to patients by enacting an EUA, if that's what the FDA chooses to do prior to another form of approval. And so it's a step wise approach, which allows us to immediately address these humanitarian needs, while still pursuing all the aspects of a normal approval, which we are doing with the FDA. So, I think that's probably the most important point. And again, I know Robyn and trust us. We will be answering your questions on the sustainable model for Remdesivir in the future, in the near future. We just don't have the answers yet and we -- but we deeply respect and appreciate the fact that when we get into millions of doses, we have to have a sustainable economic model that works here and that achieves access to affordability to patients around the world. So, more to come on that. If I could turn it over to Merdad on the ventilated treatment approach.\nMerdad Parsey: The criticality of this comes down to a timing question. It really comes down to how long is viral replication ongoing in the lungs of patients, and how quickly do patients deteriorate to needing mechanical ventilation. Certainly, what we're seeing is that, patients are very, very rapidly deteriorating, some patients deteriorate rapidly. And so getting them into viral therapy in that timeframe where it seems that there's still viral replication going on certainly seems to be benefiting those patients. And probably what's going on and this is speculation on my part is by limiting the viral replication, you're going to limit the inflammation, you're going to reduce the number of people who develop lung injury, and you're going to get them off the ventilator faster. So, the discharge rates that we're seeing where the people are being discharged four days earlier, for example, in NIAID study underlying that are patients who are deescalate their need for oxygenation and that leads them to getting on to room air more quickly. And I think -- so there's a time element in all of this that I think is probably where we're benefiting these patients. Certainly if you talk about people who've been ventilated for a week or two weeks, there the question of whether an antiviral would be beneficial, I think seems more difficult to tie into what's going on. But again, it comes down to understand the viral kinetics here and that's a work in progress, I think for all of us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Salim Syed with Mizuho.\nSalim Syed: Hey guys, thanks so much for the question. And I echo all my peer\u2019s comments on the great work you guys have done on Remdesivir. Dan, maybe just one for me, a high level of question here around your involvement, maybe with folks in Washington, you're discussions there. So obviously, biotech for some time has been about, from Washington perspective about drug pricing and the rhetoric has been pretty negative. I'm wondering if the rhetoric has changed at all in your view, which is when you're dealing with folks there, how it's particularly changed given -- and you guys are still key to this from Remdesivir and the solution to COVID-19?\nDaniel O'Day: Yes, these are unusual times for all of us, I'm sure in all of your areas of interest, as well as ours. And so what I can say is that I think people have come together in a variety of ways, and certainly that's also occurred to a certain degree in Washington. And I've spent a decent amount of time in Washington over the past several months, certainly, before the shelter in place. And I think even then, there is some change in the rhetoric. I think for highly innovative research based companies that have immediately kind of shifted their efforts to solutions on the coronavirus, it's pretty impressive actually to many of the peers in the industry, that I stay in very close touch with have spared no expense to kind of pivot and shift. So I think at the end of the day, I think this will certainly help the industry\u2019s reputation, I think the ability to solve a human crisis like this, because of the decades of investments and the at risk investments that's done by so many companies, people I think will -- and the general public will see that. And whether that's treatment, different types of treatments or vaccines, I think that will be the case. But certainly to your point, I think the tone is different in Washington. I think people are very appreciative and concerned about finding solutions here, and it's brought us all together, which I think is a good thing. I'm not suggesting that, there won't continue to be focus and pressure on drug pricing. Of course, there will be. And we continue to work appropriately to make sure that, in particular the patients that are bearing the brunt sometimes of some of the pharmaceutical pricing that legislation is put into place that supports that and improve that for patients and that we lean in as an industry and as a company to give more that flows through to patients. So all of those principles I think still apply, but it's being done now in a way where we can have an appreciation for the innovation that the industry brings. So more to come. And a lot is still to happen this year with the election coming up and with other things. But, I think from a Gilead perspective, we stay focused on innovative medicines and making sure we have access programs on leaning into legislation that supports the innovative industry and that supports reducing patient out of pocket costs, and that will be our focus accordingly, Salim. So hope that gives a little bit of a insight.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with Piper Sandler.\nTyler Van Buren: Thanks for everything that you're doing, and have a couple more Remdesivir questions of course. Given your experience, your expertise in viral infections and all the natural history that you guys are collecting in real time. Want to ask you about your best, latest thoughts on the nature of COVID-19 recurrence. Your base case assumes a peak potentially by July return in the fall and winter but a lower impact. So, is it possible provide a rough quantification of what that lower impact might be? And then also in subsequent years, is this something that you would expect in that base case to peter out or to be with us for potentially the next decade or two? And then the second question is just following up on your earlier comments on FDA interactions and potential pathways to approval, which was helpful. Have you guys had labeling discussions? Is there any color you could provide there?\nDaniel O'Day: On Remdesivir, right?\nTyler Van Buren: Yes.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Tyler, again, for the comments and I might ask if Andy and Merdad want comment on the first question. Let me start with the second. So, yes, we've been in constant dialog with the agency on Remdesivir. I just have to really also say how thankful we are for the FDA and other members of the government, the coronavirus task force that have really made themselves available, really literally all the time when we need them and vice versa. So, it's been a very good collaborative relationship. In terms of Remdesivir and the interactions with the FDA, I mean, we have been working with them on the submission. They've been open to receiving parts of the submission, which has been very helpful under a normal process, plus there's the whole EUA process that kind of goes on top of that. So yes, the answer is and you can imagine that obviously, that's been going on for weeks and actually a couple of months now. But in the past 48 hours, it's increased in intensity. So, we are and the team is in constant kind of information exchange with the agency right now, and they're getting information from us. So obviously from NIH on the NIAID trial and there's a big sense of urgency here. I think the FDA understands the importance of reacting quickly to this. And so, it's intense right now. And we think the FDA will move quite quickly on the decision on the labeling side. So, back to the lower impact of the base case. I don't know Merdad, from a scientific perspective or Andy, if you want to provide any other -- I think, we don't have a crystal ball like it\u2019s\u2026\nMerdad Parsey: Yes, I think -- and Tyler, we are as much a consumer as others. I think we are -- obviously our data, our snapshot into what's going on. But we use for on modeling, we use the external epidemiology data and use that right now to get the broader picture. So, I don't think we have any unique insights today that don't rely on the same sources that everyone else. So that's I think where we are. Obviously, as we capture more data and maybe that would change, but today I think that's where we are. And I'll just echo what Dan said. This has been an unprecedented time in terms of our interactions with the regulators, both here in the U. S., as well as outside the U. S. It's been really impressive and truly collaborative working with NIH and the FDA in parallel over the past couple of months and we talk constantly, and the same is true with EMA, same as true is Japan, where we're talking to all the regulators in parallel. So it's been a pretty unique situation and I think everyone understands the gravity. So, that's been very helpful in moving forward collaboratively.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company.\nPhil Nadeau: Two more questions on Remdesivir. The first is on the upcoming data from the SIMPLE trial, the modern trial due in May. Can you remind us how the enrollment criteria and endpoint definitions deferred between the NIAID trial and that upcoming data set? And so should we expect similar data or are there notable differences? And then second, just a follow up question on Tyler's on the FDA approval pathway. Dan, your answer to Tyler's question suggests that you may not need any more data to get a formal FDA approval. The NIAID trial might be sufficient. Is that your current understanding of your FDA dialog?\nDaniel O'Day: Yes, I'll let Merdad also discuss. So, yes I just -- look, the discussions are still ongoing in terms of what's required for a formal approval. What I meant to infer earlier is that the NIAID data are demonstrates safety and efficacy at a highly statistical level, which is usually the barrier for a full approval. So, that's what we're working with them on. And I don't want to get ahead of the agency on that, if that's okay. But again I do believe that there is most likely kind of a two step process that potentially in the UAE being granted and then moving on to the full approval. Having said that, can I turn to Merdad or Diana, so Merdad, okay on the first question.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes, I was actually going to see if Diana wanted to answer that question\u2026\nDaniel O'Day: Okay, yes, that\u2019s great. Diana, thank you.\nDiana Brainard: So, in terms of endpoints, the NIAID study looks at time to clinical recovery, use 7 point retinal scale, and the ordinal scale is really tracking throughout most of the major clinical trials right now. But as our understanding of the disease has evolved the types of endpoints using that scale has evolved. And so, NIAID changed to time to clinical recovery, which basically means no longer requiring medical care within the hospital, getting off of oxygen or live discharge. In our moderate study, we're looking -- we're using the ordinal scale as well, but we're looking at the day 11 distribution along that ordinal scale. So, similar to what we did in our severe study, but looking at day 11 instead of day 14, recognizing that we're looking at a population that's less sick. So the modern study is looking at patients who are hospitalized, but they're not hypoxic, they're not requiring oxygen. The NIAID study enroll patients from starting their but all way through mechanical ventilation. So, slightly different end points for slightly different patient populations and most importantly, really looking at different questions. We're looking at treatment duration, they're looking at primary safety and efficacy with the placebo control.\nPhil Nadeau: That's helpful. Thank you.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks a lot, Phil. So with that, I think we'll turn the call over to Doug to close. But, let me just say, thank you very much to all of you. And we really appreciate your trust and confidence in Gilead, and we'll continue to do our best throughout what we do for patients and certainly for COVID-19. So with that, Doug, do you want to have a last word?\nDoug Maffei: Thank you, Dan. And thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead. And the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on our future progress.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Merdad Parsey",
            "content": "On the first question, we've not seen a lot of the baseline demography and the sorts of data that would help in terms of answering your question on the NIAID study. So I think we're all going to have to wait for those data to get published and put out for us all for review. So, I think that's pending and we'll look for that to come out. In terms of patient subsets, I think our data and if you look at who's been enrolled in the trials overall, I think we're clearly looking at the hospitalized patient population and we're looking at patients who are requiring supplemental oxygen is the primary population that we're after, including those that may either become ventilated or may start out mechanically ventilated. Certainly, our data support that from our open label trials, the NIAID study enrolled that breadth of patients but we have not seen subgroup analyses of the different patient populations to give you clarity there. But we believe it'll be in that fairly broad population early on. Sure. I think right now. This is Merdad again, Jeff. Thanks for the question. Right now, we do believe that Remdesivir is the best molecule and has the best potency against the coronavirus. Anything we do we look at and you know both we and others have been looking for other molecules that could have potency here. But Remdesivir is certainly the most potent molecule that we have and that's been our focus. We'll certainly keep looking there. One of the reasons we are focused on looking at alternative formulations for Remdesivir is to address the question that you asked is just how can we get to other patient populations who may benefit from the drug as outpatients, for example. And I think in the short run, I believe that that's going to be the -- short to medium-term, I think that will be the best approach for us to go. And then I think your second question was about manufacturing, right? So what I would say is the concentration that we're looking for, as you know, we think our EASL50 in human cells is in the 10s of nanomolar range, and we know our serum concentration gets in the micromolar range. And so we should be more than adequately covered by achieving those levels with the current dosing paradigm that we have, probably by an order of magnitude or two. And certainly in the serum and based on model data in nonhuman primates, as well as mice, we see more than adequate concentrations getting into the lung of those animals and in vivo efficacy in those animals. And I think, the clinical benefits we're seeing suggests that, that's exactly what's happening in humans as well. So I think we're pretty comfortable with where we are in terms of both dosing and exposure, including in the lung. No, of course. I think, Alethia, we all were using the parallel construct of influenza for our thinking around Remdesivir, which was, you got to get in really early, given the viral kinetics and influenza and getting into late probably won't have much of an impact. And I remember at investor call a couple of months ago where I said that as well, and that was certainly our expectation. However, the wild card here and I think we're still learning is what are the viral kinetics in patients with this virus? How long does that last? And how quickly does it go up? And how quickly can we have an impact on it? So, I think the data or the data essentially that we are seeing efficacy across both patient populations, but also across trials that are really all tracking in the same direction as Dan alluded to. So even if you look at for the China data, the hazard ratios for improvement are consistently positive. The study was underpowered and I think the hazard ratios we'll probably see from the NIAID study, are going to be in the same ballpark. But with an appropriate sample size, they're highly statistically significant. Similarly, I think when we look at the mortality data, when we look at all of those different factors, this virus seems to be behaving differently. Remdesivir seems to be having efficacy in relatively broad patient population. And so, I think we're learning as we go. We'll learn more as more data are generated. We have our moderate data coming up where we'll be looking at an even less severely ill patient population. So there will be more data coming out in that population that may add to our knowledge base here to understand the spectrum. And as we talked about earlier, understanding the efficacy in the subgroups and the NIAID study will be really interesting in this and we don't have that information yet. So, I think all of those data will contribute to our overall understanding of how early do you need to be in new patients who have symptoms for less time do better. Those are certainly the trends. But there certainly seems to be benefit even in patients who have longer duration of symptoms right now. So, I'll hand it off to Johanna for the HIV question. So with the IPF program, there is a scheduled interim analysis that will be coming up early next year and we think things will stay on track. Again, I'll put some error bars around the pandemic, but I don't think that should be impacted at least today. So, that will be something that we'll be clearly looking forward to and will be important to how we proceed there. In terms of the osteoarthritis, it's a great question. I think while seeing structural improvement is going to be really important and interesting. Certainly, thus far the regulatory guidance has included looking at symptoms like pain for improvement. So we can push on that. Obviously, if we see special improvement and we haven't been powered for example for pain then we'll have to look at that and think about what the implications of that are and discuss it with the regulators. So, I think what we'll be looking for is directionality on all the endpoints that we will be measuring to make a smart decision in terms of moving forward with that program. The criticality of this comes down to a timing question. It really comes down to how long is viral replication ongoing in the lungs of patients, and how quickly do patients deteriorate to needing mechanical ventilation. Certainly, what we're seeing is that, patients are very, very rapidly deteriorating, some patients deteriorate rapidly. And so getting them into viral therapy in that timeframe where it seems that there's still viral replication going on certainly seems to be benefiting those patients. And probably what's going on and this is speculation on my part is by limiting the viral replication, you're going to limit the inflammation, you're going to reduce the number of people who develop lung injury, and you're going to get them off the ventilator faster. So, the discharge rates that we're seeing where the people are being discharged four days earlier, for example, in NIAID study underlying that are patients who are deescalate their need for oxygenation and that leads them to getting on to room air more quickly. And I think -- so there's a time element in all of this that I think is probably where we're benefiting these patients. Certainly if you talk about people who've been ventilated for a week or two weeks, there the question of whether an antiviral would be beneficial, I think seems more difficult to tie into what's going on. But again, it comes down to understand the viral kinetics here and that's a work in progress, I think for all of us. Yes, I think -- and Tyler, we are as much a consumer as others. I think we are -- obviously our data, our snapshot into what's going on. But we use for on modeling, we use the external epidemiology data and use that right now to get the broader picture. So, I don't think we have any unique insights today that don't rely on the same sources that everyone else. So that's I think where we are. Obviously, as we capture more data and maybe that would change, but today I think that's where we are. And I'll just echo what Dan said. This has been an unprecedented time in terms of our interactions with the regulators, both here in the U. S., as well as outside the U. S. It's been really impressive and truly collaborative working with NIH and the FDA in parallel over the past couple of months and we talk constantly, and the same is true with EMA, same as true is Japan, where we're talking to all the regulators in parallel. So it's been a pretty unique situation and I think everyone understands the gravity. So, that's been very helpful in moving forward collaboratively. Yes, I was actually going to see if Diana wanted to answer that question..."

            "name": "Daniel O'Day",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Doug, and good afternoon, everyone. Well, as you can imagine it's been an extraordinary week for Gilead given the terrific news on our investigational antiviral drug Remdesivir. The news shared yesterday that the data showed the potential of Remdesivir to help ease some of the burden of the pandemic, is the outcome that we had all hoped would be possible. We're incredibly humbled to think about what this news could mean for patients and communities. I'd like to start by sharing my thanks to everyone who has helped to bring Remdesivir to this point, including all those involved in the collaborative clinical trials, the trial investigators, governments, hospitals and above all, the patients who participated. I want to acknowledge our internal teams that have been working day and night on Remdesivir for the past three months, following many years of research long before the outbreak began. Because of their Remdesivir news, the original focus for today's call has somewhat shifted. I'm sure you have a lot of questions on the results and the next steps. We'll provide an overview of what was a strong first quarter for Gilead, but with an abbreviated set of opening comments so we can leave more time for questions. I'll speak briefly about the quarter and Remdesivir before turning the call over to Andy to discuss financial details and the impact of COVID-19 on our business. As Doug noted in the opening, Christie, Joanna, Mehrdad and Diana have joined us today to answer your questions at the end of the call. Gilead has been built to withstand significant challenge. There's a short-term uncertainty for all of us, but the solid foundations that Gilead has laid over the past 30 years and our focus on transformational therapeutics give us confidence in the long-term durability of the business. We'll do our best to provide you with a clear picture of where we are and what we expect as far as the near-term impact of COVID-19, while acknowledging that, as we all know, these are uncertain times with many unknowns, not least of which is how long the pandemic will last. So, turning to the quarter. I'll use the framework we introduced at the start of the year with the three pillars that will shape our future; our strong core business, our internal pipeline and supplemental growth opportunities that are being enabled through our strategies. Our performance in the first quarter demonstrated the strength of our foundational business once again with double-digit growth in HIV. We reached and in fact exceeded all of our targets. Revenues for our HIV franchise were up 14% year-over-year. This was driven by both treatment and prevention as Biktarvy remain the number one prescribed HIV regimen in the U. S. during the quarter and approximately 38% of individuals on PrEP are now taking Descovy. What I would say in general about where we stand in HIV is this. We are very confident in the underlying competitiveness of our products and our position as the leader in HIV. Completing the picture in our core antivirals business, we saw sustained revenues from our HCV franchise in the last quarter. Since the introduction of authorized generics in the U. S. we've regained market share and now hold around 61% of share through Asegua and Gilead. So moving from our core business to advancing our pipeline, I'll provide just a brief overview. More detailed information is available as part of our first quarter earnings materials in the investor relations sections of our Web site. Filgotinib, as you're aware, is under regulatory review in the United States, Europe and Japan as a potential treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Our teams are preparing for a competitive launch and remain in close contact with regulators to understand the effect COVID-19 could have on reviewed timelines. In HIV, we made progress across our pipeline, sharing important data at the virtual CROI conference. With our innovative long-acting anti viral and HIV cure programs, reinforcing our long term commitment to people living with HIV. In cell therapy, the FDA accepted Kite BLA, for KTE-X19 as a treatment for relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma during the first quarter and granted a priority review designation. As you might recall, the European Medicines Agency validated our application in January. This represents really important progress patients with relapsed refractory mantle cell lymphoma, a rare form of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, are in need of new therapies. If approved, Kite would be the first company with two cell therapies on the market. So I've touched on our strong core business and advancing our pipeline. Now I want to say a few words about the work we are doing to expand our pipeline through business development, including of course the acquisition of Forty Seven completed earlier this month. Acquiring Forty Seven is a great early example of our strategy in action. We said we would build on our core area of expertise, which as you know are virology and immuno-modulation that we would keep a high bar and then our business development efforts will focus on clinical stage assets, such as magrolimab, which we gained as a part of this acquisition. We're working to integrate the teams in the program. It's a joint effort which I'm leading with Mark McCamish, the CEO of Forty Seven with the objectives of keeping things moving smoothly with magrolimab and defining a working model that supports continued innovation. Next month researchers will present data on our next generation cancer therapies virtually at ASCO, including magrolimab and a number of abstracts that highlight the Kite cell therapy portfolio. The presentations at ASCO underscore the strength of our scientific approach in immunooncology, and we look forward to sharing this latest research. Beyond Forty Seven, our business development team remains as active as ever. In the last month, we've announced three partnerships, a collaboration with Second Genome to identify biomarkers and potential new drug targets in inflammation, a licensing agreement between Kite and Teneobio covering a dual targeting CAR-T therapies, and a three year collaboration with oNKo-innate to discover cancer immunotherapies. Overall, we continue to maintain our momentum and I'm pleased with all the progress we've made this quarter. I'll now turn to Remdesivir. The study results shared yesterday from the randomized placebo controlled Phase 3 NIAID study and from our own open label Phase 3 SIMPLE study in patients with severe disease, are important progress as we seek to understand the role that Remdesivir might play in easing the burden of COVID-19 around the world. These trials are part of a suite of clinical trials investigating the effects of Remdesivir. We designed the clinical research program to ask multiple questions in parallel, including what groups of patients are most likely to respond and when to treat and for how long. Various study designs were used from placebo controlled to open label to answer very specific questions in each case. We expected that the answers would emerge around the same time and that taken together, they would form a clear picture of how Remdesivir might best be used for patients. Yesterday, we answered important questions with the initial results of the NIAID trial and SIMPLE trials. The NIAID data demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 who received Remdesivir recovered faster than similar patients who received placebo. The results from the Gilead-sponsored SIMPLE study address a critical question about dosing. The data from the first of the SIMPLE studies showed similar clinical improvements in patients with severe symptoms with COVID-19 regardless of whether they received 5 or 10 days of treatment. The ability to shorten duration for severely ill patients is very important. It means patients can go home earlier, hospital resources can be freed up and it has a positive impact of course on our supply. We had calculated having 1.5 million doses by the end of May, amounting to 140,000 treatment courses at a 10 day treatment duration. The Gilead SIMPLE study suggests we may now be able to significantly increase the number of courses available with a 5 day treatment duration for certain patients. As we announced previously, we are donating our entire existing supply, frankly because this is the right thing to do at this time and the human health need in the pandemic. As you know, we've been ramping up production since January. We've significantly reduced lead times and expanded our global network of partners. As additional raw materials come available, we'll have an exponential increase in supplies towards the latter half of this year. We hope to have produced enough supplies to treat over a million patients by year end. We are also working to build a global consortium of pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturers to expand global capacity and production. It will be essential for countries to work together to create enough supply for people all over the world, and we look forward to these collaborative efforts. For access and allocation, we'll work closely with government and healthcare system to provide access. We intend to allocate our available supply based on guiding principles that aim to direct global access for appropriate patients in urgent need of treatment. We recognize there's a lot of work left to be done and a long way to go in finding medical solutions to end the pandemic, and we'll continue to work with regulatory authorities and the best path forward for Remdesivir. At the same time, all of us at Gilead are relieved and grateful that our efforts in Remdesivir have led to this important progress at a time when we all need a beacon of hope. Before I turn the call over to Andy, I want to re reiterate how grateful we are for the partnership with many groups outside Gilead to support the work on Remdesivir. Our collaboration throughout this pandemic has been critical [Technical Difficulty]. Thanks, Michael. Appreciate the questions and sorry guys that I got cut off there before. Thanks, Andy, for picking up. I want to conclude with my comments is probably the most important comment is to really thank the colleagues throughout Gilead that are working on Remdesivir and non-Remdesivir projects alike, they've really kept the momentum going in quarter one. And I'm humbled and proud to be working with them. So Michael, thank you for the call. On the revenue side, it is just as Andy mentioned also and I mentioned, it's too premature. You know there's a lot of moving parts right now. Our focus will be on making sure we come up with a sustainable model that allows us to provide Remdesivir to patients around the globe that is intent on providing access and affordability. We're just now going through the clinical data, the demand scenarios, the regulatory approvals, all these things are essential for us to put inputs into our plan about how that will work post the donation. So we can't really give more insight into that at this stage, but certainly when we can we will. On the expense side, Andy, I mean, obviously you had mentioned already that up to $1 billion and unclear on how the accounting will occur. But perhaps you want to add something else to Michael's question. Thanks Corey. I'll start it out and maybe others on the call want to add. But our focus, as you can imagine since January, has been on ramping up the supply, particularly so that we have the lyophilized version that's appropriate for an intravenous administration, the clinical program, all of that. So, it's really where we have been. At the same time though, we have had a team just as with everything with this program, including the supply we've had teams that have been really since the very day one in January have been focusing on success. And so if successful, how else could we potentially develop this medicine? I think that's been taken into account from the totality of the clinical trial program, looking at those critical, severe and moderate patients. But likewise, we've done the same thing with other alternative delivery mechanisms, presuming success that might make it more convenient for patients or allowed us to broaden the patient groups that could benefit from a successful antiviral. And that work is, as you can imagine, still early. But we can say a couple of things. It's not, this particular medicine, because it's heavily first half metabolized in the liver, is not really appropriate as an oral formulation. We've known that for years, probably a decade. But we are looking into things like subcutaneous formulations and potentially inhaled formulations. And although, it's too premature to give you timelines on that, rest assured that we've been actively working on those. And as soon as we can give some timelines, we will see now particularly because of the efficacy that we've seen this week, we'll continue to pursue those with a great sense of urgency. But timeline is a little premature. Just know that we've been working on it now for several months. I don't know Merdad, if you want to add anything. You're okay, good. Merdad is okay. Okay, Cory, I know you need more, but we'll give you more as soon as we can. Just to be clear on your second one related to supply, you said is there any subset of patients. Can you just complete that one more time? I get it . In terms of like an allocation. Yes, with limited allocation or limited [Multiple Speakers]... Yes, got it. Okay, I'm going to turn it over to Merdad and I'll let Merdad take a stab at both of those. Yes, thanks so much, Jeff for the thoughts. Everybody at Gilead will appreciate your sentiment. Let's start with COVID and the other nukes. I didn't know whether Merdad or Andy you want to handle that, I'm not sure how you want to. I mean, Andy, maybe you want take this question as well, because you're leading the group on this. That's great Andy, and appreciate your leadership there with your business development head on, working with manufacturing. I would just add that we've been a student of other small molecules in this type of setting, whether it's [Tamiflu] in the past and some of the scale up and stockpiling that occurred there, or students of our own work, if you like, within our HIV portfolio between the developed and the developing world. So we're putting all that knowledge to work as we think about moving fast and wide in terms of our ability to produce supply, but also thinking very thoughtfully about a global footprint here, which would allow for this to, as Andy said, have different geographic representation, which we think is going to be really important. So more to come on that but we've had teams really focused on that day and night for the past several months, just to give you an idea of that. So, Johanna, I'll let you handle the filgotinib. But let me start with your first question, Jeff and thanks again. Obviously, we are conscious of the fact that this is unique and this is different. You mentioned some parallels to HIV, HCV even Tamiflu. But there's been no other time like this in the history of the planet than any of us have been alive. In terms of the far reaching effect of this pandemic, both medically from a patient perspective most importantly but also economically. And so I think there is no guidebook out there. There is no rulebook out there, other than that we need to be very thoughtful about how we can make sure we provide access of our medicines to patients around the globe. And do that in a sustainable way for the company for you as shareholders and we acknowledge that. And so points well taken and I would, I guess the short answer to your question is, I don't think there is a precedent to this. And so we understand our responsibility and we understand our responsibility to arrive at different audiences as we approach this. So, we'll be working back with you and we'll certainly be getting feedback from different individuals as we evolve this and as we understand for data around this. But rest assured, we understand our responsibility. With that I'm going to turn it over to Johanna please to talk a little bit filgotinib. Thank you so much Matthew for the comments. So Joanna, why don't you start and perhaps Diana can add on the development side. Getting back to Remdesivir and I would see this playing out over time. Again, I'm going to have to come back to some of the basis of what I said before, which is we really need some time now to reflect upon a very volatile changing situation to determine, both on a clinical side, regulatory side and pandemic side, epidemiology, what's the right sustainable model is. Rest assured that we'll come back to you as soon as we can digest that and as soon as actually a little bit more time passes, which was also one of the important reasons for the donation to allow us to obtain more information as well, what that sustainable plan a model is. But I'll just make a couple of comments on what we said in the results, so record Dr. Fauci yesterday, which is with the NIAID results and the highly statistically significant reduction in time to recovery, this now changes the landscape of your life for drug development within COVID-19. Being that one has to now think about comparing to Remdesivir and/or looking at adding to Remdesivir, which I think is exactly what the NIAID trial is going to do now. And I'm sure all of our collaborators within the drug development space, we have been working with them, we're going to continue to work with them on the most thoughtful hypotheses around how we might be fitter, just as one reflects upon the HIV building decades ago, that Remdesivir become kind of the base therapy and one looks to try to improve symptomology improvements, mortality improvements, expanding patient populations. And so that is yet another factor that will go into how we determine how best to create a sustainable solution for Remdesivir. But clearly, all those things we have been thinking about and now we have to accelerate now that we have these trial results. So, more to come on that. I will have, Merdad, you answer the lung question, if you could, please for Umer. Thanks a lot again for your comments. I'm going to turn the first question over to Mehrdad and the second one over to Joanna. But just as I do on your first question, and I think Merdad can fill in the details here. But, there's been a surprising consistency across all the different data elements in our clinical program from compassionate use, to interrogating what we know about the China trial, to the severe trial to the NIAID trial. And I think that is maybe not something that's completely well understood out there. And I think, Merdad, it's a part of your response, I think it'd be helpful for you to reflect upon that as well, if it's okay. So, I'll turn the ventilator question over to Merdad in just a second, but thanks. So to clarify the EUA. So, yes, I mean, under an emergency use authorization, one could charge for the product. We made a decision, as you know, to donate 1.5 million vials, which has the entirety of our supplies through the early summer and that's for a variety of uses, right. I mean that's for clinical trials as one would expect not to charge for those of course, compassionate use, [EAP] in other countries, but also available is that supply for regulatory approvals around the world, and then we'll allocate accordingly as those regulatory approvals come online. So yes, it is possible to charge. I would just say that our goal here is to get a full approval for Remdesivir. We feel the data supports that and then EUA therefore is a step to really a more formalized approval. The reason the agency and we are talking about that is these are extraordinary times. So, weeks would make a difference to be able to get medicine to patients by enacting an EUA, if that's what the FDA chooses to do prior to another form of approval. And so it's a step wise approach, which allows us to immediately address these humanitarian needs, while still pursuing all the aspects of a normal approval, which we are doing with the FDA. So, I think that's probably the most important point. And again, I know Robyn and trust us. We will be answering your questions on the sustainable model for Remdesivir in the future, in the near future. We just don't have the answers yet and we -- but we deeply respect and appreciate the fact that when we get into millions of doses, we have to have a sustainable economic model that works here and that achieves access to affordability to patients around the world. So, more to come on that. If I could turn it over to Merdad on the ventilated treatment approach. Yes, these are unusual times for all of us, I'm sure in all of your areas of interest, as well as ours. And so what I can say is that I think people have come together in a variety of ways, and certainly that's also occurred to a certain degree in Washington. And I've spent a decent amount of time in Washington over the past several months, certainly, before the shelter in place. And I think even then, there is some change in the rhetoric. I think for highly innovative research based companies that have immediately kind of shifted their efforts to solutions on the coronavirus, it's pretty impressive actually to many of the peers in the industry, that I stay in very close touch with have spared no expense to kind of pivot and shift. So I think at the end of the day, I think this will certainly help the industry's reputation, I think the ability to solve a human crisis like this, because of the decades of investments and the at risk investments that's done by so many companies, people I think will -- and the general public will see that. And whether that's treatment, different types of treatments or vaccines, I think that will be the case. But certainly to your point, I think the tone is different in Washington. I think people are very appreciative and concerned about finding solutions here, and it's brought us all together, which I think is a good thing. I'm not suggesting that, there won't continue to be focus and pressure on drug pricing. Of course, there will be. And we continue to work appropriately to make sure that, in particular the patients that are bearing the brunt sometimes of some of the pharmaceutical pricing that legislation is put into place that supports that and improve that for patients and that we lean in as an industry and as a company to give more that flows through to patients. So all of those principles I think still apply, but it's being done now in a way where we can have an appreciation for the innovation that the industry brings. So more to come. And a lot is still to happen this year with the election coming up and with other things. But, I think from a Gilead perspective, we stay focused on innovative medicines and making sure we have access programs on leaning into legislation that supports the innovative industry and that supports reducing patient out of pocket costs, and that will be our focus accordingly, Salim. So hope that gives a little bit of a insight. On Remdesivir, right? Thanks, Tyler, again, for the comments and I might ask if Andy and Merdad want comment on the first question. Let me start with the second. So, yes, we've been in constant dialog with the agency on Remdesivir. I just have to really also say how thankful we are for the FDA and other members of the government, the coronavirus task force that have really made themselves available, really literally all the time when we need them and vice versa. So, it's been a very good collaborative relationship. In terms of Remdesivir and the interactions with the FDA, I mean, we have been working with them on the submission. They've been open to receiving parts of the submission, which has been very helpful under a normal process, plus there's the whole EUA process that kind of goes on top of that. So yes, the answer is and you can imagine that obviously, that's been going on for weeks and actually a couple of months now. But in the past 48 hours, it's increased in intensity. So, we are and the team is in constant kind of information exchange with the agency right now, and they're getting information from us. So obviously from NIH on the NIAID trial and there's a big sense of urgency here. I think the FDA understands the importance of reacting quickly to this. And so, it's intense right now. And we think the FDA will move quite quickly on the decision on the labeling side. So, back to the lower impact of the base case. I don't know Merdad, from a scientific perspective or Andy, if you want to provide any other -- I think, we don't have a crystal ball like it's... Yes, I'll let Merdad also discuss. So, yes I just -- look, the discussions are still ongoing in terms of what's required for a formal approval. What I meant to infer earlier is that the NIAID data are demonstrates safety and efficacy at a highly statistical level, which is usually the barrier for a full approval. So, that's what we're working with them on. And I don't want to get ahead of the agency on that, if that's okay. But again I do believe that there is most likely kind of a two step process that potentially in the UAE being granted and then moving on to the full approval. Having said that, can I turn to Merdad or Diana, so Merdad, okay on the first question. Okay, yes, that's great. Diana, thank you. Thanks a lot, Phil. So with that, I think we'll turn the call over to Doug to close. But, let me just say, thank you very much to all of you. And we really appreciate your trust and confidence in Gilead, and we'll continue to do our best throughout what we do for patients and certainly for COVID-19. So with that, Doug, do you want to have a last word?"

            "name": "Andrew Dickinson",
            "content": "Sounds like we lost Dan. I'll just finish Dan's comments. We also want to say how proud we are of the way our employees have demonstrated such dedication to meeting the needs of patients those with COVID-19, as well as those with conditions, including HIV, viral hepatitis and cancer who depend on us for their medications. So with that, I will turn to our financial comments and then we'll move to Q&A. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Andrew Dickinson. I'm the company's CFO. Before I start, I'd also like to acknowledge the incredible work of our 12,000 employees and what they're doing during these challenging times. Their dedication and resilience is really inspiring. In addition from the outset, I'd like to emphasize that our core business is very strong, durable, and provides a solid foundation to navigate the current environment. We continue to have confidence in 2020 and beyond. The pandemic has not diminished that view at all, and we remain confident in our long term outlook. I'd like to first briefly share some commentary on our very strong first quarter results. And I'll remind you that the earnings materials posted on our Web site can help all of the details, including preliminary color on the impact of COVID-19 on our business to date, as well as our preliminary expectations for the coming months. We are happy to walk through the results and the impact of COVID-19 on our business today in detail during the Q&A session. Starting with our revenues for the quarter. Total revenues for the first quarter were $5.5 billion with non-GAAP earnings of $1.68 per diluted share. This compares to revenue of $5.3 billion with non-GAAP earnings of $1.67 per diluted share for the same period last year. Product sales for the first quarter were $5.5 billion, down 6% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year. I'd like to call out that we believe approximately $200 million of revenues were pulled forward in Q1, primarily for our HIV franchise due to the COVID-19 pandemic across the U. S. and Europe. This was the result of payers and pharmacies providing greater access to medicines by allowing 90 day refills and in some cases, early refills among other operators. We expect this to reverse itself out over subsequent quarters. Now, turning to our expenses, non-GAAP R&D expense was $1 billion for the quarter, up 8% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the ramp up of Remdesivir, including manufacturing scale up and clinical trial costs. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $1.1 billion, up 4% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher promotional expenses in the United States related to our HIV products. As Dan highlighted, we completed our acquisition of Forty Seven this month. We currently expect to incur approximately $120 million in expenses this year related to Forty Seven, primarily in research and development. In addition, I'd like to highlight that the acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition. And as a result, we currently expect to incur approximately $4.8 billion in GAAP R&D expense, primarily related to in process research and development. Turning to our strong balance sheet. During the quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations. We ended the quarter with $24.3 billion in cash and marketable debt securities. We repaid $500 million of debt, paid cash dividends of $874 million and repurchased $19 million shares of stock for $1.3 billion. I want to note that we paid approximately $4.9 billion in cash upon closing the Forty Seven in April. Our strong balance sheet and disciplined allocation of capital has positioned us to continue to grow and build our business despite current environment and associated risks. We remain very confident in the durability of our business, and expect to generate significant operating cash flow during 2020. I'll turn now to COVID-19 and its impact on our business. Like others, we have anticipated that there could be a short-term financial impact to our company and to the sector as a whole. We continue to carefully review our results to assess the potential magnitude of that impact. Towards the end of the quarter ending April, we did begin to see some effects on our business, primarily as fewer patients access healthcare and the number of new starts in HCV and HIV prevention began to slow. However, to-date, the overall effect on our business has been modest and it remains unclear what the ultimate impact will be. Given this significant uncertainty regarding the duration and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are actively planning for a number of scenarios. And we'd like to focus on our base case assumptions today, which we are making from data drawn from a number of sources, including epidemiologists, economists and public health officials. First, these base case assumptions suggest the pandemic will peak between March and July. We would point the recent data from Johns Hopkins would show trends reflecting a slowing of the rate of new cases since late March in the United States, and a declining number of new patients in some critically affected regions of the world. Second, if the virus returns in the fall or winter, the impact will be lessened due to preparedness and hopefully the emergence of therapeutics, including potentially our own Remdesivir. Third, the global economy will begin recovery late in Q2 and a return to the pre-COVID dynamics will be underway by year end. We have of course considered external views that anticipate more or -- and less favorable scenarios, but we believe this base case provides the best foundation at this time to plan in this uncertain situation. Let me share a few qualitative perspectives on potential business implications of this scenario. Please bear in mind the forward-looking statement disclosures we shared at the beginning of the call. I'd also like to highlight again that we have added significant commentary throughout the investor presentation that's posted on our Web site and we would encourage you to review those materials. There are three key takeaways from our perspective; first, we had a very strong quarter; second, to-date, the impact on our business has been modest; and third, we remain very confident in our long-term outlook. That said, on the commercial side driven by lessened healthcare provider access and fewer patient visits, we may see revenues adversely impacted in Q2 and potentially beyond. This would likely be different across our franchises with our HCV franchise disproportionately affected due to the acute care nature of the therapy. We believe that the majority of any revenue decrease in HCV revenue due to the pandemic could be recouped in a warehousing type effect later in 2020 or into 2021. In HIV, early signals suggest that switches both for treatment and prevention patients maybe impacted by COVID-19 as people defer healthcare visits. Specifically, in April, we are observing reductions in Descovy for PrEP initiations and lower switch volume. PrEP refills may also be effected, but it's still too early to fully understand any trends here. In contrast, our HIV treatment business is less likely to be significantly impacted as we believe patients will continue to prioritize refilling their prescriptions and access their physicians through telemedicine. In cell therapy, reduced access to authorized treatment centers could unfortunately result in critically ill patients having access challenges, which would impact the business. Turning to clinical development. Like many others in our industry, we are pausing enrollment for most trials. The exception to this is studies where patient outcomes are critically impacted, such as trials of our HIV Capsid inhibitor in heavily pretreated individuals who have few other treatment options and some of our study programs that have enrolled patients with cancer who are critically ill. Enrollment in these studies is at the discretion of the investigators. Overall, we expect reduced clinical development expenses in the short term. In addition, the dynamic could lead to delays and potential approvals for pipeline assets over the longer run. With challenge brings opportunity to help. And as Dan described earlier, we are excited by emerging results in Remdesivir as a potential therapy for COVID-19. As we ramp up further development and manufacturing of Remdesivir, we will incur additional costs beyond those forecasts the beginning of the year. The magnitude of this investment is dependent on the continued evolution of the data, the duration of the pandemic and other factors. The potential range of this investment for 2020 is up to $1 billion and the accounting treatment of this investment is dependent upon a number of factors, including potential regulatory approvals. We're authorized by regulatory authorities that Gilead will focus on making Remdesivir both accessible and affordable to governments and patients around the world. Given the continued uncertainty in the trajectory of the pandemic and in Remdesivir clinical data, it's premature to define what the right post donation business model is to create a sustainable long term supply for global needs. In the context of strong underlying business and Q1 results, we will continue to monitor the situation and expect to provide additional insights and outlook on our Q2 earnings call. I'd like to close by thanking our team for their extraordinary efforts and for delivering a very strong first quarter during these challenging times. We can now turn the call over to Q&A. Operator? At this point, it's too early to tell you where that's going to [fall on the] [ph] P&L because there're number of scenarios. Those expenses could fall into cost of goods sold. As you know, there could be R&D expenses and in some scenarios, a portion of them could also be SG&A expenses. So at a high level, the expenses that we're referencing as you would expect come from manufacturing predominantly and to a lesser extent clinical trials. And I think that's our best good faith estimate at this time based on what we know in terms of the expenses that we see as we ramp up over the year. And we'll do everything we can to provide more color and commentary in particular on our Q2 earnings call. On the manufacturing side, I'd say a couple of things at a high level. Again, our primary focus is on providing access to patients around the world. So, just like we did with our HIV medicines and HCV medicines, we are deeply focused on this. We have two separate work streams. One is working on our internal supply chain and making sure that we have the robust supply of starting materials, intermediate and a strong manufacturing consortium to build with companies around the world. You've seen some of the references to that in Dan, CEO's letters and I would expect it will provide some additional information over the coming weeks and months. We do have a second work stream, where we are in discussions with large sophisticated companies around the globe exploring the potential for other companies to help establish separate end-to-end manufacturing supply chains. The difficulty there, as you might imagine, is that given the scarcity of some of the starting materials, we want to make sure that we don't do anything to impact our supply chain, given that that is the quickest route to getting product to patients who need it all around the world. But we are looking at alternatives. It's too early to give you any specific guidance or to tell you where we're going to land on it. But we are working with a number of companies around the world that you and others know well to see what we could do together and if there's an opportunity to benefit patients in that way. So I'll leave it at that and then we will see..."

            "content": "So, as you probably know, we're really pursuing multiple shots on goals for developing a partner for capsid inhibitor. We are looking at molecules across different classes, and part of that is looking at the integrase inhibitor class, and we've got really what's the best-in-class, ideal integrase inhibitor right now with Biktarvy. And so, one of our efforts has been in formulating that such that it could be a long-acting injectable and that potential sort of first-generation partner for capsid inhibitor. We've made a lot of progress. As you know, we've got a great formulation team here and we're on the verge of getting that into the clinic. Now, most Phase 1 centers globally really have been shut down or paused. So, the timing there is a little bit uncertain but we're ready and hoping to have data by the end of the year. So, in terms of endpoints, the NIAID study looks at time to clinical recovery, use 7 point retinal scale, and the ordinal scale is really tracking throughout most of the major clinical trials right now. But as our understanding of the disease has evolved the types of endpoints using that scale has evolved. And so, NIAID changed to time to clinical recovery, which basically means no longer requiring medical care within the hospital, getting off of oxygen or live discharge. In our moderate study, we're looking -- we're using the ordinal scale as well, but we're looking at the day 11 distribution along that ordinal scale. So, similar to what we did in our severe study, but looking at day 11 instead of day 14, recognizing that we're looking at a population that's less sick. So the modern study is looking at patients who are hospitalized, but they're not hypoxic, they're not requiring oxygen. The NIAID study enroll patients from starting their but all way through mechanical ventilation. So, slightly different end points for slightly different patient populations and most importantly, really looking at different questions. We're looking at treatment duration, they're looking at primary safety and efficacy with the placebo control."

            "content": "So, Geoffrey, I think just a quick update on filgo. We basically have hired all of our home office personnelj, both from a commercial medical standpoint, we've hired our sales leadership, field leadership as well and we're monitoring the situation really closely to be honest with you, because nobody really knows when this ends or what's the new normal and when not begin. And so we're just kind of monitoring that and planning for success to be honest with you to make sure that we are ready for launch for the second half of 2020 across all of the markets where we hope to get regulatory approval with the U. S., Japan, as well as Europe towards the end of this year. I think from a virtual launch standpoint, I think those are considerations that we're looking at in scenario planning and we haven't made a decision obviously that will be linked to the timing of this pandemic. Having said that, I will also tell you that a lot of our teams are doing virtual right now, many of the markets are doing remote detailing, virtual speaker programs, et cetera. And working through this environment despite obviously the opposites and patients not being open at this point in time. So, we're working through all that and looking at the different scenarios. But I think we need to know a little bit more information on the timing of this pandemic and how that plays out towards the end of this year. So HIV overall business have of course another solid quarter again this year. It's the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, and that's obviously driven by both the treatment and the PrEP business. So your question specific to Descovy. Yes, so we just hit 38%. And so, tracking exactly to our plan, right. We had said anywhere between 40% to 45% towards the end of this year. So, we feel confident with that number. Obviously, as Andy mentioned in his opening comments, there has been a little bit of a slowdown from a switch standpoint in the PrEP market for obvious reasons, because patients are not going there to the physicians offices. But it's modest thus far and we think a lot of those will be able to recoup towards the end of this year, when the pandemic does left. So, we feel still very confident that, yes, we think we're going to be in the range of that 40%, 45% that we had originally set out and maybe even, if all goes well and we can get out of this pandemic a little bit earlier, maybe a little bit north of that. So Diana, maybe to address the long acting. So Alethia, just a couple of things. We have a couple of moving pieces in the first quarter for HIV. So, I just want to -- because it's not just one piece that's making the difference here. And so the first one is obviously your seasonal inventory. So there's Q4 load off and then Q1 draw down, so that's definitely happening in Q1. Then we also had towards late March, like I'm sure many did as well, the prescription, number of days for prescription rise and inventories rise towards the end of March. We've had a bit of a mix of those two things. And specifically to government channels that you're asking the buying pattern, we do normally seem to run a little bit more of a higher mix towards government channels in the first quarter, and that obviously may negatively impacts our payer mix. So that is definitely happening in the first quarter of this year."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jacquie Ross, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you, Gigi, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. The press release, slides, and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today\u2019s call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O\u2019Day, our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier, our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey, and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we\u2019ll open up the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Christi Shaw, the Chief Executive Officer of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including those related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gilead\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations; plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections and the use of capital; and 2022 financial guidance, all of these involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the Company\u2019s underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release available on the Gilead website. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dan.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Thank you, Jacquie. And good afternoon, everybody. As we head into 2022, Gilead is coming off a year of positive clinical momentum and strong financial performance, mitigating the impact of the pandemic on some parts of our business. Higher sales of Veklury more than offset the impact of COVID-19 on HIV and HCV. Veklury continues to play a critical role in helping to treat people with COVID-19, with continued activity against the Omicron variant. The FDA recently expanded its use beyond the hospital for patients at high risk of disease progression. In addition, we just initiated a Phase 1 trial of GS-5245, a novel oral COVID19 nucleoside, that once metabolized, works in the same way as remdesivir. Our full year revenue for 2021 was 11% higher than the midpoint of our initial guidance in February of 2021. It was also an important year for our transformation to becoming a business that is based on diverse, sustainable growth. In 2021, we received 7 approvals or accelerated approvals in the U.S. and Europe, and submitted an additional 6 filings. Our approvals included: three for Trodelvy, with FDA and MAA approval in second-line triple-negative breast cancer as well as an accelerated approval from FDA for metastatic bladder cancer; two for cell therapy, with Yescarta receiving accelerated approval in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma and Tecartus receiving full approval in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia; and two expanded labels in virology, one for a pediatric label for Biktarvy in the U.S. and an expanded label for Veklury in the E.U. for adults not requiring supplemental oxygen. Our 2022 plans include a significant increase in clinical development studies across our novel oncology portfolio. We are planning at least 20 additional trials, including 7 Phase 3 trials for Trodelvy. And these include: the ASCENT-03 trial, which is evaluating Trodelvy in the front-line triple-negative breast cancer in the PDL1 negative population; the ASCENT-04, in collaboration with Merck, to evaluate Trodelvy and Keytruda in front-line triple-negative breast cancer population in the PDL1 positive population; and the EVOKE-03, which will be led by Merck, to evaluate Trodelvy and Keytruda in non-small cell lung cancer. You will also see ongoing momentum in our virology portfolio as we continue to expand our leadership in antiviral therapies. We are advancing our longer-acting HIV options with lenacapavir as the foundation and look forward to potential regulatory decisions in 2022. If approved, lenacapavir would be the only HIV treatment option administered twice yearly. In addition, we\u2019ll continue to drive progress across our broader virology portfolio, including hepatitis, COVID-19, and other emerging viruses. This is a really important time in Gilead\u2019s transformation journey. After the consistent work to execute on our strategy and expand our portfolio over the last two years, you will increasingly start to see this play out in tangible results. We\u2019re confident that Gilead has all the elements in place for a strong year and a strong decade. Johanna, and Merdad and Andy will now take you through the details of our progress and our plans. And let me hand first to Johanna to talk about our commercial performance in the fourth quarter and the full year. And I\u2019ll be back to you in the Q&A. Johanna?\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone. As you can see on slide 7, we had a strong end to the year with Q4 total product sales, excluding Veklury, of $5.8 billion, up 7% quarter-over-quarter, driven by favorable pricing and inventory dynamics. This also represented 8% growth year-over-year, driven by continued recovery in the HIV treatment market and favorable pricing dynamics. Veklury sales were higher than expected in Q4 reflecting the start of the Omicron surge, but lower than both the prior quarter and prior year, and contributing to total product sales of $7.2 billion for the quarter. Moving to slide 8, total fourth quarter Veklury sales were $1.4 billion, bringing total sales for 2021 to $5.6 billion. Gilead is proud of the role that Veklury continues to play in this pandemic. Veklury has demonstrated activity against the Omicron variant and has helped many patients with COVID-19 in the most recent surge. Although symptoms have generally been less severe, the volume of overall cases has meaningfully increased since the emergence of Omicron, and we have seen the total number of hospitalizations increase as well. While we would all prefer to put this pandemic behind us, we expect Veklury to continue to play a critical role in 2022 and beyond. As you would expect, hospitalizations remain a key indicator for in-patient Veklury sales, and we are seeing higher hospitalizations in geographies with lower vaccination adoption, including certain parts of the U.S. as well as Eastern Europe. Additionally, I\u2019m very pleased to highlight that the FDA recently approved the sNDA filing for the use of Veklury in the outpatient setting for patients at high risk of disease progression. This approval was based on data generated in the Phase 3 PINETREE study, further solidifying the credibility, importance and role of Veklury. Now Veklury will be available to help even more patients earlier and reduce risk of hospitalization for COVID-19. Next, as shown on slide 9, total HIV sales were $4.5 billion in the quarter, up 8% sequentially driven by favorable inventory and pricing dynamics as well as changes to our gross to net estimates in Q4 2021. For the full year, total HIV sales were $16.3 billion, down 4% year-over-year, primarily due to the Truvada and Atripla LOE, in addition to pandemic-related impacts and pricing dynamics. The expected impact from the LOEs, which amounted to $1.3 billion, was offset by continued Biktarvy growth. Excluding the sizeable LOE impact, HIV total product sales for the full year grew 4% compared to 2020 despite the ongoing pandemic headwinds. We now expect the Truvada and Atripla loss of exclusivity impact to be minimal going forward as the headwind dissipates starting in Q2 of this year. In HIV treatment, we continue to see signs of market recovery although the U.S. market declined 1% sequentially in Q4 following two quarters of sequential growth. On a year-over-year basis, the overall market in Q4 was up 1.5% in both the U.S. as well as the EU5, despite screening and diagnosis rates still below pre-pandemic levels. As you know, favorable dynamics play out in the fourth quarter of every year in HIV, and 2021 was no different with some year-end inventory stocking and favorable seasonal pricing as well as changes in our gross to net estimates in Q4 2021. As you think about 2022, I\u2019ll remind you of the normal HIV inventory build-up in Q4 and the New Year reset for patient copays and donut hole payments. Given these factors, along with the favorable pricing dynamics I just mentioned, we expect the sequential decline in Q1 \u201822 to be greater than Q1 \u201821. Nonetheless, we expect a strong year overall in HIV and expect continued growth in subsequent quarters. Back to Q4, Biktarvy had another record quarter with sales of $2.5 billion, up 11% sequentially and 22% year-over-year. On slide 10, you can see that Biktarvy U.S. treatment market share has increased over 5 share points in 2021, reaching 42%, which is the highest share that any complete regimen has ever achieved in this market. For the full year, Biktarvy sales were $8.6 billion, growing 19% from 2020, and Biktarvy remains the leading prescribed treatment for na\u00efve and switch patients in the U.S. as well as number 1 in na\u00efve in EU5. Descovy revenue for the fourth quarter was $473 million, up 9% quarter-over-quarter primarily as a result of favorable seasonal pricing and inventory dynamics as well as continued demand. We expect Descovy revenue to continue to be driven by PrEP as Descovy has maintained about 45% of overall PrEP market prescriptions in the U.S. We will continue to ensure access to support physician choice, and expect growing demand and market expansion to offset the impact of increased commercial contracting. Overall, while near term growth continues to be impacted by local pandemic-related social restrictions, we are encouraged by the growing PrEP market. In Q4, the overall PrEP market grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, and 31% year-over-year. Looking forward, we believe lenacapavir, our investigational longer-acting PrEP offering, could potentially catalyze the market well beyond the 25% penetration rate in PrEP that we see today. Moving to slide 11, it\u2019s clear that HCV continues to be the part of our portfolio most impacted by the pandemic. Although there was some slight quarter-over-quarter recovery in market starts in the EU5, U.S. market starts declined, resulting in flat total starts overall. While Gilead market share increased modestly on a sequential basis in both the U.S. and the EU, this was more than offset by unfavorable pricing dynamics, resulting in Q4 total sales of $393 million, down 8% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. As you can see on slide 12, our HBV and HDV franchise reported record quarterly revenues of $265 million, up 7% sequentially due to seasonal inventory and favorable pricing. The 9% year-over-year growth was primarily driven by Vemlidy demand. Total fiscal year sales for this franchise were $969 million, up 13% year-over-year. Hepcludex reported $12 million of sales in Q4 in Europe, with $37 million in 2021 sales since our acquisition in late first quarter. Hepcludex is currently available in Germany and France, in addition to a number of early access programs in countries such as Austria, Italy, and Greece. In 2022, and as part of our comprehensive commercialization plan, we expect to finalize reimbursement for launch in a number of major European markets. In the U.S., we filed a BLA in November and FDA granted priority review for accelerated approval, with a PDUFA date set for the third quarter and an Advisory Committee meeting that will be scheduled in the coming months. Moving to oncology, first with Trodelvy on slide 13, global sales were $118 million in the fourth quarter, up 17% sequentially and up 84% year-over-year compared to full Q4 2020 sales. This reflects growing adoption of the second line metastatic TNBC triple-negative breast cancer indication, which was noted as a preferred regimen in the NCCN Breast Guidelines updated in September. We are also starting to see stronger, unaided brand awareness which is resulting in continued market share growth. In second-line TNBC, Trodelvy now captures approximately 1 in 4 new starts in the U.S. We have expanded our oncology footprint globally, including tripling our U.S. headcount to further accelerate penetration of Trodelvy and prepare for our potential HR positive and HER2 negative launches. Additionally, EU approval for Trodelvy was granted in late November 2021 and we have already seen strong momentum in France and Germany since their launch. We plan to launch in a number of new countries following key reimbursement decisions this year. Now, on slide 14, on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, cell therapy Q4 sales of $239 million reflected 47% year-over-year growth, an 8% increase sequentially. For the quarter, Yescarta sales of $182 million were up 41% year-over-year driven by continued demand in relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Tecartus sales of $57 million in the quarter reflected 68% year-over-year growth based on growing global demand for relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma and early contribution from adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the U.S. As a reminder, FDA granted Tecartus approval in adult ALL in October and in just the first few months of launch, there has already been strong demand that we expect to continue in the coming quarters given the high unmet need. Full year cell therapy sales of $871 million reflected 43% year-over-year growth driven by continued LBCL and MCL demand globally as well as the new launches. The strong growth we\u2019ve seen with these recent launches reinforces our belief that cell therapy adoption will continue its positive momentum as more physicians understand the benefits for appropriate patients and therefore increase referral rates to treatment centers. Merdad will elaborate later, so I\u2019ll just quickly mention the impressive data Kite presented at ASH in December, 43% overall survival rate after five years in third line LBCL patients. The Yescarta data at ASH not only highlighted the long-term real-world safety and efficacy profile in third line LBCL, but also in earlier lines of therapy. For ZUMA-7 data in second-line LBCL, FDA has set a PDUFA date of April 1st when we hope Yescarta will be granted approval. In the meantime, the Kite team is ramping up manufacturing capacity to meet the anticipated demand. Kite expects the new Maryland facility to begin commercial operations by Q2. Combined with the Amsterdam and El Segundo facilities, we expect to increase operational capacity by up to 50% by the end of this year. Christi is here with the team and available to take questions on cell therapy during our Q&A. In closing, our oncology sales were $1.25 billion in 2021 and we expect robust growth in the coming years. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Merdad for pipeline updates.\nMerdad Parsey: Thanks, Johanna. Good afternoon, everyone. Building on what both Johanna and Dan have said, the Gilead team rounded out a very strong 2021 with further progress across our portfolio. In 2021 alone, we began enrolling patients in 13 oncology, 13 virology, and 4 inflammation trials, and we have recently shared the initial details of the ambitious development programs we are targeting for 2022. As we look forward, we are confident that we have the foundation to continue to build a robust, diverse portfolio across our three focus therapeutic areas. First, on slide 16, Veklury continues to play a vital role in the fight against COVID-19. Veklury was the first approved treatment for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We have received expanded indication labels in the U.S. and EU. In December, the European Commission approved a variation to the Conditional Marketing Authorization for Veklury for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults not on supplemental oxygen. And last month, based on data from the Phase 3 PINETREE study, the FDA expanded the approval of Veklury to include non-hospitalized patients at high risk for COVID-19 disease progression. These expanded indications speak to the activity of Veklury against the coronavirus variants we have seen so far, including Omicron. We believe there will continue to be a need for Veklury delivered intravenously, especially for higher risk patients. The potential for continued COVID-19 variants and infections highlight the need for more convenient oral formulations to expand the options for outpatients. As such, we have just initiated a Phase 1 trial of GS-5245, a novel oral COVID-19 nucleoside, that once metabolized, works in the same way as remdesivir. Pending data, the evolving pandemic landscape, and discussions with regulatory agencies, we are hoping to initiate a registrational trial before the end of the year. Moving to HIV on slide 17, we shared an overview of some of our long-acting development activities a few weeks ago, to highlight the diversity of our portfolio and how it targets the entire HIV life cycle. We continue to believe that our investigational agent lenacapavir is a unique and foundational asset, given its potential for extended dosing, in addition to the compelling efficacy and safety profile highlighted in the CAPELLA and CALIBRATE studies. Next, on slide 18, you can see our current clinical efforts with long-acting HIV therapeutics. As previously announced, the Phase 2 study evaluating the oral combination of lenacapavir with Merck\u2019s islatravir is on partial clinical hold, and Merck remains in discussions with FDA on next steps islatravir. In the meantime, we at Gilead continue to develop a number of other potential partner agents for lenacapavir in HIV treatment and look forward to sharing some more detail on these programs at our Virology Deep Dive later this month. We remain confident and excited about lenacapavir\u2019s future potential to deliver options for people living with HIV or those who could benefit from PrEP. I want to be very clear that the recent clinical hold for the lenacapavir trials, which the FDA initiated in December, is not associated with the lenacapavir molecule itself. Rather, the hold reflects concern about the compatibility of certain vials with the lenacapavir solution. We continue to work with the FDA to remediate the concern and to agree on a path to resume these trials. We are hopeful this can be achieved quickly. As such, we continue to expect an FDA decision for lenacapavir in heavily treatment experienced individuals in the first half of 2022. If successful, lenacapavir will become the first available six-month, long-acting subcutaneous injection for the treatment of HIV. Next, moving to Trodelvy on slide 18, I\u2019m pleased to confirm that we now expect to share both top-line progression-free survival data as well as the first planned interim analysis of overall survival from TROPiCS-02 in March. There\u2019s been a convergence of events for PFS and OS such that we will be able to conduct and report a single analysis of these outcomes rather than have two analyses separated by a short interval. Gilead remains blinded to the data, and we are excited to be able to share this more complete view later this quarter. We are targeting an sBLA filing in the second half of 2022, depending, of course, on the readout. If the data are positive, we believe that Trodelvy could represent a very important treatment option for HR+/HER2- patients who are hormone refractory and have very limited options. Reflecting our confidence in Trodelvy overall, we are expanding the number of clinical programs in 2022 to evaluate effectiveness in breast, lung and bladder cancers, with plans to initiate study start-up activities for at least 7 Phase 3 trials. Three of these are expected to enroll their first patients in 2022, including two in front line metastatic TNBC and another in front-line non-small cell lung cancer study that will be led by Merck. Going forward, we will separately disclose trial start up activities versus FPI milestones. Additionally, in the first half of this year, we plan to add a combination of Trodelvy with other Gilead portfolio assets as a study or an additional cohort in an existing study. We look forward to sharing more details at our upcoming Oncology Deep Dive in April. This is another example of the versatility and tremendous potential that Trodelvy, along with the growing oncology portfolio, can generate. Next slide, onto magrolimab. Early last week, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold pausing enrollment and screening in trials and cohorts in the U.S. evaluating magrolimab in combination with azacitidine following review of a preliminary data set suggesting an apparent imbalance in investigator reported SUSARs, or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, between treatment groups in our ongoing Phase 3 trial in high-risk MDS. A subsequent partial clinical hold has been placed on the Phase 2 multiple myeloma study and the fully enrolled Phase 2 DLBCL study. Importantly, patients currently enrolled in our magrolimab studies can continue treatment and our compassionate use programs remain open. We are working with FDA to take a comprehensive look at the safety data, and we will share the outcome as quickly as we can. In the meantime, we remain committed to the magrolimab development program and believe that it has the potential to address an important unmet medical need in these seriously ill patients. As you know, the patients in our ENHANCE Phase 3 trial have a very high unmet need, with a median overall survival of only 1 to 3 years on the current standard of care. Separate and prior to the partial clinical hold, our Phase 1b single arm study in higher risk MDS no longer has a viable path to submission based on regulatory feedback. As such, we will remain focused on our Phase 3 ENHANCE study and look forward to sharing the 1b data at an upcoming scientific meeting. Next, moving to cell therapy on slide 21, on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, I will share a brief update on the impressive data Kite presented at ASH last December. First, as you may recall, in 2020 we shared that Yescarta had a four-year overall survival rate of 44% in third-line LBCL patients. At ASH in December, we presented five-year data from ZUMA-1 in third-line LBCL patients showing Yescarta demonstrated a remarkable and durable 43% overall survival rate, stable since our four-year update. Additionally, 92% of the patients who remained alive at five years have not needed any additional cancer treatment since their one-time infusion of Yescarta. It\u2019s truly inspiring to see this type of durability for CAR T cell therapies. As announced yesterday, the FDA approved a label update for Yescarta to include use of prophylactic corticosteroids across all approved indications. Adding prophylactic steroid use can improve the management of certain side effects without compromising the activity of Yescarta. For example, the FDA label now shows no grade 3 or greater cytokine release syndrome events occurred using the Cohort 6 protocol, as compared to 13% in the original label. This label update complements data published in 2021 showing 68% of patients had no CRS or neurologic events within 72 hours of Yescarta infusion. As we look to earlier lines of treatment, the landmark ZUMA-7 trial evaluating Yescarta in second-line relapsed/refractory LBCL demonstrated a greater than 4-fold increase in median event free survival, or EFS, compared to standard of care through two years of follow-up. As you can see on the slide, the EFS curve for Yescarta is compelling. The sBLA was filed last quarter and we expect an FDA decision by April of this year. In terms of the first-line LBCL data, Yescarta demonstrated 89% overall response rate in high-risk patients, and 78% complete response with a median follow-up of 15.9 months. Given these encouraging data, the Kite team is in discussions with regulatory authorities on a potential path forward in front line LBCL. And finally, on slide 22, we highlight key 2022 catalysts across the portfolio, many of which I have just mentioned. I\u2019d also like to take a moment to highlight the three Arcus milestones in second half of this year. Last quarter, Gilead opted in to the three Arcus programs, which added four assets to our portfolio: domvanalimab, an Fc silent anti-TIGIT antibody; AB308, an Fc active anti-TIGIT antibody; etrumadenant, an adenosine receptor antagonist; and quemliclustat, a small molecule CD73 inhibitor. Together with Arcus, we expect to share ARC-7 Phase 2 PFS data in the second half of 2022, which will include data for the zimberelimab monotherapy, zim and dom doublet, as well as the zim, dom and etruma triplet arm. We look forward to sharing data when available and are very excited to collaborate more closely with Arcus to accelerate future development plans. On slide 23, you can see that Gilead\u2019s portfolio now encompasses 55 clinical stage programs, nearly doubling since 2019. Given the exciting potential of our portfolio across virology, oncology, and even early stage inflammation assets, this is just the beginning. Our teams are committed to advancing the most promising programs that will help transform patient outcomes, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you over the coming quarters and years. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Andy.\nAndrew Dickinson: Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. It was a strong close to 2021, driven primarily by strong HIV and Veklury revenue in the fourth quarter. For the full year, and excluding the impact of the LOEs, HIV grew 4% year-over-year, driven by the continued outperformance of Biktarvy, which achieved record U.S. market share of 42%, and sales of $8.6 billion, up 19% from 2020. Oncology was another highlight from both a pipeline and revenue perspective, with full year cell therapy sales of $871 million growing 43% from 2020, and Trodelvy sales of $380 million in its first full year. By 2030, we anticipate our oncology franchise will represent at least a third of our total revenue. Before I get into the normal P&L review and 2022 guidance, I want to address the EPS results for this quarter upfront. Slide 25 highlights two sizeable expenses that occurred after we gave our last guidance in October. First, and subsequent to the exercise of Gilead\u2019s opt-in to four Arcus assets in December, our fourth quarter results reflect a net charge of $625 million, recorded in R&D. This charge reflects our $725 million option payment recognized in Q4 less $100 million that was previously accrued. This impacted our EPS by about $0.38 in Q4 and for the full year. Second, and as part of a legal settlement with ViiV and related parties, we have agreed to make a one-time $1.25 billion payment, in addition to an ongoing 3% royalty for future sales of Biktarvy and the bictegravir component of bictegravir-containing products in the United States. This royalty extends until October 5 of 2027. The $1.25 billion payment is recorded in our fourth quarter results and reflected in our cost of goods sold. This charge constituted an approximately 17% impact to gross margin in the fourth quarter, and it impacted our EPS by $0.80 for Q4 2021 and the full year. Going forward, we expect the impact of this new royalty to be approximately 1% on our gross margin, starting in the first quarter of 2022. Excluding these items, and their combined $1.18 impact, our full year non-GAAP EPS would have exceeded the guidance range that we set back in October, helped by stronger than expected Veklury sales. Moving back to our quarterly review on slide 26, fourth quarter revenue in our base business included HIV product sales growth of 7% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Veklury sales were higher than expected due to start of the Omicron surge. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 70.5%, impacted by the legal settlement that I referenced earlier, and non-GAAP R&D was impacted by the Arcus opt-in, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 per share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32.2%, reflecting tax expense related to uncertain tax positions, an increase in valuation allowance, as well as the impact of discrete tax benefits related to legal settlements with tax authorities in 2020 that did not recur this year. For the full year, on slide 27, total product sales of $27 billion grew 11% driven by Veklury. Excluding Veklury, total product sales were roughly flat at $21.4 billion as growth in Biktarvy and oncology offset the $1.3 billion impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs in the United States. I touched on the main P&L impacts in the fourth quarter discussion, but will highlight that our non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2021 was 20.4%, despite the higher effective tax rate in the fourth quarter. Moving now to slide 28. Our 2022 guidance assumes that the recent Omicron surge represents the only major COVID-19 wave for 2022, and that our HIV business will continue to recover from the pandemic. With that in mind, we expect Product Sales in the range of $23.8 billion to $24.3 billion. Excluding Veklury, we expect product sales in the range of $21.8 billion to $22.3 billion, representing growth of 2% to 4% for our base business year-over-year. Relative to Q1, I\u2019ll remind you to expect HIV revenue to decline sequentially. This is a normal dynamic for HIV due to inventory and seasonal pricing impacts, and you\u2019ll recall last year HIV revenue declined 14% sequentially in Q1 \u201821 from Q4 of 2020. For Q122, we expect a larger sequential decline, given the favorable Q4 \u201821 changes to gross to net estimates that Johanna mentioned earlier. Nonetheless, we expect a strong year overall for our HIV business and continued growth in the subsequent quarters. Looking beyond Q1, we expect the impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs will be largely behind us starting in Q2, and we look forward to accelerating growth in our HIV business during the remainder of the year. For the full year 2022, we expect Veklury sales of approximately $2 billion. This assumes, as I previously indicated, that Omicron will represent the only major surge for the year, with Veklury revenue heavily weighted in the first quarter. That said, the pandemic continues to be dynamic, and we will update you on our Veklury expectations on a quarterly basis, consistent with our recent practice. Moving to the rest of the P&L. We expect our non-GAAP product gross margin to be approximately 85% to 86%, consistent with our historic guidance and allowing for the 3% royalty associated with the legal settlement. For non-GAAP operating expenses, we expect R&D to decrease by a mid-single digit percentage compared to 2021 levels. This decline is driven by the net $625 million charge related to the Arcus opt-in in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding this, we expect full year R&D expense to increase by a mid-to-high single digit percentage compared to 2021 levels. We expect SG&A to be approximately flat on a dollar basis compared to 2021. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20% this year. Finally, we expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $6.20 and $6.70 for the full-year, and GAAP diluted EPS to be between $4.70 and $5.20. On capital allocation, our priorities have not changed. We continued to invest in our business while, at the same time, we returned over $4 billion in 2021 to our shareholders, through dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we repaid $4.75 billion of debt in 2021. For 2022, we plan to repay $1.5 billion of debt, of which, we repaid $500 million this morning. With that, I will invite the operator to begin the Q&A. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: Dan or Andy, maybe a higher level strategic question. I wanted to ask about your comments regarding long-term oncology sales. And the question is, are you comfortable with the aggregate assets in the portfolio? Do you think you\u2019ll need to be more aggressive on BD either to drive more near-term growth or looking longer term to have higher impact assets?\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Jeff. Thanks for the question and teaming. I\u2019ll start and then hand it over to Andy. So, yes, I mean, the guide that we gave at JP Morgan was that we are confident in our ability to grow and to also have oncology by 2030 be at least a third of our overall revenue on top of a solid HIV business and virology business overall. I think, the answer to the question, Geoff, is we believe we have everything in-house to be able to fulfill on that commitment today. I mean, the number of options that we have with Trodelvy, with magrolimab, with the Arcus assets and with Cell Therapy from an oncology base provides tremendous opportunity for us to look alone and in combination of that portfolio in the coming years. And that specifically leads to the more than 30 clinical trials we have ongoing right now in our oncology portfolio. And our guide that this year will start at least another 20 in the oncology space. So really, that\u2019s the armamentarium behind our commitment and our growth. Of course, we\u2019ll continue to be opportunistic around business development and look for supplemental options out there that can complement this portfolio as a course of normal business as any healthy company should. Having said that, we really do have enough in-house to be able to fill up on that commitment. So, with that, Andy, I may have stolen all your thunder, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have some additional perspectives.\nAndrew Dickinson: Yes. Geoff, thank you for the question. I think it\u2019s an important question, especially in the context of the magrolimab clinical hold that maybe underpinning the question specifically. But the answer is relatively simple. We have a very strong set of assets already. The guidance that we provided at JP Morgan does not actually include all of the assets or all the indications for all the assets. So, there\u2019s a lot of ways for us to get there. We have complete confidence in where we\u2019re going, and we don\u2019t expect to change our BD strategy as a result of any of the recent developments. We\u2019re actually really excited about where we are. And there\u2019s a lot of upside to that of other assets, whether it\u2019s some of the earlier Arcus assets or the Tizona or Pionyr assets, as examples, provide additional options for patients. So, when you talk about high-impact assets, I would just summarize by saying, we already think that we have a great portfolio of high-impact assets in oncology, we\u2019re incredibly pleased with what we\u2019ve put together and nothing that\u2019s happened recently has changed that in any way. So, thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal: Maybe a question for Merdad. So, in the light of new data that are emerging in HR positive and HER2-negative breast cancer, do you have any updated thoughts on how to think about overall survival in the treatment and control arms for TROPiCS-02 vis-\u00e0-vis the expectation or the assumptions in clinical trials, which I think, if I\u2019m not mistaken, 12 months for the control and 16.5 months for the treatment? So, how should we think about OS? Thank you.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Mohit. Directly over to you, Merdad.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes. Thanks, Mohit. It\u2019s a great question. And I think as I mentioned in my call, I think we\u2019re excited that we\u2019re going to be able to share the first interim analysis from the OS as well when we do the readout here for the PFS. So, I do think we\u2019ll look at both at the same time. You\u2019re absolutely right that there are developments in the HR-positive space, but I continue to believe, and I think that the impact on both PFS -- on PFS in particular here, but also OS continues to be, I think, if we see something in the ballpark of what you just described, we\u2019re confident that that remains incredibly clinically relevant for people suffering with HR-positive HER2-negative. It is, as you state, an increasingly competitive area, but we do think that that remains a key milestone for patients if we can achieve that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan.\nCory Kasimov: I wanted to follow up as well on the TROPiCS-02 study. And maybe, Merdad, can you talk about how you see the potential significance of this convergence of events that you alluded to when thinking about both progression-free survival and overall survival? Did you see any implications from this, or is this kind of moving along the lines as you would have expected it to?\nMerdad Parsey: Yes. Great question, and thanks for asking it. I think I\u2019m very reassured I would not read anything into this other than the fact that we\u2019ve been, as you can imagine, keeping track of the PFS events and the OS events all along. And we\u2019ve now gotten to the point where those OS events have occurred in a time frame that allows us to look at both of these events at the same time. I don\u2019t think it really says anything about -- I think what you\u2019re getting at is does it have any implications for the underlying positive or negative or anything like that. And I really don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way to interpret that right now. It would be pure speculation to think that there\u2019s some underlying driver of bringing those endpoints together. And actually, it\u2019s not that unexpected. It\u2019s a little bit closer than we thought it would be, but not by that much. So, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. I\u2019m just excited we\u2019ll be able to do it. It will be a more robust look. And I think as I\u2019ve said before, we think the regulators are going to want to see those robust looks at the OS to help them with sort of, in a sense, supporting the PFS endpoint.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets.\nBrian Abrahams: I wanted to better understand the potential signals from magrolimab. I think you guys have said that you haven\u2019t observed any clear AE trend. I was curious, where is the disconnect versus what the FDA and investigator concerns are here? And maybe talk a little bit about the potential path to resolution, what additional safety data would be needed and your level of confidence you will reach a resolution? Thanks.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: That\u2019s great. Thanks, Brian.\nMerdad Parsey: Thanks, Cory. Yes. So look, I think the way to think about it is some of -- there have been a couple of events that the agency wants to make sure that they have a chance to look at the overall safety profile. I remain blinded to the safety data. So, what is going on is we are gathering the safety data, and we\u2019re going to share it with the FDA and with the data monitoring committee. I can tell you that we feel that these are temporary challenges right now and we\u2019re going to work through resolving it as quickly as possible. I don\u2019t think these challenges really shake our confidence for the portfolio overall and our overall strategy hasn\u2019t changed. We\u2019re really committed to the macro development program, and we think that it really continues to have the potential to really address -- an important unmet medical need. The only thing I\u2019d add is, remember, these are very generally pretty sick patients. And with that underlying illness, I think it\u2019s appropriate to be cautious to make sure that we\u2019re striking the right balance as we go forward. But we\u2019ll work through it by looking at the overall safety at the overall safety profile, Brian, and make sure that we are able to resolve those issues with the FDA.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: And Brian, we\u2019ll keep you informed as that evolves. We have obviously a lot of patients on magrolimab that continue to be served by magrolimab. So, we have a sense of urgency in working with the agency around this.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs.\nSalveen Richter: You referred to the Arcus portfolio. Can you just comment on what you\u2019re most excited about outside of TIGIT and when you might start the triplet study?\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Sure. Merdad, why don\u2019t you start on that?\nMerdad Parsey: Sure. I think in addition to the TIGIT asset, as you know, the adenosine portfolio, if you will, the 2 molecules, the 2 inhibitors of adenosine, both in terms of the synthesis inhibitor, CD73, as well as the receptor blocker are really interesting to us. They\u2019re early programs, but we think that there is a real potential for those assets to provide significant upside to treatment, both in terms of where -- in lung cancer, where we think there\u2019s some -- the trial that\u2019s ongoing that is looking at the addition of adenosine inhibition to TIGIT plus PD-1 as well as in some of the indications that Arcus is evaluating with monotherapy in particular, pancreatic cancer. So, I think for us, there are a number of opportunities there and the broad potential of adenosine inhibitors to add on to immuno-oncology in general and TIGIT plus PD-1 in particular really strike us is a really great opportunity that hopefully as the data mature, we\u2019ll be able to share more and really underpin the optimism we have around where those programs are headed.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Right. And I think there was a question around when to start the...\nMerdad Parsey: And then the triplet study, yes, we\u2019ll -- we haven\u2019t announced that yet. We need to work through some details. Thanks for reminding me, Dan. We\u2019re working through some approach. Really, the question here for us is how to go from the doublet, where we\u2019re really looking at a TIGIT inhibitor being an unapproved agent, right, and then potentially bringing in a second unapproved agent. So we have to work through in a sense, the regulatory complications of how we have to sequence and stage those studies to allow us to assess the contribution of components such that we can move forward aggressively. So, we\u2019re working really closely with our adenosine colleague -- our adenosine colleagues, our Arcus colleagues, and we\u2019ll work through the regulatory pathways to make sure that we can get to a robust base Phase 3 trials with those. So, as we do so, we\u2019ll certainly share the timing in the pathway.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: And Salveen, the only thing I\u2019d add on top of Merdad\u2019s eloquent response is the potential to combine this attractive portfolio for markets with other medicines that we have within Gilead, including Trodelvy and possibly magrolimab and others, so his combination of having access to a PD-1 2 TIGIT compounds to adenosine combined with Trodelvy provides a rich opportunity to look at rational-based combinations. And we\u2019ll be getting more into that as we do a deeper dive in oncology as a starting point in April. And then obviously, throughout the year, we\u2019ll continue to update you on that. And it\u2019s one of the major reasons why opting in early was important to us because we can work really fluidly now across a very rich portfolio. And with the additional expertise and colleagues from Arcus, it really expands all of our potential and clinical science and beyond.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies.\nMichael Yee: Maybe back to Merdad on Trodelvy, appreciating that I know there\u2019s a lot of focus on this interim OS. I would love to give you the opportunity to perhaps frame expectations at an interim. Interims have different connotations and there\u2019s different interims at different percent of events that have accrued. So, could you just explain what percent of events this interim is based on? Do you actually expect to hit stat significant, or do you just expecting a trend of a few months? Maybe just talk to that a bit, because I think there\u2019s different implications of just an interim.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Yes. Thanks, Michael. And maybe just a suggestion, as you answer, Michael\u2019s specific question, it might be helpful for the whole audience to hear again kind of your overall view of the potential success of this indication.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes. Michael, it\u2019s a great question. And I think, thank you for asking it. So, as a reminder, I think from a PFS standpoint, the primary endpoint of the study, we believe we\u2019re really well powered to detect a difference there. And as I\u2019ll remind folks, we did redesign the study a year ago in order to power the study adequately for OS as well. I would -- I think as excited as I am that we will be able to report out that first interim analysis, Michael, you\u2019re absolutely right on that. I would not expect statistical significance at this first interim because it is relatively early in the time frame that we\u2019re seeing. So, my expectation is that again, pending a positive outcome that we are well powered to see a PFS improvement at a statistically significant level. And the OS will be supportive data at that point that will give us directionality as to where we\u2019re headed. And then hopefully, subsequent to that as the events accrue, we\u2019ll see where we\u2019re headed with OS and down the road. It\u2019s a great question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein.\nRonny Gal: Switching over to talk a little bit about Yescarta. Can you tell us if there\u2019s already impact, the use of Yescarta in second line, or is it still ahead of us? And you\u2019ve mentioned you\u2019re increasing your capacity by 50%. Are you currently capacity-constrained or demand-constrained? Essentially, will all that demand be used if it comes on line?\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Yes. Thanks, Ronny. And as I turn it over to Christi, let me just say how many patients we\u2019ve been able to impact with cell therapy in 2021, and that being just the beginning, I think, of our promise for the future. We certainly invested in the manufacturing capacity to anticipate demand and success in the second-line, and Christi can go into the details with you. Christi, over to you.\nChristi Shaw: Thanks, Dan. Thanks for the question. Yes, we\u2019re very excited about not only the second-line, which is the most important to help the most patients, but the continued success of third line plus with the five-year data that was presented at ASH where year four, you saw 43% of patients still alive, and at -- 44% of the patients still on life of four years and 43% at five years, which I think you heard Merdad say. So, based on those as well as new indications coming out, we\u2019re really seeing an increase in demand. Our capacity, we\u2019re well positioned. We have the El Segundo manufacturing site here in California. Amsterdam was approved during COVID and with up to its capacity by the end of last year. And now, we have the Maryland site, which will be going online in the first half of this year where you\u2019ll see our automation as well. So, not only increasing capacity, but also the ability to reduce costs. So, things are coming along nicely in terms of our ability to deliver, and we still have that reliability of 97% success when we give the cells back, which is so critically important to patients. So, not a capacity issue. We had a transparency, a couple of issues last year where we had a scheduling issue where physicians were asking for the exact same slot all at the same time. And we quickly addressed that and no longer have that concern. So, we\u2019re doing well and preparing for, hopefully, what we\u2019ll see is helping a lot more patients stay live a lot longer.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Thanks so much, Christi. And overall, Ronny, we\u2019re expecting about a 50% increase in capacity over the course of 2022, so continued investment there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow from UBS.\nColin Bristow: On magrolimab, maybe could you explain why the multiple myeloma and DLBCL trials were also on hold given they\u2019re not in combination with aza? And then, just somewhat related to that, the $1.50 in acquisition-related expenses in the \u201822 guide, is there any component of that, that\u2019s related to the Forty Seven acquisition.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Great. So I\u2019ll have Andy answer the second. Maybe you want to touch base on the first, Merdad, also telling about the stage of those 2 trials.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes, it\u2019s really important to -- I think this may have not been entirely clear. First of all, I think -- look, I think whenever there\u2019s a safety question, the agency is going to err on the side of being cautious. And so we\u2019ll work through with them on how to go forward. And I agree in those studies, we are not combining with azacitidine. So again, I think as we share the data and the analysis with the agency, hopefully, we can come to resolution sooner than later. And it\u2019s important to note that for the multiple myeloma study, we actually hadn\u2019t really started enrolling patients at that point. So I think that was one consideration. And by contrast for the DLBCL study, that is completely enrolled. So, the partial hold there actually doesn\u2019t have much of a practical impact on that study because we\u2019re going to continue dosing the patients who are already enrolled in that study. So, I think -- remember that the way it works is maybe the context here, the holds are placed on an IND, not on a study-by-study basis, generally. So, this was a hold to the IND. And so, that\u2019s sort of the context to think about it. I\u2019ll hand it off to Andy to answer the second part of the question.\nAndrew Dickinson: I\u2019m not sure that I fully understood the question, but what I can tell you is none of the -- none of the updates that we provided in terms of the onetime fourth quarter expenses nor none of our 2022 guidance has anything to do with expenses. So you and I can maybe talk separately to understand what your question is specifically, but there\u2019s nothing related to or the Forty Seven acquisition that was either part of our fourth quarter update, year-end update or part of the 2022 guide specifically.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Colin. Happy to take that up separately, too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hartaj Singh from Oppenheimer.\nHartaj Singh: This is just a question on Veklury. You\u2019re starting to get a pretty consistent franchise there. I mean, unfortunately, COVID-19 is still out there. Various experts have indicated and even some of the companies we cover, we\u2019re going from a pandemic to an endemic kind of state over this year into next year. How do we -- how do you think of Veklury going forward? I know it\u2019s difficult to give guidance there, but you\u2019ve got a year and a half worth of data underneath your belt. How are you thinking of hospitalizations going forward, whether that\u2019s through breakthrough infections, or do you see as unvaccinated individuals get less and less that hospitalization will concomitantly decrease? Any thoughts there? And then, assuming the oral program gets approved, how do you see remdesivir IV and then the oral option working together going forward? And again, thanks for the questions, and a really nice quarter.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Hartaj. So, I think Johanna can start with some of the pandemic -- endemic and then Merdad could also comment a little bit on the forward portfolio. But please, Johanna, over to you.\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Hartaj, for the question. Basically, what we\u2019ve seen since the very beginning is how that Veklury sales truly track to the hospitalizations. And we\u2019ve seen that most recently again with the Omicron surge. What we did see as well is the fact that -- despite the fact that Omicron seemed to may be less severe impact, unfortunately, the number of cases were much greater and therefore just the pure absolute numbers of hospitalizations went up. And so, we\u2019ve tracked every single time pretty much in line, parallel to the hospitalization rates. And we assume that will continue. We do think the hospitalizations will get impacted by some of the oral compounds, even some of the outpatient use of Veklury, but also neutralizing antibodies as well as the oral treatments as well like the PI from Pfizer. And so, we do think that will decrease hospitalizations over time. The one thing we had assumed maybe about a year ago is we really thought the vaccination rates would continue to rise and they didn\u2019t. They basically stabilize at around the 60%, 65% rate. And of course, there are variances across the country. So, what we\u2019ve seen is the use of different treatments as well as the vaccinations -- the vaccination rates are really dictating a little bit kind of the hospitalizations and therefore, the Veklury usage. And yet again, in the December, January time frame, we\u2019ve really seen Veklury play a critical role here for these hospitalizations, also having to do with the fact that many of the other previous agents that were on the market were no longer effective against the Omicron variant. And we haven\u2019t seen any of that. We\u2019ve seen very strong efficacy with Veklury, which has also helped that. I think most recently, the outpatient data that\u2019s just come out in addition to the indication really plays a critical role when there are surges and hospitals are overcapacity, so that they really can look at outpatient setting with Veklury, and we think that will just kind of play hand in hand. And I would propose, as I turn it over to Merdad to address the oral piece of the puzzle, I actually think you need both. I think you need the oral setting, so more players in the oral setting is critical and you still need hospitalizations because, unfortunately, as this -- if it does become endemic, I do think you\u2019ll see a steady rate of hospitalizations as we go through, and that\u2019s where Veklury plays a critical role. Merdad?\nMerdad Parsey: Yes. Thanks. And I guess, I\u2019d make two points. The first is, is very early days with the oral program. And so, I would keep that in mind. We just started Phase 1. So, a lot of things can happen. And so I would just keep that in mind. Obviously, if things go well, we\u2019ll move as aggressively as possible. And I agree with Johanna. I think that there will always be a role for both oral and IV therapies. There will be a -- what we\u2019re seeing now, I think, in terms of how folks are approaching it is that as availability of oral therapies becomes broader, they\u2019re used relatively early in the course of disease. Many people may progress and/or not get treated early enough and end up in the hospital. And at that point, I think that\u2019s where that hospitalized or carry hospitalization more severe disease is where the role of IV therapies is going to come in, Veklury in particular is going to come in. So, I have too much to add to what Johanna said, but I do think there\u2019ll be a role for both in the long run.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Hartaj, just to complement what Johanna and Merdad said, I think we clearly see that as this becomes endemic that there\u2019ll be potentially a need for multiple mechanisms in the outpatient setting. So, that\u2019s one of the reasons why approaching it from a preliminary standpoint as well as to a protease standpoint, we think could make sense over the long term for resistance patterns. And the last thing I\u2019ll say is I think what we\u2019ve seen this, whether it\u2019s pandemic or endemic, remdesivir is going to firmly trench now as a standard of care in the hospital setting. And so, as goes hospitalization, so will go remdesivir over time, and we think that\u2019s going to be an important part of our ongoing business and our benefit to patients.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays.\nCarter Gould: I wanted to come back to Trodelvy but a little bit more from the commercial and strategic angle and wanted to -- just sort of the decision to triple the sales force at this point, ahead of TROPiCS-02, is that decision dependent upon positive data from TROPiCS-02, or could that potentially be revisited, depending on that outcome? And then, specifically around sort of what you\u2019re seeing in -- with the sales, it seems like the growth on an absolute basis quarter-on-quarter does seem to be sort of slowing a bit. Can you maybe just talk about how the real-world duration of use has maybe evolved, and if that\u2019s sort of in line with what you saw in the studies -- in the pivotal studies? Thank you.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Carter. Right over to Johanna, please.\nJohanna Mercier: Sure, Carter. Thanks for the question. Just a couple of things. One is the footprint, the geographic footprint that we\u2019ve just initiated and that ramp-up and the tripling. It has really maybe three objectives. One is to further support our initial launches of both metastatic TNBC triple-negative breast cancer as well as bladder. So, that\u2019s definitely number one, and that is here and now. the potential to support a potential indication in HR positive, which is what you were referring to. And the third one is also setting up for the future success of our total oncology portfolio. So, assuming positive data, of course, is what we\u2019ve decided to go for, but having said that, even if that didn\u2019t play out, this is the right team for the future for Gilead Oncology. So that was the first part of your question. The second part of your question about the growth slowing, I actually think we\u2019re quite pleased, actually, as we got into Q4, what we\u2019ve seen is the share really drive up post NCCN breast guidelines update in September. And so, we had good data point of share. The last data point we have is October, and that\u2019s the 1 in 4 that you heard me talk about earlier. And so, that\u2019s doubling from where we were in April. So, we were at about half of that share in second line. And now we\u2019re at about 24%, 25% share in second line. So, a real nice growth on that front and definitely more to come. I think there\u2019s an incredible opportunity for Trodelvy in this patient setting, especially with the high unmet medical need and the incredible OS data that we have with Trodelvy. So more to come on that.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Terrific. Thank you so much, Carter. We can take one last question, everybody. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Harrison: Just one clarification and one question. So, for Merdad, can you just clarify, it was unclear to me from your comments whether the FDA had asked for the OS data, and that\u2019s why you were including this interim now for the filing or if that had been your plan all along. So, if you could just clarify that would be great. And then, second, any comments you can make specifically around the stocking tailwind as well as the gross to net tailwind that you have from HIV in the fourth quarter? Thanks.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Thanks a lot, Matthew. We\u2019ll go to Merdad and then Johanna.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes, very quickly. I think as I mentioned, we did upsize the study last year for OS because we\u2019ve always believed, especially in HR-positive that having OS data are going to be important to support a file. It\u2019s not the primary endpoint, and we think it\u2019s going to be important supportive data to go. So, that didn\u2019t really have much to do with this confluence of events here. It\u2019s a fortuitous event in terms of timing here that will support our data. So hopefully, that answers...\nDaniel O\u2019Day: The FDA did not ask for it.\nMerdad Parsey: The FDA didn\u2019t specifically ask us for it. No. It\u2019s always -- we\u2019re always going to take a look at OS with the first PFS data cut at this point in order -- instead of doing a look and then an interim, we\u2019re just going to do the PFS and the interim at the same time.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Matthew. Johanna?\nJohanna Mercier: And Matthew, the second part of your question around the Q4 piece of the puzzle. So, as you well know, right, as you go into Q4, you usually have a bit of a seasonal inventory build in the subchannel play. And then, of course, that bleeds out in Q1. So, that\u2019s one piece of the puzzle. In Q1, the other difference is, of course, you increased your co-pay support, your donut hole coverage and so all those pieces and your payer mix kind of changes in your first quarter. Having said that, in addition to that, there was some favorability in Q4 of 2021 from a gross-to-net standpoint, which will then create an even bigger kind of decline in Q1, and that\u2019s what we were referring to. So, hopefully, that helps a little bit. It\u2019s a onetime thing in Q4. And it\u2019s just more around the comparison versus Q1 over Q4 as we get through the first quarter, and that\u2019s what I was trying to signal.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Great, Matthew. And I just want to, before I turn it over to Jacquie, thank all of you for joining from our perspective. We are really excited about the build that we\u2019ve had at Gilead over the past two years and the team and the people that we have on board. We\u2019ve got a lot to do this year, and we\u2019re really teed up for a good strong year and a strong decade ahead with this portfolio. With that, Jacquie, over to you, please.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you, Dan, and thanks to our operator, Gigi, for your help today, and indeed to all of you for joining us. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and hope that you can join us for our Virology Deep Dive scheduled for Thursday, the 17th of February. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Merdad Parsey",
            "content": "Thanks, Johanna. Good afternoon, everyone. Building on what both Johanna and Dan have said, the Gilead team rounded out a very strong 2021 with further progress across our portfolio. In 2021 alone, we began enrolling patients in 13 oncology, 13 virology, and 4 inflammation trials, and we have recently shared the initial details of the ambitious development programs we are targeting for 2022. As we look forward, we are confident that we have the foundation to continue to build a robust, diverse portfolio across our three focus therapeutic areas. First, on slide 16, Veklury continues to play a vital role in the fight against COVID-19. Veklury was the first approved treatment for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We have received expanded indication labels in the U.S. and EU. In December, the European Commission approved a variation to the Conditional Marketing Authorization for Veklury for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults not on supplemental oxygen. And last month, based on data from the Phase 3 PINETREE study, the FDA expanded the approval of Veklury to include non-hospitalized patients at high risk for COVID-19 disease progression. These expanded indications speak to the activity of Veklury against the coronavirus variants we have seen so far, including Omicron. We believe there will continue to be a need for Veklury delivered intravenously, especially for higher risk patients. The potential for continued COVID-19 variants and infections highlight the need for more convenient oral formulations to expand the options for outpatients. As such, we have just initiated a Phase 1 trial of GS-5245, a novel oral COVID-19 nucleoside, that once metabolized, works in the same way as remdesivir. Pending data, the evolving pandemic landscape, and discussions with regulatory agencies, we are hoping to initiate a registrational trial before the end of the year. Moving to HIV on slide 17, we shared an overview of some of our long-acting development activities a few weeks ago, to highlight the diversity of our portfolio and how it targets the entire HIV life cycle. We continue to believe that our investigational agent lenacapavir is a unique and foundational asset, given its potential for extended dosing, in addition to the compelling efficacy and safety profile highlighted in the CAPELLA and CALIBRATE studies. Next, on slide 18, you can see our current clinical efforts with long-acting HIV therapeutics. As previously announced, the Phase 2 study evaluating the oral combination of lenacapavir with Merck's islatravir is on partial clinical hold, and Merck remains in discussions with FDA on next steps islatravir. In the meantime, we at Gilead continue to develop a number of other potential partner agents for lenacapavir in HIV treatment and look forward to sharing some more detail on these programs at our Virology Deep Dive later this month. We remain confident and excited about lenacapavir's future potential to deliver options for people living with HIV or those who could benefit from PrEP. I want to be very clear that the recent clinical hold for the lenacapavir trials, which the FDA initiated in December, is not associated with the lenacapavir molecule itself. Rather, the hold reflects concern about the compatibility of certain vials with the lenacapavir solution. We continue to work with the FDA to remediate the concern and to agree on a path to resume these trials. We are hopeful this can be achieved quickly. As such, we continue to expect an FDA decision for lenacapavir in heavily treatment experienced individuals in the first half of 2022. If successful, lenacapavir will become the first available six-month, long-acting subcutaneous injection for the treatment of HIV. Next, moving to Trodelvy on slide 18, I'm pleased to confirm that we now expect to share both top-line progression-free survival data as well as the first planned interim analysis of overall survival from TROPiCS-02 in March. There's been a convergence of events for PFS and OS such that we will be able to conduct and report a single analysis of these outcomes rather than have two analyses separated by a short interval. Gilead remains blinded to the data, and we are excited to be able to share this more complete view later this quarter. We are targeting an sBLA filing in the second half of 2022, depending, of course, on the readout. If the data are positive, we believe that Trodelvy could represent a very important treatment option for HR+/HER2- patients who are hormone refractory and have very limited options. Reflecting our confidence in Trodelvy overall, we are expanding the number of clinical programs in 2022 to evaluate effectiveness in breast, lung and bladder cancers, with plans to initiate study start-up activities for at least 7 Phase 3 trials. Three of these are expected to enroll their first patients in 2022, including two in front line metastatic TNBC and another in front-line non-small cell lung cancer study that will be led by Merck. Going forward, we will separately disclose trial start up activities versus FPI milestones. Additionally, in the first half of this year, we plan to add a combination of Trodelvy with other Gilead portfolio assets as a study or an additional cohort in an existing study. We look forward to sharing more details at our upcoming Oncology Deep Dive in April. This is another example of the versatility and tremendous potential that Trodelvy, along with the growing oncology portfolio, can generate. Next slide, onto magrolimab. Early last week, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold pausing enrollment and screening in trials and cohorts in the U.S. evaluating magrolimab in combination with azacitidine following review of a preliminary data set suggesting an apparent imbalance in investigator reported SUSARs, or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, between treatment groups in our ongoing Phase 3 trial in high-risk MDS. A subsequent partial clinical hold has been placed on the Phase 2 multiple myeloma study and the fully enrolled Phase 2 DLBCL study. Importantly, patients currently enrolled in our magrolimab studies can continue treatment and our compassionate use programs remain open. We are working with FDA to take a comprehensive look at the safety data, and we will share the outcome as quickly as we can. In the meantime, we remain committed to the magrolimab development program and believe that it has the potential to address an important unmet medical need in these seriously ill patients. As you know, the patients in our ENHANCE Phase 3 trial have a very high unmet need, with a median overall survival of only 1 to 3 years on the current standard of care. Separate and prior to the partial clinical hold, our Phase 1b single arm study in higher risk MDS no longer has a viable path to submission based on regulatory feedback. As such, we will remain focused on our Phase 3 ENHANCE study and look forward to sharing the 1b data at an upcoming scientific meeting. Next, moving to cell therapy on slide 21, on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, I will share a brief update on the impressive data Kite presented at ASH last December. First, as you may recall, in 2020 we shared that Yescarta had a four-year overall survival rate of 44% in third-line LBCL patients. At ASH in December, we presented five-year data from ZUMA-1 in third-line LBCL patients showing Yescarta demonstrated a remarkable and durable 43% overall survival rate, stable since our four-year update. Additionally, 92% of the patients who remained alive at five years have not needed any additional cancer treatment since their one-time infusion of Yescarta. It's truly inspiring to see this type of durability for CAR T cell therapies. As announced yesterday, the FDA approved a label update for Yescarta to include use of prophylactic corticosteroids across all approved indications. Adding prophylactic steroid use can improve the management of certain side effects without compromising the activity of Yescarta. For example, the FDA label now shows no grade 3 or greater cytokine release syndrome events occurred using the Cohort 6 protocol, as compared to 13% in the original label. This label update complements data published in 2021 showing 68% of patients had no CRS or neurologic events within 72 hours of Yescarta infusion. As we look to earlier lines of treatment, the landmark ZUMA-7 trial evaluating Yescarta in second-line relapsed/refractory LBCL demonstrated a greater than 4-fold increase in median event free survival, or EFS, compared to standard of care through two years of follow-up. As you can see on the slide, the EFS curve for Yescarta is compelling. The sBLA was filed last quarter and we expect an FDA decision by April of this year. In terms of the first-line LBCL data, Yescarta demonstrated 89% overall response rate in high-risk patients, and 78% complete response with a median follow-up of 15.9 months. Given these encouraging data, the Kite team is in discussions with regulatory authorities on a potential path forward in front line LBCL. And finally, on slide 22, we highlight key 2022 catalysts across the portfolio, many of which I have just mentioned. I'd also like to take a moment to highlight the three Arcus milestones in second half of this year. Last quarter, Gilead opted in to the three Arcus programs, which added four assets to our portfolio: domvanalimab, an Fc silent anti-TIGIT antibody; AB308, an Fc active anti-TIGIT antibody; etrumadenant, an adenosine receptor antagonist; and quemliclustat, a small molecule CD73 inhibitor. Together with Arcus, we expect to share ARC-7 Phase 2 PFS data in the second half of 2022, which will include data for the zimberelimab monotherapy, zim and dom doublet, as well as the zim, dom and etruma triplet arm. We look forward to sharing data when available and are very excited to collaborate more closely with Arcus to accelerate future development plans. On slide 23, you can see that Gilead's portfolio now encompasses 55 clinical stage programs, nearly doubling since 2019. Given the exciting potential of our portfolio across virology, oncology, and even early stage inflammation assets, this is just the beginning. Our teams are committed to advancing the most promising programs that will help transform patient outcomes, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you over the coming quarters and years. With that, I'll hand it over to Andy. Yes. Thanks, Mohit. It's a great question. And I think as I mentioned in my call, I think we're excited that we're going to be able to share the first interim analysis from the OS as well when we do the readout here for the PFS. So, I do think we'll look at both at the same time. You're absolutely right that there are developments in the HR-positive space, but I continue to believe, and I think that the impact on both PFS -- on PFS in particular here, but also OS continues to be, I think, if we see something in the ballpark of what you just described, we're confident that that remains incredibly clinically relevant for people suffering with HR-positive HER2-negative. It is, as you state, an increasingly competitive area, but we do think that that remains a key milestone for patients if we can achieve that. Yes. Great question, and thanks for asking it. I think I'm very reassured I would not read anything into this other than the fact that we've been, as you can imagine, keeping track of the PFS events and the OS events all along. And we've now gotten to the point where those OS events have occurred in a time frame that allows us to look at both of these events at the same time. I don't think it really says anything about -- I think what you're getting at is does it have any implications for the underlying positive or negative or anything like that. And I really don't think there's any way to interpret that right now. It would be pure speculation to think that there's some underlying driver of bringing those endpoints together. And actually, it's not that unexpected. It's a little bit closer than we thought it would be, but not by that much. So, I wouldn't read too much into it. I'm just excited we'll be able to do it. It will be a more robust look. And I think as I've said before, we think the regulators are going to want to see those robust looks at the OS to help them with sort of, in a sense, supporting the PFS endpoint. Thanks, Cory. Yes. So look, I think the way to think about it is some of -- there have been a couple of events that the agency wants to make sure that they have a chance to look at the overall safety profile. I remain blinded to the safety data. So, what is going on is we are gathering the safety data, and we're going to share it with the FDA and with the data monitoring committee. I can tell you that we feel that these are temporary challenges right now and we're going to work through resolving it as quickly as possible. I don't think these challenges really shake our confidence for the portfolio overall and our overall strategy hasn't changed. We're really committed to the macro development program, and we think that it really continues to have the potential to really address -- an important unmet medical need. The only thing I'd add is, remember, these are very generally pretty sick patients. And with that underlying illness, I think it's appropriate to be cautious to make sure that we're striking the right balance as we go forward. But we'll work through it by looking at the overall safety at the overall safety profile, Brian, and make sure that we are able to resolve those issues with the FDA. Sure. I think in addition to the TIGIT asset, as you know, the adenosine portfolio, if you will, the 2 molecules, the 2 inhibitors of adenosine, both in terms of the synthesis inhibitor, CD73, as well as the receptor blocker are really interesting to us. They're early programs, but we think that there is a real potential for those assets to provide significant upside to treatment, both in terms of where -- in lung cancer, where we think there's some -- the trial that's ongoing that is looking at the addition of adenosine inhibition to TIGIT plus PD-1 as well as in some of the indications that Arcus is evaluating with monotherapy in particular, pancreatic cancer. So, I think for us, there are a number of opportunities there and the broad potential of adenosine inhibitors to add on to immuno-oncology in general and TIGIT plus PD-1 in particular really strike us is a really great opportunity that hopefully as the data mature, we'll be able to share more and really underpin the optimism we have around where those programs are headed. And then the triplet study, yes, we'll -- we haven't announced that yet. We need to work through some details. Thanks for reminding me, Dan. We're working through some approach. Really, the question here for us is how to go from the doublet, where we're really looking at a TIGIT inhibitor being an unapproved agent, right, and then potentially bringing in a second unapproved agent. So we have to work through in a sense, the regulatory complications of how we have to sequence and stage those studies to allow us to assess the contribution of components such that we can move forward aggressively. So, we're working really closely with our adenosine colleague -- our adenosine colleagues, our Arcus colleagues, and we'll work through the regulatory pathways to make sure that we can get to a robust base Phase 3 trials with those. So, as we do so, we'll certainly share the timing in the pathway. Yes. Michael, it's a great question. And I think, thank you for asking it. So, as a reminder, I think from a PFS standpoint, the primary endpoint of the study, we believe we're really well powered to detect a difference there. And as I'll remind folks, we did redesign the study a year ago in order to power the study adequately for OS as well. I would -- I think as excited as I am that we will be able to report out that first interim analysis, Michael, you're absolutely right on that. I would not expect statistical significance at this first interim because it is relatively early in the time frame that we're seeing. So, my expectation is that again, pending a positive outcome that we are well powered to see a PFS improvement at a statistically significant level. And the OS will be supportive data at that point that will give us directionality as to where we're headed. And then hopefully, subsequent to that as the events accrue, we'll see where we're headed with OS and down the road. It's a great question. Yes, it's really important to -- I think this may have not been entirely clear. First of all, I think -- look, I think whenever there's a safety question, the agency is going to err on the side of being cautious. And so we'll work through with them on how to go forward. And I agree in those studies, we are not combining with azacitidine. So again, I think as we share the data and the analysis with the agency, hopefully, we can come to resolution sooner than later. And it's important to note that for the multiple myeloma study, we actually hadn't really started enrolling patients at that point. So I think that was one consideration. And by contrast for the DLBCL study, that is completely enrolled. So, the partial hold there actually doesn't have much of a practical impact on that study because we're going to continue dosing the patients who are already enrolled in that study. So, I think -- remember that the way it works is maybe the context here, the holds are placed on an IND, not on a study-by-study basis, generally. So, this was a hold to the IND. And so, that's sort of the context to think about it. I'll hand it off to Andy to answer the second part of the question. Yes. Thanks. And I guess, I'd make two points. The first is, is very early days with the oral program. And so, I would keep that in mind. We just started Phase 1. So, a lot of things can happen. And so I would just keep that in mind. Obviously, if things go well, we'll move as aggressively as possible. And I agree with Johanna. I think that there will always be a role for both oral and IV therapies. There will be a -- what we're seeing now, I think, in terms of how folks are approaching it is that as availability of oral therapies becomes broader, they're used relatively early in the course of disease. Many people may progress and/or not get treated early enough and end up in the hospital. And at that point, I think that's where that hospitalized or carry hospitalization more severe disease is where the role of IV therapies is going to come in, Veklury in particular is going to come in. So, I have too much to add to what Johanna said, but I do think there'll be a role for both in the long run. Yes, very quickly. I think as I mentioned, we did upsize the study last year for OS because we've always believed, especially in HR-positive that having OS data are going to be important to support a file. It's not the primary endpoint, and we think it's going to be important supportive data to go. So, that didn't really have much to do with this confluence of events here. It's a fortuitous event in terms of timing here that will support our data. So hopefully, that answers... The FDA didn't specifically ask us for it. No. It's always -- we're always going to take a look at OS with the first PFS data cut at this point in order -- instead of doing a look and then an interim, we're just going to do the PFS and the interim at the same time."

            "name": "Daniel O'Day",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacquie. And good afternoon, everybody. As we head into 2022, Gilead is coming off a year of positive clinical momentum and strong financial performance, mitigating the impact of the pandemic on some parts of our business. Higher sales of Veklury more than offset the impact of COVID-19 on HIV and HCV. Veklury continues to play a critical role in helping to treat people with COVID-19, with continued activity against the Omicron variant. The FDA recently expanded its use beyond the hospital for patients at high risk of disease progression. In addition, we just initiated a Phase 1 trial of GS-5245, a novel oral COVID19 nucleoside, that once metabolized, works in the same way as remdesivir. Our full year revenue for 2021 was 11% higher than the midpoint of our initial guidance in February of 2021. It was also an important year for our transformation to becoming a business that is based on diverse, sustainable growth. In 2021, we received 7 approvals or accelerated approvals in the U.S. and Europe, and submitted an additional 6 filings. Our approvals included: three for Trodelvy, with FDA and MAA approval in second-line triple-negative breast cancer as well as an accelerated approval from FDA for metastatic bladder cancer; two for cell therapy, with Yescarta receiving accelerated approval in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma and Tecartus receiving full approval in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia; and two expanded labels in virology, one for a pediatric label for Biktarvy in the U.S. and an expanded label for Veklury in the E.U. for adults not requiring supplemental oxygen. Our 2022 plans include a significant increase in clinical development studies across our novel oncology portfolio. We are planning at least 20 additional trials, including 7 Phase 3 trials for Trodelvy. And these include: the ASCENT-03 trial, which is evaluating Trodelvy in the front-line triple-negative breast cancer in the PDL1 negative population; the ASCENT-04, in collaboration with Merck, to evaluate Trodelvy and Keytruda in front-line triple-negative breast cancer population in the PDL1 positive population; and the EVOKE-03, which will be led by Merck, to evaluate Trodelvy and Keytruda in non-small cell lung cancer. You will also see ongoing momentum in our virology portfolio as we continue to expand our leadership in antiviral therapies. We are advancing our longer-acting HIV options with lenacapavir as the foundation and look forward to potential regulatory decisions in 2022. If approved, lenacapavir would be the only HIV treatment option administered twice yearly. In addition, we'll continue to drive progress across our broader virology portfolio, including hepatitis, COVID-19, and other emerging viruses. This is a really important time in Gilead's transformation journey. After the consistent work to execute on our strategy and expand our portfolio over the last two years, you will increasingly start to see this play out in tangible results. We're confident that Gilead has all the elements in place for a strong year and a strong decade. Johanna, and Merdad and Andy will now take you through the details of our progress and our plans. And let me hand first to Johanna to talk about our commercial performance in the fourth quarter and the full year. And I'll be back to you in the Q&A. Johanna? Thanks, Jeff. Thanks for the question and teaming. I'll start and then hand it over to Andy. So, yes, I mean, the guide that we gave at JP Morgan was that we are confident in our ability to grow and to also have oncology by 2030 be at least a third of our overall revenue on top of a solid HIV business and virology business overall. I think, the answer to the question, Geoff, is we believe we have everything in-house to be able to fulfill on that commitment today. I mean, the number of options that we have with Trodelvy, with magrolimab, with the Arcus assets and with Cell Therapy from an oncology base provides tremendous opportunity for us to look alone and in combination of that portfolio in the coming years. And that specifically leads to the more than 30 clinical trials we have ongoing right now in our oncology portfolio. And our guide that this year will start at least another 20 in the oncology space. So really, that's the armamentarium behind our commitment and our growth. Of course, we'll continue to be opportunistic around business development and look for supplemental options out there that can complement this portfolio as a course of normal business as any healthy company should. Having said that, we really do have enough in-house to be able to fill up on that commitment. So, with that, Andy, I may have stolen all your thunder, but I'm sure you'll have some additional perspectives. Thanks, Mohit. Directly over to you, Merdad. That's great. Thanks, Brian. And Brian, we'll keep you informed as that evolves. We have obviously a lot of patients on magrolimab that continue to be served by magrolimab. So, we have a sense of urgency in working with the agency around this. Sure. Merdad, why don't you start on that? Right. And I think there was a question around when to start the... And Salveen, the only thing I'd add on top of Merdad's eloquent response is the potential to combine this attractive portfolio for markets with other medicines that we have within Gilead, including Trodelvy and possibly magrolimab and others, so his combination of having access to a PD-1 2 TIGIT compounds to adenosine combined with Trodelvy provides a rich opportunity to look at rational-based combinations. And we'll be getting more into that as we do a deeper dive in oncology as a starting point in April. And then obviously, throughout the year, we'll continue to update you on that. And it's one of the major reasons why opting in early was important to us because we can work really fluidly now across a very rich portfolio. And with the additional expertise and colleagues from Arcus, it really expands all of our potential and clinical science and beyond. Yes. Thanks, Michael. And maybe just a suggestion, as you answer, Michael's specific question, it might be helpful for the whole audience to hear again kind of your overall view of the potential success of this indication. Yes. Thanks, Ronny. And as I turn it over to Christi, let me just say how many patients we've been able to impact with cell therapy in 2021, and that being just the beginning, I think, of our promise for the future. We certainly invested in the manufacturing capacity to anticipate demand and success in the second-line, and Christi can go into the details with you. Christi, over to you. Thanks so much, Christi. And overall, Ronny, we're expecting about a 50% increase in capacity over the course of 2022, so continued investment there. Great. So I'll have Andy answer the second. Maybe you want to touch base on the first, Merdad, also telling about the stage of those 2 trials. Thanks, Colin. Happy to take that up separately, too. Thanks, Hartaj. So, I think Johanna can start with some of the pandemic -- endemic and then Merdad could also comment a little bit on the forward portfolio. But please, Johanna, over to you. Hartaj, just to complement what Johanna and Merdad said, I think we clearly see that as this becomes endemic that there'll be potentially a need for multiple mechanisms in the outpatient setting. So, that's one of the reasons why approaching it from a preliminary standpoint as well as to a protease standpoint, we think could make sense over the long term for resistance patterns. And the last thing I'll say is I think what we've seen this, whether it's pandemic or endemic, remdesivir is going to firmly trench now as a standard of care in the hospital setting. And so, as goes hospitalization, so will go remdesivir over time, and we think that's going to be an important part of our ongoing business and our benefit to patients. Thanks, Carter. Right over to Johanna, please. Terrific. Thank you so much, Carter. We can take one last question, everybody. Thank you. Thanks a lot, Matthew. We'll go to Merdad and then Johanna. The FDA did not ask for it. Thanks, Matthew. Johanna? Great, Matthew. And I just want to, before I turn it over to Jacquie, thank all of you for joining from our perspective. We are really excited about the build that we've had at Gilead over the past two years and the team and the people that we have on board. We've got a lot to do this year, and we're really teed up for a good strong year and a strong decade ahead with this portfolio. With that, Jacquie, over to you, please."

            "content": "Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. It was a strong close to 2021, driven primarily by strong HIV and Veklury revenue in the fourth quarter. For the full year, and excluding the impact of the LOEs, HIV grew 4% year-over-year, driven by the continued outperformance of Biktarvy, which achieved record U.S. market share of 42%, and sales of $8.6 billion, up 19% from 2020. Oncology was another highlight from both a pipeline and revenue perspective, with full year cell therapy sales of $871 million growing 43% from 2020, and Trodelvy sales of $380 million in its first full year. By 2030, we anticipate our oncology franchise will represent at least a third of our total revenue. Before I get into the normal P&L review and 2022 guidance, I want to address the EPS results for this quarter upfront. Slide 25 highlights two sizeable expenses that occurred after we gave our last guidance in October. First, and subsequent to the exercise of Gilead's opt-in to four Arcus assets in December, our fourth quarter results reflect a net charge of $625 million, recorded in R&D. This charge reflects our $725 million option payment recognized in Q4 less $100 million that was previously accrued. This impacted our EPS by about $0.38 in Q4 and for the full year. Second, and as part of a legal settlement with ViiV and related parties, we have agreed to make a one-time $1.25 billion payment, in addition to an ongoing 3% royalty for future sales of Biktarvy and the bictegravir component of bictegravir-containing products in the United States. This royalty extends until October 5 of 2027. The $1.25 billion payment is recorded in our fourth quarter results and reflected in our cost of goods sold. This charge constituted an approximately 17% impact to gross margin in the fourth quarter, and it impacted our EPS by $0.80 for Q4 2021 and the full year. Going forward, we expect the impact of this new royalty to be approximately 1% on our gross margin, starting in the first quarter of 2022. Excluding these items, and their combined $1.18 impact, our full year non-GAAP EPS would have exceeded the guidance range that we set back in October, helped by stronger than expected Veklury sales. Moving back to our quarterly review on slide 26, fourth quarter revenue in our base business included HIV product sales growth of 7% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Veklury sales were higher than expected due to start of the Omicron surge. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 70.5%, impacted by the legal settlement that I referenced earlier, and non-GAAP R&D was impacted by the Arcus opt-in, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 per share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32.2%, reflecting tax expense related to uncertain tax positions, an increase in valuation allowance, as well as the impact of discrete tax benefits related to legal settlements with tax authorities in 2020 that did not recur this year. For the full year, on slide 27, total product sales of $27 billion grew 11% driven by Veklury. Excluding Veklury, total product sales were roughly flat at $21.4 billion as growth in Biktarvy and oncology offset the $1.3 billion impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs in the United States. I touched on the main P&L impacts in the fourth quarter discussion, but will highlight that our non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2021 was 20.4%, despite the higher effective tax rate in the fourth quarter. Moving now to slide 28. Our 2022 guidance assumes that the recent Omicron surge represents the only major COVID-19 wave for 2022, and that our HIV business will continue to recover from the pandemic. With that in mind, we expect Product Sales in the range of $23.8 billion to $24.3 billion. Excluding Veklury, we expect product sales in the range of $21.8 billion to $22.3 billion, representing growth of 2% to 4% for our base business year-over-year. Relative to Q1, I'll remind you to expect HIV revenue to decline sequentially. This is a normal dynamic for HIV due to inventory and seasonal pricing impacts, and you'll recall last year HIV revenue declined 14% sequentially in Q1 \u201821 from Q4 of 2020. For Q122, we expect a larger sequential decline, given the favorable Q4 \u201821 changes to gross to net estimates that Johanna mentioned earlier. Nonetheless, we expect a strong year overall for our HIV business and continued growth in the subsequent quarters. Looking beyond Q1, we expect the impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs will be largely behind us starting in Q2, and we look forward to accelerating growth in our HIV business during the remainder of the year. For the full year 2022, we expect Veklury sales of approximately $2 billion. This assumes, as I previously indicated, that Omicron will represent the only major surge for the year, with Veklury revenue heavily weighted in the first quarter. That said, the pandemic continues to be dynamic, and we will update you on our Veklury expectations on a quarterly basis, consistent with our recent practice. Moving to the rest of the P&L. We expect our non-GAAP product gross margin to be approximately 85% to 86%, consistent with our historic guidance and allowing for the 3% royalty associated with the legal settlement. For non-GAAP operating expenses, we expect R&D to decrease by a mid-single digit percentage compared to 2021 levels. This decline is driven by the net $625 million charge related to the Arcus opt-in in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding this, we expect full year R&D expense to increase by a mid-to-high single digit percentage compared to 2021 levels. We expect SG&A to be approximately flat on a dollar basis compared to 2021. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20% this year. Finally, we expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $6.20 and $6.70 for the full-year, and GAAP diluted EPS to be between $4.70 and $5.20. On capital allocation, our priorities have not changed. We continued to invest in our business while, at the same time, we returned over $4 billion in 2021 to our shareholders, through dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we repaid $4.75 billion of debt in 2021. For 2022, we plan to repay $1.5 billion of debt, of which, we repaid $500 million this morning. With that, I will invite the operator to begin the Q&A. Thank you. Yes. Geoff, thank you for the question. I think it's an important question, especially in the context of the magrolimab clinical hold that maybe underpinning the question specifically. But the answer is relatively simple. We have a very strong set of assets already. The guidance that we provided at JP Morgan does not actually include all of the assets or all the indications for all the assets. So, there's a lot of ways for us to get there. We have complete confidence in where we're going, and we don't expect to change our BD strategy as a result of any of the recent developments. We're actually really excited about where we are. And there's a lot of upside to that of other assets, whether it's some of the earlier Arcus assets or the Tizona or Pionyr assets, as examples, provide additional options for patients. So, when you talk about high-impact assets, I would just summarize by saying, we already think that we have a great portfolio of high-impact assets in oncology, we're incredibly pleased with what we've put together and nothing that's happened recently has changed that in any way. So, thanks for the question. I'm not sure that I fully understood the question, but what I can tell you is none of the -- none of the updates that we provided in terms of the onetime fourth quarter expenses nor none of our 2022 guidance has anything to do with expenses. So you and I can maybe talk separately to understand what your question is specifically, but there's nothing related to or the Forty Seven acquisition that was either part of our fourth quarter update, year-end update or part of the 2022 guide specifically."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Johanna Mercier",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone. As you can see on slide 7, we had a strong end to the year with Q4 total product sales, excluding Veklury, of $5.8 billion, up 7% quarter-over-quarter, driven by favorable pricing and inventory dynamics. This also represented 8% growth year-over-year, driven by continued recovery in the HIV treatment market and favorable pricing dynamics. Veklury sales were higher than expected in Q4 reflecting the start of the Omicron surge, but lower than both the prior quarter and prior year, and contributing to total product sales of $7.2 billion for the quarter. Moving to slide 8, total fourth quarter Veklury sales were $1.4 billion, bringing total sales for 2021 to $5.6 billion. Gilead is proud of the role that Veklury continues to play in this pandemic. Veklury has demonstrated activity against the Omicron variant and has helped many patients with COVID-19 in the most recent surge. Although symptoms have generally been less severe, the volume of overall cases has meaningfully increased since the emergence of Omicron, and we have seen the total number of hospitalizations increase as well. While we would all prefer to put this pandemic behind us, we expect Veklury to continue to play a critical role in 2022 and beyond. As you would expect, hospitalizations remain a key indicator for in-patient Veklury sales, and we are seeing higher hospitalizations in geographies with lower vaccination adoption, including certain parts of the U.S. as well as Eastern Europe. Additionally, I'm very pleased to highlight that the FDA recently approved the sNDA filing for the use of Veklury in the outpatient setting for patients at high risk of disease progression. This approval was based on data generated in the Phase 3 PINETREE study, further solidifying the credibility, importance and role of Veklury. Now Veklury will be available to help even more patients earlier and reduce risk of hospitalization for COVID-19. Next, as shown on slide 9, total HIV sales were $4.5 billion in the quarter, up 8% sequentially driven by favorable inventory and pricing dynamics as well as changes to our gross to net estimates in Q4 2021. For the full year, total HIV sales were $16.3 billion, down 4% year-over-year, primarily due to the Truvada and Atripla LOE, in addition to pandemic-related impacts and pricing dynamics. The expected impact from the LOEs, which amounted to $1.3 billion, was offset by continued Biktarvy growth. Excluding the sizeable LOE impact, HIV total product sales for the full year grew 4% compared to 2020 despite the ongoing pandemic headwinds. We now expect the Truvada and Atripla loss of exclusivity impact to be minimal going forward as the headwind dissipates starting in Q2 of this year. In HIV treatment, we continue to see signs of market recovery although the U.S. market declined 1% sequentially in Q4 following two quarters of sequential growth. On a year-over-year basis, the overall market in Q4 was up 1.5% in both the U.S. as well as the EU5, despite screening and diagnosis rates still below pre-pandemic levels. As you know, favorable dynamics play out in the fourth quarter of every year in HIV, and 2021 was no different with some year-end inventory stocking and favorable seasonal pricing as well as changes in our gross to net estimates in Q4 2021. As you think about 2022, I'll remind you of the normal HIV inventory build-up in Q4 and the New Year reset for patient copays and donut hole payments. Given these factors, along with the favorable pricing dynamics I just mentioned, we expect the sequential decline in Q1 \u201822 to be greater than Q1 \u201821. Nonetheless, we expect a strong year overall in HIV and expect continued growth in subsequent quarters. Back to Q4, Biktarvy had another record quarter with sales of $2.5 billion, up 11% sequentially and 22% year-over-year. On slide 10, you can see that Biktarvy U.S. treatment market share has increased over 5 share points in 2021, reaching 42%, which is the highest share that any complete regimen has ever achieved in this market. For the full year, Biktarvy sales were $8.6 billion, growing 19% from 2020, and Biktarvy remains the leading prescribed treatment for nai\u0308ve and switch patients in the U.S. as well as number 1 in nai\u0308ve in EU5. Descovy revenue for the fourth quarter was $473 million, up 9% quarter-over-quarter primarily as a result of favorable seasonal pricing and inventory dynamics as well as continued demand. We expect Descovy revenue to continue to be driven by PrEP as Descovy has maintained about 45% of overall PrEP market prescriptions in the U.S. We will continue to ensure access to support physician choice, and expect growing demand and market expansion to offset the impact of increased commercial contracting. Overall, while near term growth continues to be impacted by local pandemic-related social restrictions, we are encouraged by the growing PrEP market. In Q4, the overall PrEP market grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, and 31% year-over-year. Looking forward, we believe lenacapavir, our investigational longer-acting PrEP offering, could potentially catalyze the market well beyond the 25% penetration rate in PrEP that we see today. Moving to slide 11, it's clear that HCV continues to be the part of our portfolio most impacted by the pandemic. Although there was some slight quarter-over-quarter recovery in market starts in the EU5, U.S. market starts declined, resulting in flat total starts overall. While Gilead market share increased modestly on a sequential basis in both the U.S. and the EU, this was more than offset by unfavorable pricing dynamics, resulting in Q4 total sales of $393 million, down 8% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. As you can see on slide 12, our HBV and HDV franchise reported record quarterly revenues of $265 million, up 7% sequentially due to seasonal inventory and favorable pricing. The 9% year-over-year growth was primarily driven by Vemlidy demand. Total fiscal year sales for this franchise were $969 million, up 13% year-over-year. Hepcludex reported $12 million of sales in Q4 in Europe, with $37 million in 2021 sales since our acquisition in late first quarter. Hepcludex is currently available in Germany and France, in addition to a number of early access programs in countries such as Austria, Italy, and Greece. In 2022, and as part of our comprehensive commercialization plan, we expect to finalize reimbursement for launch in a number of major European markets. In the U.S., we filed a BLA in November and FDA granted priority review for accelerated approval, with a PDUFA date set for the third quarter and an Advisory Committee meeting that will be scheduled in the coming months. Moving to oncology, first with Trodelvy on slide 13, global sales were $118 million in the fourth quarter, up 17% sequentially and up 84% year-over-year compared to full Q4 2020 sales. This reflects growing adoption of the second line metastatic TNBC triple-negative breast cancer indication, which was noted as a preferred regimen in the NCCN Breast Guidelines updated in September. We are also starting to see stronger, unaided brand awareness which is resulting in continued market share growth. In second-line TNBC, Trodelvy now captures approximately 1 in 4 new starts in the U.S. We have expanded our oncology footprint globally, including tripling our U.S. headcount to further accelerate penetration of Trodelvy and prepare for our potential HR positive and HER2 negative launches. Additionally, EU approval for Trodelvy was granted in late November 2021 and we have already seen strong momentum in France and Germany since their launch. We plan to launch in a number of new countries following key reimbursement decisions this year. Now, on slide 14, on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, cell therapy Q4 sales of $239 million reflected 47% year-over-year growth, an 8% increase sequentially. For the quarter, Yescarta sales of $182 million were up 41% year-over-year driven by continued demand in relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Tecartus sales of $57 million in the quarter reflected 68% year-over-year growth based on growing global demand for relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma and early contribution from adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the U.S. As a reminder, FDA granted Tecartus approval in adult ALL in October and in just the first few months of launch, there has already been strong demand that we expect to continue in the coming quarters given the high unmet need. Full year cell therapy sales of $871 million reflected 43% year-over-year growth driven by continued LBCL and MCL demand globally as well as the new launches. The strong growth we've seen with these recent launches reinforces our belief that cell therapy adoption will continue its positive momentum as more physicians understand the benefits for appropriate patients and therefore increase referral rates to treatment centers. Merdad will elaborate later, so I'll just quickly mention the impressive data Kite presented at ASH in December, 43% overall survival rate after five years in third line LBCL patients. The Yescarta data at ASH not only highlighted the long-term real-world safety and efficacy profile in third line LBCL, but also in earlier lines of therapy. For ZUMA-7 data in second-line LBCL, FDA has set a PDUFA date of April 1st when we hope Yescarta will be granted approval. In the meantime, the Kite team is ramping up manufacturing capacity to meet the anticipated demand. Kite expects the new Maryland facility to begin commercial operations by Q2. Combined with the Amsterdam and El Segundo facilities, we expect to increase operational capacity by up to 50% by the end of this year. Christi is here with the team and available to take questions on cell therapy during our Q&A. In closing, our oncology sales were $1.25 billion in 2021 and we expect robust growth in the coming years. With that, I'll hand it over to Merdad for pipeline updates. Thanks, Hartaj, for the question. Basically, what we've seen since the very beginning is how that Veklury sales truly track to the hospitalizations. And we've seen that most recently again with the Omicron surge. What we did see as well is the fact that -- despite the fact that Omicron seemed to may be less severe impact, unfortunately, the number of cases were much greater and therefore just the pure absolute numbers of hospitalizations went up. And so, we've tracked every single time pretty much in line, parallel to the hospitalization rates. And we assume that will continue. We do think the hospitalizations will get impacted by some of the oral compounds, even some of the outpatient use of Veklury, but also neutralizing antibodies as well as the oral treatments as well like the PI from Pfizer. And so, we do think that will decrease hospitalizations over time. The one thing we had assumed maybe about a year ago is we really thought the vaccination rates would continue to rise and they didn't. They basically stabilize at around the 60%, 65% rate. And of course, there are variances across the country. So, what we've seen is the use of different treatments as well as the vaccinations -- the vaccination rates are really dictating a little bit kind of the hospitalizations and therefore, the Veklury usage. And yet again, in the December, January time frame, we've really seen Veklury play a critical role here for these hospitalizations, also having to do with the fact that many of the other previous agents that were on the market were no longer effective against the Omicron variant. And we haven't seen any of that. We've seen very strong efficacy with Veklury, which has also helped that. I think most recently, the outpatient data that's just come out in addition to the indication really plays a critical role when there are surges and hospitals are overcapacity, so that they really can look at outpatient setting with Veklury, and we think that will just kind of play hand in hand. And I would propose, as I turn it over to Merdad to address the oral piece of the puzzle, I actually think you need both. I think you need the oral setting, so more players in the oral setting is critical and you still need hospitalizations because, unfortunately, as this -- if it does become endemic, I do think you'll see a steady rate of hospitalizations as we go through, and that's where Veklury plays a critical role. Merdad? Sure, Carter. Thanks for the question. Just a couple of things. One is the footprint, the geographic footprint that we've just initiated and that ramp-up and the tripling. It has really maybe three objectives. One is to further support our initial launches of both metastatic TNBC triple-negative breast cancer as well as bladder. So, that's definitely number one, and that is here and now. the potential to support a potential indication in HR positive, which is what you were referring to. And the third one is also setting up for the future success of our total oncology portfolio. So, assuming positive data, of course, is what we've decided to go for, but having said that, even if that didn't play out, this is the right team for the future for Gilead Oncology. So that was the first part of your question. The second part of your question about the growth slowing, I actually think we're quite pleased, actually, as we got into Q4, what we've seen is the share really drive up post NCCN breast guidelines update in September. And so, we had good data point of share. The last data point we have is October, and that's the 1 in 4 that you heard me talk about earlier. And so, that's doubling from where we were in April. So, we were at about half of that share in second line. And now we're at about 24%, 25% share in second line. So, a real nice growth on that front and definitely more to come. I think there's an incredible opportunity for Trodelvy in this patient setting, especially with the high unmet medical need and the incredible OS data that we have with Trodelvy. So more to come on that. And Matthew, the second part of your question around the Q4 piece of the puzzle. So, as you well know, right, as you go into Q4, you usually have a bit of a seasonal inventory build in the subchannel play. And then, of course, that bleeds out in Q1. So, that's one piece of the puzzle. In Q1, the other difference is, of course, you increased your co-pay support, your donut hole coverage and so all those pieces and your payer mix kind of changes in your first quarter. Having said that, in addition to that, there was some favorability in Q4 of 2021 from a gross-to-net standpoint, which will then create an even bigger kind of decline in Q1, and that's what we were referring to. So, hopefully, that helps a little bit. It's a onetime thing in Q4. And it's just more around the comparison versus Q1 over Q4 as we get through the first quarter, and that's what I was trying to signal."

            "content": "Thanks, Dan. Thanks for the question. Yes, we're very excited about not only the second-line, which is the most important to help the most patients, but the continued success of third line plus with the five-year data that was presented at ASH where year four, you saw 43% of patients still alive, and at -- 44% of the patients still on life of four years and 43% at five years, which I think you heard Merdad say. So, based on those as well as new indications coming out, we're really seeing an increase in demand. Our capacity, we're well positioned. We have the El Segundo manufacturing site here in California. Amsterdam was approved during COVID and with up to its capacity by the end of last year. And now, we have the Maryland site, which will be going online in the first half of this year where you'll see our automation as well. So, not only increasing capacity, but also the ability to reduce costs. So, things are coming along nicely in terms of our ability to deliver, and we still have that reliability of 97% success when we give the cells back, which is so critically important to patients. So, not a capacity issue. We had a transparency, a couple of issues last year where we had a scheduling issue where physicians were asking for the exact same slot all at the same time. And we quickly addressed that and no longer have that concern. So, we're doing well and preparing for, hopefully, what we'll see is helping a lot more patients stay live a lot longer."

        "content": "Daniel O\u2019day: To the significant reduction in the risk of hospitalizations after a three-day IV treatment of Veklury and the outpatient setting. In order to meet additional treatment needs, we also continued to advance our oral programs to develop a novel best-in-class therapy. Turning to HIV performance, we saw positive gains in the treatment market for the second quarter in a row, and reported record revenue for Biktarvy.  While treatment prescription volumes remained below pre -pandemic levels, we maintained total U.S. and EU treatment market share and we grew Biktarvy share sequentially in both geographies. The PrEP market continues to recover in our PrEP market share is holding steady despite generic entry.  Overall, our third quarter results give us confidence that the HIV market is recovering from the pandemic and our market share clearly highlights Giliead strong market position. As a result of the strong quarter, we have increased our full-year revenue and earnings per share guidance. That [Indiscernible] now look set to deliver close to twice the revenue we expected at the start of the year. While our base business has clearly been affected by COVID, it has also shown resilience.  At the guidance midpoint, we are now expecting full year total revenue to be $1.75 billion higher than we expected at the start of the year. Our confidence in the longevity of our HIV business is in part-based on our progress in developing the next generation of HIV therapy and prevention. Lenacapavir is the cornerstone of that work, and we have 4 clinical trials evaluating Lenacapavir across treatment and prevention, highlighting our efforts to extend the options available to people living with or at risk of HIV.  This quarter, Lenacapavir was granted FDA priority review for the heavily treatment experienced population. As a reminder, Lenacapavir has breakthrough therapy designation, and if approved, would be the first long-acting treatment for people living with HIV who have multi-drug resistance, as well as the first available 6-month long acting subcutaneous injection treatment for HIV. Separately, as you know, we signed an agreement with Merck earlier this year to explore combinations of Lenacapavir and Eslatrivir in long acting treatment.  Earlier this week, we announced the start of a Phase 2 study with Mark evaluating, lenacapavir, eslatrir, long acting oral combination treatment. Our approach to long acting is very much shaped by people living with HIV. We've heard that they would welcome weekly oral or infrequent subcutaneous injections that could coincide with routine office visits or even be taken at home.  The advantages of these options include greater convenience, that potential for stronger adherence and privacy. Lenacapavir has shown promising potential in both oral and subcutaneous injections and will continue to advance both options while updating you on our progress throughout. While extending our leadership in HIV, we're also executing on the significant potential in our broad and diverse oncology portfolio.  This has potential that could bring transformational benefits for people with cancer and value for our stakeholders. Third quarter highlights include the initiation of 2 solid tumor trials from magrolimab, head and neck cancer and a multi - tumor basket study. We plan to initiate an additional Phase III study in first-line unfit, acute myeloid leukemia or AML in early 2022.  The FDA approval of Tecartus for adult relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia or ALL, is our fourth approved indication in cell therapy. Additionally, the Kite team has filed an SBLA for Yescarta and second-line LBCL, which if approved, would be the first CAR T therapy in earlier line setting. And a positive CHMP opinion for Trodelvy in second-line metastatic tripling of breast cancer earlier this month, we expect an approval decision from the European Commission later this year.  And this could potentially be our 6th approval for Trodelvy in triple-negative breast cancer in 2021. Additionally, we've just announced a new clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck to evaluate the combination of Gilead's TROP -2 antibody drug conjugate for Trodelvy with Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA for the treatment of first-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.  When we acquired immunomedics last year, we said that we would explore the use of Trodelvy across a wide range of tumor types, and that we would pursue combinations with both internal and external molecules. You can see this start to play out now with this Merck partnership as an early example of our approach.  Next on Slide 5, I'm pleased to note that we delivered on 3 of our target milestones for the quarter. You'll also note that the timelines for TROPiCS-02 and the Phase Ib Magrolimab have shifted as we now expect to have the PFS readout for TROPiCS-02 in late January or early February. And the topline readout for the Phase Ib Magrolimab in the First Quarter of 2022. Merdad will also touch on this later in the call.  But as you know, these modest timeline adjustments are quite normal in oncology, especially event-driven trials like TROPiCS-02. We look forward to sharing these updates in the first quarter of 2022. Taken as a whole, our oncology portfolio now stands some of the most promising targets in the field today. In addition to Trodelvy for TROP-2, CD47 and cell therapy. These include TIGIT, adenosine and many others.  We are very encouraged by the momentum across these programs and look forward to sharing much more in the coming quarters. The positive momentum overall in the third quarter gives us great confidence in the direction we are taking and the pace of our progress. We are well on our way with the plans to sustain our leadership in HIV. And while there is much more to come in oncology, we've already begun to execute on the potential in our highly promising portfolio.  That glory is making a significant impact as the pandemic continues to evolve. And we are well-placed for when the HIV market bounces back. I want to thank all the Gilead kind of employees around the world who are making all this possible with their passion for scientific excellence, and their commitment to global public health. With that, I'll hand over to Johanna, who will share an update on the commercial performance in the third quarter.\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Dan. And good afternoon everyone. As you can see on Slide 7, total product sales of $7.4 billion grew 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by Veklury. Excluding Veklury, total product sales were $5.4 billion down 3% year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs.  Offset by continued growth in Biktarvy and contributions from our new medicines such as Trodelvy. On Slide 8, Veklury sales of 1.9 billion were up a 132% sequentially, and reflected strong U.S. demand consistent with the recent surge in COVID cases, including the Delta variant. Over 60% of patients hospitalized with COVID -19 in the U.S. with these Veklury, and we continue to expect the Veklury sales to track hospitalizations, which you can see peaked at the end of August and have been declining ever since.  Moving to HIV on Slide 9, revenue of 4.2 billion grew 6% sequentially driven by favorable net pricing and strong demand for Biktarvy, partially offset by continuation of the trends toward the less favorable payer mix. Our sequential trends were strong, total HIV revenues were down 8% year-over-year, given the impact of Truvada -Atripla LOEs and lower channel inventory, primarily driven by pandemic-related stocking in the prior year.  Excluding the impact of the LOEs, HIV revenues were up 4% year-over-year. Overall, we're encouraged by the improving trends in HIV treatment. The U.S. HIV treatment market grew about 3% sequentially, suggesting a modest pickup from the recovery that started in Q2. Our steer at the overall U.S. HIV treatment market continues to hold steady at approximately 75%. And reflecting the modest pandemic recovery and strong share gain, Biktarvy revenues grew 20% year-over-year, and 14% sequentially to a record $2.3 billion.  Descovy revenue of $433 million was flat quarter-over-quarter, driven by increased demand and inventory, offset by lower net price. We continue to see recovery year-to-date with the PRAC market growing 12% quarter-over-quarter, and our encouraged to see Descovy shareholding study around 45%, despite the availability of multi-source generic versions of Truvada.  Next on Slide 10, Biktarvy continues to gain market share sequentially and year-over-year, both in the U.S. and EU5. We're particularly pleased to see sequential quarterly growth of 1.5% in the US and 1% in the EU5, especially given Biktarvy's leading market share. We're proud to see continued uptake of Biktarvy now capturing 41% of the total treatment market in the U.S. with more than 57% of people living with HIV starting treatment on Biktarvy.  On Slide 11 HCV revenue of 429 million was down 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable settlement in the Third Quarter of 2020 that did not repeat. Fewer patient starts outside of the U.S. and the timing of Department of Corrections purchases on a relative basis. Sequentially, [Indiscernible] revenue declined 22% due to inventory dynamics, including a sizable purchase by the Department of Corrections in the prior quarter and fewer patients\u2019 stats.  Although stats improved in some geographies year-over-year, we saw sequential declines in the U.S. and Europe, driven by continued pandemic-related impact on patient visits, and lower testing volumes in additional -- in addition to normal seasonality. However, we continue to be pleased that Gilead HPD market share is holding steady around 60% in the U.S. and just about 50% in the EU5. Moving to Slide 12, HBV and HDV revenues of $247 million wrap 17% year-over-year, driven by Vemlidy demand in international markets and the addition of Hepcludex to our portfolio.  Q3 revenue for Hepcludex was $12 million reflecting sales now in Germany, France, Austria, and Greece. We are actively working with government authorities to secure full reimbursement in a major European market in 2022. Moving to Trodelvy on Slide 13, third quarter revenue of a $101 million grew 13% quarter-over-quarter, driven by increased share in metastatic TNBC in part due to the expansion to second-line. Trodelvy was approved for second-line metastatic TNBC in the U.S. in April.  And we already estimate that approximately 15% of second-line patients are receiving Trodelvy. In third line or later setting, we estimate that about a third of patients with metastatic TNBC are receiving Trodelvy. In urothelial cancer, at least one in four bladder cancer patients in the third line or later setting, start treatment on Trodelvy. And with adoption and second-line still, there's continued opportunity for growth across both settings. We are pleased with the uptake so far and remain focused on broadening physician awareness in community settings. Following recent NCCN, breast cancer, and ASMO clinical guideline updates.  Trodelvy is now included as a preferred regimen in second-line metastatic TNBC in both guidelines. And we expect this will drive further adoption. We are preparing the first commercial launches of Trodelvy from metastatic TNBC in Great Britain, Australia, Canada, and Switzerland. And later this year, we are expecting a decision from the European Commission following the recent positive opinion from the CHMP. Next, on slide 14, and on behalf of Christy and the Kite team, our cell therapy products grew 51% year-over-year to $222 million.  This was driven by LBCL demand and strong launches in both mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, more than offsetting the expected impact of new U.S. entrants in LBCL. With the addition of our new MCL and FL indications, we are particularly proud that we have maintained our best-in-class manufacturing operations within 97% reliability rate. To support our expected growth, we are working to bring our new Maryland facility online in mid-2022, which will automate many of our manual processes and reduce costs. We also want to highlight the recent FDA approval of Tecartus in adults ALL.  This Makes Tecartus the first and only Car T therapy now available to these eligible patients in the U.S. The Kite team has also filed a supplemental BLA for Yescarta in second-line LBCL, which would bring us one step closer to potentially carrying even more patients. Kristy is here with the team and available to take questions on cell therapy during the Q&A. And with that, I hand it over to Merdad for pipeline updates.\nMerdad Parsey: Thank you Jyna. As always, our focus today on the most important updates and refer you to the appendix of the earnings presentation for a more comprehensive view of our pipeline programs. First on Slide 16 in HIV prevention, we've initiated the 5,000-plus Phase III PURPOSE-1 trials, getting Lenacapavir for the prevention in adolescent girls and young women who are risk of HIV infection.  We're also in the initial stages of recruiting for Purpose-2, to evaluate Lenacapavir for prevention over 3,000 cisgender men, transgender, and gender non-binary who have sex with men. We will provide updated timelines once enrollment is further along. In HIV treatment, the FDA granted priority review in August for Lenacapavir for the treatment of people living with HIV who have developed multi-drug resistance to other antiretrovirals.  This is based on compelling CAPELLA data that demonstrated 81% of heavily treatment experienced individuals achieved viral suppression when Lenacapavir was combined with an optimized background regimen. The PDUFA action date has been set for February 28th 2022, and if approved, Lenacapavir would become the first available 6 months long acting subcutaneous injection treatment for HIV.  Earlier this week, we announced that enrollment head started for the Phase 2 trial, for the long-acting oral combination of Lenacapavir and Eslatrivir. This is part of our collaborative work with Merck to develop more flexible options for people living with HIV with a once-weekly oral pill. Gilliat is leading the development in clinical work for this oral combination. And Merck is leading the clinical work for the injectable combination that is expected to enter Phase 1 clinical trials next year.  Moving to Veklury on Slide 17, we presented a late breaker at the IDWeek 2021 conference last month based on the Phase 3 pine trees study evaluating Veklury as an outpatient intravenous COVID -19 treatment. The results demonstrated that a three-day course of Veklury significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization for high-risk patients with COVID -19. In particular, Veklury demonstrated a statistically significant 87% reduction in risk of the composite primary endpoint of COVID -19 related hospitalizations or all-cause mortality by day 28 compared with placebo.  There were no deaths in either arm of the study by day 28. We stopped PINETREE enrollment at the halfway mark of 584 patients in April due to the COVID -19 landscape at the time. But the study remains blinded and collected outcome data and the enrolled patients. Upon analysis of those data, the results were highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful. Again, demonstrating the efficacy of Veklury.  It also emphasizes the importance of early treatment with antiviral therapies. We have submitted these data to the FDA as an SNDA filing, and our discussions with federal regulatory agencies to explore approval for IV Veklury in an outpatient setting. We're also continuing our work to develop novel oral antivirals for the treatment of COVID -19. Moving to Slide 18, we continue to view Trodelvy as a pipeline interproduct. Trodelvy targets TROP-2, which is overexpressed in many solid tumor cells.  So, we believe that Trodelvy can have a meaningful impact on a wide - range of cancers. In addition to the second-line metastatic TNBC and in second-line bladder indications that are approved today. We're all eagerly anticipating the readout from the Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 study, a randomized Phase 3 trial in HR-positive HER2 -negative metastatic breast cancer. As a reminder, this is an event-driven trial evaluating disease progression. And we have not yet achieved the target number of events. As such, we now expect to have the top line data readout in late January or early February.  To be clear, data, announcements will only begin once we achieve the required number of events. We remain confident for the potential Trodelvy to deliver a clinically meaningful benefit to patients with HR-positive or 2-negative metastatic breast cancer. We also continue to do advance Trodelvy into registrational studies for other indications. For example, as recently posted on clinicaltrials.gov, we plan to initiate the Phase 3 trial in second to third line non-small cell lung cancer at risk, and look forward to sharing updates for other solid tumors as we expand the program.  As Dan mentioned, we'll also start to work with Merck on the New York clinical study looking at Trodelvy in combination with Merck's KEYTRUDA for first-line metastatic TNBC and plan to initiate the trial in the first half of 2022. Moving onto Slide 19, we continue to believe that with its synergistic potential in the safety profile observed to date [Indiscernible] could benefit patients with a variety of hematologic and solid tumors. As you know, our initial focus has been MDS and AML.  While our commitment to these patients remains unchanged, we continue to evolve our clinical programs in the context of the recent development in the MDS therapeutic landscape. The ongoing Phase 3 enhanced trial evaluating Magrolimab in higher-risk MDS is on track and enrolling well. We will discuss our development plans and regulatory path forward with the FDA before the end of the year. Meanwhile, the data from our Phase Ib trial continues to mature.  We now expect to share top line data in First Quarter of 2022. Looking beyond MDS, our enhanced 2 trial from Magrolimab in first-line TP53 mutant AML is ongoing, targeting the new therapeutic option for nearly 2,000 patients in the U.S. In addition, an estimated 6,000 patients in the U.S. are diagnosed and treated annually with unfit AML. So, we're expanding our development efforts to initiate a Phase III trial for one -- first-line unfit AML by early next year.  Over the past few months, we've initiated 2 solid tumor trials from Magrolimab. One in head and neck cancer, and a separate solid tumor basket study for patients with non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, and urothelial cancer. We also plan to initiate a third study in metastatic TNBC. Based on broad CD-47 expression for [Indiscernible] bimagrumab potential to be an effective therapy for solid tumors, and look forward to sharing more updates as they become available.  Next, on behalf of Christy and the Kite team, I also wanted to highlight the most recent approvals for Tecartus in adults with relapsed or refractory ALL on slide 20. There's an incredibly high unmet need for these patients with 50% of adult patients relapsing on currently available treatment. The approval was based on data from ZUMA-3, which demonstrated 65% of patients who achieved complete remission.  Additionally, as Johanna mentioned earlier, Kite has filed the sBLA for Yescarta and second-line LBCL. With a medium follow-up of 2 years, the study met the primary endpoint of event-free survival with a hazard ratio of 0.398 and a P-value of less than 0.0001, representing a potential significant advance in the standard of care for LBCL patients.  We look forward to reviewing the entire dataset a dash and expect an update next year on approval status. Lastly, moving to Slide 21, we remain very excited about our oncology partners whose works expands many promising new pathways in oncology. For example, our partners at Arcus has a pipeline that includes not only anti-TIGIT candidates but also CD73 and adenosine receptor inhibitors to promote immune responses and inhibit tumor growth.  We continue to expect to trigger the opt-in review period for Arcus ' domvanalimab likely later this year or early next year, pending the review of more mature data. Additionally, through our partnerships, we have access to several candidates that could help modulate immunosuppressive and tumor permissive cell types and pathways, including [Indiscernible] HLAGE checkpoint inhibitor, which recently expanded to Phase 1b study.  And Johnson CCR -8 Inhibitor, which received IND clearance last quarter. Other potential opt-in programs from partners include Pioneers, [Indiscernible] antibodies which are in Phase 1 trials in actively enrolling patients, and a Genesis CD-137 agonist, which is expected to be evaluated in the combination trial that will be initiated later this year. In closing on slide 22, our teams are focused on executing across our oncology virology and inflammation pipeline.  And while it's still early days for our inflammation portfolio remain committed and invested in continuing to advance our pipeline across various mechanisms of action, such as [Indiscernible] four, Alpha 4 Beta 7, and Tippl 2 in combination with our opt-in partners, our pipeline portfolio spans many of the most promising targets across our three therapeutic focus areas. Very excited and committed to build out our best-in-class and industry-leading franchise. Now hand it over to Andy.\nAndrew Dickinson: Thank you Merdad. And good afternoon, everyone. Moving to Slide 24, as you've heard from Johanna, our financial performance in the Third Quarter overall was strong, with total product sales up 13% year-over-year, driven by Veklury's continued role in the pandemic.  Year-over-year, total product sales excluding Veklury, fell 3% due to Truvada in a triple sales following their loss of exclusivity late last year, offset in part by the continued demand for Biktarvy and contributions from our new medicines such as Trodelvy. Sequentially, total product sales excluding Veklury were up 2%, highlighting the ongoing pandemic recovery in HIV treatment and PrEP. This was partially offset by HCV where new starts in both the U.S. and Europe continued to be impacted by the pandemic.  Turning to the rest of the P&L, non-GAAP product gross margin was 90%, 350 basis points higher year-over-year, reflecting the reversal of a previously recorded $175 million litigation reserve, as well as lower royalty expense and a change in product mix. Non-GAAP R&D was $1.1 billion down 4% year-over-year, reflecting lower remdesivir and inflammation-related expenses, offset in part by increased clinical investment in Trodelvy and Magrolimab.  Non-GAAP SG&A was $1.2 billion up 8% year-over-year, driven by increased promotional and marketing activities across all of our geographies primarily for Trodelvy. On tax, we realized a higher effective tax rate of 18.9% for the third quarter, we're up 50 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to a prior-year net discrete tax benefit.  Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.65 for the quarter compared to $2.11 for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher Veklury sales and product gross margin offset by a higher SG&A lower interest income and higher effective tax rate. On Slide 25, you can see that Veklury has already exceeded our prior guidance for the year with total revenues of 4.2 billion in the first nine months.  As a result, and with modestly updated expectations for the rest of our business, we are increasing our revenue and earnings per share guidance for the full-year by 6% and 13% at the mid-point respectively, as shown on Slide 26. After the wave of infections and hospitalizations in recent months, we believe we have moved past the peak of the pandemic for the year. We continue to expect that Veklury will play an important role in the treatment of patients with COVID -19 globally.  However, assuming we do not experience another surge, we expect Veklury revenue to step down significantly in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are raising our full-year total product sales in the range of 26 billion to 26.3 billion compared to our previous range of 24.4 billion to 25 billion reflecting results year-to-date in Veklury performance. We now expect full-year Veklury revenues to be in the range of 4.5 billion to 4.8 billion, up from our prior outlook of 2.7 billion to 3.1 billion.  We continue to expect that sales of Veklury will track COVID -19 related hospitalizations. We now expect full-year total product sales excluding Veklury to be approximately 21.5 billion compared to the prior range of 21.7 billion to 21.9 billion, reflecting our performance year-to-date in continued pandemic related impact. As for the rest of our P&L, we expect our non-GAAP product gross margin to be approximately 87% compared to 86% to 87% previously, primarily reflecting the strong gross margin in the third quarter.  For non-GAAP operating expenses, we now expect R&D to decline mid-single-digit percentage compared to 2020 levels, as compared to our prior expectations of low to mid-single-digit percentage decline. We expect SG&A to be flat on a dollar basis compared to 2020 versus prior expectations of flat to low single-digit percentage decline. On our non-GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 21% this year.  Finally, with the updates to our revenue product gross margin and operating expenses, we now expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $7.90 and $8.10 for the full year. And GAAP diluted EPS to be between $5.50 and $5.70. On capital allocation, our priorities have not changed. We continue to invest in our business and at the same time, we've returned over $1 billion in the third quarter and $3.2 billion year-to-date to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.  We have also repaid $3.75 billion in debt this year. And earlier today, we notified our 3 non-call 1-bondholders that we would exercise our ability to repay $1 billion of the notes early. Taken together, we now expect to pay down $4.75 billion of debt this year, significantly exceeding our prior guidance to pay down at least $4 billion. With that, I'll invite the Operator to begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] We ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question. Then your line will be muted. If you have a follow-up, please re-queue. Our first question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMatthew Harrison: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Probably unsurprisingly, my question's for Merdad. Merdad, can you just comment maybe in a little bit more detail in terms of the assumptions that you previously made on TROPiCS-02 and how they were tracking or not tracking that caused you to make this change especially around the blinded event rate and anything else you were watching in the trial? Thanks.\nMerdad Parsey: Hi, Matthew. Sure. Happy to. Look, I think as you know, event-driven trials are inherently variable in terms of when the events occur and importantly, when those events come into the database. We had initially thought we would hit the mark this year, but as time has gone by, our best projections right now are that we'll hit that mark next year. And as we said, I think we will be able to share those results probably mid-January to mid-February time frame. That's how we're tracking to the events at this point.\nJohanna Mercier: Katherine, I think we're ready for our next call.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren with Cowen. Your line is open.\nTyler Van Buren: Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I have another one on TROPiCS-02. Can you just remind us or help set expectations in terms of what you feel is a clinically meaningful benefit on PFS? A lot of people seem to be taking it at around 2 months. If you do reach that sub two-month PFS benefit, let's say, a 1.6 or 1.7, would you guys still go ahead and file or how would you view the data? Thank you.\nDaniel O\u2019day: Thanks, Tyler. Yes, Merdad?\nMerdad Parsey: Yes, Tyler, thanks. I do think the consensus that folks have seen we would've agreed d that 2 months is that threshold for clinically meaningful. I think if we were to fall short of that, which is a difficult place to speculate and not our expectations.  But if that were to happen, we would look at the totality of the data. We'd want ed to look and see if there's other areas where we could provide benefit to patients, and we look at the totality of the data before deciding what we would do.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore. Your line is open.\nUmer Raffat: Hi. Maybe let me focus on the Ramdevsivir for a quick second. I'm just trying to understand the reported number a little better, it's a billion five in U.S. on third quarter, which if you re-express based on the [Indiscernible] that\u2019s near our price point would imply maybe 750 thousand patients on the drug in third quarter in U.S. and we know the total U.S. COVID hospitalizations were right around 750,000 in U.S. as well. Is it just reporting artifact [Indiscernible] estimates? I'm just trying to understand why this was materially different than the 50% to 60% penetration remdesivir historically had. And I'll spare my TROPiCS question for Merdad subsequent to the call.\nMerdad Parsey: Thanks, Umer. Go ahead, Johanna. You want to hit that one.\nJohanna Mercier: Sure. Umer, I think what -- so the $9 million that Dan referred to earlier is really a mix over the year, right? So that's a little bit different than what you're referring to. The $1.5 billion you asked, most of the sales actually of the total $1.9 billion, obviously coming out of the U.S. and the patient population.  So, I can't track your math per se, but what I would say is that the U.S. patient population, was the greatest, and if you just do the math on about a five-day therapy on average price for Ramdesivir that you would get to less than near 750, just doing it off the top of my head. I think it's probably a little bit lower than that and higher in other parts of the world just because of price points.\nMerdad Parsey: And Johanna the -- maybe also the color on the [Indiscernible] the current market share of patient for patients in the hospital.\nJohanna Mercier: Yeah, I thought probably a little bit north of the 60% that you're referring to. We've seen -- obviously we're looking at different databases, but we've seen up to close to 66%, 67% of share of Veklury in early days of hospitalization.  Obviously, often used with Demethazone and other inflame products that anti-inflammatory products. But we do see the share increase and we've seen that obviously with the surge in August and September, we saw that take out both from a protocol standpoint as well play out in the usage itself in the U.S. specifically.\nUmer Raffat: Thanks, Johanna.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBrian Abrahams: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Sticking with COVID, curious to learn more about. Your outlook on how COVID treatment will evolve into next year and beyond. I'm curious if you could give us a little bit more color around the efforts to develop oral direct-acting and antivirals for COVID that you spoke about at the beginning to call, are these primarily [Indiscernible] derivatives you're looking at protease inhibitors, potential combination cocktails. When might we learn more about those? Thanks.\nDaniel O\u2019day: Thanks, Brian. I think we've all been a little bit shy about predicting how the [Indiscernible] will continue to evolve because, I think, we've proven to be not always right on that. I'm going to let Merdad comment and I'll sort of the other team members have anything to comment. What I will say is back to the previous cash cushion from Umer is that there's no doubt that we see a direct connection correlation between Ramdev's use and outbreak. So that continues.  And as Johanna says we continue to get the market share, and there's also no doubt, Brian, to your point that the although injectable Ramdesivir continues to play a really important role around the world for hospitalized patients, and now the data, obviously we have in the outpatient setting. We're not satisfied yet, and we want to continue to put our science to work, and maybe Merdad, if you want to have any forecast on the future of pandemic to endemic, you're welcome to.\nMerdad Parsey: No, no. Thank you. No, I agree with Dan. I think it's incredibly difficult to predict outside of -- I think what we're all starting to believe is it'll be a combination of vaccines, therapeutics of various types, or course, anticipating changes in the virus over time, we'll have to keep an eye on it and see how it goes. Importantly, to date none of the variance have shown any resistance to [Indiscernible].  We think that's a positive outcome so far. We haven't disclosed yet what the oral compounds are going to be. They're -- we are moving them forward as quickly as possible and we'll share those data as those molecules begin to mature. But our hope is that they certainly provide an alternative treatment option, in particular, in the outpatient setting with Veklury remaining really a stalwart in the hospitalized and, potentially, the outpatient IV setting.\nAndrew Dickinson: And I would just add, Brian, I think it's fair to say that obviously we continue to work on oral versions of remdesivir. We have said before in the past, and to your point -- from a scientific standpoint, the opportunity to look at combination therapy and oral medicines for COVID to also anticipate future viral resistance. So those are all themes and then to Merdad, of course, the updating you as those medicines continue to move forward.\nDaniel O\u2019day: Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nGeoff Meacham: Afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Just had a bigger picture question on HIV. When you look in the pandemic, remdesivir has done quite well even this quarter, and your oncology pipeline has really grown.  But when we look at the core HIV business, long-term great -- long-term growth rate we used to think was high single-digits and it's much lower last year and this year and I know you have generics and I know the pandemic has affected the market, but the question is, do you think you'll go back to a higher long-term growth rate in HIV and maybe just help us with the drivers of that. Thank you very much.\nDaniel O\u2019day: Thank you, Geoff. So, Johanna.\nJohanna Mercier: Sure. Geoff, are you asking specifically the market or just generally?\nGeoff Meacham: For you guys, maybe [Indiscernible] for the market.\nJohanna Mercier: Okay. I think what we said in the second quarter was exactly what's playing out today. We have seen a little bit of a recovery in Q2 and we're seeing that recovery continue, actually, and accelerate a little bit into Q3. We're at about 3% growth, we're about 2% in Q2, and we were negative 3 quarters before that. What we're -- the -- what we're assuming at this point is, actually, we're going to get back from a market standpoint back to where we were prior to COVID.  We're just starting from a much lower base, so it's going to take a little bit of time. I think the assumption is that as we get to 2022, you will see that play out, assuming no other major surges come through. That's from a market standpoint, which, obviously, will help from a product standpoint. When you think about Biktarvy and you think of our growth year-on-year at about 20%, and then of course, double-digit growth on a quarterly basis as well.  We have different dynamics going on. Obviously, demand is still strong, so we're quite pleased with that. We grew about 1.5% share over the last quarter, over 6% in a full year. So, we're on a much larger base because we are our market leader. But we've also had some different pricing dynamics as well going on that are related to obviously the mix that we're looking at.  So that's something that has impacted directly by the pandemic. As you think about your government versus commercial mix, and we've seen PHS channels specifically grow a little bit more rapidly than any other segment over the last couple of quarters. So those are the dynamics that we're dealing with. But if you look at the basic demand, very strong in double-digit growth.\nAndrew Dickinson: Jac, it's probably -- Andy, it's also probably worth highlighting again, the difference in the PrEP market and the treatment market. They just joined a touch base on the treatment market that's exactly right. Remember that a lot of the growth that you're referring to a couple of years ago was driven by the incredibly strong PrEP market as well.  We think you will see that again, it's just going to take the introduction of Lenacapavir in a couple of years to get there. So, the dynamic in the treatment market, I think is relatively constant with what we've seen historically, it's just we're building off a bigger base as Johanna said. And the market will continue to grow and then you should see the PrEP dynamic coming back in and a couple of years in terms of driving additional growth.\nDaniel O\u2019day: Thanks Geoff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies, your line is open.\nMichael Yee: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. [Indiscernible] go to TROPiCS-02 I do think it's important. I wanted to ask for Merdad what his was on the importance of OS. Obviously, it would be immature and I think Mark, which suggests you could get OS later in '22. But if you do have a TFS benefit around, 2 months, how confident are you that it still be okay and confident around OS sitting and the crush over and other impacts wouldn't impede that result? maybe just comment on that a bit. Thank you.\nMerdad Parsey: Sure, Michael. Happy to. Look, I think as you recall, one of the reasons we modified the stage, it's important you go back to the early part of the year, when we modified this trial. We expanded the sample size and we changed the endpoint. And I think the main purpose behind modifying the sample size was to make sure that we could hit OS with the assumptions that we had in the trial.  So, I think if we hit PFS, we feel reasonably confident with all the caveats that you said right around crossover and things like that that are difficult to control, that we should be able to hit OS. So, I think that's important. And I think that really gets to the other underlying issue around this delay as we moved from investigator to central overrides of the progression events, those are the things that led to the slight delay here that we're talking about. But I think that all means we'll have a stronger outcome when the data are available.\nDaniel O\u2019day: And maybe just the risk because I know there's been several questions on O2 just to complement what Merdad had said. When we think about trials in the oncology space for all of us have a lot of experience, but it's certainly not uncommon when you think about event-driven trials to have to have the slight adjustments of timelines. And I would just point out that initially we anticipated that we would have this data and to Merdad's point with all the protocol adjustments that we did in the middle of the year in December of this year.  And now we're talking about those data coming in mid-January to mid-February. So, the timeline changes are really very minor. And in terms of the trial conduct and design, nothing has changed in regards to our confidence for TROPiCS-02. So, I just wanted to make sure I also had a chance to say that. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nCory Kasimov: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask you about the Arcus TIGIT program in which regard to the added data you expect to get on this asset to make the go-no-go decision. Is it just more durability or you're going to see more patients to basically just looking for your latest thoughts there on what it would take for you to opt-in. Thank you\nDaniel O\u2019day: Merdad, you want to take this?\nMerdad Parsey: Yeah. Sure. Thanks Corey. We do anticipate that the data move will mature, I think is what we've been thinking. And I think that's a combination of things. More patients per arm, as well as longer observation time for the patients that are enrolled in the study. We remain really interested in that and enthusiastic about that study.  And as I said, I think we feel that it's likely that we'll be able to make our opt-in decision this year. So, we continue to believe that that's where we're headed with those data. In total, I think we do expect to see a larger, more robust dataset to decide on.\nAndrew Dickinson: And as we said before, what we're looking for is clear separation of the doublet from single agent and we're looking for an ORR of over 50% in the doublet and hopefully in the triplet as well, that would be upside for us.\nJohanna Mercier: Katherine, we're ready for the next caller, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Garlow with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nAndrew Garlow: Hi. Thanks for taking my question and I just have one on the HIV pipeline. So, given you're collaborating with Merck on lenacapavir and [Indiscernible] as a combo? One of your competitors in this space claim that frontline standard of care needs to include an integration inhibitor. So, given your experience with [Indiscernible] do you agree or not that integrates Inhibitor as always likely to be needed in a first-line setting.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes. Thanks for the question. It's an interesting statement to make. We obviously don't believe that. That's why we're pursuing the combination approach that we are. So, I think the data will tell the story in the long run. We're pretty confident that we can get there with the combination approach that we're taking right now.\nDaniel O\u2019day: Thanks, Andrew.\nJohanna Mercier: Katherine our next caller.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nGeoffrey Porges: Thank you very much for taking the question. Why don't we go back to the [Indiscernible] impairment question for the core business? Perhaps you could give us a sense of where your stats for HCV and HIV in Q4 compared to Q4, 2019. And then secondarily, do you expect those businesses to grow in 2022? I know it's early for guidance, but you've obviously developed your plan already. Just be helpful to see how you're thinking about COVID impact on those core businesses.\nDaniel O\u2019day: Can I just clarify you meant Q3, Q3?\nGeoffrey Porges: No, we're in Q4 now. And I'm really trying to get a sense of -- you showed pretty clearly the decline in hospitalizations and in number of different therapeutic categories were recovering in Q4. So, really wondering where we are today compared to Q4 2019.\nDaniel O\u2019day: Got you. Johanna.\nJohanna Mercier: Sure. Let me start Geoff with that HBV and then I'll move onto HIV. So, at an HBV standpoint where we talked about being about 8% under year-over-year. A lot of that has to do with timing and pricing adjustments. So, it's not patient per se. We are actually flat pretty much year-over-year, about 2% positive.  What we did see though is market starts declined in Q3 and that's directly related to the pandemic, because less screening diagnosis, they were down again in Q3. And so, we believe that it will pick back up. I wouldn't go so much to say that it will be an increase. But I would say that we should be able to hold flat because you typically see HDV patient starts decline over time just because there's less patients that need the cure, but not as quickly as what we're seeing in the quarter.  So, we do think that will pick back up. It's -- so we would assume a little bit more tempered decline in 2022. The HIV piece of the puzzle, we still are seeing screenings and diagnosis less than pre - COVID -19. So, we're seeing about screenings 10% down versus 2019. And diagnosis, there's still 20% below 2019 levels. So as much as we're seeing recovery quarter-over-quarter, and we're excited about that, because that's in line with what we had assumed, we're still not back to the levels that we're needs to be.  And so I would say that you are now growing from a lower base and it's what we talked about in the last quarter where the assumption was it would come right back, but the dynamic market in HIV is very small and it's going to take a little bit longer, and therefore, we're just growing from a lower base and we do believe we'll get back to typical levels of a couple of single-digit growth from a market standpoint in 2022, is just going to take us a couple of quarters to get there. Hopefully that helps a little bit to give your perspective.\nGeoffrey Porges: That helps a lot. Thank you.\nDaniel O\u2019day: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas [Indiscernible] Securities. Your line is open.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just thinking big picture on your long-term growth. Obviously, there are a lot of questions here on Trodelvy and thinking about the HIV business as -- two core areas that are very important for your long-term growth.  Can you talk about how your expectations of Trodelvy market opportunity have changed from your initial acquisition? And if you don't see the data that you want to see from TROPiCS-02 how are you going to think about your strategy for growing the business? Because it seems like that is core to the long-term future of the Company. Thanks.\nDaniel O\u2019day: Right, thanks Robin. All of Andy start here, and certainly ask.\nAndrew Dickinson: Hey, Robyn, Thanks for the question. And Johanna may want to weigh in as well. Look, I think there are a number of growth drivers. If we just step back, when you think about long-term growth there has been a number of questions. Just to paint the picture again, there are a number of growth drivers that we see driving.  We don't provide specific long-term guidance. What we've said and we'll continue to say is that the HIV business, including the long-acting collaboration that you mentioned, Trodelvy, Magrolimab, Cell Therapy, and a number of the other programs, potentially the Arcus programs are expected to drive our long-term growth.  In the short run, we see a much more promising growth profile than we did historically. We think that we've done a lot to turn the Company around and now the growth profile is improving significantly from our perspective. When you get to '24 or '25, again, we've said we see an expected inflection in our growth profile as a lot of these programs that are currently in the clinic hopefully reach the commercialization, including a number of the Trodelvy programs.  On Trodelvy, specifically, I think we continue to be very bullish on the prospects for Trodelvy overall. Similar to where we were when we did the transaction. So, you'll remember, we highlighted there are a number of ways to win with Trodelvy when we acquired Immunomedics. The hormone-receptor positive study was just one of those studies. Obviously, we're excited about the work that we're doing in lung cancer and other areas. So, there's a much broader clinical development plan for Trodelvy then the market probably fully appreciates today.  The announcement with Merck earlier today is a good example of that. That will give you a sense of where we're going and we expect to give you a much greater sense of that overall. So, I think at a macro level before I ask Johanna to comment, I'd say our expectations for Trodelvy have not changed. We continue to be very enthusiastic about where we are and where we're going and there's lots of different ways for us to get there over time.\nJohanna Mercier: Yeah. No, I -- thanks, Andy. I would just add, I think we are pleased with where we're going with Trodelvy today in the short-term. We still believe that there's a lot of growth opportunities specifically in the earlier lines setting betting both across triple-negative breast cancer, as well as bladder cancer.  And so, we're seeing those opportunities play out. I think the guidelines are going to help us set up for success, let alone setup for future pipeline studies such as HR -positive coming through, hopefully. in a positive way as you mentioned, and that should just [Indiscernible] expand our market opportunity even more so.  The only thing I would add to what Andy was saying is also on the HIV front, we are not looking just at the oncology opportunities, but also from an HIV standpoint, we still believe that TAR - VIR is foundational to our HIV opportunities. In addition to of course, Lenacapavir that Merdad spoke too earlier. So, we're excited about what we have going on there as well.\nDaniel O\u2019day: Thank you, Robyn.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ronny Gal with Bernstein, your line is open.\nRonny Gal: Good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask a little bit about the agreement between -- about a combination of Trodelvy and Keytruda. This might get a piece of economics that Trodelvy, can you talk a little bit about the elements of the agreement. And then one of your peers signed an agreement with Merck on non-small cell lung cancer. And I was wondering, are those steps of agreements exclusive that is, they can have another TROP-2 ADC in triple negative breast cancer, and you may partner with them in lung cancer as well.\nAndrew Dickinson: Yes. Hi Ronny. it's Andy. Thank you for the question. It's relatively straightforward, this is a straightforward, simple clinical collaboration Merck is providing Trodelvy. They obviously had input on the study design KEYTRUDA. I'm sorry, KEYTRUDA. To be studied, thank you.  They do not have any economics on Trodelvy as a result of the study, but they will enjoy hopefully they've added benefits to KEYTRUDA on their end. And these studies are not exclusive. They have the ability to do other studies in the same area with other agents, including other TROP-2 antibodies. And we have the ability to do studies with other PD-1 inhibitors as well. And of course, we started in triple-negative breast cancer.  You're highlighting that there's another study that they will do with another TROP-2 inhibitor in lung cancer. That of course is an area that we're going to look at as well. So, I expect that there's more to come, but these are relatively straightforward, simple, plain vanilla clinical collaborations.\nDaniel O\u2019day: And its part of our strategy, right Ronny, to scale the opportunity with Trodelvy because there's many things we can do ourselves. But frankly, given the multi - tumor opportunity for Trodelvy, engaging in partnerships like this allows us to expand much more than we could ourselves. And I think it's the beginning of what you'll see from as we look to really expand the promise and potential of Trodelvy.\nJohanna Mercier: Katherine, I think maybe we have time for 2 more questions.\nOperator: Okay. Our next one comes from Brian Skorney with Baird. Your line is open.\nBrian Skorney: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I guess we'll be seeing a bunch of potentially transformative data in Large B-cell Lymphoma in a couple of months, I assume at ASH. I guess in addition to your own data, just thoughts on given the Telerik success, how do you think about the potential for CAR - T19 to move upwards into the frontline setting, and does the success of... actually change the market opportunity in your view for second-line as well? Thanks.\nDaniel O\u2019day: That's fine. Christy, please.\nChristi Shaw: Sure. Yes, we're very excited about our submission at the end of September for second-line and expect to hear back on the status from FDA first half of next year. But we will be presenting the data at ASH, as you said, and CAR T is really the only potential cure we're seeing right now. So, when you look at the out of class second-line agents and moving to frontline.  It typically has been a delay to [Indiscernible]. And now with this new study coming out, we'll have to see what that exact duration will be for those patients. We hope it will be successful, but we don't see a huge impact to our projections in the cell therapy marketplace. Second-line actually allows us to basically double the market that we can play in, which is about 14 thousand patients in the US.  That combined with you'll also see our frontline data ZUMA-12 which was completed, we'll be presenting that at ASH as well. You will see that on frontline, second-line and see how it may stack up, although they're not head-to-head trial. We're pretty confident in where we are, and it doesn't really change our projections for the future of cell therapy or for our specific brands.\nJohanna Mercier: Katherine, maybe just our last question, please.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open.\nCarter Gould: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe just one on the long study that's going to get started later this year for Trodelvy. You've characterized that study at risk, but presumably you've had some insight from the basket study. Is that a fair assumption, and could we see data from that basket study, maybe by the time we see TROPiCS-02 data? Thank you.\nMerdad Parsey: Thanks. Great question. Our -- we're looking at the totality of the data we have. It's not just the TROPiCS-03 data, we're looking at the totality of the data in line that we have accumulated, and that's really the approach we're taking. So, I take your point, and it's arguably not that bigger risk given the data we've seen.  We -- I would not expect for us to be sharing those data around the time of the tropics, too, but we do -- we will plan on sharing those data over time. So, we'll definitely share those data over time, but for now, we're pretty excited by it what we've seen in terms of the Trodelvy performance in [Indiscernible]\nDaniel O\u2019day: [Indiscernible]\nOperator: That's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Jacquie Ross for closing remarks.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you, Katherine. And thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and look forward to updating you on our progress.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Merdad Parsey",
            "content": "Thank you Jyna. As always, our focus today on the most important updates and refer you to the appendix of the earnings presentation for a more comprehensive view of our pipeline programs. First on Slide 16 in HIV prevention, we've initiated the 5,000-plus Phase III PURPOSE-1 trials, getting Lenacapavir for the prevention in adolescent girls and young women who are risk of HIV infection.  We're also in the initial stages of recruiting for Purpose-2, to evaluate Lenacapavir for prevention over 3,000 cisgender men, transgender, and gender non-binary who have sex with men. We will provide updated timelines once enrollment is further along. In HIV treatment, the FDA granted priority review in August for Lenacapavir for the treatment of people living with HIV who have developed multi-drug resistance to other antiretrovirals.  This is based on compelling CAPELLA data that demonstrated 81% of heavily treatment experienced individuals achieved viral suppression when Lenacapavir was combined with an optimized background regimen. The PDUFA action date has been set for February 28th 2022, and if approved, Lenacapavir would become the first available 6 months long acting subcutaneous injection treatment for HIV.  Earlier this week, we announced that enrollment head started for the Phase 2 trial, for the long-acting oral combination of Lenacapavir and Eslatrivir. This is part of our collaborative work with Merck to develop more flexible options for people living with HIV with a once-weekly oral pill. Gilliat is leading the development in clinical work for this oral combination. And Merck is leading the clinical work for the injectable combination that is expected to enter Phase 1 clinical trials next year.  Moving to Veklury on Slide 17, we presented a late breaker at the IDWeek 2021 conference last month based on the Phase 3 pine trees study evaluating Veklury as an outpatient intravenous COVID -19 treatment. The results demonstrated that a three-day course of Veklury significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization for high-risk patients with COVID -19. In particular, Veklury demonstrated a statistically significant 87% reduction in risk of the composite primary endpoint of COVID -19 related hospitalizations or all-cause mortality by day 28 compared with placebo.  There were no deaths in either arm of the study by day 28. We stopped PINETREE enrollment at the halfway mark of 584 patients in April due to the COVID -19 landscape at the time. But the study remains blinded and collected outcome data and the enrolled patients. Upon analysis of those data, the results were highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful. Again, demonstrating the efficacy of Veklury.  It also emphasizes the importance of early treatment with antiviral therapies. We have submitted these data to the FDA as an SNDA filing, and our discussions with federal regulatory agencies to explore approval for IV Veklury in an outpatient setting. We're also continuing our work to develop novel oral antivirals for the treatment of COVID -19. Moving to Slide 18, we continue to view Trodelvy as a pipeline interproduct. Trodelvy targets TROP-2, which is overexpressed in many solid tumor cells.  So, we believe that Trodelvy can have a meaningful impact on a wide - range of cancers. In addition to the second-line metastatic TNBC and in second-line bladder indications that are approved today. We're all eagerly anticipating the readout from the Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 study, a randomized Phase 3 trial in HR-positive HER2 -negative metastatic breast cancer. As a reminder, this is an event-driven trial evaluating disease progression. And we have not yet achieved the target number of events. As such, we now expect to have the top line data readout in late January or early February.  To be clear, data, announcements will only begin once we achieve the required number of events. We remain confident for the potential Trodelvy to deliver a clinically meaningful benefit to patients with HR-positive or 2-negative metastatic breast cancer. We also continue to do advance Trodelvy into registrational studies for other indications. For example, as recently posted on clinicaltrials.gov, we plan to initiate the Phase 3 trial in second to third line non-small cell lung cancer at risk, and look forward to sharing updates for other solid tumors as we expand the program.  As Dan mentioned, we'll also start to work with Merck on the New York clinical study looking at Trodelvy in combination with Merck's KEYTRUDA for first-line metastatic TNBC and plan to initiate the trial in the first half of 2022. Moving onto Slide 19, we continue to believe that with its synergistic potential in the safety profile observed to date [Indiscernible] could benefit patients with a variety of hematologic and solid tumors. As you know, our initial focus has been MDS and AML.  While our commitment to these patients remains unchanged, we continue to evolve our clinical programs in the context of the recent development in the MDS therapeutic landscape. The ongoing Phase 3 enhanced trial evaluating Magrolimab in higher-risk MDS is on track and enrolling well. We will discuss our development plans and regulatory path forward with the FDA before the end of the year. Meanwhile, the data from our Phase Ib trial continues to mature.  We now expect to share top line data in First Quarter of 2022. Looking beyond MDS, our enhanced 2 trial from Magrolimab in first-line TP53 mutant AML is ongoing, targeting the new therapeutic option for nearly 2,000 patients in the U.S. In addition, an estimated 6,000 patients in the U.S. are diagnosed and treated annually with unfit AML. So, we're expanding our development efforts to initiate a Phase III trial for one -- first-line unfit AML by early next year.  Over the past few months, we've initiated 2 solid tumor trials from Magrolimab. One in head and neck cancer, and a separate solid tumor basket study for patients with non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, and urothelial cancer. We also plan to initiate a third study in metastatic TNBC. Based on broad CD-47 expression for [Indiscernible] bimagrumab potential to be an effective therapy for solid tumors, and look forward to sharing more updates as they become available.  Next, on behalf of Christy and the Kite team, I also wanted to highlight the most recent approvals for Tecartus in adults with relapsed or refractory ALL on slide 20. There's an incredibly high unmet need for these patients with 50% of adult patients relapsing on currently available treatment. The approval was based on data from ZUMA-3, which demonstrated 65% of patients who achieved complete remission.  Additionally, as Johanna mentioned earlier, Kite has filed the sBLA for Yescarta and second-line LBCL. With a medium follow-up of 2 years, the study met the primary endpoint of event-free survival with a hazard ratio of 0.398 and a P-value of less than 0.0001, representing a potential significant advance in the standard of care for LBCL patients.  We look forward to reviewing the entire dataset a dash and expect an update next year on approval status. Lastly, moving to Slide 21, we remain very excited about our oncology partners whose works expands many promising new pathways in oncology. For example, our partners at Arcus has a pipeline that includes not only anti-TIGIT candidates but also CD73 and adenosine receptor inhibitors to promote immune responses and inhibit tumor growth.  We continue to expect to trigger the opt-in review period for Arcus ' domvanalimab likely later this year or early next year, pending the review of more mature data. Additionally, through our partnerships, we have access to several candidates that could help modulate immunosuppressive and tumor permissive cell types and pathways, including [Indiscernible] HLAGE checkpoint inhibitor, which recently expanded to Phase 1b study.  And Johnson CCR -8 Inhibitor, which received IND clearance last quarter. Other potential opt-in programs from partners include Pioneers, [Indiscernible] antibodies which are in Phase 1 trials in actively enrolling patients, and a Genesis CD-137 agonist, which is expected to be evaluated in the combination trial that will be initiated later this year. In closing on slide 22, our teams are focused on executing across our oncology virology and inflammation pipeline.  And while it's still early days for our inflammation portfolio remain committed and invested in continuing to advance our pipeline across various mechanisms of action, such as [Indiscernible] four, Alpha 4 Beta 7, and Tippl 2 in combination with our opt-in partners, our pipeline portfolio spans many of the most promising targets across our three therapeutic focus areas. Very excited and committed to build out our best-in-class and industry-leading franchise. Now hand it over to Andy. Hi, Matthew. Sure. Happy to. Look, I think as you know, event-driven trials are inherently variable in terms of when the events occur and importantly, when those events come into the database. We had initially thought we would hit the mark this year, but as time has gone by, our best projections right now are that we'll hit that mark next year. And as we said, I think we will be able to share those results probably mid-January to mid-February time frame. That's how we're tracking to the events at this point. Yes, Tyler, thanks. I do think the consensus that folks have seen we would've agreed d that 2 months is that threshold for clinically meaningful. I think if we were to fall short of that, which is a difficult place to speculate and not our expectations.  But if that were to happen, we would look at the totality of the data. We'd want ed to look and see if there's other areas where we could provide benefit to patients, and we look at the totality of the data before deciding what we would do. Thanks, Umer. Go ahead, Johanna. You want to hit that one. And Johanna the -- maybe also the color on the [Indiscernible] the current market share of patient for patients in the hospital. No, no. Thank you. No, I agree with Dan. I think it's incredibly difficult to predict outside of -- I think what we're all starting to believe is it'll be a combination of vaccines, therapeutics of various types, or course, anticipating changes in the virus over time, we'll have to keep an eye on it and see how it goes. Importantly, to date none of the variance have shown any resistance to [Indiscernible].  We think that's a positive outcome so far. We haven't disclosed yet what the oral compounds are going to be. They're -- we are moving them forward as quickly as possible and we'll share those data as those molecules begin to mature. But our hope is that they certainly provide an alternative treatment option, in particular, in the outpatient setting with Veklury remaining really a stalwart in the hospitalized and, potentially, the outpatient IV setting. Sure, Michael. Happy to. Look, I think as you recall, one of the reasons we modified the stage, it's important you go back to the early part of the year, when we modified this trial. We expanded the sample size and we changed the endpoint. And I think the main purpose behind modifying the sample size was to make sure that we could hit OS with the assumptions that we had in the trial.  So, I think if we hit PFS, we feel reasonably confident with all the caveats that you said right around crossover and things like that that are difficult to control, that we should be able to hit OS. So, I think that's important. And I think that really gets to the other underlying issue around this delay as we moved from investigator to central overrides of the progression events, those are the things that led to the slight delay here that we're talking about. But I think that all means we'll have a stronger outcome when the data are available. Yeah. Sure. Thanks Corey. We do anticipate that the data move will mature, I think is what we've been thinking. And I think that's a combination of things. More patients per arm, as well as longer observation time for the patients that are enrolled in the study. We remain really interested in that and enthusiastic about that study.  And as I said, I think we feel that it's likely that we'll be able to make our opt-in decision this year. So, we continue to believe that that's where we're headed with those data. In total, I think we do expect to see a larger, more robust dataset to decide on. Yes. Thanks for the question. It's an interesting statement to make. We obviously don't believe that. That's why we're pursuing the combination approach that we are. So, I think the data will tell the story in the long run. We're pretty confident that we can get there with the combination approach that we're taking right now. Thanks. Great question. Our -- we're looking at the totality of the data we have. It's not just the TROPiCS-03 data, we're looking at the totality of the data in line that we have accumulated, and that's really the approach we're taking. So, I take your point, and it's arguably not that bigger risk given the data we've seen.  We -- I would not expect for us to be sharing those data around the time of the tropics, too, but we do -- we will plan on sharing those data over time. So, we'll definitely share those data over time, but for now, we're pretty excited by it what we've seen in terms of the Trodelvy performance in [Indiscernible]"

            "content": "To the significant reduction in the risk of hospitalizations after a three-day IV treatment of Veklury and the outpatient setting. In order to meet additional treatment needs, we also continued to advance our oral programs to develop a novel best-in-class therapy. Turning to HIV performance, we saw positive gains in the treatment market for the second quarter in a row, and reported record revenue for Biktarvy.  While treatment prescription volumes remained below pre -pandemic levels, we maintained total U.S. and EU treatment market share and we grew Biktarvy share sequentially in both geographies. The PrEP market continues to recover in our PrEP market share is holding steady despite generic entry.  Overall, our third quarter results give us confidence that the HIV market is recovering from the pandemic and our market share clearly highlights Giliead strong market position. As a result of the strong quarter, we have increased our full-year revenue and earnings per share guidance. That [Indiscernible] now look set to deliver close to twice the revenue we expected at the start of the year. While our base business has clearly been affected by COVID, it has also shown resilience.  At the guidance midpoint, we are now expecting full year total revenue to be $1.75 billion higher than we expected at the start of the year. Our confidence in the longevity of our HIV business is in part-based on our progress in developing the next generation of HIV therapy and prevention. Lenacapavir is the cornerstone of that work, and we have 4 clinical trials evaluating Lenacapavir across treatment and prevention, highlighting our efforts to extend the options available to people living with or at risk of HIV.  This quarter, Lenacapavir was granted FDA priority review for the heavily treatment experienced population. As a reminder, Lenacapavir has breakthrough therapy designation, and if approved, would be the first long-acting treatment for people living with HIV who have multi-drug resistance, as well as the first available 6-month long acting subcutaneous injection treatment for HIV. Separately, as you know, we signed an agreement with Merck earlier this year to explore combinations of Lenacapavir and Eslatrivir in long acting treatment.  Earlier this week, we announced the start of a Phase 2 study with Mark evaluating, lenacapavir, eslatrir, long acting oral combination treatment. Our approach to long acting is very much shaped by people living with HIV. We've heard that they would welcome weekly oral or infrequent subcutaneous injections that could coincide with routine office visits or even be taken at home.  The advantages of these options include greater convenience, that potential for stronger adherence and privacy. Lenacapavir has shown promising potential in both oral and subcutaneous injections and will continue to advance both options while updating you on our progress throughout. While extending our leadership in HIV, we're also executing on the significant potential in our broad and diverse oncology portfolio.  This has potential that could bring transformational benefits for people with cancer and value for our stakeholders. Third quarter highlights include the initiation of 2 solid tumor trials from magrolimab, head and neck cancer and a multi - tumor basket study. We plan to initiate an additional Phase III study in first-line unfit, acute myeloid leukemia or AML in early 2022.  The FDA approval of Tecartus for adult relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia or ALL, is our fourth approved indication in cell therapy. Additionally, the Kite team has filed an SBLA for Yescarta and second-line LBCL, which if approved, would be the first CAR T therapy in earlier line setting. And a positive CHMP opinion for Trodelvy in second-line metastatic tripling of breast cancer earlier this month, we expect an approval decision from the European Commission later this year.  And this could potentially be our 6th approval for Trodelvy in triple-negative breast cancer in 2021. Additionally, we've just announced a new clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck to evaluate the combination of Gilead's TROP -2 antibody drug conjugate for Trodelvy with Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA for the treatment of first-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.  When we acquired immunomedics last year, we said that we would explore the use of Trodelvy across a wide range of tumor types, and that we would pursue combinations with both internal and external molecules. You can see this start to play out now with this Merck partnership as an early example of our approach.  Next on Slide 5, I'm pleased to note that we delivered on 3 of our target milestones for the quarter. You'll also note that the timelines for TROPiCS-02 and the Phase Ib Magrolimab have shifted as we now expect to have the PFS readout for TROPiCS-02 in late January or early February. And the topline readout for the Phase Ib Magrolimab in the First Quarter of 2022. Merdad will also touch on this later in the call.  But as you know, these modest timeline adjustments are quite normal in oncology, especially event-driven trials like TROPiCS-02. We look forward to sharing these updates in the first quarter of 2022. Taken as a whole, our oncology portfolio now stands some of the most promising targets in the field today. In addition to Trodelvy for TROP-2, CD47 and cell therapy. These include TIGIT, adenosine and many others.  We are very encouraged by the momentum across these programs and look forward to sharing much more in the coming quarters. The positive momentum overall in the third quarter gives us great confidence in the direction we are taking and the pace of our progress. We are well on our way with the plans to sustain our leadership in HIV. And while there is much more to come in oncology, we've already begun to execute on the potential in our highly promising portfolio.  That glory is making a significant impact as the pandemic continues to evolve. And we are well-placed for when the HIV market bounces back. I want to thank all the Gilead kind of employees around the world who are making all this possible with their passion for scientific excellence, and their commitment to global public health. With that, I'll hand over to Johanna, who will share an update on the commercial performance in the third quarter. Thanks, Tyler. Yes, Merdad? Thanks, Brian. I think we've all been a little bit shy about predicting how the [Indiscernible] will continue to evolve because, I think, we've proven to be not always right on that. I'm going to let Merdad comment and I'll sort of the other team members have anything to comment. What I will say is back to the previous cash cushion from Umer is that there's no doubt that we see a direct connection correlation between Ramdev's use and outbreak. So that continues.  And as Johanna says we continue to get the market share, and there's also no doubt, Brian, to your point that the although injectable Ramdesivir continues to play a really important role around the world for hospitalized patients, and now the data, obviously we have in the outpatient setting. We're not satisfied yet, and we want to continue to put our science to work, and maybe Merdad, if you want to have any forecast on the future of pandemic to endemic, you're welcome to. Thanks, Brian. Thank you, Geoff. So, Johanna. Thanks Geoff. And maybe just the risk because I know there's been several questions on O2 just to complement what Merdad had said. When we think about trials in the oncology space for all of us have a lot of experience, but it's certainly not uncommon when you think about event-driven trials to have to have the slight adjustments of timelines. And I would just point out that initially we anticipated that we would have this data and to Merdad's point with all the protocol adjustments that we did in the middle of the year in December of this year.  And now we're talking about those data coming in mid-January to mid-February. So, the timeline changes are really very minor. And in terms of the trial conduct and design, nothing has changed in regards to our confidence for TROPiCS-02. So, I just wanted to make sure I also had a chance to say that. Thanks, Mike. Merdad, you want to take this? Thanks, Andrew. Can I just clarify you meant Q3, Q3? Got you. Johanna. Thank you. Right, thanks Robin. All of Andy start here, and certainly ask. Thank you, Robyn. And its part of our strategy, right Ronny, to scale the opportunity with Trodelvy because there's many things we can do ourselves. But frankly, given the multi - tumor opportunity for Trodelvy, engaging in partnerships like this allows us to expand much more than we could ourselves. And I think it's the beginning of what you'll see from as we look to really expand the promise and potential of Trodelvy. That's fine. Christy, please. [Indiscernible]"

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Andrew Dickinson",
            "content": "Thank you Merdad. And good afternoon, everyone. Moving to Slide 24, as you've heard from Johanna, our financial performance in the Third Quarter overall was strong, with total product sales up 13% year-over-year, driven by Veklury's continued role in the pandemic.  Year-over-year, total product sales excluding Veklury, fell 3% due to Truvada in a triple sales following their loss of exclusivity late last year, offset in part by the continued demand for Biktarvy and contributions from our new medicines such as Trodelvy. Sequentially, total product sales excluding Veklury were up 2%, highlighting the ongoing pandemic recovery in HIV treatment and PrEP. This was partially offset by HCV where new starts in both the U.S. and Europe continued to be impacted by the pandemic.  Turning to the rest of the P&L, non-GAAP product gross margin was 90%, 350 basis points higher year-over-year, reflecting the reversal of a previously recorded $175 million litigation reserve, as well as lower royalty expense and a change in product mix. Non-GAAP R&D was $1.1 billion down 4% year-over-year, reflecting lower remdesivir and inflammation-related expenses, offset in part by increased clinical investment in Trodelvy and Magrolimab.  Non-GAAP SG&A was $1.2 billion up 8% year-over-year, driven by increased promotional and marketing activities across all of our geographies primarily for Trodelvy. On tax, we realized a higher effective tax rate of 18.9% for the third quarter, we're up 50 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to a prior-year net discrete tax benefit.  Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.65 for the quarter compared to $2.11 for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher Veklury sales and product gross margin offset by a higher SG&A lower interest income and higher effective tax rate. On Slide 25, you can see that Veklury has already exceeded our prior guidance for the year with total revenues of 4.2 billion in the first nine months.  As a result, and with modestly updated expectations for the rest of our business, we are increasing our revenue and earnings per share guidance for the full-year by 6% and 13% at the mid-point respectively, as shown on Slide 26. After the wave of infections and hospitalizations in recent months, we believe we have moved past the peak of the pandemic for the year. We continue to expect that Veklury will play an important role in the treatment of patients with COVID -19 globally.  However, assuming we do not experience another surge, we expect Veklury revenue to step down significantly in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are raising our full-year total product sales in the range of 26 billion to 26.3 billion compared to our previous range of 24.4 billion to 25 billion reflecting results year-to-date in Veklury performance. We now expect full-year Veklury revenues to be in the range of 4.5 billion to 4.8 billion, up from our prior outlook of 2.7 billion to 3.1 billion.  We continue to expect that sales of Veklury will track COVID -19 related hospitalizations. We now expect full-year total product sales excluding Veklury to be approximately 21.5 billion compared to the prior range of 21.7 billion to 21.9 billion, reflecting our performance year-to-date in continued pandemic related impact. As for the rest of our P&L, we expect our non-GAAP product gross margin to be approximately 87% compared to 86% to 87% previously, primarily reflecting the strong gross margin in the third quarter.  For non-GAAP operating expenses, we now expect R&D to decline mid-single-digit percentage compared to 2020 levels, as compared to our prior expectations of low to mid-single-digit percentage decline. We expect SG&A to be flat on a dollar basis compared to 2020 versus prior expectations of flat to low single-digit percentage decline. On our non-GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 21% this year.  Finally, with the updates to our revenue product gross margin and operating expenses, we now expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $7.90 and $8.10 for the full year. And GAAP diluted EPS to be between $5.50 and $5.70. On capital allocation, our priorities have not changed. We continue to invest in our business and at the same time, we've returned over $1 billion in the third quarter and $3.2 billion year-to-date to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.  We have also repaid $3.75 billion in debt this year. And earlier today, we notified our 3 non-call 1-bondholders that we would exercise our ability to repay $1 billion of the notes early. Taken together, we now expect to pay down $4.75 billion of debt this year, significantly exceeding our prior guidance to pay down at least $4 billion. With that, I'll invite the Operator to begin the Q&A. And I would just add, Brian, I think it's fair to say that obviously we continue to work on oral versions of remdesivir. We have said before in the past, and to your point -- from a scientific standpoint, the opportunity to look at combination therapy and oral medicines for COVID to also anticipate future viral resistance. So those are all themes and then to Merdad, of course, the updating you as those medicines continue to move forward. Jac, it's probably -- Andy, it's also probably worth highlighting again, the difference in the PrEP market and the treatment market. They just joined a touch base on the treatment market that's exactly right. Remember that a lot of the growth that you're referring to a couple of years ago was driven by the incredibly strong PrEP market as well.  We think you will see that again, it's just going to take the introduction of Lenacapavir in a couple of years to get there. So, the dynamic in the treatment market, I think is relatively constant with what we've seen historically, it's just we're building off a bigger base as Johanna said. And the market will continue to grow and then you should see the PrEP dynamic coming back in and a couple of years in terms of driving additional growth. And as we said before, what we're looking for is clear separation of the doublet from single agent and we're looking for an ORR of over 50% in the doublet and hopefully in the triplet as well, that would be upside for us. Hey, Robyn, Thanks for the question. And Johanna may want to weigh in as well. Look, I think there are a number of growth drivers. If we just step back, when you think about long-term growth there has been a number of questions. Just to paint the picture again, there are a number of growth drivers that we see driving.  We don't provide specific long-term guidance. What we've said and we'll continue to say is that the HIV business, including the long-acting collaboration that you mentioned, Trodelvy, Magrolimab, Cell Therapy, and a number of the other programs, potentially the Arcus programs are expected to drive our long-term growth.  In the short run, we see a much more promising growth profile than we did historically. We think that we've done a lot to turn the Company around and now the growth profile is improving significantly from our perspective. When you get to '24 or '25, again, we've said we see an expected inflection in our growth profile as a lot of these programs that are currently in the clinic hopefully reach the commercialization, including a number of the Trodelvy programs.  On Trodelvy, specifically, I think we continue to be very bullish on the prospects for Trodelvy overall. Similar to where we were when we did the transaction. So, you'll remember, we highlighted there are a number of ways to win with Trodelvy when we acquired Immunomedics. The hormone-receptor positive study was just one of those studies. Obviously, we're excited about the work that we're doing in lung cancer and other areas. So, there's a much broader clinical development plan for Trodelvy then the market probably fully appreciates today.  The announcement with Merck earlier today is a good example of that. That will give you a sense of where we're going and we expect to give you a much greater sense of that overall. So, I think at a macro level before I ask Johanna to comment, I'd say our expectations for Trodelvy have not changed. We continue to be very enthusiastic about where we are and where we're going and there's lots of different ways for us to get there over time. Yes. Hi Ronny. it's Andy. Thank you for the question. It's relatively straightforward, this is a straightforward, simple clinical collaboration Merck is providing Trodelvy. They obviously had input on the study design KEYTRUDA. I'm sorry, KEYTRUDA. To be studied, thank you.  They do not have any economics on Trodelvy as a result of the study, but they will enjoy hopefully they've added benefits to KEYTRUDA on their end. And these studies are not exclusive. They have the ability to do other studies in the same area with other agents, including other TROP-2 antibodies. And we have the ability to do studies with other PD-1 inhibitors as well. And of course, we started in triple-negative breast cancer.  You're highlighting that there's another study that they will do with another TROP-2 inhibitor in lung cancer. That of course is an area that we're going to look at as well. So, I expect that there's more to come, but these are relatively straightforward, simple, plain vanilla clinical collaborations."

            "name": "Johanna Mercier",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan. And good afternoon everyone. As you can see on Slide 7, total product sales of $7.4 billion grew 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by Veklury. Excluding Veklury, total product sales were $5.4 billion down 3% year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs.  Offset by continued growth in Biktarvy and contributions from our new medicines such as Trodelvy. On Slide 8, Veklury sales of 1.9 billion were up a 132% sequentially, and reflected strong U.S. demand consistent with the recent surge in COVID cases, including the Delta variant. Over 60% of patients hospitalized with COVID -19 in the U.S. with these Veklury, and we continue to expect the Veklury sales to track hospitalizations, which you can see peaked at the end of August and have been declining ever since.  Moving to HIV on Slide 9, revenue of 4.2 billion grew 6% sequentially driven by favorable net pricing and strong demand for Biktarvy, partially offset by continuation of the trends toward the less favorable payer mix. Our sequential trends were strong, total HIV revenues were down 8% year-over-year, given the impact of Truvada -Atripla LOEs and lower channel inventory, primarily driven by pandemic-related stocking in the prior year.  Excluding the impact of the LOEs, HIV revenues were up 4% year-over-year. Overall, we're encouraged by the improving trends in HIV treatment. The U.S. HIV treatment market grew about 3% sequentially, suggesting a modest pickup from the recovery that started in Q2. Our steer at the overall U.S. HIV treatment market continues to hold steady at approximately 75%. And reflecting the modest pandemic recovery and strong share gain, Biktarvy revenues grew 20% year-over-year, and 14% sequentially to a record $2.3 billion.  Descovy revenue of $433 million was flat quarter-over-quarter, driven by increased demand and inventory, offset by lower net price. We continue to see recovery year-to-date with the PRAC market growing 12% quarter-over-quarter, and our encouraged to see Descovy shareholding study around 45%, despite the availability of multi-source generic versions of Truvada.  Next on Slide 10, Biktarvy continues to gain market share sequentially and year-over-year, both in the U.S. and EU5. We're particularly pleased to see sequential quarterly growth of 1.5% in the US and 1% in the EU5, especially given Biktarvy's leading market share. We're proud to see continued uptake of Biktarvy now capturing 41% of the total treatment market in the U.S. with more than 57% of people living with HIV starting treatment on Biktarvy.  On Slide 11 HCV revenue of 429 million was down 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable settlement in the Third Quarter of 2020 that did not repeat. Fewer patient starts outside of the U.S. and the timing of Department of Corrections purchases on a relative basis. Sequentially, [Indiscernible] revenue declined 22% due to inventory dynamics, including a sizable purchase by the Department of Corrections in the prior quarter and fewer patients' stats.  Although stats improved in some geographies year-over-year, we saw sequential declines in the U.S. and Europe, driven by continued pandemic-related impact on patient visits, and lower testing volumes in additional -- in addition to normal seasonality. However, we continue to be pleased that Gilead HPD market share is holding steady around 60% in the U.S. and just about 50% in the EU5. Moving to Slide 12, HBV and HDV revenues of $247 million wrap 17% year-over-year, driven by Vemlidy demand in international markets and the addition of Hepcludex to our portfolio.  Q3 revenue for Hepcludex was $12 million reflecting sales now in Germany, France, Austria, and Greece. We are actively working with government authorities to secure full reimbursement in a major European market in 2022. Moving to Trodelvy on Slide 13, third quarter revenue of a $101 million grew 13% quarter-over-quarter, driven by increased share in metastatic TNBC in part due to the expansion to second-line. Trodelvy was approved for second-line metastatic TNBC in the U.S. in April.  And we already estimate that approximately 15% of second-line patients are receiving Trodelvy. In third line or later setting, we estimate that about a third of patients with metastatic TNBC are receiving Trodelvy. In urothelial cancer, at least one in four bladder cancer patients in the third line or later setting, start treatment on Trodelvy. And with adoption and second-line still, there's continued opportunity for growth across both settings. We are pleased with the uptake so far and remain focused on broadening physician awareness in community settings. Following recent NCCN, breast cancer, and ASMO clinical guideline updates.  Trodelvy is now included as a preferred regimen in second-line metastatic TNBC in both guidelines. And we expect this will drive further adoption. We are preparing the first commercial launches of Trodelvy from metastatic TNBC in Great Britain, Australia, Canada, and Switzerland. And later this year, we are expecting a decision from the European Commission following the recent positive opinion from the CHMP. Next, on slide 14, and on behalf of Christy and the Kite team, our cell therapy products grew 51% year-over-year to $222 million.  This was driven by LBCL demand and strong launches in both mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, more than offsetting the expected impact of new U.S. entrants in LBCL. With the addition of our new MCL and FL indications, we are particularly proud that we have maintained our best-in-class manufacturing operations within 97% reliability rate. To support our expected growth, we are working to bring our new Maryland facility online in mid-2022, which will automate many of our manual processes and reduce costs. We also want to highlight the recent FDA approval of Tecartus in adults ALL.  This Makes Tecartus the first and only Car T therapy now available to these eligible patients in the U.S. The Kite team has also filed a supplemental BLA for Yescarta in second-line LBCL, which would bring us one step closer to potentially carrying even more patients. Kristy is here with the team and available to take questions on cell therapy during the Q&A. And with that, I hand it over to Merdad for pipeline updates. Katherine, I think we're ready for our next call. Sure. Umer, I think what -- so the $9 million that Dan referred to earlier is really a mix over the year, right? So that's a little bit different than what you're referring to. The $1.5 billion you asked, most of the sales actually of the total $1.9 billion, obviously coming out of the U.S. and the patient population.  So, I can't track your math per se, but what I would say is that the U.S. patient population, was the greatest, and if you just do the math on about a five-day therapy on average price for Ramdesivir that you would get to less than near 750, just doing it off the top of my head. I think it's probably a little bit lower than that and higher in other parts of the world just because of price points. Yeah, I thought probably a little bit north of the 60% that you're referring to. We've seen -- obviously we're looking at different databases, but we've seen up to close to 66%, 67% of share of Veklury in early days of hospitalization.  Obviously, often used with Demethazone and other inflame products that anti-inflammatory products. But we do see the share increase and we've seen that obviously with the surge in August and September, we saw that take out both from a protocol standpoint as well play out in the usage itself in the U.S. specifically. Sure. Geoff, are you asking specifically the market or just generally? Okay. I think what we said in the second quarter was exactly what's playing out today. We have seen a little bit of a recovery in Q2 and we're seeing that recovery continue, actually, and accelerate a little bit into Q3. We're at about 3% growth, we're about 2% in Q2, and we were negative 3 quarters before that. What we're -- the -- what we're assuming at this point is, actually, we're going to get back from a market standpoint back to where we were prior to COVID.  We're just starting from a much lower base, so it's going to take a little bit of time. I think the assumption is that as we get to 2022, you will see that play out, assuming no other major surges come through. That's from a market standpoint, which, obviously, will help from a product standpoint. When you think about Biktarvy and you think of our growth year-on-year at about 20%, and then of course, double-digit growth on a quarterly basis as well.  We have different dynamics going on. Obviously, demand is still strong, so we're quite pleased with that. We grew about 1.5% share over the last quarter, over 6% in a full year. So, we're on a much larger base because we are our market leader. But we've also had some different pricing dynamics as well going on that are related to obviously the mix that we're looking at.  So that's something that has impacted directly by the pandemic. As you think about your government versus commercial mix, and we've seen PHS channels specifically grow a little bit more rapidly than any other segment over the last couple of quarters. So those are the dynamics that we're dealing with. But if you look at the basic demand, very strong in double-digit growth. Katherine, we're ready for the next caller, please. Katherine our next caller. Sure. Let me start Geoff with that HBV and then I'll move onto HIV. So, at an HBV standpoint where we talked about being about 8% under year-over-year. A lot of that has to do with timing and pricing adjustments. So, it's not patient per se. We are actually flat pretty much year-over-year, about 2% positive.  What we did see though is market starts declined in Q3 and that's directly related to the pandemic, because less screening diagnosis, they were down again in Q3. And so, we believe that it will pick back up. I wouldn't go so much to say that it will be an increase. But I would say that we should be able to hold flat because you typically see HDV patient starts decline over time just because there's less patients that need the cure, but not as quickly as what we're seeing in the quarter.  So, we do think that will pick back up. It's -- so we would assume a little bit more tempered decline in 2022. The HIV piece of the puzzle, we still are seeing screenings and diagnosis less than pre - COVID -19. So, we're seeing about screenings 10% down versus 2019. And diagnosis, there's still 20% below 2019 levels. So as much as we're seeing recovery quarter-over-quarter, and we're excited about that, because that's in line with what we had assumed, we're still not back to the levels that we're needs to be.  And so I would say that you are now growing from a lower base and it's what we talked about in the last quarter where the assumption was it would come right back, but the dynamic market in HIV is very small and it's going to take a little bit longer, and therefore, we're just growing from a lower base and we do believe we'll get back to typical levels of a couple of single-digit growth from a market standpoint in 2022, is just going to take us a couple of quarters to get there. Hopefully that helps a little bit to give your perspective. Yeah. No, I -- thanks, Andy. I would just add, I think we are pleased with where we're going with Trodelvy today in the short-term. We still believe that there's a lot of growth opportunities specifically in the earlier lines setting betting both across triple-negative breast cancer, as well as bladder cancer.  And so, we're seeing those opportunities play out. I think the guidelines are going to help us set up for success, let alone setup for future pipeline studies such as HR -positive coming through, hopefully. in a positive way as you mentioned, and that should just [Indiscernible] expand our market opportunity even more so.  The only thing I would add to what Andy was saying is also on the HIV front, we are not looking just at the oncology opportunities, but also from an HIV standpoint, we still believe that TAR - VIR is foundational to our HIV opportunities. In addition to of course, Lenacapavir that Merdad spoke too earlier. So, we're excited about what we have going on there as well. Katherine, I think maybe we have time for 2 more questions. Katherine, maybe just our last question, please."

But we will be presenting the data at ASH, as you said, and CAR T is really the only potential cure we're seeing right now. So, when you look at the out of class second-line agents and moving to frontline.  It typically has been a delay to [Indiscernible]. And now with this new study coming out, we'll have to see what that exact duration will be for those patients. We hope it will be successful, but we don't see a huge impact to our projections in the cell therapy marketplace. Second-line actually allows us to basically double the market that we can play in, which is about 14 thousand patients in the US.  That combined with you'll also see our frontline data ZUMA-12 which was completed, we'll be presenting that at ASH as well. You will see that on frontline, second-line and see how it may stack up, although they're not head-to-head trial. We're pretty confident in where we are, and it doesn't really change our projections for the future of cell therapy or for our specific brands."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jacquie Ross, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you, Joelle. And good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the second quarter of 2021. The press release, slides, and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com.  The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open up the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Christi Shaw, the Chief Executive Officer of Kite.  Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward\u2010looking statements, including those related to the impact of the COVID\u201019 pandemic on Gilead's business, financial condition and results of operations; plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, financial projections and the use of capital; and 2021 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward\u2010looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward\u2010looking statements.  Non\u2010GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non\u2010GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet, as well as on the Gilead website.  I will now turn the call over to Dan. \nDaniel O'Day: Thank you, Jacquie. And good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join us today. We're pleased to provide you with an update on our second quarter, where we delivered solid financial performance and significant progress on our increasingly diverse pipeline.  2021 is an important year for our pipeline, and we're very encouraged by the milestones we've achieved \u2013 for therapies that are potentially transformative for Gilead and for patients. All of this reinforces our confidence in our strategic direction.  I want to take this opportunity to thank our global community of Gilead and Kite employees who consistently go above and beyond to drive progress, with resilience and dedication. Different parts of the world are riding the ebb and flow of COVID\u201019 cases at various times, and while the vaccines give us hope and optimism, we are still very much living with the pandemic. Remdesivir continues to play an important role in fighting the virus and has now been used to treat an estimated 7 million hospitalized patients worldwide.  Turning to the main highlights of the quarter on slide 4. The second quarter was a solid quarter overall. Veklury sales of $829 million were once again higher than anticipated, offsetting the lingering impact of the pandemic, particularly on HIV treatment.  In light of this pandemic impact, Biktarvy's performance is quite encouraging. Revenue for the quarter was $2 billion, up 24%, or $390 million from the same quarter last year. This more than offset the $322 million headwind associated with the impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs. Much of that headwind is now, of course, behind us.  Overall, our share of the HIV treatment market held steady quarter\u2010over\u2010quarter, and our PrEP share remained steady even with generic entries. These dynamics give us confidence that the underlying demand for our HIV products remains strong, and positions us well for growth as the overall HIV market recovery gains momentum.  Moving to our clinical pipeline, 2021 is a catalyst heavy year for Gilead and we have delivered all of our key first half pipeline commitments. Among other milestones, we shared top line data from the highly anticipated ZUMA\u20107 trial where Yescarta improved event\u2010free survival for second line Large B\u2010cell Lymphoma, or LBCL, patients by 60% compared to the standard of care. This is truly a landmark trial \u2013 the first and largest reported Phase III trial readout that demonstrates the efficacy and safety of cell therapy, and we are excited by the opportunity to bring the potential benefits of cell therapy to patients in earlier lines.  We shared positive Phase III data from MYR 301 which will help support our anticipated BLA filing for Hepcludex for HDV in the US later this year, and we submitted our NDA for use of lenacapavir in the heavily treatment experienced population with multidrug resistance. This filing was based on data from Phase II/III CAPELLA study presented earlier this month. We also shared strong lenacapavir data from the Phase II CALIBRATE study in HIV treatment, which will be used to inform our broader lenacapavir efforts.  Our partner Arcus provided an interim update for ARC\u20107 that supports the continuation of both the ARC\u20107 and ARC\u201010 trials for their anti\u2010TIGIT candidate, domvanalimab.  Lastly, on slide 4, we are beginning to see the positive impact of our strategy, which we introduced early last year. The business is diversifying across indications and therapies. In particular, we are seeing Cell Therapy and Trodelvy contribute to growth and expect they will be key growth drivers for Gilead. While we build out the oncology business, we remain focused and committed on ensuring the long\u2010term competitive positioning of our virology portfolio. Next, on slide 5, we highlighted our pipeline execution so far this year, and I'd like to thank all those who helped us to deliver on this ambitious agenda, including our employees, the people who participated in the studies, our partners, and the study investigators.  As we look ahead to the rest of the year, our target milestones include a progression free survival, or PFS, readout in our event\u2010driven Phase III TROPiCS\u201002 study evaluating Trodelvy in hormone receptor positive/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer; a Phase Ib data readout for magrolimab in myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS. Depending on the data, timing and results, this could result in a BLA submission for accelerated approval. And initiation of the potential Phase II lenacapavir and islatravir long\u2010acting oral combination. As you know, this is in collaboration with Merck and the development and formulation work remains on track. We look forward to updating you next quarter about additional milestone progress.  We understand that continued strong and consistent pipeline execution is critical to extending the virology business and expanding further into oncology. We believe our current and pipeline therapies can address significant unmet needs.  We are very encouraged by the progress Gilead and Kite are making. We are well on our way in our journey to expand and diversify into new therapeutic areas, and we are already seeing the evolution of both our pipeline and commercial portfolio.  With that, I'll hand over to Johanna who will share an update on our commercial performance for the second quarter. \nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Dan. And good afternoon, everyone. Starting on slide 7, total product sales of $6.2 billion were up 21% year-over-year, primarily reflecting Veklury which was not a contributor to revenue in the second quarter of 2020.  On slide 8, Veklury second quarter revenues of $829 million declined sequentially, reflecting the impact of higher vaccination rates and lower infection and hospitalization in many regions. While hospitalizations trended lower in the second quarter, Veklury remained the therapy of choice in 3 out of 5 patients hospitalized with COVID\u201019.  We estimate that, since the launch in May 2020, roughly 7 million patients globally have been treated with remdesivir. It's truly remarkable and encouraging to see how remdesivir continues to play such a key role in fighting this global pandemic.  Excluding Veklury, total product sales of $5.3 billion were up 5% year\u2010over\u2010year. We saw growth in cell therapy and HCV, in addition to new revenue contributions from Trodelvy and, more modestly, Hepcludex for HDV.  Additionally, other product revenues of $291 million grew 20% year\u2010over\u2010year, driven by increased demand for AmBisome outside the US to treat mucormycosis, which has seen a rising incidence in patients hospitalized with COVID\u201019. Sequentially, we saw 9% growth for total product sales excluding Veklury, primarily driven by growth in Biktarvy.  Moving to slide 9, HIV product sales were $3.9 billion, up 8% sequentially and down 2% year\u2010over year. Compared to the second quarter of 2020, total HIV revenue reflected strong Biktarvy growth that more than offset the $322 million lower revenue from Truvada and Atripla following the loss of exclusivity. Compared to last quarter, HIV grew $288 million, reflecting customary seasonal inventory dynamics and growing demand for treatment.  Biktarvy revenue of $2 billion was up 24% year\u2010over\u2010year and 9% sequentially, with quarter-over-quarter growth primarily driven by increased demand. Biktarvy remains the number one prescribed therapy in the US across na\u00efve, switch and continuing patients and remains number one in na\u00efve across all EU5 countries. Approximately 70% of switches from both Gilead and non\u2010Gilead regimens result in incremental revenue. Overall, and despite the ongoing impact of the pandemic, Biktarvy continues to gain market share with 1% share growth versus last quarter in both the US as well as the EU5.  Descovy revenues of $435 million grew 21% sequentially, due to a modest improvement in the demand for PrEP and more favorable inventory and pricing dynamics that we typically see in the second quarter relative to the first.  As we highlighted in prior quarters, we have been working with payers to ensure patients continue to have access to Descovy in light of entry of generic alternatives for Truvada. We're really pleased to see this strong sequential growth in Descovy, and we continue to maintain mid\u201040% share despite generic impacts.  Year\u2010over\u2010year, Descovy grew 4% largely due to higher demand for PrEP. And, overall, PrEP demand is showing signs of recovery and is expected to continue to improve as pandemic restrictions phase out.  Earlier this month, federal FAQs for the US preventive services task force were released. It provided greater clarity as to the importance of PrEP in ending the epidemic, and we are really encouraged by this recent development. We hope it will help us to minimize the barriers of PrEP use going forward.  Before I transition to other products, I just want to take a moment to share some perspective on the HIV treatment market, given the longer than expected pandemic impact.  In regions outside the US, such as Europe, we are beginning to see signs of recovery in the dynamic market, with second quarter trends generally in line with our expectations. In the US, however, the pace of pandemic recovery was slower than we expected in this last quarter, and while we are seeing signs of recovery in PrEP and some sequential growth in the treatment market, it's clear that it will take several quarters for treatment to return to pre\u2010pandemic levels.  In treatment, there are really two pandemic\u2010related headwinds that we observed. First, lower HIV screening and diagnosis resulting in lower treatment initiation. And second, due to the limited support services available during the pandemic, we have seen a higher number of patients discontinue their HIV treatments.  Taken together, these factors have reduced the number of active patients on HIV therapy entering 2021, thereby reducing the overall volume of new and refill prescriptions we would expect to see in 2021. We did, however, see growth resume from this lower base in the second quarter. After prior quarter-over-quarter declines, second quarter US HIV treatment prescriptions grew 2%, and we expect the market to grow at historical rates once screening and diagnosis rates return to pre\u2010pandemic levels.  To continue our efforts to advance progress against the HIV epidemic, we are partnering with healthcare professionals, advocacy groups, and policy makers to raise awareness of the unique challenges COVID19 poses to HIV screening, diagnosis, and adherence. Our goal is to help health care providers ensure that patients continue to be diagnosed and treated.  Given the strength of the demand fundamentals for Biktarvy, Descovy for PrEP, and other Gilead HIV products, we remain confident in our competitive positioning now that many communities are easing social distancing requirements.  In the meantime, we continue to see strength in underlying treatment demand with no material changes in the competitive landscape, with our total Gilead treatment market share holding steady at 75% in the US and just under 50% in Europe, despite competition and the entry of new generics.  Next, on slide 10, HCV product sales in the second quarter were $549 million, up 23% compared to last year, but patient starts remain well below pre\u2010pandemic levels. The growth reflects a modest sequential recovery in HCV patient starts in the US in Q2 2021, in addition to an artificially low Q2 of 2020 that was impacted by unfavorable government rebate adjustments. We will be watching for further signs of recovery in the third quarter. Both US and EU Gilead market shares remain steady around 60% and 50%, respectively.  Moving to slide 11, HBV and HDV product sales were $237 million, up 8% year\u2010over\u2010year, with improving patient starts on Vemlidy, particularly in ex\u2010US markets.  In its first full quarter as part of Gilead, Hepcludex contributed $7 million and is currently available in France, Germany, and Austria. We are excited to be working with the various reimbursement authorities to increase patient access and expect to secure full reimbursement in the major European markets in 2022.  Moving to Trodelvy on slide 12, product sales in the second quarter were $89 million, up 24% quarter-over-quarter, driven by demand for the two new indications approved in April, namely second line plus metastatic triple negative breast cancer and urothelial cancer.  We continue to be encouraged by the positive feedback from physicians on the Phase III ASCENT data, which demonstrated one\u2010year median overall survival benefit for second\u2010line metastatic TNBC patients treated with Trodelvy.  To build on this growing interest, we're increasing community awareness, especially of the expanded indication to second\u2010line in TNBC. And we expect to see growing demand as breast cancer screening ramps back up to pre\u2010pandemic levels.  IQVIA data suggest that breast cancer screening volumes were about 20% lower in the US in 2020 compared to 2019. This suggests as many as 41,500 breast cancer patients have not been diagnosed during the pandemic.  On behalf of Christi and the Kite team, I'm pleased to share our cell therapy commercial update on slide 13. Total cell therapy product sales totaled $219 million in the second quarter, representing 39% growth year\u2010over\u2010year, driven by both Yescarta and Tecartus. Yescarta growth was driven by strong demand in Europe, as well as successful follicular lymphoma launch in the US. Increased competition, particularly in third line LBCL, continues to raise the profile of cell therapy and is positive to Kite overall. We remain  confident in Yescarta's competitive profile and positioning, and are particularly proud of Kite's industry-leading manufacturing turnaround time and reliability. Our results also reflected strong momentum from the Tecartus mantle cell lymphoma launch, highlighting the unmet need for MCL patients.  We continue to add new indications and geographies for our cell therapy products. For example, the Fosun Kite joint venture recently received approval in China for Yescarta as the first cell therapy to treat third line LBCL. And we were excited to see the topline data for ZUMA\u20107, getting us a step closer to a second line LBCL cell therapy.  Even as we prepare for discussions with regulatory agencies later this year, commercial and manufacturing preparations are ramping up to ensure sufficient capacity and support for second line LBCL demand in both the US and Europe. Christi is here with the team to take your questions on cell therapy later in the call, but, for now, I'll hand it over to Merdad to walk us through the pipeline updates. \nMerdad Parsey: Thank you, Johanna. As Dan mentioned, it has been a gratifying year, delivering on all our key pipeline commitments, supporting Gilead's ambitions to extend our leadership in HIV and creating a broader portfolio spanning virology and oncology, and building our portfolio in inflammation.  I'll spend our time today on the highlights of the quarter, and point you to the appendix of the earnings presentation for a more complete view of our pipeline activities.  First, in HIV, as you can see on slide 15, programs for our investigational lenacapavir agent continue to progress. At the recent International AIDS Society meeting, we shared data from the Phase II/III CAPELLA study that evaluated heavily treatment\u2010experienced individuals who have already developed resistance to multiple antiretroviral drugs.  CAPELLA demonstrated lenacapavir's potency in this difficult to treat population. Despite significant prior resistance, antiviral activity was observed starting at day 15. By week 26, 81% of individuals had viral suppression when lenacapavir was combined with an optimized background regimen.  Based on these data, we have filed a New Drug Application. If approved, this would become the first six-month long\u2010acting subcutaneous injection regimen available, and deliver a welcome new option for people living with HIV who have developed multi\u2010drug\u2010resistance to other antiretrovirals.  Also at IAS, we presented strong interim results from the Phase II CALIBRATE study, evaluating lenacapavir in a treatment\u2010na\u00efve population. In CALIBRATE, participants received lenacapavir either as a subcutaneous injection or as a daily oral pill in combination with Descovy.  At week 28, 94% of subjects achieved HIV\u20101 RNA loads of less than 50 copies per mL. These findings will be used to help inform our broader efforts establishing lenacapavir as a foundational agent for our long\u2010acting franchise.  Late last month, we screened the first patient for the Phase III PURPOSE\u20102 trial studying lenacapavir for HIV prevention in cisgender men, transgender women, transgender men, and gender non-binary people who have sex with men and are at risk of HIV infection. We expect to initiate the Phase III PURPOSE\u20101 study of lenacapavir for HIV prevention in adolescent girls and young women later this year.  Finally, we are actively working on the co\u2010formulation for the long\u2010acting investigational oral and injectable combinations of lenacapavir and islatravir and expect to initiate the oral Phase II trial by the end of the year.  Moving on to HDV on slide 16. Last month, at the International Liver Congress, we presented data from the MYR301 and MYR204 programs. MYR301 is a Phase III registrational study evaluating bulevirtide as monotherapy for the treatment of HDV.  Interim results demonstrated that bulevirtide was well tolerated in both cirrhotic and non\u2010cirrhotic patients with compensated chronic HDV infections. At week 24, bulevirtide treatment was associated with significantly greater HDV RNA declines and improvements in biochemical measures of disease activity compared to no treatment. Moreover, there were no treatment\u2010related serious adverse events leading to discontinuation.  These results continue to support the effectiveness of the 2 mg dose, which has received conditional approval from the EMA, and will form the basis of the BLA filing planned for later this year in the U.S.  As part of our HDV cure efforts, we also presented interim data from the MYR204 Phase IIb study investigating finite regimens of bulevirtide both as monotherapy and in combination with PEG\u2010interferon alpha. Both monotherapy and combination treatments of bulevirtide were found to be generally well tolerated and more effective than PEG\u2010interferon alone through 24 weeks of therapy.  The primary endpoint analysis occurs at 24\u2010weeks after completion of therapy and includes virologic and biochemical response data. We look forward to sharing those data when available.  Moving to slide 17, and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, as you know, we shared earlier strong positive top\u2010line data from ZUMA\u20107, the landmark 359\u2010patient Phase III study evaluating Yescarta in second\u2010line LBCL. The study met the primary end point for event\u2010free survival, with a hazard ratio of 0.398, representing a 60% improvement in event\u2010free survival compared to standard of care stem cell transplant. Yescarta had a safety profile comparable to or better than what we have seen in the third line setting. This is a clinically and statistically meaningful improvement in outcomes that, if approved in the US, could extend Yescarta's reach to a total unique population of 14,000 patients annually in the second and third\u2010line LBCL setting.  ZUMA\u20107 also met the key secondary endpoint of objective response rate. As expected, data for overall survival is immature at this time, but the interim analysis suggests a favorable trend in this critical milestone.  In summary, we are very excited about the potential benefit to patients demonstrated in ZUMA\u20107 and look forward to beginning discussions with regulatory agencies later this year as we work towards potential sBLA and MAA filing for Yescarta in second\u2010line LBCL. And, separately, we are on track for the Phase II readout for first\u2010line LBCL study before the end of the year.  Beyond LBCL, we have completed filing Yescarta with the EMA for patients with follicular lymphoma after three or more lines of systemic therapy. We also have a PDUFA date of October 1 under accelerated review with the FDA for Tecartus in ALL.  And, of course, while our internal focus remains on autologous cell therapies, we continue our engagement in alternative approaches, most recently partnering with Shoreline Biosciences to develop novel off\u2010the\u2010shelf, allogeneic cell therapies based on natural killer targets for hematological cancers.  Slide 18 is a recap of our pipeline execution so far this year. In addition to the items we've discussed already, our partner Arcus provided an early, interim update of their Phase II ARC\u20107 trial in late June, demonstrating clinical activity in the anti\u2010TIGIT domvanalimab\u2010based doublet and triplet combinations.  Zimberelimab, our anti\u2010PD\u20101 antibody, saw similar levels of activity in the monotherapy arm compared to marketed anti\u2010PD\u20101s. Based on the interim analysis, we are pleased that ARC\u20107 and the confirmatory Phase III ARC\u201010 trial will continue to enroll as planned. We look forward to seeing how the data mature with additional patients and duration of follow\u2010up to inform our opt\u2010in decision.  Separately, our partner Galapagos also shared data readouts from their Toledo SIK2/3 programs across psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis and the plaque psoriasis from their TYK2 program. Both studies were early and had small samples, and we look forward to additional data.  We also remain focused on the following upcoming milestones. For Trodelvy, we continue to target a TROPiCS\u201002 PFS readout this year. The study is an event\u2010driven Phase III trial in patients with hormone receptor positive/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer. Pending data, we will evaluate and determine the appropriate regulatory next steps. We estimate there are roughly 17,000 patients in the US who could benefit from Trodelvy in this setting.  We continue to expect the Phase III non\u2010small cell lung cancer for Trodelvy to initiate in the second half of this year. We plan to share an update from the TROPiCS\u201003 basket study on lung cancer later this year and will separately provide updates on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer as those data mature.  We anticipate a Phase Ib readout for magrolimab in MDS later this year and, pending data, will engage with regulators as we explore a potential BLA filing for accelerated approval. If approved, magrolimab would be the first\u2010in\u2010class macrophage checkpoint inhibitor targeting CD47 and Gilead's first frontline oncology indication.  There is a significant unmet need for MDS with no new treatments approved in 14 years despite 15,000 new patients being diagnosed each year in the US alone. We continue our development efforts in AML and have enrolled our first patient in the Phase III frontline AML magrolimab study.  Before I wrap the pipeline discussion, I wanted to share one last update on remdesivir. We have decided not to move forward with an inhaled formulation of remdesivir based on the results of our initial proof\u2010of\u2010concept study, suggesting sub\u2010optimal lung deposition.  To address patient needs in the evolving pandemic, we are continuing our efforts on advancing multiple novel antivirals. We expect to submit IND filings later this year or early next year for these agents. We remain committed to supporting patients through this pandemic and continuing our legacy of developing anti\u2010viral therapeutics for the treatment of emerging diseases.  Finally, on slide 19, I want to recognize the teams at Gilead and Kite. Compared to just two years ago, our pipeline has grown from 30 clinical stage programs to over 50 today and resulted in a considerably more diverse set of assets that can be transformative not only for patients, but for Gilead.  The Gilead and Kite teams have worked tirelessly to deliver on our pipeline programs during this time of dramatic growth despite the pandemic. It's a thrilling time to be part of a team with tireless dedication and commitment to helping patients. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters ahead.  With that, I'll hand the call over to Andy to walk us through the financial results of the quarter. \nAndrew Dickinson: Thank you, Merdad. And good afternoon, everyone. Moving to slide 21, our financial results in the second quarter were solid overall, with total product sales up 21% year\u2010over\u2010year given the important role Veklury continues to play in this pandemic.  Excluding Veklury, total product sales grew 5% year\u2010over\u2010year, with strong Biktarvy growth more than offsetting lower Truvada and Atripla revenues, in addition to impressive growth in cell therapy and, of course, the new revenue contribution associated with Trodelvy which was not part of our portfolio in the second quarter of last year.  Moving down the P&L, non\u2010GAAP product gross margin was 86.4% in the second quarter, 210 basis points higher year-over-year and primarily associated with a lower royalty expense.  Non\u2010GAAP R&D was $1.1 billion, down 9% year\u2010over\u2010year, with lower remdesivir\u2010related investments as compared to the same period last year, partly offset by higher investments across our pipeline, notably Trodelvy and magrolimab.  Non\u2010GAAP SG&A expense was $1.1 billion, down 4% year\u2010over\u2010year, primarily due to lower legal expenses, offset in part by continued commercial investment in Trodelvy and Veklury outside the United States. Moving to tax, we realized a lower effective tax rate of 19.6% for the quarter, or down 320 basis points year\u2010over\u2010year, due to a shift in geographic earnings mix.  Overall, our non\u2010GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.87 per share in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.11 for the same period last year. The year\u2010over\u2010year improvement primarily reflects higher product sales due to Veklury, higher gross margin, as well as lower operating expenses and a lower effective tax rate, offset by lower interest income.  Overall, we're encouraged by our first half results, shown on slide 22.  Moving to slide 23, you can see that we are updating our guidance for 2021. As always, the duration and magnitude of the COVID\u201019 pandemic continue to be uncertain, and the rate and degree of these pandemic impacts as well as the corresponding recovery from the pandemic may vary across our business.  With that said, we now expect full-year total product sales in the range of $24.4 billion to $25 billion compared to our previous range of $23.7 billion to $25.1 billion. The new range increases the midpoint from $24.4 billion to $24.7 billion, and reflects our solid results year\u2010to\u2010date as well as our updated expectations for the second half of the year.  With first half Veklury revenue of $2.3 billion, we now expect full-year Veklury revenue in the range of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion compared to our previous $2 billion to $3 billion range.  Our updated range reflects the ongoing role of Veklury in this pandemic, and assumes we'll continue to see regional outbreaks. The situation continues to be dynamic, and we'll likely update our thinking again when we report our earnings after the third quarter.  Back to our guidance, we now expect total product sales excluding Veklury for the year to be in the range of $21.7 billion to $21.9 billion compared to our previous range of $21.7 billion to $22.1 billion. This tightening of the range reflects the longer-than-expected pandemic impact on our business, including the latest increase in COVID\u201019 cases.  As Johanna discussed, the pandemic has most notably impacted our HIV treatment business where we saw substantially fewer treatment initiations and a greater number of discontinuations than expected in 2020. It's taking longer than we expected for treated patient volume to ramp back up to more normal levels, particularly in the United States. That said, we saw encouraging signs of recovery in the HIV market in the second quarter, and our guidance assumes recovery will continue through the remainder of the year.  Based on market share dynamics, we remain very confident in our competitive positioning, and we believe we are well positioned as the recovery continues.  Looking at the rest of our P&L, we now expect non\u2010GAAP product gross margin in the range of 86% to 87%, reflecting the lower mix of HIV revenue. We now expect non\u2010GAAP R&D to decline low to mid-single digit percentage compared to 2020 levels. This primarily reflects the timing of investments, and we remind you that expenses in both R&D and SG&A are back-end loaded this year, increasing sequentially from Q2 into Q3, and then even more from Q3 into Q4. Our non\u2010GAAP SG&A guidance remains unchanged at flat to low-single digit percentage decline over 2020.  In R&D, we will be ramping up additional studies with magrolimab, Trodelvy, long\u2010acting combination work with lenacapavir for the treatment of HIV, and other pipeline activities.  And in SG&A, we will be ramping up marketing activities to support our growing portfolio of indications such as with Trodelvy and Tecartus.  Finally, reflecting the updates to our revenue, gross margin, and operating expense guidance, we now project non\u2010GAAP diluted EPS between $6.90 per share and $7.25 per share for the year, and GAAP diluted EPS between $4.70 and $5.05.  Additionally, our capital allocation priorities have not changed, and we remain committed to our dividend. Year\u2010to\u2010date, we have paid down $1.25 billion in debt, and we are on\u2010track to repay at least $4 billion in debt by the end of the year.  With that, I'll invite the operator to begin the question-and-answer session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Cory Kasimov with J.P. Morgan.\nGavin Scott: This is Gavin on for Cory. Just wanted to go back to the US HIV business. Can you provide additional color, particularly in the context of why this is so much different from the ex-US markets? And what is the most important factor you'll be watching for to have confidence in the US market? normalizing? \nDaniel O'Day: I'm obviously going to turn that over to Johanna. I'd just point out that we continue to do really well in our share and certainly Biktarvy growth and are well positioned as the market rebounds. And with that, I'll turn it over to Johanna for some specifics.\nJohanna Mercier: I think from a market dynamics standpoint, what we're seeing is we saw a little bit last year in Q2, most of the industry was actually slowing down pretty quickly in Q2. HIV took a little bit longer. And it's kind of that playing out in 2021 is taking a little bit longer to come back and bounce back.  One of the major reasons for that has to do with your dynamic market being much smaller in this market. You have a very large pool of patients that are just continuing patients. And you're really playing in a dynamic market with your na\u00efve patients coming in and your switches and your restarts really around 5% or so. And so, that's why it's taking a little bit longer as we're going through this.  From a different standpoint between US and Europe, I think it has more to do with the fact that in Europe, there's diversity across some of the different countries as to the pandemics and the timing of kind of the recoveries or even some of the surges that happen. So, it's a little bit more blended than what we've seen in the US thus far. And so, I think that's just what's playing out here. Obviously, the bigger impact being in the US because that's where most of our business lies in HIV.  And just to close out on that \u2013 that's from a market standpoint, and it's very different than kind of the fundamentals of our HIV business. I think what we've seen with Biktarvy, we're really quite pleased with in light of the fact that not only it's grown quarter-over-quarter by 1 point both in the US as well as the EU5, but also if you think about it over the last 12 months, it's grown 6 point share over a very strong base. We're just under 40%. We're at 39% share at this point in time. So, we're very pleased with the continued growth of Biktarvy. And you can appreciate that because it's such a larger base that's going to get more challenging as we move forward. And that's why I think we're excited about the market coming back a little bit. We've seen it come back in Q2. Where the market goes, obviously, our HIV business goes because we own 75% of the market. And so, therefore, we're watching that very closely, but we would expect that recovery to continue, although at a slower pace than we had originally expected.\nGavin Scott: Anything on the indicators? I think you've mentioned \u2013 is there anything more on the indicators we should be looking?\nJohanna Mercier: Yeah. So, we've been looking, of course, at the HIV screening and the diagnosis and how that's playing out. And we're still under by about 13% to below pre-COVID levels. So, I think once those come back up, I think that would be something that we're watching very closely. And also, the drop off rates, we talked a little bit earlier about the adherence piece of the puzzle because you have less patient support groups around, you have less surround sound around those HIV patients, you have a lot of those case managers and physicians that have moved over to treat COVID-19 and so far impacting HIV a little bit disproportionately. And so, we're also looking at those drop-offs. And we've seen those drop-offs come back to normal to pre-COVID levels just most recently. And so that's another positive sign to the recovery of the market.\nDaniel O'Day: Gavin, obviously, just from a patient perspective, we had been and will continue to be dedicated to helping patients, particularly in underserved communities, get back into the care system. I think that's something that Gilead prides itself on. And that's exceptionally important as a leader in HIV medicines to make sure we are always on the side of the patients as we emerge from this pandemic. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. \nTerence Flynn: A two part for me. First for Johanna. Just wondering if you can provide any more insight on the Trodelvy launch, specifically the split of sales by either setting or indication.  And then, for Merdad, can you remind us of the size of the lung cancer cohort in TROPiCS\u201003? And then, how are you thinking about the potential risk of ILD in that population? \nJohanna Mercier: We're really pleased with the Trodelvy sales. I had 24% growth quarter-over-quarter. I think it's a very strong quarter. And I think that really has to do with the approval, the second line plus approval that we got in metastatic triple negative breast cancer early April. It's also related to the fact that because now we have the full approval, we have the opportunity to promote the incredible overall survival data that we have with the ASCENT data. And so, that's been a big piece of the puzzle.  If you're asking me to split the sales per line of therapy, that's very challenging in light of the claims data that we had. But what I would say, if it's more about bladder cancer versus triple negative breast cancer, I would say most of that is triple negative breast cancer, probably about a 90/10 ratio as our bladder cancer is much smaller, although we've done some nice inroads there already and are looking at about just under 10% share in bladder right now with Trodelvy. So we're excited about that as well. Merdad?\nMerdad Parsey: With TROPiCS\u201003, it's a basket study. So, the Ns per arm are not hard and fast. We'll probably be looking at data once we get to the 20, 30 range in there, but it's not predetermined. So, I wouldn't want to overstate it. Regarding ILD, we are definitely very sensitive to and watching for it, as you can imagine. To date, we haven't had any reports of that, but we're ever vigilant. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets.\nBrian Abrahams: Question regarding HIV lifecycle. You're still moving forward data for subcu lenacapavir based combo in treatment-na\u00efve HIV. I'm curious how did the learnings there with respect to the resistance profile you're observing shape how you think about the future development steps vis-\u00e0-vis potentially exploring higher doses more frequent than every six-month injections and/or combining with agents that might have a higher intrinsic barrier resistance versus F/TAF.  And then, I guess along the lines of HIV lifecycle, I'm also curious your level of confidence as to the potential of F/TAF to have exclusivity beyond 2025. Thanks.\nDaniel O'Day: Why don't we have you start, Merdad, and perhaps Andy can comment a little bit on the on the second piece, too?\nMerdad Parsey: It's a very good question. I think if you think about the patients in that trial, these are highly treatment experienced patients who often develop resistance because of non-compliance. And when these subjects are getting a subcu injection of lenacapavir, remember that these patients are going to potentially continue to go off and on their oral regimens.  As we think about the future, as you know, we are for treatment going outside of the highly treatment experienced population. We're really thinking about how we're going to combine lenacapavir with other long acting agents like islatravir. And as we do so, I think the concerns about patients potentially having effective monotherapy with lenacapavir go away in some regards, right? Ensuring that patients are taking multiple agents at the same time is going to be really important for us.\nDaniel O'Day: Perhaps, Andy, you want to comment on the exclusivity question for Brian?\nAndrew Dickinson: As you know, there's litigation that's underway. There were some recent developments that a number of analysts have wrote about. Our base case continues to be that there'll be generics arriving in 2025 and 2026 in the US and EU, respectively. But we think we have a strong case and we look forward to continuing to prosecute the case. And we'll see where it plays out. We should have an additional update later this year. So, that's really where it stands. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink.\nGeoffrey Porges: Just a couple of pops in my question. Could you clarify a couple of your partnerships? There's been some news from Galapagos. You've invested over $5 billion there. Are you going to take on any of those drugs from the Toledo portfolio that the company recently highlighted?  And then related to that, your Arcus partnership, does your guidance include the mild upfront costs of opting in for any of those programs? And what's the trigger and the window for when you can opt in to any of those three programs because they sort of appear on your pipeline slide, but it's not completely clear whether they're in or out? So, could you clarify where you're going with those two partnerships? \nDaniel O'Day: I'll start a little bit and then ask Merdad and Andy, if he wants to add any as well. First and foremost, I think we believe deeply in partnerships. We have a robust internal portfolio. And we also, as you know, have designed these opt-ins as a way to expand our portfolio in different therapeutic areas. Starting with Galapagos, as you know, which is predominantly focused on inflammation, at this stage, we don't have any opt in milestones right now with Galapagos. We're working closely with them on their science and their discovery platform, and some of their preclinical to clinical molecules to support them in their efforts. But at this stage, we don't have anything more to report other than what Galapagos has reported on the \u2013 for instance, Geoff, to your question on the Toledo program. But rest assured that as those programs evolve and mature and develop, we'll keep you informed.  Perhaps, Merdad, if you want to say anything else on Galapagos and then bridge to Arcus.\nMerdad Parsey: I think the stories are similar. We like to keep you apprised of what could potentially come into our portfolio, and we have the opt-in rights for Arcus. I think Dan laid out Galapagos well. For Arcus, we continue to wait for data to mature. And once the data get to a level of maturity where we can really make the call, that's when we'll have our opt in. We have not included \u2013 and Andy will confirm for me, but we have not included the financials of potential opt-in in our guidance at this point. \nAndrew Dickinson: I'm happy to follow-up here, Geoff. Good question. Nothing has changed from the guidance at the beginning of the year. So, our R&D spend and all of our expense guidance does not include the opt-ins on any of the programs that we have opt-ins, including the three programs that you mentioned at Arcus. You also asked about the opt-in windows. The opt-in window for the first TIGIT antibody should be coming most likely at the end of this year or it could be early next year, but it's most likely at the end of this year. We'll have enough patient data to trigger the opt-in or our desired opt-in potentially early. On the other two programs, the adenosine programs at Arcus, that's most likely next year. And again, there may be additional data that comes this year. But if it looks really strong, we want to move as quickly as we can, and we can opt-in early, Geoff, on those programs.  And then, on Toledo, it's relatively simple. On all of the Galapagos programs that opt-in comes after Phase II enabling studies, so the Toledo programs are a long ways away from a potential opt-in decision. \nMerdad Parsey: Phase III enabling.\nAndrew Dickinson: Yeah, Phase III enabling. Thank you.\nDaniel O'Day: Geoff, just kind of round out your question, there's obviously many other partnerships we have that we're working closely with at different phases. But those are the specific ones you asked about. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: A question for Dan or Merdad on COVID. There's a high expectation that vaccines are here for a while now that the Delta variant has really changed the dynamic. The question is, has the strategic value of Veklury changed for you guys as new cases have ticked up? I know you decided not to pursue inhaled. But is there a lifecycle here worth investing in over the long term?\nDaniel O'Day: I'll start and then Merdad will either correct me or add information to it. Just to emphasize the importance of Gilad's legacy in antivirals, and frankly, our strength in that to us as well. So, being, of course, the first company to have \u2013 and the only company to have an approved antiviral for COVID is no accident. Obviously, it's decades of experience, decades of investments in a variety of emerging viruses, including COVID. And we haven't stopped. So, to your point, Geoff, I think we're all learning about this pandemic as it rolls out. And it's certainly going through different phases and we think will continue to go through different phases. And therefore, we are, if you like, kind of doubling down on an ability to think about antivirals outside the hospital setting where remdesivir plays such an important role.  And maybe with that, I'll hand it over to Merdad, as a clinician, how you might also see the future of the pandemic and then also our role in it. \nMerdad Parsey: I think we have been pretty been pretty consistently of the mindset that the vaccines will make a tremendous impact in the case numbers and those sorts of things. Even when we get to some sort of equilibrium, unfortunately, there will continue to be, we believe, infections. People will continue to get infected, and some proportion of those patients will end up in the hospital.  So, we do believe that Veklury in the hospitalized setting is going to continue to be really important for treating those patients. And as Dan alluded to, we continue to believe and are committed to making treatments available in the outpatient setting. So, the inhaled, nebulized approach didn't give us the results we were hoping for, the consistency we were looking for. But because we have other agents in our pipeline based on our virology expertise, we will be bringing those forward and really focusing on the outpatient setting there. So, we continue to believe that having a treatment available for people, whether they're vaccinated or not, is going to be important for the foreseeable future.\nDaniel O'Day: Geoff, what I might add is that our preclinical folks continue to study remdesivir against a variety of variants. In fact, all four major variants of concern. So, the Alpha from UK, the Beta from South Africa, the Gamma from Brazil and the Delta from India, and all are fully sensitive against \u2013 or remdesivir is sensitive against all of those strains, which would make sense because we're not seeing any mutations in the polymerase remdesivir binding site. And so, I think it's important as we think about next generation products to also think about medicines that will be effective against these ongoing variants, like remdesivir. So, it's an important bar for us as we move forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore.\nUmer Raffat: I had two quick ones as well. First, have you had an interim PFS on the HR+ study of Trodelvy? And secondly, congrats on Bill Grossman's hire from Arcus. And I was wondering to what extent was the decision of Bill bringing onboard driven elusively by Bill's familiarity with Arcus programs.\nMerdad Parsey: We have not done the interim PFS analysis. As we've talked about, that'll happen certainly before the end of the year, we hope. And that's still what we're tracking to, but we have not done the analysis yet. So, we remain blinded to those data.  And then, in terms of Bill, I think I wouldn't necessarily tie it as you're suggesting to Arcus. It's certainly an advantage for us that, should we opt-in to Arcus programs, Bill will bring familiarity. But for us, Bill's experience and leadership and his excitement about being here and overseeing the overall portfolio were the drivers for Bill coming onboard.\nDaniel O'Day: I would just add, Umer, look, many of us know Bill. You know him as well. Our relationship with Arcus is extremely important and continues to be, and this was an example of Bill seeing a career opportunity and seeing an evolution for his career that made sense for him. We certainly want to make sure that Arcus continues to have the skill set that it needs to be successful, we have the skill set that we need to be successful. I think it's just a good example of how partners collaborate at times. So, I just wanted to emphasize our relationship with Arcus is unchanged and as strong as ever. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies.\nMichael Yee: Maybe a question for Merdad on Trodelvy. A couple of parts. In the TROPiCS\u201002 study, you had the smart decision to take a look at that, enlarge it, powered for PFS, et cetera. Did you have any information that could help give you confidence around the powering and any information that helped you give confidence in the overall study, such as the number of events that have passed or anything like that, or even knowing that it had passed a futility, if you could even comment on that?  And then, on the lung data that's coming up, can you just comment around your belief in the profile versus the competitor? Is it similar efficacy, better safety, or how should we interpret that data when it comes later this year? \nMerdad Parsey: On the TROPiCS\u201002 study, we have not done a futility analysis. We continue to look to those data maturing and getting the number of events that we need for the PFS analysis that we have planned. We're pretty confident in our powering and, in particular, since we expanded the sample size to make sure that we are able to hit the PFS endpoint. Of course, a relevant issue is more the duration of PFS that we get, but from a powering standpoint, we're comfortable. And it's just a matter of seeing those data.  From an ongoing event standpoint, I think we are where we thought we would be at this point. And it's really around just letting the events come in, make sure they get adjudicated, we clean the data in time to do the analysis properly. So, that's where we are with that.  And then, in terms of the lung data on efficacy, as I think we've said before, we're really proceeding somewhat at risk and pretty aggressively, partly based on our belief in the drug, partly because of what we've seen with other agents in lung and partly based on our early data that you're familiar with in lung that we've seen. Of course, we want to make those data more robust while we go into the Phase III world. So, we are going to augment our existing data to make sure that we're mitigating our risks somewhat. But thus far, I think what we are hoping for is efficacy that certainly is comparable to what the benchmark might be, even though I think it's too early to say what that benchmark is with a direct competitor. But we are, again, I think confident about our ability to bring safety profile that hopefully will be better for patients. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Cantor. \nAlethia Young: I'm just curious about \u2013 again, going back to the Arcus collaboration with ARC-7, how did you think about what the hurdle is for a triple? Do you think that it has to be more than like some of the competitors like Roche have on the doublet?\nMerdad Parsey: I think we have the luxury of being able to look at the singlet, a doublet and a triple here. We would be, of course, excited if the triplet differentiates from the doublet and provides better efficacy. I think that's what we'd be looking for. And so, as the data mature, looking for some signals, a reason to believe that the triplet is performing more robustly than the doublet is probably going to be our focus. We'd be very excited if that plays out and gives us, I think, a pretty unique position. \nOperator: The last question comes from Ronny Gal with Bernstein.\nRonny Gal: A question about the projections for HIV for the next couple of years. Part one, I guess, as you change your reimbursement policy on 340B clinics next year, how big essentially is that difference in terms of what it creates for you? And where on the P&L will it appear on revenue, on SG&A? And the second one, you already mentioned PrEP barriers are dropping with preventative treatment designation for PrEP. I can't figure out if this is good or bad for you from the perspective of a branded drug adoption, given that they don't have to cover branded drugs. \nJohanna Mercier: Ronny, I'm assuming you're talking about the patient assistance program changes. So, I want to differentiate that. Those aren't 340B changes. That's actually a program that's really in line with our commitment to help end the HIV epidemic. To date, the program's actually provided free drug to more than 250,000 individuals. And really, that's what it is, it's a free program that was always intended and will continue to provide free Gilead medication to eligible individuals to treat and prevent HIV. Unfortunately, it was not intended to be a source of funding for organizations to deliver services. And that's what we're trying to reset a little bit. So, the changes to our program model will protect our ability to be able to do this in the longer term and make it a sustainable program for us, and more importantly, for patients. So, that's the patient assistance program on that front.  The question you're asking me about PrEP, we're actually quite encouraged with the FAQ that came out from the US PSTF. And here's why. In the FAQ, they provide a lot more clarity than they had in the past. This isn't new. The recommendation actually came out \u2013the Affordable Care Act recommendation came out two years ago. But what this provided was actually more details to it and clarity on the importance of PrEP in ending the epidemic and minimizing the barriers of use.  And there's a couple of things in the FAQ that pop out for me. One is, it truly supports physician and patient choice. And that's the piece where generics or non-generics \u2013 right? So, Truvada generics or Descovy would then need to be really \u2013 the physicians and the patients get to decide together what is the right medicine for which patient. And of course, with the bone and renal safety benefits that Descovy brings, I think this is a great addition to the FAQ.  In addition to that, there's also some guidance around timely management of the request for this by payers. So, to turn it around within 24 hours, which is quite different than what's happening today.  And then, the last piece is $0 of out of pocket costs. So, I think for patients, this is great news. And I also think for patient choice and physician choice, this is quite promising as well.\nDaniel O'Day: Well, thank you all very much. \nJacquie Ross : Thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and look forward to updating you on our progress. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Daniel O'Day",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacquie. And good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join us today. We're pleased to provide you with an update on our second quarter, where we delivered solid financial performance and significant progress on our increasingly diverse pipeline.  2021 is an important year for our pipeline, and we're very encouraged by the milestones we've achieved \u2013 for therapies that are potentially transformative for Gilead and for patients. All of this reinforces our confidence in our strategic direction.  I want to take this opportunity to thank our global community of Gilead and Kite employees who consistently go above and beyond to drive progress, with resilience and dedication. Different parts of the world are riding the ebb and flow of COVID\u201019 cases at various times, and while the vaccines give us hope and optimism, we are still very much living with the pandemic. Remdesivir continues to play an important role in fighting the virus and has now been used to treat an estimated 7 million hospitalized patients worldwide.  Turning to the main highlights of the quarter on slide 4. The second quarter was a solid quarter overall. Veklury sales of $829 million were once again higher than anticipated, offsetting the lingering impact of the pandemic, particularly on HIV treatment.  In light of this pandemic impact, Biktarvy's performance is quite encouraging. Revenue for the quarter was $2 billion, up 24%, or $390 million from the same quarter last year. This more than offset the $322 million headwind associated with the impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs. Much of that headwind is now, of course, behind us.  Overall, our share of the HIV treatment market held steady quarter\u2010over\u2010quarter, and our PrEP share remained steady even with generic entries. These dynamics give us confidence that the underlying demand for our HIV products remains strong, and positions us well for growth as the overall HIV market recovery gains momentum.  Moving to our clinical pipeline, 2021 is a catalyst heavy year for Gilead and we have delivered all of our key first half pipeline commitments. Among other milestones, we shared top line data from the highly anticipated ZUMA\u20107 trial where Yescarta improved event\u2010free survival for second line Large B\u2010cell Lymphoma, or LBCL, patients by 60% compared to the standard of care. This is truly a landmark trial \u2013 the first and largest reported Phase III trial readout that demonstrates the efficacy and safety of cell therapy, and we are excited by the opportunity to bring the potential benefits of cell therapy to patients in earlier lines.  We shared positive Phase III data from MYR 301 which will help support our anticipated BLA filing for Hepcludex for HDV in the US later this year, and we submitted our NDA for use of lenacapavir in the heavily treatment experienced population with multidrug resistance. This filing was based on data from Phase II/III CAPELLA study presented earlier this month. We also shared strong lenacapavir data from the Phase II CALIBRATE study in HIV treatment, which will be used to inform our broader lenacapavir efforts.  Our partner Arcus provided an interim update for ARC\u20107 that supports the continuation of both the ARC\u20107 and ARC\u201010 trials for their anti\u2010TIGIT candidate, domvanalimab.  Lastly, on slide 4, we are beginning to see the positive impact of our strategy, which we introduced early last year. The business is diversifying across indications and therapies. In particular, we are seeing Cell Therapy and Trodelvy contribute to growth and expect they will be key growth drivers for Gilead. While we build out the oncology business, we remain focused and committed on ensuring the long\u2010term competitive positioning of our virology portfolio. Next, on slide 5, we highlighted our pipeline execution so far this year, and I'd like to thank all those who helped us to deliver on this ambitious agenda, including our employees, the people who participated in the studies, our partners, and the study investigators.  As we look ahead to the rest of the year, our target milestones include a progression free survival, or PFS, readout in our event\u2010driven Phase III TROPiCS\u201002 study evaluating Trodelvy in hormone receptor positive/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer; a Phase Ib data readout for magrolimab in myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS. Depending on the data, timing and results, this could result in a BLA submission for accelerated approval. And initiation of the potential Phase II lenacapavir and islatravir long\u2010acting oral combination. As you know, this is in collaboration with Merck and the development and formulation work remains on track. We look forward to updating you next quarter about additional milestone progress.  We understand that continued strong and consistent pipeline execution is critical to extending the virology business and expanding further into oncology. We believe our current and pipeline therapies can address significant unmet needs.  We are very encouraged by the progress Gilead and Kite are making. We are well on our way in our journey to expand and diversify into new therapeutic areas, and we are already seeing the evolution of both our pipeline and commercial portfolio.  With that, I'll hand over to Johanna who will share an update on our commercial performance for the second quarter. I'm obviously going to turn that over to Johanna. I'd just point out that we continue to do really well in our share and certainly Biktarvy growth and are well positioned as the market rebounds. And with that, I'll turn it over to Johanna for some specifics. Gavin, obviously, just from a patient perspective, we had been and will continue to be dedicated to helping patients, particularly in underserved communities, get back into the care system. I think that's something that Gilead prides itself on. And that's exceptionally important as a leader in HIV medicines to make sure we are always on the side of the patients as we emerge from this pandemic. Why don't we have you start, Merdad, and perhaps Andy can comment a little bit on the on the second piece, too? Perhaps, Andy, you want to comment on the exclusivity question for Brian? I'll start a little bit and then ask Merdad and Andy, if he wants to add any as well. First and foremost, I think we believe deeply in partnerships. We have a robust internal portfolio. And we also, as you know, have designed these opt-ins as a way to expand our portfolio in different therapeutic areas. Starting with Galapagos, as you know, which is predominantly focused on inflammation, at this stage, we don't have any opt in milestones right now with Galapagos. We're working closely with them on their science and their discovery platform, and some of their preclinical to clinical molecules to support them in their efforts. But at this stage, we don't have anything more to report other than what Galapagos has reported on the \u2013 for instance, Geoff, to your question on the Toledo program. But rest assured that as those programs evolve and mature and develop, we'll keep you informed.  Perhaps, Merdad, if you want to say anything else on Galapagos and then bridge to Arcus. Geoff, just kind of round out your question, there's obviously many other partnerships we have that we're working closely with at different phases. But those are the specific ones you asked about. I'll start and then Merdad will either correct me or add information to it. Just to emphasize the importance of Gilad's legacy in antivirals, and frankly, our strength in that to us as well. So, being, of course, the first company to have \u2013 and the only company to have an approved antiviral for COVID is no accident. Obviously, it's decades of experience, decades of investments in a variety of emerging viruses, including COVID. And we haven't stopped. So, to your point, Geoff, I think we're all learning about this pandemic as it rolls out. And it's certainly going through different phases and we think will continue to go through different phases. And therefore, we are, if you like, kind of doubling down on an ability to think about antivirals outside the hospital setting where remdesivir plays such an important role.  And maybe with that, I'll hand it over to Merdad, as a clinician, how you might also see the future of the pandemic and then also our role in it. Geoff, what I might add is that our preclinical folks continue to study remdesivir against a variety of variants. In fact, all four major variants of concern. So, the Alpha from UK, the Beta from South Africa, the Gamma from Brazil and the Delta from India, and all are fully sensitive against \u2013 or remdesivir is sensitive against all of those strains, which would make sense because we're not seeing any mutations in the polymerase remdesivir binding site. And so, I think it's important as we think about next generation products to also think about medicines that will be effective against these ongoing variants, like remdesivir. So, it's an important bar for us as we move forward. I would just add, Umer, look, many of us know Bill. You know him as well. Our relationship with Arcus is extremely important and continues to be, and this was an example of Bill seeing a career opportunity and seeing an evolution for his career that made sense for him. We certainly want to make sure that Arcus continues to have the skill set that it needs to be successful, we have the skill set that we need to be successful. I think it's just a good example of how partners collaborate at times. So, I just wanted to emphasize our relationship with Arcus is unchanged and as strong as ever. Well, thank you all very much."

            "name": "Johanna Mercier",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan. And good afternoon, everyone. Starting on slide 7, total product sales of $6.2 billion were up 21% year-over-year, primarily reflecting Veklury which was not a contributor to revenue in the second quarter of 2020.  On slide 8, Veklury second quarter revenues of $829 million declined sequentially, reflecting the impact of higher vaccination rates and lower infection and hospitalization in many regions. While hospitalizations trended lower in the second quarter, Veklury remained the therapy of choice in 3 out of 5 patients hospitalized with COVID\u201019.  We estimate that, since the launch in May 2020, roughly 7 million patients globally have been treated with remdesivir. It's truly remarkable and encouraging to see how remdesivir continues to play such a key role in fighting this global pandemic.  Excluding Veklury, total product sales of $5.3 billion were up 5% year\u2010over\u2010year. We saw growth in cell therapy and HCV, in addition to new revenue contributions from Trodelvy and, more modestly, Hepcludex for HDV.  Additionally, other product revenues of $291 million grew 20% year\u2010over\u2010year, driven by increased demand for AmBisome outside the US to treat mucormycosis, which has seen a rising incidence in patients hospitalized with COVID\u201019. Sequentially, we saw 9% growth for total product sales excluding Veklury, primarily driven by growth in Biktarvy.  Moving to slide 9, HIV product sales were $3.9 billion, up 8% sequentially and down 2% year\u2010over year. Compared to the second quarter of 2020, total HIV revenue reflected strong Biktarvy growth that more than offset the $322 million lower revenue from Truvada and Atripla following the loss of exclusivity. Compared to last quarter, HIV grew $288 million, reflecting customary seasonal inventory dynamics and growing demand for treatment.  Biktarvy revenue of $2 billion was up 24% year\u2010over\u2010year and 9% sequentially, with quarter-over-quarter growth primarily driven by increased demand. Biktarvy remains the number one prescribed therapy in the US across nai\u0308ve, switch and continuing patients and remains number one in nai\u0308ve across all EU5 countries. Approximately 70% of switches from both Gilead and non\u2010Gilead regimens result in incremental revenue. Overall, and despite the ongoing impact of the pandemic, Biktarvy continues to gain market share with 1% share growth versus last quarter in both the US as well as the EU5.  Descovy revenues of $435 million grew 21% sequentially, due to a modest improvement in the demand for PrEP and more favorable inventory and pricing dynamics that we typically see in the second quarter relative to the first.  As we highlighted in prior quarters, we have been working with payers to ensure patients continue to have access to Descovy in light of entry of generic alternatives for Truvada. We're really pleased to see this strong sequential growth in Descovy, and we continue to maintain mid\u201040% share despite generic impacts.  Year\u2010over\u2010year, Descovy grew 4% largely due to higher demand for PrEP. And, overall, PrEP demand is showing signs of recovery and is expected to continue to improve as pandemic restrictions phase out.  Earlier this month, federal FAQs for the US preventive services task force were released. It provided greater clarity as to the importance of PrEP in ending the epidemic, and we are really encouraged by this recent development. We hope it will help us to minimize the barriers of PrEP use going forward.  Before I transition to other products, I just want to take a moment to share some perspective on the HIV treatment market, given the longer than expected pandemic impact.  In regions outside the US, such as Europe, we are beginning to see signs of recovery in the dynamic market, with second quarter trends generally in line with our expectations. In the US, however, the pace of pandemic recovery was slower than we expected in this last quarter, and while we are seeing signs of recovery in PrEP and some sequential growth in the treatment market, it's clear that it will take several quarters for treatment to return to pre\u2010pandemic levels.  In treatment, there are really two pandemic\u2010related headwinds that we observed. First, lower HIV screening and diagnosis resulting in lower treatment initiation. And second, due to the limited support services available during the pandemic, we have seen a higher number of patients discontinue their HIV treatments.  Taken together, these factors have reduced the number of active patients on HIV therapy entering 2021, thereby reducing the overall volume of new and refill prescriptions we would expect to see in 2021. We did, however, see growth resume from this lower base in the second quarter. After prior quarter-over-quarter declines, second quarter US HIV treatment prescriptions grew 2%, and we expect the market to grow at historical rates once screening and diagnosis rates return to pre\u2010pandemic levels.  To continue our efforts to advance progress against the HIV epidemic, we are partnering with healthcare professionals, advocacy groups, and policy makers to raise awareness of the unique challenges COVID19 poses to HIV screening, diagnosis, and adherence. Our goal is to help health care providers ensure that patients continue to be diagnosed and treated.  Given the strength of the demand fundamentals for Biktarvy, Descovy for PrEP, and other Gilead HIV products, we remain confident in our competitive positioning now that many communities are easing social distancing requirements.  In the meantime, we continue to see strength in underlying treatment demand with no material changes in the competitive landscape, with our total Gilead treatment market share holding steady at 75% in the US and just under 50% in Europe, despite competition and the entry of new generics.  Next, on slide 10, HCV product sales in the second quarter were $549 million, up 23% compared to last year, but patient starts remain well below pre\u2010pandemic levels. The growth reflects a modest sequential recovery in HCV patient starts in the US in Q2 2021, in addition to an artificially low Q2 of 2020 that was impacted by unfavorable government rebate adjustments. We will be watching for further signs of recovery in the third quarter. Both US and EU Gilead market shares remain steady around 60% and 50%, respectively.  Moving to slide 11, HBV and HDV product sales were $237 million, up 8% year\u2010over\u2010year, with improving patient starts on Vemlidy, particularly in ex\u2010US markets.  In its first full quarter as part of Gilead, Hepcludex contributed $7 million and is currently available in France, Germany, and Austria. We are excited to be working with the various reimbursement authorities to increase patient access and expect to secure full reimbursement in the major European markets in 2022.  Moving to Trodelvy on slide 12, product sales in the second quarter were $89 million, up 24% quarter-over-quarter, driven by demand for the two new indications approved in April, namely second line plus metastatic triple negative breast cancer and urothelial cancer.  We continue to be encouraged by the positive feedback from physicians on the Phase III ASCENT data, which demonstrated one\u2010year median overall survival benefit for second\u2010line metastatic TNBC patients treated with Trodelvy.  To build on this growing interest, we're increasing community awareness, especially of the expanded indication to second\u2010line in TNBC. And we expect to see growing demand as breast cancer screening ramps back up to pre\u2010pandemic levels.  IQVIA data suggest that breast cancer screening volumes were about 20% lower in the US in 2020 compared to 2019. This suggests as many as 41,500 breast cancer patients have not been diagnosed during the pandemic.  On behalf of Christi and the Kite team, I'm pleased to share our cell therapy commercial update on slide 13. Total cell therapy product sales totaled $219 million in the second quarter, representing 39% growth year\u2010over\u2010year, driven by both Yescarta and Tecartus. Yescarta growth was driven by strong demand in Europe, as well as successful follicular lymphoma launch in the US. Increased competition, particularly in third line LBCL, continues to raise the profile of cell therapy and is positive to Kite overall. We remain  confident in Yescarta's competitive profile and positioning, and are particularly proud of Kite's industry-leading manufacturing turnaround time and reliability. Our results also reflected strong momentum from the Tecartus mantle cell lymphoma launch, highlighting the unmet need for MCL patients.  We continue to add new indications and geographies for our cell therapy products. For example, the Fosun Kite joint venture recently received approval in China for Yescarta as the first cell therapy to treat third line LBCL. And we were excited to see the topline data for ZUMA\u20107, getting us a step closer to a second line LBCL cell therapy.  Even as we prepare for discussions with regulatory agencies later this year, commercial and manufacturing preparations are ramping up to ensure sufficient capacity and support for second line LBCL demand in both the US and Europe. Christi is here with the team to take your questions on cell therapy later in the call, but, for now, I'll hand it over to Merdad to walk us through the pipeline updates. I think from a market dynamics standpoint, what we're seeing is we saw a little bit last year in Q2, most of the industry was actually slowing down pretty quickly in Q2. HIV took a little bit longer. And it's kind of that playing out in 2021 is taking a little bit longer to come back and bounce back.  One of the major reasons for that has to do with your dynamic market being much smaller in this market. You have a very large pool of patients that are just continuing patients. And you're really playing in a dynamic market with your nai\u0308ve patients coming in and your switches and your restarts really around 5% or so. And so, that's why it's taking a little bit longer as we're going through this.  From a different standpoint between US and Europe, I think it has more to do with the fact that in Europe, there's diversity across some of the different countries as to the pandemics and the timing of kind of the recoveries or even some of the surges that happen. So, it's a little bit more blended than what we've seen in the US thus far. And so, I think that's just what's playing out here. Obviously, the bigger impact being in the US because that's where most of our business lies in HIV.  And just to close out on that \u2013 that's from a market standpoint, and it's very different than kind of the fundamentals of our HIV business. I think what we've seen with Biktarvy, we're really quite pleased with in light of the fact that not only it's grown quarter-over-quarter by 1 point both in the US as well as the EU5, but also if you think about it over the last 12 months, it's grown 6 point share over a very strong base. We're just under 40%. We're at 39% share at this point in time. So, we're very pleased with the continued growth of Biktarvy. And you can appreciate that because it's such a larger base that's going to get more challenging as we move forward. And that's why I think we're excited about the market coming back a little bit. We've seen it come back in Q2. Where the market goes, obviously, our HIV business goes because we own 75% of the market. And so, therefore, we're watching that very closely, but we would expect that recovery to continue, although at a slower pace than we had originally expected. Yeah. So, we've been looking, of course, at the HIV screening and the diagnosis and how that's playing out. And we're still under by about 13% to below pre-COVID levels. So, I think once those come back up, I think that would be something that we're watching very closely. And also, the drop off rates, we talked a little bit earlier about the adherence piece of the puzzle because you have less patient support groups around, you have less surround sound around those HIV patients, you have a lot of those case managers and physicians that have moved over to treat COVID-19 and so far impacting HIV a little bit disproportionately. And so, we're also looking at those drop-offs. And we've seen those drop-offs come back to normal to pre-COVID levels just most recently. And so that's another positive sign to the recovery of the market. We're really pleased with the Trodelvy sales. I had 24% growth quarter-over-quarter. I think it's a very strong quarter. And I think that really has to do with the approval, the second line plus approval that we got in metastatic triple negative breast cancer early April. It's also related to the fact that because now we have the full approval, we have the opportunity to promote the incredible overall survival data that we have with the ASCENT data. And so, that's been a big piece of the puzzle.  If you're asking me to split the sales per line of therapy, that's very challenging in light of the claims data that we had. But what I would say, if it's more about bladder cancer versus triple negative breast cancer, I would say most of that is triple negative breast cancer, probably about a 90/10 ratio as our bladder cancer is much smaller, although we've done some nice inroads there already and are looking at about just under 10% share in bladder right now with Trodelvy. So we're excited about that as well. Merdad? Ronny, I'm assuming you're talking about the patient assistance program changes. So, I want to differentiate that. Those aren't 340B changes. That's actually a program that's really in line with our commitment to help end the HIV epidemic. To date, the program's actually provided free drug to more than 250,000 individuals. And really, that's what it is, it's a free program that was always intended and will continue to provide free Gilead medication to eligible individuals to treat and prevent HIV. Unfortunately, it was not intended to be a source of funding for organizations to deliver services. And that's what we're trying to reset a little bit. So, the changes to our program model will protect our ability to be able to do this in the longer term and make it a sustainable program for us, and more importantly, for patients. So, that's the patient assistance program on that front.  The question you're asking me about PrEP, we're actually quite encouraged with the FAQ that came out from the US PSTF. And here's why. In the FAQ, they provide a lot more clarity than they had in the past. This isn't new. The recommendation actually came out \u2013the Affordable Care Act recommendation came out two years ago. But what this provided was actually more details to it and clarity on the importance of PrEP in ending the epidemic and minimizing the barriers of use.  And there's a couple of things in the FAQ that pop out for me. One is, it truly supports physician and patient choice. And that's the piece where generics or non-generics \u2013 right? So, Truvada generics or Descovy would then need to be really \u2013 the physicians and the patients get to decide together what is the right medicine for which patient. And of course, with the bone and renal safety benefits that Descovy brings, I think this is a great addition to the FAQ.  In addition to that, there's also some guidance around timely management of the request for this by payers. So, to turn it around within 24 hours, which is quite different than what's happening today.  And then, the last piece is $0 of out of pocket costs. So, I think for patients, this is great news. And I also think for patient choice and physician choice, this is quite promising as well."

            "name": "Andrew Dickinson",
            "content": "Thank you, Merdad. And good afternoon, everyone. Moving to slide 21, our financial results in the second quarter were solid overall, with total product sales up 21% year\u2010over\u2010year given the important role Veklury continues to play in this pandemic.  Excluding Veklury, total product sales grew 5% year\u2010over\u2010year, with strong Biktarvy growth more than offsetting lower Truvada and Atripla revenues, in addition to impressive growth in cell therapy and, of course, the new revenue contribution associated with Trodelvy which was not part of our portfolio in the second quarter of last year.  Moving down the P&L, non\u2010GAAP product gross margin was 86.4% in the second quarter, 210 basis points higher year-over-year and primarily associated with a lower royalty expense.  Non\u2010GAAP R&D was $1.1 billion, down 9% year\u2010over\u2010year, with lower remdesivir\u2010related investments as compared to the same period last year, partly offset by higher investments across our pipeline, notably Trodelvy and magrolimab.  Non\u2010GAAP SG&A expense was $1.1 billion, down 4% year\u2010over\u2010year, primarily due to lower legal expenses, offset in part by continued commercial investment in Trodelvy and Veklury outside the United States. Moving to tax, we realized a lower effective tax rate of 19.6% for the quarter, or down 320 basis points year\u2010over\u2010year, due to a shift in geographic earnings mix.  Overall, our non\u2010GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.87 per share in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.11 for the same period last year. The year\u2010over\u2010year improvement primarily reflects higher product sales due to Veklury, higher gross margin, as well as lower operating expenses and a lower effective tax rate, offset by lower interest income.  Overall, we're encouraged by our first half results, shown on slide 22.  Moving to slide 23, you can see that we are updating our guidance for 2021. As always, the duration and magnitude of the COVID\u201019 pandemic continue to be uncertain, and the rate and degree of these pandemic impacts as well as the corresponding recovery from the pandemic may vary across our business.  With that said, we now expect full-year total product sales in the range of $24.4 billion to $25 billion compared to our previous range of $23.7 billion to $25.1 billion. The new range increases the midpoint from $24.4 billion to $24.7 billion, and reflects our solid results year\u2010to\u2010date as well as our updated expectations for the second half of the year.  With first half Veklury revenue of $2.3 billion, we now expect full-year Veklury revenue in the range of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion compared to our previous $2 billion to $3 billion range.  Our updated range reflects the ongoing role of Veklury in this pandemic, and assumes we'll continue to see regional outbreaks. The situation continues to be dynamic, and we'll likely update our thinking again when we report our earnings after the third quarter.  Back to our guidance, we now expect total product sales excluding Veklury for the year to be in the range of $21.7 billion to $21.9 billion compared to our previous range of $21.7 billion to $22.1 billion. This tightening of the range reflects the longer-than-expected pandemic impact on our business, including the latest increase in COVID\u201019 cases.  As Johanna discussed, the pandemic has most notably impacted our HIV treatment business where we saw substantially fewer treatment initiations and a greater number of discontinuations than expected in 2020. It's taking longer than we expected for treated patient volume to ramp back up to more normal levels, particularly in the United States. That said, we saw encouraging signs of recovery in the HIV market in the second quarter, and our guidance assumes recovery will continue through the remainder of the year.  Based on market share dynamics, we remain very confident in our competitive positioning, and we believe we are well positioned as the recovery continues.  Looking at the rest of our P&L, we now expect non\u2010GAAP product gross margin in the range of 86% to 87%, reflecting the lower mix of HIV revenue. We now expect non\u2010GAAP R&D to decline low to mid-single digit percentage compared to 2020 levels. This primarily reflects the timing of investments, and we remind you that expenses in both R&D and SG&A are back-end loaded this year, increasing sequentially from Q2 into Q3, and then even more from Q3 into Q4. Our non\u2010GAAP SG&A guidance remains unchanged at flat to low-single digit percentage decline over 2020.  In R&D, we will be ramping up additional studies with magrolimab, Trodelvy, long\u2010acting combination work with lenacapavir for the treatment of HIV, and other pipeline activities.  And in SG&A, we will be ramping up marketing activities to support our growing portfolio of indications such as with Trodelvy and Tecartus.  Finally, reflecting the updates to our revenue, gross margin, and operating expense guidance, we now project non\u2010GAAP diluted EPS between $6.90 per share and $7.25 per share for the year, and GAAP diluted EPS between $4.70 and $5.05.  Additionally, our capital allocation priorities have not changed, and we remain committed to our dividend. Year\u2010to\u2010date, we have paid down $1.25 billion in debt, and we are on\u2010track to repay at least $4 billion in debt by the end of the year.  With that, I'll invite the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. As you know, there's litigation that's underway. There were some recent developments that a number of analysts have wrote about. Our base case continues to be that there'll be generics arriving in 2025 and 2026 in the US and EU, respectively. But we think we have a strong case and we look forward to continuing to prosecute the case. And we'll see where it plays out. We should have an additional update later this year. So, that's really where it stands. I'm happy to follow-up here, Geoff. Good question. Nothing has changed from the guidance at the beginning of the year. So, our R&D spend and all of our expense guidance does not include the opt-ins on any of the programs that we have opt-ins, including the three programs that you mentioned at Arcus. You also asked about the opt-in windows. The opt-in window for the first TIGIT antibody should be coming most likely at the end of this year or it could be early next year, but it's most likely at the end of this year. We'll have enough patient data to trigger the opt-in or our desired opt-in potentially early. On the other two programs, the adenosine programs at Arcus, that's most likely next year. And again, there may be additional data that comes this year. But if it looks really strong, we want to move as quickly as we can, and we can opt-in early, Geoff, on those programs.  And then, on Toledo, it's relatively simple. On all of the Galapagos programs that opt-in comes after Phase II enabling studies, so the Toledo programs are a long ways away from a potential opt-in decision. Yeah, Phase III enabling. Thank you."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Merdad Parsey",
            "content": "Thank you, Johanna. As Dan mentioned, it has been a gratifying year, delivering on all our key pipeline commitments, supporting Gilead's ambitions to extend our leadership in HIV and creating a broader portfolio spanning virology and oncology, and building our portfolio in inflammation.  I'll spend our time today on the highlights of the quarter, and point you to the appendix of the earnings presentation for a more complete view of our pipeline activities.  First, in HIV, as you can see on slide 15, programs for our investigational lenacapavir agent continue to progress. At the recent International AIDS Society meeting, we shared data from the Phase II/III CAPELLA study that evaluated heavily treatment\u2010experienced individuals who have already developed resistance to multiple antiretroviral drugs.  CAPELLA demonstrated lenacapavir's potency in this difficult to treat population. Despite significant prior resistance, antiviral activity was observed starting at day 15. By week 26, 81% of individuals had viral suppression when lenacapavir was combined with an optimized background regimen.  Based on these data, we have filed a New Drug Application. If approved, this would become the first six-month long\u2010acting subcutaneous injection regimen available, and deliver a welcome new option for people living with HIV who have developed multi\u2010drug\u2010resistance to other antiretrovirals.  Also at IAS, we presented strong interim results from the Phase II CALIBRATE study, evaluating lenacapavir in a treatment\u2010nai\u0308ve population. In CALIBRATE, participants received lenacapavir either as a subcutaneous injection or as a daily oral pill in combination with Descovy.  At week 28, 94% of subjects achieved HIV\u20101 RNA loads of less than 50 copies per mL. These findings will be used to help inform our broader efforts establishing lenacapavir as a foundational agent for our long\u2010acting franchise.  Late last month, we screened the first patient for the Phase III PURPOSE\u20102 trial studying lenacapavir for HIV prevention in cisgender men, transgender women, transgender men, and gender non-binary people who have sex with men and are at risk of HIV infection. We expect to initiate the Phase III PURPOSE\u20101 study of lenacapavir for HIV prevention in adolescent girls and young women later this year.  Finally, we are actively working on the co\u2010formulation for the long\u2010acting investigational oral and injectable combinations of lenacapavir and islatravir and expect to initiate the oral Phase II trial by the end of the year.  Moving on to HDV on slide 16. Last month, at the International Liver Congress, we presented data from the MYR301 and MYR204 programs. MYR301 is a Phase III registrational study evaluating bulevirtide as monotherapy for the treatment of HDV.  Interim results demonstrated that bulevirtide was well tolerated in both cirrhotic and non\u2010cirrhotic patients with compensated chronic HDV infections. At week 24, bulevirtide treatment was associated with significantly greater HDV RNA declines and improvements in biochemical measures of disease activity compared to no treatment. Moreover, there were no treatment\u2010related serious adverse events leading to discontinuation.  These results continue to support the effectiveness of the 2 mg dose, which has received conditional approval from the EMA, and will form the basis of the BLA filing planned for later this year in the U.S.  As part of our HDV cure efforts, we also presented interim data from the MYR204 Phase IIb study investigating finite regimens of bulevirtide both as monotherapy and in combination with PEG\u2010interferon alpha. Both monotherapy and combination treatments of bulevirtide were found to be generally well tolerated and more effective than PEG\u2010interferon alone through 24 weeks of therapy.  The primary endpoint analysis occurs at 24\u2010weeks after completion of therapy and includes virologic and biochemical response data. We look forward to sharing those data when available.  Moving to slide 17, and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, as you know, we shared earlier strong positive top\u2010line data from ZUMA\u20107, the landmark 359\u2010patient Phase III study evaluating Yescarta in second\u2010line LBCL. The study met the primary end point for event\u2010free survival, with a hazard ratio of 0.398, representing a 60% improvement in event\u2010free survival compared to standard of care stem cell transplant. Yescarta had a safety profile comparable to or better than what we have seen in the third line setting. This is a clinically and statistically meaningful improvement in outcomes that, if approved in the US, could extend Yescarta's reach to a total unique population of 14,000 patients annually in the second and third\u2010line LBCL setting.  ZUMA\u20107 also met the key secondary endpoint of objective response rate. As expected, data for overall survival is immature at this time, but the interim analysis suggests a favorable trend in this critical milestone.  In summary, we are very excited about the potential benefit to patients demonstrated in ZUMA\u20107 and look forward to beginning discussions with regulatory agencies later this year as we work towards potential sBLA and MAA filing for Yescarta in second\u2010line LBCL. And, separately, we are on track for the Phase II readout for first\u2010line LBCL study before the end of the year.  Beyond LBCL, we have completed filing Yescarta with the EMA for patients with follicular lymphoma after three or more lines of systemic therapy. We also have a PDUFA date of October 1 under accelerated review with the FDA for Tecartus in ALL.  And, of course, while our internal focus remains on autologous cell therapies, we continue our engagement in alternative approaches, most recently partnering with Shoreline Biosciences to develop novel off\u2010the\u2010shelf, allogeneic cell therapies based on natural killer targets for hematological cancers.  Slide 18 is a recap of our pipeline execution so far this year. In addition to the items we've discussed already, our partner Arcus provided an early, interim update of their Phase II ARC\u20107 trial in late June, demonstrating clinical activity in the anti\u2010TIGIT domvanalimab\u2010based doublet and triplet combinations.  Zimberelimab, our anti\u2010PD\u20101 antibody, saw similar levels of activity in the monotherapy arm compared to marketed anti\u2010PD\u20101s. Based on the interim analysis, we are pleased that ARC\u20107 and the confirmatory Phase III ARC\u201010 trial will continue to enroll as planned. We look forward to seeing how the data mature with additional patients and duration of follow\u2010up to inform our opt\u2010in decision.  Separately, our partner Galapagos also shared data readouts from their Toledo SIK2/3 programs across psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis and the plaque psoriasis from their TYK2 program. Both studies were early and had small samples, and we look forward to additional data.  We also remain focused on the following upcoming milestones. For Trodelvy, we continue to target a TROPiCS\u201002 PFS readout this year. The study is an event\u2010driven Phase III trial in patients with hormone receptor positive/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer. Pending data, we will evaluate and determine the appropriate regulatory next steps. We estimate there are roughly 17,000 patients in the US who could benefit from Trodelvy in this setting.  We continue to expect the Phase III non\u2010small cell lung cancer for Trodelvy to initiate in the second half of this year. We plan to share an update from the TROPiCS\u201003 basket study on lung cancer later this year and will separately provide updates on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer as those data mature.  We anticipate a Phase Ib readout for magrolimab in MDS later this year and, pending data, will engage with regulators as we explore a potential BLA filing for accelerated approval. If approved, magrolimab would be the first\u2010in\u2010class macrophage checkpoint inhibitor targeting CD47 and Gilead's first frontline oncology indication.  There is a significant unmet need for MDS with no new treatments approved in 14 years despite 15,000 new patients being diagnosed each year in the US alone. We continue our development efforts in AML and have enrolled our first patient in the Phase III frontline AML magrolimab study.  Before I wrap the pipeline discussion, I wanted to share one last update on remdesivir. We have decided not to move forward with an inhaled formulation of remdesivir based on the results of our initial proof\u2010of\u2010concept study, suggesting sub\u2010optimal lung deposition.  To address patient needs in the evolving pandemic, we are continuing our efforts on advancing multiple novel antivirals. We expect to submit IND filings later this year or early next year for these agents. We remain committed to supporting patients through this pandemic and continuing our legacy of developing anti\u2010viral therapeutics for the treatment of emerging diseases.  Finally, on slide 19, I want to recognize the teams at Gilead and Kite. Compared to just two years ago, our pipeline has grown from 30 clinical stage programs to over 50 today and resulted in a considerably more diverse set of assets that can be transformative not only for patients, but for Gilead.  The Gilead and Kite teams have worked tirelessly to deliver on our pipeline programs during this time of dramatic growth despite the pandemic. It's a thrilling time to be part of a team with tireless dedication and commitment to helping patients. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters ahead.  With that, I'll hand the call over to Andy to walk us through the financial results of the quarter. With TROPiCS\u201003, it's a basket study. So, the Ns per arm are not hard and fast. We'll probably be looking at data once we get to the 20, 30 range in there, but it's not predetermined. So, I wouldn't want to overstate it. Regarding ILD, we are definitely very sensitive to and watching for it, as you can imagine. To date, we haven't had any reports of that, but we're ever vigilant. It's a very good question. I think if you think about the patients in that trial, these are highly treatment experienced patients who often develop resistance because of non-compliance. And when these subjects are getting a subcu injection of lenacapavir, remember that these patients are going to potentially continue to go off and on their oral regimens.  As we think about the future, as you know, we are for treatment going outside of the highly treatment experienced population. We're really thinking about how we're going to combine lenacapavir with other long acting agents like islatravir. And as we do so, I think the concerns about patients potentially having effective monotherapy with lenacapavir go away in some regards, right? Ensuring that patients are taking multiple agents at the same time is going to be really important for us. I think the stories are similar. We like to keep you apprised of what could potentially come into our portfolio, and we have the opt-in rights for Arcus. I think Dan laid out Galapagos well. For Arcus, we continue to wait for data to mature. And once the data get to a level of maturity where we can really make the call, that's when we'll have our opt in. We have not included \u2013 and Andy will confirm for me, but we have not included the financials of potential opt-in in our guidance at this point. Phase III enabling. I think we have been pretty been pretty consistently of the mindset that the vaccines will make a tremendous impact in the case numbers and those sorts of things. Even when we get to some sort of equilibrium, unfortunately, there will continue to be, we believe, infections. People will continue to get infected, and some proportion of those patients will end up in the hospital.  So, we do believe that Veklury in the hospitalized setting is going to continue to be really important for treating those patients. And as Dan alluded to, we continue to believe and are committed to making treatments available in the outpatient setting. So, the inhaled, nebulized approach didn't give us the results we were hoping for, the consistency we were looking for. But because we have other agents in our pipeline based on our virology expertise, we will be bringing those forward and really focusing on the outpatient setting there. So, we continue to believe that having a treatment available for people, whether they're vaccinated or not, is going to be important for the foreseeable future. We have not done the interim PFS analysis. As we've talked about, that'll happen certainly before the end of the year, we hope. And that's still what we're tracking to, but we have not done the analysis yet. So, we remain blinded to those data.  And then, in terms of Bill, I think I wouldn't necessarily tie it as you're suggesting to Arcus. It's certainly an advantage for us that, should we opt-in to Arcus programs, Bill will bring familiarity. But for us, Bill's experience and leadership and his excitement about being here and overseeing the overall portfolio were the drivers for Bill coming onboard. On the TROPiCS\u201002 study, we have not done a futility analysis. We continue to look to those data maturing and getting the number of events that we need for the PFS analysis that we have planned. We're pretty confident in our powering and, in particular, since we expanded the sample size to make sure that we are able to hit the PFS endpoint. Of course, a relevant issue is more the duration of PFS that we get, but from a powering standpoint, we're comfortable. And it's just a matter of seeing those data.  From an ongoing event standpoint, I think we are where we thought we would be at this point. And it's really around just letting the events come in, make sure they get adjudicated, we clean the data in time to do the analysis properly. So, that's where we are with that.  And then, in terms of the lung data on efficacy, as I think we've said before, we're really proceeding somewhat at risk and pretty aggressively, partly based on our belief in the drug, partly because of what we've seen with other agents in lung and partly based on our early data that you're familiar with in lung that we've seen. Of course, we want to make those data more robust while we go into the Phase III world. So, we are going to augment our existing data to make sure that we're mitigating our risks somewhat. But thus far, I think what we are hoping for is efficacy that certainly is comparable to what the benchmark might be, even though I think it's too early to say what that benchmark is with a direct competitor. But we are, again, I think confident about our ability to bring safety profile that hopefully will be better for patients. I think we have the luxury of being able to look at the singlet, a doublet and a triple here. We would be, of course, excited if the triplet differentiates from the doublet and provides better efficacy. I think that's what we'd be looking for. And so, as the data mature, looking for some signals, a reason to believe that the triplet is performing more robustly than the doublet is probably going to be our focus. We'd be very excited if that plays out and gives us, I think, a pretty unique position."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jacquie Ross, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the first quarter of 2021. The press release, slides, and supplementary data are available on the investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today\u2019s call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day, our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier, our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey, and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we\u2019ll open up the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Christi Shaw, the Chief Executive Officer of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward\u2010looking statements, including those related to the impact of the COVID\u201019 pandemic on Gilead\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations; our plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, financial projections and the use of capital; and our 2021 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward\u2010looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward\u2010looking statements. Non\u2010GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company\u2019s underlying business performance. The GAAP to non\u2010GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet, as well as on the Gilead website. I will now turn the call over to Dan.\nDaniel O'Day: Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Before I hand over to the team to go into the details of our commercial, pipeline and financial results, I wanted to share our overall assessment of Gilead\u2019s first quarter. 2021 is a pivotal year for Gilead, and as you can see on Slide 4, we are off to a solid start. Our first quarter total product sales were in\u2010line with our internal expectations. While our core business was more impacted by COVID\u201019 than we anticipated, this was offset by higher Veklury sales. In the United States, one in two hospitalized patients are receiving Veklury, and worldwide Veklury continues to play a key role as a standard of care treatment for patients who are hospitalized with COVID\u201019. Given the desperate situation in India, Gilead has been working with the Indian government, health authorities and our voluntary licensees to increase supply of remdesivir and provide donated medicine. As the trajectory of the pandemic evolves globally, we will continue to invest in multiple clinical studies of Veklury, including alternative formulations. Earlier this month, we received two FDA approvals for Trodelvy. The full approval for metastatic triple negative breast cancer extended the label to second\u2010line plus patients. This means, Trodelvy could help many more patients, as there are more than double the number of patients in this category as there are in the third line setting. We also received accelerated approval in second\u2010line plus metastatic urothelial cancer. In March, we announced a new partnership to combine investigational lenacapavir with Merck\u2019s investigational islatravir for long\u2010acting HIV treatment, accelerating the path to the next wave of therapies. While many people living with HIV may prefer a daily regimen like Biktarvy, we believe that broadening their options to include weekly oral therapies and infrequent injections every three months or longer addresses a significant patient need, and sets up strong, sustainable HIV leadership into the late 2030s. Long\u2010acting formulations, such as lenacapavir as monotherapy, are also likely to unlock further PrEP usage and reach many more people at risk of HIV. We are also pleased with our progress in advancing lenacapavir in both treatment and prevention settings as part of our internal clinical development. This past quarter, we reported compelling long-acting efficacy data for lenacapavir in heavily treatment\u2010experienced people with multi\u2010drug resistant HIV. We are fully confident that lenacapavir will be the foundation for our long-acting HIV treatment and prevention portfolio. And while we advance lenacapavir, Biktarvy usage continues to grow, with one in two people living with HIV starting their treatment on Biktarvy in the U.S. In addition, Biktarvy is capturing one in two switches, and approximately, half of those are switching from a regimen that includes a non\u2010Gilead agent. In addition to securing regulatory approvals in oncology, we have already achieved several other pipeline milestones, including EMA validation of the Trodelvy MAA for metastatic triple\u2010negative breast cancer and submission of the supplemental biologics license application to FDA for Tecartus in relapse or refractory ALL. Building on the work we did last year, we continue with the disciplined prioritization of our pipeline across Gilead. To share one example, Kite completed an optimization exercise this past quarter, to ensure that resources are focused on the most promising opportunities to make a difference for patients. Finally, we're looking forward to a full-year of clinical news flow for Gilead. Our pipeline list for 2021 includes over 20 milestones across therapeutic areas. While they are all important steps in Gilead's journey to serve more patients and diversify our business, Slide 5 lists the most significant items, so you can track our progress more clearly. These include the Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 PFS readout for Trodelvy in hormone receptor positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer; Yescarta's Phase 3 ZUMA-7 readout for second-line DLBCL, which could result in an sBLA submission later this year; the Phase 3 readout for Hepcludex that could lead to BLA filing; ARC-2 Domvanalimab Phase 2 or seven interim readout in non-small cell lung cancer, which could inform an opt-in decision; Magrolimab's Phase 1b data readout in MDS, which could lead to a submission for accelerated approval later this year; and potential Phase 2 initiation of lenacapavir and islatravir as a long-acting oral HIV treatment in the second-half of 2021. Our aspirations for patients are bold and our pipeline offers diversity across indications and risk profiles. While execution will continue to be a focus, these milestones give us a great deal of optimism about the future and our ability to deliver therapies that make a meaningful difference for patients. Before I hand off, I want to take a moment to thank Dr. Bill Lee, who is retiring from his role as Executive Vice President of Research after 30 years at Gilead. On behalf of all of us, I want to offer my sincere gratitude to Bill for his outstanding contributions that have helped to benefit millions of patients around the world. I would also like to welcome Dr. Flavius Martin, who joined Gilead as the new EVP of Research on April 12. Flavius has an impressive track record in overseeing industry-leading research and advancing new therapeutic candidates. With that, I'll invite Johanna to update you on our commercial operations in the first quarter.\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on Slide 7, it was a solid quarter of execution for the commercial team with total product revenue of $6.3 billion, up 16% from the first quarter of last year. This was in line with our internal expectations as Veklury sales offset a more substantial pandemic-related impact on our core business than we had anticipated. Excluding Veklury, total product revenue was $4.9 billion, reflecting inventory and pricing seasonality the anticipated HIV loss of exclusivity in the U.S., and ongoing pandemic-related dynamics in HIV and HCV. Moving to HIV on Slide 8. Revenue was down sequentially as expected, primarily due to seasonal trends. As a reminder, two things happen every year to our HIV business that contribute to a sequential decline from Q4 to Q1. First, the channel builds inventory in the fourth quarter then draws it down in Q1. In the first quarter of 2021, this inventory impact contributed an estimated $410 million to the sequential decline. Second, we've realized lower net HIV prices in the first quarter, due to items such as increased co-pay support and Part D discounts, which tend to normalize throughout the rest of the year. This quarter, we had two additional impacts.  A year-over-year decline of $335 million in Truvada NHFR revenue associated with LOEs in the US. And a difficult comparison in the first quarter of 2020 given the pandemic-related HIV stocking we saw in March of 2020, as well as the impact of the pandemic on HIV market demand. Our focus is on share-driven by demand. Overall, three and four people living with HIV initiate or switch to Gilead products, highlighting the strength in demand for our life-changing medicines. While the pandemic dampened market size and switched volumes, we maintain share in line with prior quarters across our total HIV portfolio despite generic erosion. In terms of product lines, Biktarvy was up 8% year-over-year, but down sequentially as expected driven by seasonal inventory and pricing dynamics. Despite the pandemic impact on the new starts and switch volume in HIV, demand fundamental for Biktarvy remains strong, with five share point growth compared to the same time last year and two share point growth just in the last quarter in the United States. As Dan mentioned earlier, one out of two people living with HIV initiating or switching therapy is prescribed Biktarvy. Further, nearly half of Biktarvy switches come from incremental sources. Descovy revenue was down sequentially and year-over-year largely driven by seasonal inventory and pricing dynamics. Although, PrEP volume continues to be impacted by the pandemic, Descovy share remains stable around 45% and positions us well as the PrEP market recovers post\u2010pandemic. Moving to Slide 9, HCV first quarter revenue was $510 million. We continue to maintain a leading share of about 60% in the US and 50% in Europe. Despite COVID continuing to impact patient starts, we did see a very modest sequential improvement overall in patient volume, although it remains depressed versus pre\u2010COVID levels. HCV also benefited from a pricing adjustment in France. As shown on Slide 10, in Q1, HBV and HDV sales totaled $220 million with HBV sales of $214 million, growing 15% year\u2010over\u2010year, driven by strong Vemlidy demand, most notably in China and in the US. We continue to expect the HBV franchise sales to reach $1 billion by full year 2022. With the completion of the MYR acquisition during the first quarter, our portfolio now includes Hepcludex. There are currently no available treatments for HDV, making Hepcludex, which has received conditional approval by the EMA, a first\u2010in\u2010class treatment. This innovative drug blocks viral entry into liver cells. We are targeting a BLA submission later this year, and are excited by the opportunity to make Hepcludex more broadly available and address the unmet need for people who are infected with HDV. Moving to Slide 11, Trodelvy delivered $72 million in its first full quarter as part of the Gilead portfolio. In a span of just three weeks this month, Trodelvy received FDA full approval for second\u2010line plus metastatic triple negative breast cancer, received accelerated approval in second\u2010line plus metastatic urothelial cancer, and had its ASCENT Phase III data published in The New England Journal of Medicine just a week ago. We can now leverage treatment efficacy data from the full trial population in our discussions with physicians, and build even greater confidence to consider this potentially transformative therapy. This more than doubles the patient population, extending our reach to 6,000 second line metastatic TNBC patients in the US, in addition to over 4,000 patients in the third\u2010line plus population. Given the poor prognosis and difficulty in treating both second and third line metastatic TNBC patients, Trodelvy could extend median overall survival by almost a year while also nearly tripling the median progression free survival compared to chemotherapy. Outside the US, we submitted the TNBC Marketing Authorization Application based on the ASCENT Phase III clinical study for an accelerated review process. We look forward to continuing discussions with the European Medicines Agency and anticipate approval as early as December of this year. Additionally, Trodelvy is under review for TNBC in the UK, Canada, Switzerland, and Australia as part of Project Orbis. On Slide 12, Christi is on the call to answer your questions shortly, but you can see that our Cell Therapy business had a strong quarter, with revenue of $191 million, up 36% from the same quarter last year, driven by growing adoption of Yescarta in Europe, with our industry\u2010leading four\u2010year 44% overall survival. The recent approval for Yescarta in follicular lymphoma will broaden our addressable patient population and support our ongoing growth. Tecartus continues to see strong launch demand as physicians and patients adopt the first and only cell therapy approved for relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Moving to Veklury on Slide 13, first quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, with demand tracking hospitalization rates. Although we saw lower hospitalization rates and increasing vaccination rates in certain parts of the world, overall progress was more gradual than expected over the first quarter and as such, we are now assuming a slower pandemic\u2010recovery for the second quarter. As the pace of recovery builds momentum in the second half of the year, this should contribute to a modest recovery in patient starts for our HCV and HIV franchises. We will continue to play our part to support broader access for eligible patients in need of remdesivir. We are working with our voluntary licensees to accelerate production capacity for India, while also donating 450,000 vials of Veklury to help patients as the supply of licensed generics increases. Our thoughts are with those who continue to tackle the worst of this pandemic. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Merdad.\nMerdad Parsey: Thank you, Johanna. As both Dan and Johanna mentioned, we are off to a solid start in a catalyst heavy 2021, and my comments today will focus on the nearer\u2010term events and changes to our pipeline. A comprehensive update on our broader pipeline is included in the appendix of the slide deck available on our IR website. I\u2019ll start with our virology pipeline. We remain as focused as ever on driving innovation in HIV therapies, and there are no changes to the expected timelines associated with our lenacapavir programs. In HIV prevention, we are activating sites for our first Phase III study for lenacapavir as monotherapy for the prevention of HIV and will begin screening patients later this quarter. This study will focus on preventing infection in cisgender men, transgender women and men, and gender non\u2010binary people who have sex with men. In the second half of 2021, we plan to initiate a study looking at lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV infections in adolescent girls and young women. In treatment, we presented additional data from Phase II/III CAPELLA trial for lenacapavir at CROI and we continue to expect our first lenacapavir filing for use with other anti-retrovirals and heavily treatment experienced individuals in the second half of this year. We anticipate data later this year from the Phase 2 CALIBRATE study in the treatment-naive population to support a virologically suppressed indication. And we plan to launch a Phase 2 trial for a long-acting oral treatment combination of Gilead's lenacapavir and Merck's islatravir in the second half of this year. Both medicines have shown long half-lives and high potency at low doses. As such, we believe that the lenacapavir plus islatravir combination is promising and we're excited by our new partnership and working with our colleagues at Merck to bring the maximum benefit possible to people living with HIV. Based on our commitment to HIV, we continue to work towards a potential cure. We have several early-stage programs evaluating combinations to understand the biology and identify path for this important mission. Leveraging our internal expertise as well as external partnerships, including Aelix and Gritstone. On Slide 16, moving on to the oncology pipeline, which has over 20 internal clinical stage programs, including many built around Trodelvy. We're excited to have received full FDA approval of Trodelvy in second-line plus metastatic triple-negative breast cancer based on the confirmatory Phase 3 ASCENT trial data. In the US alone this indication expands upon the accelerated approval for third line metastatic triple negative breast cancer to now include second-line patients, who've had at least one prior treatment for metastatic disease. Trodelvy has the potential to significantly improve overall survival and progression-free survival outcomes for patients. In the US, there's a population of 10,000 patients who may benefit from Trodelvy. We also received FDA accelerated approval for second-line metastatic urothelial carcinoma based on positive data from the Phase 2 TROPHY study. With almost one-third of patients responding to treatment and the 7.2-month median duration of response, Trodelvy offers a much-needed new treatment option for the many patients with metastatic urothelial cancer, whose disease continues to progress despite receiving available first and second-line treatment. In the US alone, we estimate there are roughly 8,000 addressable patients. 2021 will continue to be an exciting year for Trodelvy, and there have been no changes to the 2021 timelines we shared previously. We submitted the MAA to the EMA for Trodelvy in second-line plus metastatic TNBC in March, and it's now under accelerated review. We continue to target EU approval in the second half of this year. Later this year, we anticipate a Phase 3 TROPiCS\u201002 progression free survival readout for hormone receptor positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Pending data, we'll evaluate and determine the appropriate next steps from a regulatory standpoint. We estimate there are roughly 17,000 patients in the US who could benefit from Trodelvy in this setting. We're now actively recruiting additional patients for the Phase 2 TROPiCS-03 basket study in solid tumors to expand eligibility to patients regardless of TROPiCS-02 expression. We've already decided to initiate a Phase 3 trial in non-small cell lung cancer in the second half of this year, and we'll share updates on additional plan studies later this year. Moving on to cell therapy on Slide 17. With FDA's accelerated approval of the Yescarta for patients with third-line plus follicular lymphoma in March, we now have added a third indication for the Kite portfolio. ZUMA-5 study data showed the 91% of patients responded to a single infusion with an estimated 74% of patients in continued remission at 18 months. We're working towards making this option available to patients outside the US and continue to target an MAA filing in the next several months. There are no changes to the expected timelines for the ZUMA-7 study assessing Yescarta for the second-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or DLBCL patients. We expect to announce the top-line Phase 3 outcome later this quarter, followed by sBLA and MAA submissions in the second half of the year. Additionally, the FDA has approved the inclusion of the ZUMA-1 Cohort 4s updated safety data into Yescarta's label for third-line DLBCL. Cohort 4 demonstrated that early use of corticosteroids and/or tocilizumab led to reductions in cytokine release syndrome or neurological events. Moving on to Tecartus, we submitted our sBLA for relapsed or refractory adult B-cell precursor, acute lymphocytic leukemia or ALL just after the end of the first quarter. If approved, Tecartus would add a much-needed treatment option for patients 18 and older. We plan to share the ZUMA-3 data at ASCO this summer and we continue to enroll patients for ZUMA-4 to evaluate Tecartus for ALL in the pediatric population. Consistent with our ongoing diligence across both Gilead and Kite, we will continue to focus and streamline the Kite portfolio to align with our key strategic priorities and expertise in hematologic malignancies, specifically lymphoma and leukemia. Moving on to Slide 18. In addition to the previously mentioned milestones for virology Trodelvy and Kite, we have several other notable upcoming events. First, I want to take a moment to highlight magrolimab's progress and outlook in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. In MDS, we expect to see Phase 1b data in the second half of this year, pending results those data could lead to a BLA submission before the end of the year. If approved, magrolimab will be the first-in-class macrophage checkpoint inhibitor targeting CD47 and Gilead's first run frontline oncology indication. There's a significant unmet need for MDS with no new treatments approved in 14 years, despite 15,000 new patients diagnosed each year in the US alone. We're also exploring pivotal studies in frontline AML. Additionally, we continue to evaluate multiple solid tumor indications for magrolimab most recently initiating a Phase Ib/II second-line plus solid tumor basket study and a randomized Phase II study for head and neck cancer in combination with chemotherapy and Merck's KEYTRUDA. Second in Virology, we're thrilled to officially add Hepcludex into our portfolio and look forward to Phase III data readout later this quarter with the potential for a BLA filing in the second half of the year. As for potential opt-in programs Arcus' ARC-7 non-small cell lung cancer study is expected to evaluate an interim data in the second quarter. We and the Arcus team have indicated that the interim analysis is targeting an ORR of 50% or greater and a clear separation in ORR from the Zimberelimab monotherapy arm when compared to the Domvanalimab plus Zimberelimab combination arm. Last on Slide 19, you can see our robust and diversified pipeline across oncology virology and inflammation. In addition to the readouts on the previous slide we have multiple collaboration programs that we're monitoring closely including Arcus' eight -- ARC-8 study in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and ARC-6 study for castration-resistant prostate cancer expect -- both of which expect initial readouts later this year. And the Galapagos 623 Toledo proof-of-concept trials across psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and RA are expected to have readouts later this year. In closing, we're pleased to see how our portfolio has grown from about 30 clinical stage programs two years ago to 47 today, while maintaining our focus on disciplined management of R&D expenses. We've also gone from six molecules approved filed or in registrational studies to 15. Our teams have worked tirelessly to continuously evaluate and accelerate priority programs. We're thrilled to see how our portfolio is developing. And we look forward to accelerating innovation to help transform patient care. With that I'd like to hand the call over to Andy.\nAndrew Dickinson: Thank you Merdad and good afternoon everyone. As you can see we are building momentum in our clinical pipeline and we expect to have plenty of data to share as we move through the rest of 2021. Moving to Slide 21. The first quarter was a good start to the year with total product sales in line with our internal expectations overall as modestly higher Veklury sales offset a slower pandemic-related recovery than we had anticipated. In addition to pandemic impacts, our HIV business reflected the inventory seasonality we typically see in the first quarter. Total product sales were $6.3 billion up 16% year-over-year driven primarily by Veklury. The first quarter reflects continued growth from Biktarvy, our first full quarter of Trodelvy sales and strong growth in HBV as well as cell therapy. This growth was offset by ongoing COVID-related softness across our business in addition to the Truvada and Atripla LOEs. As also indicated by Johanna, there is the difficult comparison to the first quarter of 2020 given the pandemic-related HIV stocking observed last year. As a result total product sales excluding Veklury were $4.9 billion down 11% year-over-year. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 86.5%, 60 basis points lower year-over-year primarily associated with product mix and a small inventory charge partially offset by favorable royalty adjustments. Non-GAAP R&D was $1 billion, up 4% year-over-year primarily driven by investment in new pipeline products including Trodelvy and magrolimab offset by timing of certain clinical studies and lower Veklury-related expenses. Non-GAAP SG&A was also $1 billion, down 4% from Q1 2020 due to timing of grants and sales and marketing activities. This was partially offset by higher commercialization investments associated with Veklury, Trodelvy cell therapy and HBV and HIV in China. Moving to tax. We realized a lower rate of 18% for the quarter due to recognition of favorable settlements with tax authorities. Overall our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.08 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $1.68 for the same period last year. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to Veklury revenues, flat operating expenses and a lower tax rate offset in part by lower interest income. You can see on Slide 22 that there is no change to our full year non-GAAP guidance. While the pandemic remains unpredictable and as we realized a more substantial impact to our core business in the first quarter than we had anticipated, we are nonetheless encouraged by the lower hospitalization rates and increased vaccinations. We have modified our assumptions on the timing of pandemic recovery to allow a more gradual improvement starting in the second quarter. We continue to expect total product sales excluding Veklury of $21.7 billion to $22.1 billion. We continue to expect full year non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses each to be flat to down low single-digit percentages year-over-year. Given our first quarter results, you can see our R&D expenses are somewhat back-end loaded in 2021 based on the timing of clinical activities which include the anticipated initiation of the solid tumor study with magrolimab advancing internal long-acting combinations with lenacapavir for the treatment of HIV and other pipeline activities. Our work with Merck on a long-acting treatment regimen for people living with HIV is also underway and will ramp-up during 2021, although, we are able to absorb this program into our current R&D expense guidance. In SG&A, we are ramping up sales and marketing to support efforts such as the ongoing and expected launches of Trodelvy in the U.S. for bladder cancer and in Europe for triple-negative breast cancer. Additionally, we expect to start seeing higher travel and other costs scale-up in the second half of the year, as social distancing restrictions lighten-up in some geographies. Despite the lighter expenses in the first quarter, we're leaving our operating expense guidance unchanged, as we expect to catch up on this to some extent later in the year. And for now, retain the flexibility to manage the timing of clinical and commercial investments. We continue to expect our non-GAAP tax-rate to be 21% for the year. While we are carefully monitoring the discussions on a higher corporate tax-rate here in the United States, we believe any impact is more likely in 2022 and beyond, although, of course, a more immediate change could alter our current-tax guidance. Finally, with no changes to our revenue or operating expense guidance we continue to expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of $6.75 to $7.45 for the year. We have updated our GAAP diluted EPS guidance and now expect to be in the range of $4.75 to $5.45, down from $5.25 to $5.95, reflecting fair value losses for our equity holdings in the first quarter, donation expenses and other pre-tax charges including upfront payments related to collaboration. On Slide 23, you can see that we remain diligent in our capital allocation priorities. Already this year, we have repaid $1.25 billion in debt. And we're on track to pay down at least $4 billion in total by the end of the year. We have also returned $1.2 billion to shareholders, through dividends and repurchase of shares. To close, we remain committed to delivering for patients and for shareholders, as we look to invest in our business and R&D pipeline, while paying close attention to our expenses. With that, I'll hand the call back to Dan for a few closing comments. Dan?\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks Andy. And before we open-up for questions, I'd like to thank the broadly Gilead team, who accomplished a great deal in the first quarter, setting the stage I think for quite an exciting year reaching catalysts across our clinical portfolio. Of course, Gilead would not be the company it is today without the vision of John Martin, Gilead's Chief Executive Officer for 20 years, who passed away in March. Under his leadership, Gilead transformed the treatment of HIV and viral hepatitis and became a global organization, firmly rooted in its commitment to science and to patients. That commitment will be a constant, as we work to take John's legacy forward in Gilead's next chapter. With that, I'll invite the operator to begin the Q&A.\nQuestion-and:\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets.\nBrian Abrahams: Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. It looks like you're seeing steady growth in adoption of Trodelvy. So I'm just wondering, how should we think about the potential for a near-term inflection and update, now that you'd have full approval in triple-negative, the publication out and label expansion into urothelial? And I'm curious, are you starting to see some pull through. And where do you stand with respect to community physician awareness? How important is that as well for adoption? Thanks.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Brian. Johanna, please.\nJohanna Mercier: Sure. Thanks, Brian, for the question. And we're really excited with the recent news that we got with Trodelvy. It's really going to help us gain momentum, exactly what you said. We have strong awareness in academic centers above 80%. We haven't been able to break through. We're only at about 50% or so in the community. And as you well know, if three quarters of the patients sit in the community, that's an incredible opportunity for us to make sure that we make sure the messages come across. We haven't been in a position in the past to promote overall survival, in light of the fact that we just had that conditional approval. And so now, with the full approval not only do we get to double the patient population that Trodelvy can actually help, but actually we also get to promote the overall survival, which is the only agent with overall survival in this setting. So I think it's really going to help us ramp-up. And the focus is still going to be despite the urothelial bladder indication. We -- the focus is really going to be more like a 90-10, 90% on second-line plus, triple-negative breast cancer and then 10% from a promotional standpoint on urothelial cancer. We believe that that's going to work well, because there's a high overlap. There's about 70% of physicians that overlap from bladder cancer and also treat TNBC. So we're going to be in good shape to ramp this up. This is really the opportunity for Trodelvy right now for this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company.\nPhil Nadeau: Merdad, I had a two-part question for you. You highlighted a couple of oncology events happening in the second-half of the year, namely the magrolimab Phase Ib data and Trodelvy data in the ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer. On magrolimab, can you give us some sense of what data needs to be produced to support a filing? And on Trodelvy, there's been a fair amount of breast cancer data recently. Has anything that you've seen questioned the powering assumptions behind the revised design of the TROPiCS-02 trial? Thanks.\nMerdad Parsey: Thanks, Phil. Great questions. In terms of magro, in terms of what we think we need to see. Look, I think, the challenge there is, obviously, that we're looking at external comparisons. So we believe that it's really around the strength of the data and its consistency with what we've seen already in that setting with magrolimab. I think, our assumption is, as long as we are consistent with the data that has emerged that will give us really good grounds to go and approach regulators to discuss a potential filing. So we're, I would say, reasonably confident there and our expectation is, as long as things continue to go the way they have been, we'll be fine. In terms of the breast cancer data for Trodelvy. Yes, I think, in terms of our confidence, I think, we remain confident that we're really well powered in that study to show benefit, in particular, in PFS, as well as OS in that trial. So I don't think we've seen anything emerge that shakes our confidence around that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Louise Pearson with Redburn.\nLouise Pearson: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. On Yescarta, I was just wondering, could you find the incremental effort that would be required on your side to access the second-line DLBCL population should see the 7 readout positively? Just thinking in terms of any overlap there might be in the sort of centers where these patients are treated? And kind of, on a related note, has there been much COVID impact on the cell therapy franchise, Germany seems to have performed pretty robustly? Thank you.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Louise. Over to you, Christi.\nChristi Shaw: Thank you. So I'll take the last one first maybe, which is the COVID impact. We did see COVID impact and slowing of our ramp-up that we started doing well Q1 of last year and there was a slowdown in Q3, Q4. We've seen that rebound in Q1. We do believe that that has to do with less COVID impact, especially in the U.S., Europe, in spite of the COVID impact, continued to grow over those quarters. Germany and Italy, being the exceptions, where the COVID impact has been greater on our business there. Overall, though, we're very pleased with what we're seeing from quarter four to quarter one of this year, significant growth and coming off a couple of down quarters for Yescarta, both the U.S. and the \u2013 and Europe up quarter-over-quarter now with Yescarta. And on the second-line DLBCL question. So the good news is, the APCs are already set up, just like with Yescarta's we're able to launch quickly. So moving up to the second-line doubles the market opportunity, doubles the number of patients that we can serve. We also have community reps in the field already, both in Europe and in the U.S. So this referral pattern will continue to be something that we work on. But the belief, or my belief is, that as we look at patients in the third-line plus, those are typically patients that are going for palliative care and quality of life and short-term quantity of life is being managed whereas with ZUMA-7 in the second-line versus stem cell transplant, physicians and patients are still looking for a cure. So if the study is positive, we're looking at replacing stem cell transplant as a standard of care in second-line for curative potential. Remember, stem cell only cures 20% of the patients that are sent there.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Christi\nOperator: Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: Afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I wanted to ask one on Biktarvy. The adoption has been hugely successful and really for quite some time. So the question is, where do you see share maximizing in the U.S.? And what are the bigger growth opportunities? And then in the EU, what has been the primary headwind to greater share? Thank you.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Geoff. Over to you, Johanna, please.\nJohanna Mercier: Yes. Thanks, Geoff, for the question. Yes, we're really quite pleased with Biktarvy's performance. It just continues. And obviously, there's been some ins and out because of dynamics around us from a market standpoint, because of COVID and inventory, but the share growth 8% year-over-year, as well as the fact that we continue to grow share and even 2 points in the last quarter. We also grew 2 points not only in the U.S., but we also grew just under 2 points in Europe and about 5 points year-over-year as well. So we are seeing solid growth in Europe and we are seeing, in other markets as well, like, Japan and Canada, we're number one with Biktarvy. So I think that, as the data continues to show the benefits of the profile that Biktarvy offers for patients. I think there's no stopping us, Geoff. I think we need to continue to grow this business and we are well poised to get out of this COVID-19 pandemic and hopefully the markets reset. The market already has reset in the naive patient population. We're almost back to pre-COVID levels, which is great, and that's where Biktarvy truly differentiates itself. And in the switch business, we're not there yet. We're about 30% under pre-COVID levels. But again, with a share of close to 50%, also well poised for that to come back on track. So, I think, we continue to expand and continue to gain share over older agents, because of the benefits that Biktarvy offers, not just in the U.S., but really around the world.\nGeoff Meacham: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies.\nMichael Yee: Hi, thank you. And I appreciate the question. Going back to Trodelvy and the TROPiCS-02 study I think it's fantastic. You guys upsized that and overpowered it. I guess I had two questions. One was, can you describe sort of what input went into your powering assumptions for that? And then also, do you guys have a view that higher CDK4/6 matters given that that's pretty much standard of care nowadays and that's certainly evolved over the last few years as you think about the study? Thank you.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Michael. I'll take that. So two -- yes great questions. In terms of assumptions, I think, what's safe to say is we've been fairly conservative on our inputs to the assumptions in terms of looking at what the standard of care PFS looks like and using sort of that as our approach. And I'd say actually that's fairly our general approach. I think we try to take a fairly conservative approach in terms of designing our trials and balance what I would sort of a statistically significant benefit with a clinically meaningful benefit. And I think that that's -- we keep both of those in mind when we're powering our studies to make sure that we are -- we're hitting not only statistical significance, but looking for clinical significance. In terms of prior CDK4/6, I mean it's obviously something that's come up a fair bit appropriately. I think, people are looking at some data -- there are a number of hypotheses that are going around what it could be there. We're trying to take a very data-driven approach on this. And I guess, I would say a couple of things. One is that, in our hands and what we've seen so far from the prior studies, where we looked at those people who had gotten prior to CDK4/6 compared with standard of care, Trodelvy continues to bring benefit to those patients. And as a big caveat that's a fairly small number of people in that from us when we look at it, but I think we're comfortable that that continues to be the case. And secondly, we are going to look at the data from the upcoming trial and we will look at that that group of patients as a subgroup analysis to see if there is a difference in terms of how they respond compared to the overall population of patients that are going to be enrolled in that. So, we'll make sure that we segregate those patients out to make sure we learn from that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess maybe two-part for me. You mentioned a more gradual recovery now in the second quarter, but you maintained your guidance component. So just wanted to understand that a little bit more that you baked in more of a cushion there when you initially gave the guidance? And then on the PrEP side, how are you thinking about the recovery there in the second half of the year? Thank you.\nDaniel O'Day: Okay. Thanks. And so, Andy, why don't you start? And Johanna might want to add to the PrEP.\nAndrew Dickinson: Yes. Hi Terence. Thanks for the question. You're right. At the beginning of the year, we recognize that 2021 was likely to be more dynamic than prior years. And when we put together our guidance for the year, we looked at a range of scenarios. We're well within the range of scenarios in the first quarter. We're off to a good start. The mix was a little bit different than we expected with the additional pandemic-related headwinds that you heard about. But to be clear, when we think both about our total product revenues including Veklury, but also our base case revenues -- our base product revenues excluding Veklury, we're very comfortable with where we are and we're on target for the year. We'll provide another update of course in the middle of the year, but that's how you should think about it at a high level Terence.\nDaniel O'Day: And on the PrEP market -- yes Johanna.\nJohanna Mercier: Yes. Thanks, Dan. So, on the PrEP market, as I mentioned Descovy share is holding at about 45%, 46% in the first quarter. So we're quite pleased with that. We've obviously been working closely with payers to make sure that patients and providers had choice in their prevention approach. The market is still dampened because of this pandemic as you can appreciate with the social dynamics that we are all living with. Although, we have seen some uptake in the last month or so, we'll see how that plays out. But again I think it's going to be in line with what Andy said which is going to be a bit of a gradual recovery for the PrEP market. But I think, we're very well poised to make sure that once that market gets back to pre-COVID levels, I think we'll be in very good shape in light of our -- holding our share at this level.\nTerence Flynn: Thanks, Johanna.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. My kids are just sitting in the background there and excited about your earnings call.\nDaniel O'Day: We love it.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Very excited. They are very, very excited. I have a -- I just want to thank you for your outreach for India. I have a question about your guidance of $2 billion to $3 billion for Veklury. How do we think about this? I mean it doesn't feel like this is going to go on longer outside the United States than we expect. But obviously some places are cheaper than others. Can you give us some estimates on how do you think of -- general trends on pricing and thanks for what you're doing over there? And then this is a very simple question. You talked a lot upfront about cell therapy. There's still -- there is also off-the-shelf iPSCs. We talked about that a lot. Can you give us any sense if you're interested in augmenting our portfolio with one of those because those are different technologies? And again, my kids basing.\nDaniel O'Day: I appreciate your kids loving us. That's terrific. And thank you for acknowledging the efforts of the company for so many countries out there that are streaking with this. Can I ask Johanna to cover the Veklury question and then Christi to cover the cell therapy?\nJohanna Mercier: Absolutely. Thanks, Robyn for your question and comment. I think what we've seen with Veklury is a really directly proportional effect with hospitalization rates. And it's kind of what we've been saying for the last couple of quarters and we're seeing it. Yes. I mean you could literally draw the line with the hospitalizations both in the US as well as outside of the US. Where we've seen sales as in the first quarter and I think that's going to continue although to a lesser degree we've seen hospitalizations really come down in the month of March and kind of hold steady unfortunately. And hopefully, they'll keep coming down as months go by and vaccination rates increase. But what we have seen is sales are really coming out in the US, of course, also within our European region as well as Asia. There's a lot of markets in Asia that are also taking full advantage of the benefits of Veklury for their patients their appropriate patients. And so we believe, we've always said that, we think the tail is longer. I know nobody wants to hear that but I think we think the tail is longer than anybody thought originally. And I think that's what we're seeing as we go into Q2 and it will be a gradual recovery. So we do believe that Veklury still will have an important role to play within the next couple of quarters and potentially beyond into 2022. As for some of these -- for example India or other countries that are served by our voluntary licenses. Obviously, those are royalty-free during the pandemic and that is something at a much lower price level. So our price for Veklury hasn't moved. It's well below the value of Veklury for the developed countries. For the developing rolled up it's obviously quite different. With that Christi?\nChristi Shaw: Yes. Thanks, Robyn. Thanks for the question. So you heard a little bit in the beginning from both Merdad and Johanna and maybe Dan that we recently took a really hard look at our portfolio review. A few things are evolving or transforming if you will. Kite had such a success story in bringing the first potential cure for lymphoma. We've transformed now to a company that has multiple brands, franchise basically three indications now and with a couple more to come in the next year. As we look at that, we know a lot more now about how to affect leukemia and lymphoma in this area. So really taking a focus on making sure that we double down on our life cycle management improving the risk-benefit profile of what we have, trying to get patients with combination therapies for et cetera, to ensure we increase the efficacy. That's really our main focus on our core. We are also looking at disrupting what we have today whether it's iPSC, Allo. We do believe eventually the market will be and we'll be trying to drive that way too towards a lower cost off-the-shelf more convenient for patients' treatments. But today unfortunately from what we've seen at the recent congresses and publications and study results, it's a bit further out than we had anticipated just 12 to 18 months ago. So we really need to focus on improving autologous where we have it today, disrupting ourselves in the future. And lastly to your question beyond iPSC -- your question was iPSC, but even beyond that as we look at solid tumor, we really are the partner of choice with our successful manufacturing process, our ability to deliver reliably in a short period of time. We are looking at transformations, really good transformations where we have proof-of-concept in solid tumors where the market will be the largest in the long-term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Harrison: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. A question on Galapagos and I guess there are two parts here. First part is, you've got these upcoming Toledo readouts. Merdad, maybe you could just comment on what you're potentially looking to see from those readouts given that the duration of those trials is fairly short. So maybe what you would view as sort of a positive outcome. And then I guess, second question is a more sort of broader strategic question here. But if you don't see something that's positive out of those how do you think about the longer-term relationship there? And given that you're the largest shareholder what might you consider in terms of that relationship? Thanks very much.\nDaniel O'Day: Great. You want to start Merdad and then I'll follow.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes, sure. It's a great question. And I think you -- Matthew you mentioned, I think look where we are now with the Toledo programs is looking for evidence of tolerability and proof-of-concept, proof of principle for that pathway in multiple indications. And I would describe these early small studies as a place to demonstrate that and look to see where the biggest impact could be. I think it's an early part of the longer journey ranging from -- is there a particular indication that we want to pursue further to confirm and expand on the signal to -- do we have the right molecule for that. So I think we view these together with Galapagos, I believe, we view these as sort of, very early in the story of the Toledo program. So we'll be looking to see what those data look like in the near-term. Dan, do you want add.\nDaniel O'Day: Sure. So maybe just to you Matthew to just give a little bit of context of people that may not be completely familiar with our relationship with Galapagos. So, of course, there was the filgotinib relationship, but then there was a separate relationship that we went into. As you know, a couple of years ago now. And that was really based on the research platform. And I would say that nothing has really changed in relation to that. I mean one of the reasons to do that was to diversify our approaches from a discovery research perspective across if you like the Gilead Group. I listened hard to the scientists at that time. I continue to listen hard to the scientists today. They think they have a very discriminated platform for screening compounds for first-in-class. And I'll remind you that's really the approach first-in-class which of course comes with some risks some of which we've seen in the later-stage programs. And, of course, Toledo is the most advanced now of those programs. But having said that there are many others within their discovery platform that we continue to be intrigued about. I think it's an important part of our overall inflammation strategy, albeit, at an earlier stage for Gilead. But when we think about our strategic approach that really focuses on immunology and virology as our core scientific skills, we have now obviously leaders in virology built up a really significant presence in oncology with inflammatory disorders really, kind of, the next step and the next stage of our platform where Galapagos presents, I think, one aspect of that but a very important aspect in terms of first-in-class approach. So we continue to be working very closely with our partners at Galapagos to determine what the next screens are and what the next targets are in the concept of our -- the entirety of our inflammation strategy. So thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ronny Gal with Bernstein.\nRonny Gal: Yes. Just a question on Descovy. The 22% down on the year-over-year. I was wondering if you can unpack those for us. So how much of that was inventory COVID impact in price. So when it comes to price do you think this is a like a one-year giveaway? Or should we expect that kind of a pricing decline every year going forward at least when it comes to the back-class compounds?\nDaniel O'Day: Ronny, just at the very end what did you say?\nJohanna Mercier: Yes, please.\nRonny Gal: Are we expecting the price declines this year to be a repeating events every year? Or is this essentially expected to be a onetime decline as to Truvada generic center.\nDaniel O'Day: Got you. Okay. Joanna, you got it.\nJohanna Mercier: Yes. Thank you. So thanks for that. I didn't hear the last part of that question originally. Yes. So for Descovy the year-over-year, obviously, it does have to do with higher payer discounts. And that was to ensure that patients and providers had choice. And make sure that we didn't have any step at it. And now we do have some step at it for some plan. But for most plans access is very open to make sure that our patients and providers choose which therapeutics is best for them for prevention. And so I think that we will continue to be smart and we will continue to be disciplined in the way that we look at those discussions with our payers, but we're also looking at data that's been pretty clear that shows that if you basically put a step at it you don't actually get the patient on a Truvada generic you actually just lose your patient. And I think as we think about ending the epidemic prevention is a big piece of that. And so that's why choice is so important and that we keep people at risk of HIV making sure that we keep those folks on the medicines that they're on without creating any access restrictions. And so if that's what we need to do moving forward to ensure that that might impact the price as we go. Our intent is obviously to keep the balance between what we do from a payer standpoint, but also what we do from a share standpoint. And that's why we're proud of the fact that we've been able to manage the payer dynamics and actually hold and even grow share in the last quarter.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer.\nHartaj Singh: Great. Thank you for the question. And I just want to also echo what Robyn said. I think people forget we donated almost one million vials of Remdesivir last year around this time which very few companies have done. Just a quick question on your partnership with Merck. What's the logic behind Gilead I guess leading the US development for the oral and then Merck on the injectable? What was the thinking that went into sort of the parameters of that and then also the cost-sharing and the revenue sharing assumptions? Any color on that would really help. Thank you for the question.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Hartaj and believe me it means a lot for you to comment on that for all the colleagues at Gilead who I think feel very strongly about the intrinsic work we do for patients and donations is just one piece of that it's part of our DNA. Andy, I think you're going to answer the question.\nAndrew Dickinson: Sure. Hartaj, thank you for the question. Look it was relatively simple. You have two outstanding organizations that are deeply experienced at formulation and drug development. Gilead obviously is one of the leading companies globally in terms of coformulating orals. For a single tablet regimen especially in the HIV arena and it made sense I think to both companies that have us take the lead there. And at the same time we recognize that to keep both programs moving forward quickly, it probably made the most sense to have Merck also lead a program and the injectable formulation program is one that was in their sweet spot. So this is a win-win. Both companies will be involved in both programs. And we think by doing that we're going to be able to advance these programs more quickly than we could individually. As far as the cost sharing, we took on more of the cost-sharing, because we have more of the upside, right? So it was a relatively simple. I think we are both bringing great molecules to the collaboration. We're both very excited about what we think these combinations can do in the treatment market both in oral and the subcu injectable formulations. And we recognize that when you looked at the patent life of the two products for instance was different, the franchise that we have in HIV, the impact of these on our existing franchise. When we put it all into the mix, I think there was a clear alignment between the two companies that it made sense at certain revenue levels for Gilead to share disproportionately and more of the revenue or the profits, I should say. But in exchange for that, fairly we had to agree to take a little bit more of the R&D expense, which we are happy to do. So that should -- I think Hartaj that should answer your question.\nDaniel O'Day: And Hartaj, I just want to end by thanking our colleagues at Merck. It's terrific. When you get two companies to come together to put patients first to accelerate treatment options for patients in need. And we have a lot of respect for our Merck colleagues. And happy to say that already the collaboration is getting off to a very strong and rapid start. So we look forward to moving fast to make a difference for patients with different treatment options.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Jacquie Ross for closing remarks.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you, Liz, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and look forward to updating you on our continued progress.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Merdad Parsey",
            "content": "Thank you, Johanna. As both Dan and Johanna mentioned, we are off to a solid start in a catalyst heavy 2021, and my comments today will focus on the nearer\u2010term events and changes to our pipeline. A comprehensive update on our broader pipeline is included in the appendix of the slide deck available on our IR website. I'll start with our virology pipeline. We remain as focused as ever on driving innovation in HIV therapies, and there are no changes to the expected timelines associated with our lenacapavir programs. In HIV prevention, we are activating sites for our first Phase III study for lenacapavir as monotherapy for the prevention of HIV and will begin screening patients later this quarter. This study will focus on preventing infection in cisgender men, transgender women and men, and gender non\u2010binary people who have sex with men. In the second half of 2021, we plan to initiate a study looking at lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV infections in adolescent girls and young women. In treatment, we presented additional data from Phase II/III CAPELLA trial for lenacapavir at CROI and we continue to expect our first lenacapavir filing for use with other anti-retrovirals and heavily treatment experienced individuals in the second half of this year. We anticipate data later this year from the Phase 2 CALIBRATE study in the treatment-naive population to support a virologically suppressed indication. And we plan to launch a Phase 2 trial for a long-acting oral treatment combination of Gilead's lenacapavir and Merck's islatravir in the second half of this year. Both medicines have shown long half-lives and high potency at low doses. As such, we believe that the lenacapavir plus islatravir combination is promising and we're excited by our new partnership and working with our colleagues at Merck to bring the maximum benefit possible to people living with HIV. Based on our commitment to HIV, we continue to work towards a potential cure. We have several early-stage programs evaluating combinations to understand the biology and identify path for this important mission. Leveraging our internal expertise as well as external partnerships, including Aelix and Gritstone. On Slide 16, moving on to the oncology pipeline, which has over 20 internal clinical stage programs, including many built around Trodelvy. We're excited to have received full FDA approval of Trodelvy in second-line plus metastatic triple-negative breast cancer based on the confirmatory Phase 3 ASCENT trial data. In the US alone this indication expands upon the accelerated approval for third line metastatic triple negative breast cancer to now include second-line patients, who've had at least one prior treatment for metastatic disease. Trodelvy has the potential to significantly improve overall survival and progression-free survival outcomes for patients. In the US, there's a population of 10,000 patients who may benefit from Trodelvy. We also received FDA accelerated approval for second-line metastatic urothelial carcinoma based on positive data from the Phase 2 TROPHY study. With almost one-third of patients responding to treatment and the 7.2-month median duration of response, Trodelvy offers a much-needed new treatment option for the many patients with metastatic urothelial cancer, whose disease continues to progress despite receiving available first and second-line treatment. In the US alone, we estimate there are roughly 8,000 addressable patients. 2021 will continue to be an exciting year for Trodelvy, and there have been no changes to the 2021 timelines we shared previously. We submitted the MAA to the EMA for Trodelvy in second-line plus metastatic TNBC in March, and it's now under accelerated review. We continue to target EU approval in the second half of this year. Later this year, we anticipate a Phase 3 TROPiCS\u201002 progression free survival readout for hormone receptor positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Pending data, we'll evaluate and determine the appropriate next steps from a regulatory standpoint. We estimate there are roughly 17,000 patients in the US who could benefit from Trodelvy in this setting. We're now actively recruiting additional patients for the Phase 2 TROPiCS-03 basket study in solid tumors to expand eligibility to patients regardless of TROPiCS-02 expression. We've already decided to initiate a Phase 3 trial in non-small cell lung cancer in the second half of this year, and we'll share updates on additional plan studies later this year. Moving on to cell therapy on Slide 17. With FDA's accelerated approval of the Yescarta for patients with third-line plus follicular lymphoma in March, we now have added a third indication for the Kite portfolio. ZUMA-5 study data showed the 91% of patients responded to a single infusion with an estimated 74% of patients in continued remission at 18 months. We're working towards making this option available to patients outside the US and continue to target an MAA filing in the next several months. There are no changes to the expected timelines for the ZUMA-7 study assessing Yescarta for the second-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or DLBCL patients. We expect to announce the top-line Phase 3 outcome later this quarter, followed by sBLA and MAA submissions in the second half of the year. Additionally, the FDA has approved the inclusion of the ZUMA-1 Cohort 4s updated safety data into Yescarta's label for third-line DLBCL. Cohort 4 demonstrated that early use of corticosteroids and/or tocilizumab led to reductions in cytokine release syndrome or neurological events. Moving on to Tecartus, we submitted our sBLA for relapsed or refractory adult B-cell precursor, acute lymphocytic leukemia or ALL just after the end of the first quarter. If approved, Tecartus would add a much-needed treatment option for patients 18 and older. We plan to share the ZUMA-3 data at ASCO this summer and we continue to enroll patients for ZUMA-4 to evaluate Tecartus for ALL in the pediatric population. Consistent with our ongoing diligence across both Gilead and Kite, we will continue to focus and streamline the Kite portfolio to align with our key strategic priorities and expertise in hematologic malignancies, specifically lymphoma and leukemia. Moving on to Slide 18. In addition to the previously mentioned milestones for virology Trodelvy and Kite, we have several other notable upcoming events. First, I want to take a moment to highlight magrolimab's progress and outlook in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. In MDS, we expect to see Phase 1b data in the second half of this year, pending results those data could lead to a BLA submission before the end of the year. If approved, magrolimab will be the first-in-class macrophage checkpoint inhibitor targeting CD47 and Gilead's first run frontline oncology indication. There's a significant unmet need for MDS with no new treatments approved in 14 years, despite 15,000 new patients diagnosed each year in the US alone. We're also exploring pivotal studies in frontline AML. Additionally, we continue to evaluate multiple solid tumor indications for magrolimab most recently initiating a Phase Ib/II second-line plus solid tumor basket study and a randomized Phase II study for head and neck cancer in combination with chemotherapy and Merck's KEYTRUDA. Second in Virology, we're thrilled to officially add Hepcludex into our portfolio and look forward to Phase III data readout later this quarter with the potential for a BLA filing in the second half of the year. As for potential opt-in programs Arcus' ARC-7 non-small cell lung cancer study is expected to evaluate an interim data in the second quarter. We and the Arcus team have indicated that the interim analysis is targeting an ORR of 50% or greater and a clear separation in ORR from the Zimberelimab monotherapy arm when compared to the Domvanalimab plus Zimberelimab combination arm. Last on Slide 19, you can see our robust and diversified pipeline across oncology virology and inflammation. In addition to the readouts on the previous slide we have multiple collaboration programs that we're monitoring closely including Arcus' eight -- ARC-8 study in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and ARC-6 study for castration-resistant prostate cancer expect -- both of which expect initial readouts later this year. And the Galapagos 623 Toledo proof-of-concept trials across psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and RA are expected to have readouts later this year. In closing, we're pleased to see how our portfolio has grown from about 30 clinical stage programs two years ago to 47 today, while maintaining our focus on disciplined management of R&D expenses. We've also gone from six molecules approved filed or in registrational studies to 15. Our teams have worked tirelessly to continuously evaluate and accelerate priority programs. We're thrilled to see how our portfolio is developing. And we look forward to accelerating innovation to help transform patient care. With that I'd like to hand the call over to Andy. Thanks, Phil. Great questions. In terms of magro, in terms of what we think we need to see. Look, I think, the challenge there is, obviously, that we're looking at external comparisons. So we believe that it's really around the strength of the data and its consistency with what we've seen already in that setting with magrolimab. I think, our assumption is, as long as we are consistent with the data that has emerged that will give us really good grounds to go and approach regulators to discuss a potential filing. So we're, I would say, reasonably confident there and our expectation is, as long as things continue to go the way they have been, we'll be fine. In terms of the breast cancer data for Trodelvy. Yes, I think, in terms of our confidence, I think, we remain confident that we're really well powered in that study to show benefit, in particular, in PFS, as well as OS in that trial. So I don't think we've seen anything emerge that shakes our confidence around that. Yes, sure. It's a great question. And I think you -- Matthew you mentioned, I think look where we are now with the Toledo programs is looking for evidence of tolerability and proof-of-concept, proof of principle for that pathway in multiple indications. And I would describe these early small studies as a place to demonstrate that and look to see where the biggest impact could be. I think it's an early part of the longer journey ranging from -- is there a particular indication that we want to pursue further to confirm and expand on the signal to -- do we have the right molecule for that. So I think we view these together with Galapagos, I believe, we view these as sort of, very early in the story of the Toledo program. So we'll be looking to see what those data look like in the near-term. Dan, do you want add."

            "name": "Daniel O'Day",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Before I hand over to the team to go into the details of our commercial, pipeline and financial results, I wanted to share our overall assessment of Gilead's first quarter. 2021 is a pivotal year for Gilead, and as you can see on Slide 4, we are off to a solid start. Our first quarter total product sales were in\u2010line with our internal expectations. While our core business was more impacted by COVID\u201019 than we anticipated, this was offset by higher Veklury sales. In the United States, one in two hospitalized patients are receiving Veklury, and worldwide Veklury continues to play a key role as a standard of care treatment for patients who are hospitalized with COVID\u201019. Given the desperate situation in India, Gilead has been working with the Indian government, health authorities and our voluntary licensees to increase supply of remdesivir and provide donated medicine. As the trajectory of the pandemic evolves globally, we will continue to invest in multiple clinical studies of Veklury, including alternative formulations. Earlier this month, we received two FDA approvals for Trodelvy. The full approval for metastatic triple negative breast cancer extended the label to second\u2010line plus patients. This means, Trodelvy could help many more patients, as there are more than double the number of patients in this category as there are in the third line setting. We also received accelerated approval in second\u2010line plus metastatic urothelial cancer. In March, we announced a new partnership to combine investigational lenacapavir with Merck's investigational islatravir for long\u2010acting HIV treatment, accelerating the path to the next wave of therapies. While many people living with HIV may prefer a daily regimen like Biktarvy, we believe that broadening their options to include weekly oral therapies and infrequent injections every three months or longer addresses a significant patient need, and sets up strong, sustainable HIV leadership into the late 2030s. Long\u2010acting formulations, such as lenacapavir as monotherapy, are also likely to unlock further PrEP usage and reach many more people at risk of HIV. We are also pleased with our progress in advancing lenacapavir in both treatment and prevention settings as part of our internal clinical development. This past quarter, we reported compelling long-acting efficacy data for lenacapavir in heavily treatment\u2010experienced people with multi\u2010drug resistant HIV. We are fully confident that lenacapavir will be the foundation for our long-acting HIV treatment and prevention portfolio. And while we advance lenacapavir, Biktarvy usage continues to grow, with one in two people living with HIV starting their treatment on Biktarvy in the U.S. In addition, Biktarvy is capturing one in two switches, and approximately, half of those are switching from a regimen that includes a non\u2010Gilead agent. In addition to securing regulatory approvals in oncology, we have already achieved several other pipeline milestones, including EMA validation of the Trodelvy MAA for metastatic triple\u2010negative breast cancer and submission of the supplemental biologics license application to FDA for Tecartus in relapse or refractory ALL. Building on the work we did last year, we continue with the disciplined prioritization of our pipeline across Gilead. To share one example, Kite completed an optimization exercise this past quarter, to ensure that resources are focused on the most promising opportunities to make a difference for patients. Finally, we're looking forward to a full-year of clinical news flow for Gilead. Our pipeline list for 2021 includes over 20 milestones across therapeutic areas. While they are all important steps in Gilead's journey to serve more patients and diversify our business, Slide 5 lists the most significant items, so you can track our progress more clearly. These include the Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 PFS readout for Trodelvy in hormone receptor positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer; Yescarta's Phase 3 ZUMA-7 readout for second-line DLBCL, which could result in an sBLA submission later this year; the Phase 3 readout for Hepcludex that could lead to BLA filing; ARC-2 Domvanalimab Phase 2 or seven interim readout in non-small cell lung cancer, which could inform an opt-in decision; Magrolimab's Phase 1b data readout in MDS, which could lead to a submission for accelerated approval later this year; and potential Phase 2 initiation of lenacapavir and islatravir as a long-acting oral HIV treatment in the second-half of 2021. Our aspirations for patients are bold and our pipeline offers diversity across indications and risk profiles. While execution will continue to be a focus, these milestones give us a great deal of optimism about the future and our ability to deliver therapies that make a meaningful difference for patients. Before I hand off, I want to take a moment to thank Dr. Bill Lee, who is retiring from his role as Executive Vice President of Research after 30 years at Gilead. On behalf of all of us, I want to offer my sincere gratitude to Bill for his outstanding contributions that have helped to benefit millions of patients around the world. I would also like to welcome Dr. Flavius Martin, who joined Gilead as the new EVP of Research on April 12. Flavius has an impressive track record in overseeing industry-leading research and advancing new therapeutic candidates. With that, I'll invite Johanna to update you on our commercial operations in the first quarter. Thanks Andy. And before we open-up for questions, I'd like to thank the broadly Gilead team, who accomplished a great deal in the first quarter, setting the stage I think for quite an exciting year reaching catalysts across our clinical portfolio. Of course, Gilead would not be the company it is today without the vision of John Martin, Gilead's Chief Executive Officer for 20 years, who passed away in March. Under his leadership, Gilead transformed the treatment of HIV and viral hepatitis and became a global organization, firmly rooted in its commitment to science and to patients. That commitment will be a constant, as we work to take John's legacy forward in Gilead's next chapter. With that, I'll invite the operator to begin the Q&A. Thanks, Brian. Johanna, please. Thanks, Louise. Over to you, Christi. Thanks, Christi Thanks, Geoff. Over to you, Johanna, please. Thanks, Michael. I'll take that. So two -- yes great questions. In terms of assumptions, I think, what's safe to say is we've been fairly conservative on our inputs to the assumptions in terms of looking at what the standard of care PFS looks like and using sort of that as our approach. And I'd say actually that's fairly our general approach. I think we try to take a fairly conservative approach in terms of designing our trials and balance what I would sort of a statistically significant benefit with a clinically meaningful benefit. And I think that that's -- we keep both of those in mind when we're powering our studies to make sure that we are -- we're hitting not only statistical significance, but looking for clinical significance. In terms of prior CDK4/6, I mean it's obviously something that's come up a fair bit appropriately. I think, people are looking at some data -- there are a number of hypotheses that are going around what it could be there. We're trying to take a very data-driven approach on this. And I guess, I would say a couple of things. One is that, in our hands and what we've seen so far from the prior studies, where we looked at those people who had gotten prior to CDK4/6 compared with standard of care, Trodelvy continues to bring benefit to those patients. And as a big caveat that's a fairly small number of people in that from us when we look at it, but I think we're comfortable that that continues to be the case. And secondly, we are going to look at the data from the upcoming trial and we will look at that that group of patients as a subgroup analysis to see if there is a difference in terms of how they respond compared to the overall population of patients that are going to be enrolled in that. So, we'll make sure that we segregate those patients out to make sure we learn from that. Okay. Thanks. And so, Andy, why don't you start? And Johanna might want to add to the PrEP. And on the PrEP market -- yes Johanna. We love it. I appreciate your kids loving us. That's terrific. And thank you for acknowledging the efforts of the company for so many countries out there that are streaking with this. Can I ask Johanna to cover the Veklury question and then Christi to cover the cell therapy? Great. You want to start Merdad and then I'll follow. Sure. So maybe just to you Matthew to just give a little bit of context of people that may not be completely familiar with our relationship with Galapagos. So, of course, there was the filgotinib relationship, but then there was a separate relationship that we went into. As you know, a couple of years ago now. And that was really based on the research platform. And I would say that nothing has really changed in relation to that. I mean one of the reasons to do that was to diversify our approaches from a discovery research perspective across if you like the Gilead Group. I listened hard to the scientists at that time. I continue to listen hard to the scientists today. They think they have a very discriminated platform for screening compounds for first-in-class. And I'll remind you that's really the approach first-in-class which of course comes with some risks some of which we've seen in the later-stage programs. And, of course, Toledo is the most advanced now of those programs. But having said that there are many others within their discovery platform that we continue to be intrigued about. I think it's an important part of our overall inflammation strategy, albeit, at an earlier stage for Gilead. But when we think about our strategic approach that really focuses on immunology and virology as our core scientific skills, we have now obviously leaders in virology built up a really significant presence in oncology with inflammatory disorders really, kind of, the next step and the next stage of our platform where Galapagos presents, I think, one aspect of that but a very important aspect in terms of first-in-class approach. So we continue to be working very closely with our partners at Galapagos to determine what the next screens are and what the next targets are in the concept of our -- the entirety of our inflammation strategy. So thanks, Matt. Ronny, just at the very end what did you say? Got you. Okay. Joanna, you got it. Thanks, Hartaj and believe me it means a lot for you to comment on that for all the colleagues at Gilead who I think feel very strongly about the intrinsic work we do for patients and donations is just one piece of that it's part of our DNA. Andy, I think you're going to answer the question. And Hartaj, I just want to end by thanking our colleagues at Merck. It's terrific. When you get two companies to come together to put patients first to accelerate treatment options for patients in need. And we have a lot of respect for our Merck colleagues. And happy to say that already the collaboration is getting off to a very strong and rapid start. So we look forward to moving fast to make a difference for patients with different treatment options."

            "name": "Andrew Dickinson",
            "content": "Thank you Merdad and good afternoon everyone. As you can see we are building momentum in our clinical pipeline and we expect to have plenty of data to share as we move through the rest of 2021. Moving to Slide 21. The first quarter was a good start to the year with total product sales in line with our internal expectations overall as modestly higher Veklury sales offset a slower pandemic-related recovery than we had anticipated. In addition to pandemic impacts, our HIV business reflected the inventory seasonality we typically see in the first quarter. Total product sales were $6.3 billion up 16% year-over-year driven primarily by Veklury. The first quarter reflects continued growth from Biktarvy, our first full quarter of Trodelvy sales and strong growth in HBV as well as cell therapy. This growth was offset by ongoing COVID-related softness across our business in addition to the Truvada and Atripla LOEs. As also indicated by Johanna, there is the difficult comparison to the first quarter of 2020 given the pandemic-related HIV stocking observed last year. As a result total product sales excluding Veklury were $4.9 billion down 11% year-over-year. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 86.5%, 60 basis points lower year-over-year primarily associated with product mix and a small inventory charge partially offset by favorable royalty adjustments. Non-GAAP R&D was $1 billion, up 4% year-over-year primarily driven by investment in new pipeline products including Trodelvy and magrolimab offset by timing of certain clinical studies and lower Veklury-related expenses. Non-GAAP SG&A was also $1 billion, down 4% from Q1 2020 due to timing of grants and sales and marketing activities. This was partially offset by higher commercialization investments associated with Veklury, Trodelvy cell therapy and HBV and HIV in China. Moving to tax. We realized a lower rate of 18% for the quarter due to recognition of favorable settlements with tax authorities. Overall our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.08 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $1.68 for the same period last year. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to Veklury revenues, flat operating expenses and a lower tax rate offset in part by lower interest income. You can see on Slide 22 that there is no change to our full year non-GAAP guidance. While the pandemic remains unpredictable and as we realized a more substantial impact to our core business in the first quarter than we had anticipated, we are nonetheless encouraged by the lower hospitalization rates and increased vaccinations. We have modified our assumptions on the timing of pandemic recovery to allow a more gradual improvement starting in the second quarter. We continue to expect total product sales excluding Veklury of $21.7 billion to $22.1 billion. We continue to expect full year non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses each to be flat to down low single-digit percentages year-over-year. Given our first quarter results, you can see our R&D expenses are somewhat back-end loaded in 2021 based on the timing of clinical activities which include the anticipated initiation of the solid tumor study with magrolimab advancing internal long-acting combinations with lenacapavir for the treatment of HIV and other pipeline activities. Our work with Merck on a long-acting treatment regimen for people living with HIV is also underway and will ramp-up during 2021, although, we are able to absorb this program into our current R&D expense guidance. In SG&A, we are ramping up sales and marketing to support efforts such as the ongoing and expected launches of Trodelvy in the U.S. for bladder cancer and in Europe for triple-negative breast cancer. Additionally, we expect to start seeing higher travel and other costs scale-up in the second half of the year, as social distancing restrictions lighten-up in some geographies. Despite the lighter expenses in the first quarter, we're leaving our operating expense guidance unchanged, as we expect to catch up on this to some extent later in the year. And for now, retain the flexibility to manage the timing of clinical and commercial investments. We continue to expect our non-GAAP tax-rate to be 21% for the year. While we are carefully monitoring the discussions on a higher corporate tax-rate here in the United States, we believe any impact is more likely in 2022 and beyond, although, of course, a more immediate change could alter our current-tax guidance. Finally, with no changes to our revenue or operating expense guidance we continue to expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of $6.75 to $7.45 for the year. We have updated our GAAP diluted EPS guidance and now expect to be in the range of $4.75 to $5.45, down from $5.25 to $5.95, reflecting fair value losses for our equity holdings in the first quarter, donation expenses and other pre-tax charges including upfront payments related to collaboration. On Slide 23, you can see that we remain diligent in our capital allocation priorities. Already this year, we have repaid $1.25 billion in debt. And we're on track to pay down at least $4 billion in total by the end of the year. We have also returned $1.2 billion to shareholders, through dividends and repurchase of shares. To close, we remain committed to delivering for patients and for shareholders, as we look to invest in our business and R&D pipeline, while paying close attention to our expenses. With that, I'll hand the call back to Dan for a few closing comments. Dan? Yes. Hi Terence. Thanks for the question. You're right. At the beginning of the year, we recognize that 2021 was likely to be more dynamic than prior years. And when we put together our guidance for the year, we looked at a range of scenarios. We're well within the range of scenarios in the first quarter. We're off to a good start. The mix was a little bit different than we expected with the additional pandemic-related headwinds that you heard about. But to be clear, when we think both about our total product revenues including Veklury, but also our base case revenues -- our base product revenues excluding Veklury, we're very comfortable with where we are and we're on target for the year. We'll provide another update of course in the middle of the year, but that's how you should think about it at a high level Terence. Sure. Hartaj, thank you for the question. Look it was relatively simple. You have two outstanding organizations that are deeply experienced at formulation and drug development. Gilead obviously is one of the leading companies globally in terms of coformulating orals. For a single tablet regimen especially in the HIV arena and it made sense I think to both companies that have us take the lead there. And at the same time we recognize that to keep both programs moving forward quickly, it probably made the most sense to have Merck also lead a program and the injectable formulation program is one that was in their sweet spot. So this is a win-win. Both companies will be involved in both programs. And we think by doing that we're going to be able to advance these programs more quickly than we could individually. As far as the cost sharing, we took on more of the cost-sharing, because we have more of the upside, right? So it was a relatively simple. I think we are both bringing great molecules to the collaboration. We're both very excited about what we think these combinations can do in the treatment market both in oral and the subcu injectable formulations. And we recognize that when you looked at the patent life of the two products for instance was different, the franchise that we have in HIV, the impact of these on our existing franchise. When we put it all into the mix, I think there was a clear alignment between the two companies that it made sense at certain revenue levels for Gilead to share disproportionately and more of the revenue or the profits, I should say. But in exchange for that, fairly we had to agree to take a little bit more of the R&D expense, which we are happy to do. So that should -- I think Hartaj that should answer your question."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Johanna Mercier",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on Slide 7, it was a solid quarter of execution for the commercial team with total product revenue of $6.3 billion, up 16% from the first quarter of last year. This was in line with our internal expectations as Veklury sales offset a more substantial pandemic-related impact on our core business than we had anticipated. Excluding Veklury, total product revenue was $4.9 billion, reflecting inventory and pricing seasonality the anticipated HIV loss of exclusivity in the U.S., and ongoing pandemic-related dynamics in HIV and HCV. Moving to HIV on Slide 8. Revenue was down sequentially as expected, primarily due to seasonal trends. As a reminder, two things happen every year to our HIV business that contribute to a sequential decline from Q4 to Q1. First, the channel builds inventory in the fourth quarter then draws it down in Q1. In the first quarter of 2021, this inventory impact contributed an estimated $410 million to the sequential decline. Second, we've realized lower net HIV prices in the first quarter, due to items such as increased co-pay support and Part D discounts, which tend to normalize throughout the rest of the year. This quarter, we had two additional impacts.  A year-over-year decline of $335 million in Truvada NHFR revenue associated with LOEs in the US. And a difficult comparison in the first quarter of 2020 given the pandemic-related HIV stocking we saw in March of 2020, as well as the impact of the pandemic on HIV market demand. Our focus is on share-driven by demand. Overall, three and four people living with HIV initiate or switch to Gilead products, highlighting the strength in demand for our life-changing medicines. While the pandemic dampened market size and switched volumes, we maintain share in line with prior quarters across our total HIV portfolio despite generic erosion. In terms of product lines, Biktarvy was up 8% year-over-year, but down sequentially as expected driven by seasonal inventory and pricing dynamics. Despite the pandemic impact on the new starts and switch volume in HIV, demand fundamental for Biktarvy remains strong, with five share point growth compared to the same time last year and two share point growth just in the last quarter in the United States. As Dan mentioned earlier, one out of two people living with HIV initiating or switching therapy is prescribed Biktarvy. Further, nearly half of Biktarvy switches come from incremental sources. Descovy revenue was down sequentially and year-over-year largely driven by seasonal inventory and pricing dynamics. Although, PrEP volume continues to be impacted by the pandemic, Descovy share remains stable around 45% and positions us well as the PrEP market recovers post\u2010pandemic. Moving to Slide 9, HCV first quarter revenue was $510 million. We continue to maintain a leading share of about 60% in the US and 50% in Europe. Despite COVID continuing to impact patient starts, we did see a very modest sequential improvement overall in patient volume, although it remains depressed versus pre\u2010COVID levels. HCV also benefited from a pricing adjustment in France. As shown on Slide 10, in Q1, HBV and HDV sales totaled $220 million with HBV sales of $214 million, growing 15% year\u2010over\u2010year, driven by strong Vemlidy demand, most notably in China and in the US. We continue to expect the HBV franchise sales to reach $1 billion by full year 2022. With the completion of the MYR acquisition during the first quarter, our portfolio now includes Hepcludex. There are currently no available treatments for HDV, making Hepcludex, which has received conditional approval by the EMA, a first\u2010in\u2010class treatment. This innovative drug blocks viral entry into liver cells. We are targeting a BLA submission later this year, and are excited by the opportunity to make Hepcludex more broadly available and address the unmet need for people who are infected with HDV. Moving to Slide 11, Trodelvy delivered $72 million in its first full quarter as part of the Gilead portfolio. In a span of just three weeks this month, Trodelvy received FDA full approval for second\u2010line plus metastatic triple negative breast cancer, received accelerated approval in second\u2010line plus metastatic urothelial cancer, and had its ASCENT Phase III data published in The New England Journal of Medicine just a week ago. We can now leverage treatment efficacy data from the full trial population in our discussions with physicians, and build even greater confidence to consider this potentially transformative therapy. This more than doubles the patient population, extending our reach to 6,000 second line metastatic TNBC patients in the US, in addition to over 4,000 patients in the third\u2010line plus population. Given the poor prognosis and difficulty in treating both second and third line metastatic TNBC patients, Trodelvy could extend median overall survival by almost a year while also nearly tripling the median progression free survival compared to chemotherapy. Outside the US, we submitted the TNBC Marketing Authorization Application based on the ASCENT Phase III clinical study for an accelerated review process. We look forward to continuing discussions with the European Medicines Agency and anticipate approval as early as December of this year. Additionally, Trodelvy is under review for TNBC in the UK, Canada, Switzerland, and Australia as part of Project Orbis. On Slide 12, Christi is on the call to answer your questions shortly, but you can see that our Cell Therapy business had a strong quarter, with revenue of $191 million, up 36% from the same quarter last year, driven by growing adoption of Yescarta in Europe, with our industry\u2010leading four\u2010year 44% overall survival. The recent approval for Yescarta in follicular lymphoma will broaden our addressable patient population and support our ongoing growth. Tecartus continues to see strong launch demand as physicians and patients adopt the first and only cell therapy approved for relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Moving to Veklury on Slide 13, first quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, with demand tracking hospitalization rates. Although we saw lower hospitalization rates and increasing vaccination rates in certain parts of the world, overall progress was more gradual than expected over the first quarter and as such, we are now assuming a slower pandemic\u2010recovery for the second quarter. As the pace of recovery builds momentum in the second half of the year, this should contribute to a modest recovery in patient starts for our HCV and HIV franchises. We will continue to play our part to support broader access for eligible patients in need of remdesivir. We are working with our voluntary licensees to accelerate production capacity for India, while also donating 450,000 vials of Veklury to help patients as the supply of licensed generics increases. Our thoughts are with those who continue to tackle the worst of this pandemic. With that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad. Sure. Thanks, Brian, for the question. And we're really excited with the recent news that we got with Trodelvy. It's really going to help us gain momentum, exactly what you said. We have strong awareness in academic centers above 80%. We haven't been able to break through. We're only at about 50% or so in the community. And as you well know, if three quarters of the patients sit in the community, that's an incredible opportunity for us to make sure that we make sure the messages come across. We haven't been in a position in the past to promote overall survival, in light of the fact that we just had that conditional approval. And so now, with the full approval not only do we get to double the patient population that Trodelvy can actually help, but actually we also get to promote the overall survival, which is the only agent with overall survival in this setting. So I think it's really going to help us ramp-up. And the focus is still going to be despite the urothelial bladder indication. We -- the focus is really going to be more like a 90-10, 90% on second-line plus, triple-negative breast cancer and then 10% from a promotional standpoint on urothelial cancer. We believe that that's going to work well, because there's a high overlap. There's about 70% of physicians that overlap from bladder cancer and also treat TNBC. So we're going to be in good shape to ramp this up. This is really the opportunity for Trodelvy right now for this year. Yes. Thanks, Geoff, for the question. Yes, we're really quite pleased with Biktarvy's performance. It just continues. And obviously, there's been some ins and out because of dynamics around us from a market standpoint, because of COVID and inventory, but the share growth 8% year-over-year, as well as the fact that we continue to grow share and even 2 points in the last quarter. We also grew 2 points not only in the U.S., but we also grew just under 2 points in Europe and about 5 points year-over-year as well. So we are seeing solid growth in Europe and we are seeing, in other markets as well, like, Japan and Canada, we're number one with Biktarvy. So I think that, as the data continues to show the benefits of the profile that Biktarvy offers for patients. I think there's no stopping us, Geoff. I think we need to continue to grow this business and we are well poised to get out of this COVID-19 pandemic and hopefully the markets reset. The market already has reset in the naive patient population. We're almost back to pre-COVID levels, which is great, and that's where Biktarvy truly differentiates itself. And in the switch business, we're not there yet. We're about 30% under pre-COVID levels. But again, with a share of close to 50%, also well poised for that to come back on track. So, I think, we continue to expand and continue to gain share over older agents, because of the benefits that Biktarvy offers, not just in the U.S., but really around the world. Yes. Thanks, Dan. So, on the PrEP market, as I mentioned Descovy share is holding at about 45%, 46% in the first quarter. So we're quite pleased with that. We've obviously been working closely with payers to make sure that patients and providers had choice in their prevention approach. The market is still dampened because of this pandemic as you can appreciate with the social dynamics that we are all living with. Although, we have seen some uptake in the last month or so, we'll see how that plays out. But again I think it's going to be in line with what Andy said which is going to be a bit of a gradual recovery for the PrEP market. But I think, we're very well poised to make sure that once that market gets back to pre-COVID levels, I think we'll be in very good shape in light of our -- holding our share at this level. Absolutely. Thanks, Robyn for your question and comment. I think what we've seen with Veklury is a really directly proportional effect with hospitalization rates. And it's kind of what we've been saying for the last couple of quarters and we're seeing it. Yes. I mean you could literally draw the line with the hospitalizations both in the US as well as outside of the US. Where we've seen sales as in the first quarter and I think that's going to continue although to a lesser degree we've seen hospitalizations really come down in the month of March and kind of hold steady unfortunately. And hopefully, they'll keep coming down as months go by and vaccination rates increase. But what we have seen is sales are really coming out in the US, of course, also within our European region as well as Asia. There's a lot of markets in Asia that are also taking full advantage of the benefits of Veklury for their patients their appropriate patients. And so we believe, we've always said that, we think the tail is longer. I know nobody wants to hear that but I think we think the tail is longer than anybody thought originally. And I think that's what we're seeing as we go into Q2 and it will be a gradual recovery. So we do believe that Veklury still will have an important role to play within the next couple of quarters and potentially beyond into 2022. As for some of these -- for example India or other countries that are served by our voluntary licenses. Obviously, those are royalty-free during the pandemic and that is something at a much lower price level. So our price for Veklury hasn't moved. It's well below the value of Veklury for the developed countries. For the developing rolled up it's obviously quite different. With that Christi? Yes, please. Yes. Thank you. So thanks for that. I didn't hear the last part of that question originally. Yes. So for Descovy the year-over-year, obviously, it does have to do with higher payer discounts. And that was to ensure that patients and providers had choice. And make sure that we didn't have any step at it. And now we do have some step at it for some plan. But for most plans access is very open to make sure that our patients and providers choose which therapeutics is best for them for prevention. And so I think that we will continue to be smart and we will continue to be disciplined in the way that we look at those discussions with our payers, but we're also looking at data that's been pretty clear that shows that if you basically put a step at it you don't actually get the patient on a Truvada generic you actually just lose your patient. And I think as we think about ending the epidemic prevention is a big piece of that. And so that's why choice is so important and that we keep people at risk of HIV making sure that we keep those folks on the medicines that they're on without creating any access restrictions. And so if that's what we need to do moving forward to ensure that that might impact the price as we go. Our intent is obviously to keep the balance between what we do from a payer standpoint, but also what we do from a share standpoint. And that's why we're proud of the fact that we've been able to manage the payer dynamics and actually hold and even grow share in the last quarter."

            "name": "Christi Shaw",
            "content": "Thank you. So I'll take the last one first maybe, which is the COVID impact. We did see COVID impact and slowing of our ramp-up that we started doing well Q1 of last year and there was a slowdown in Q3, Q4. We've seen that rebound in Q1. We do believe that that has to do with less COVID impact, especially in the U.S., Europe, in spite of the COVID impact, continued to grow over those quarters. Germany and Italy, being the exceptions, where the COVID impact has been greater on our business there. Overall, though, we're very pleased with what we're seeing from quarter four to quarter one of this year, significant growth and coming off a couple of down quarters for Yescarta, both the U.S. and the \u2013 and Europe up quarter-over-quarter now with Yescarta. And on the second-line DLBCL question. So the good news is, the APCs are already set up, just like with Yescarta's we're able to launch quickly. So moving up to the second-line doubles the market opportunity, doubles the number of patients that we can serve. We also have community reps in the field already, both in Europe and in the U.S. So this referral pattern will continue to be something that we work on. But the belief, or my belief is, that as we look at patients in the third-line plus, those are typically patients that are going for palliative care and quality of life and short-term quantity of life is being managed whereas with ZUMA-7 in the second-line versus stem cell transplant, physicians and patients are still looking for a cure. So if the study is positive, we're looking at replacing stem cell transplant as a standard of care in second-line for curative potential. Remember, stem cell only cures 20% of the patients that are sent there. Yes. Thanks, Robyn. Thanks for the question. So you heard a little bit in the beginning from both Merdad and Johanna and maybe Dan that we recently took a really hard look at our portfolio review. A few things are evolving or transforming if you will. Kite had such a success story in bringing the first potential cure for lymphoma. We've transformed now to a company that has multiple brands, franchise basically three indications now and with a couple more to come in the next year. As we look at that, we know a lot more now about how to affect leukemia and lymphoma in this area. So really taking a focus on making sure that we double down on our life cycle management improving the risk-benefit profile of what we have, trying to get patients with combination therapies for et cetera, to ensure we increase the efficacy. That's really our main focus on our core. We are also looking at disrupting what we have today whether it's iPSC, Allo. We do believe eventually the market will be and we'll be trying to drive that way too towards a lower cost off-the-shelf more convenient for patients' treatments. But today unfortunately from what we've seen at the recent congresses and publications and study results, it's a bit further out than we had anticipated just 12 to 18 months ago. So we really need to focus on improving autologous where we have it today, disrupting ourselves in the future. And lastly to your question beyond iPSC -- your question was iPSC, but even beyond that as we look at solid tumor, we really are the partner of choice with our successful manufacturing process, our ability to deliver reliably in a short period of time. We are looking at transformations, really good transformations where we have proof-of-concept in solid tumors where the market will be the largest in the long-term."

My name is Henna, and I will be your moderator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Jacquie Ross. Please go ahead.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. The press release slides and supplementary data are available on the investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today\u2019s call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day, our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier, our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey, and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we\u2019ll open up the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Christi Shaw, the Chief Executive Officer of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward\u2010looking statements, including those related to Gilead\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations; plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections and the use of capital; and 2023 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward\u2010looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward\u2010looking statements. Non\u2010GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the Company\u2019s underlying business performance. The GAAP to non\u2010GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet, as well as on the Gilead website. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dan.\nDaniel O'Day: Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. We had the opportunity to connect with many of you a few weeks ago in San Francisco. And I\u2019m excited to be able to reconnect now to share our strong fourth quarter and full year results for 2022 in addition to our guidance for 2023. These show the tangible impact of our business transformation, notably the growth trajectory for HIV portfolio and our fast-growing oncology business. The team will take you through our quarterly results in detail, but I am very pleased to highlight on Slide 4 the strongest full year growth in our base business since 2015 when growth was driven by the peak of HCV sales. Full year 2022 sales of Biktarvy grew 20% year-over-year to $10.4 billion, exceeding $10 billion for the first time. Excluding Biktarvy, our base business in 2022 grew 8% year-over-year and I\u2019m pleased to share that our initial 2023 guidance points the base business growth between 4% and 6%. Andy will share our revenue guidance in detail, but I do want to take this opportunity to recognize the Gilead team for the progress we made in returning to growth. Thanks to their commitment to improving the health of people and communities around the world, Gilead is now poised to extend its reach to more patients and more challenging disesases and conditions than ever before. Beyond our financial results, our clinical progress in 2022 reinforces how far we\u2019ve come. At the end of the year, Sunlenca received its first approval in the U.S. for heavily treatment-experienced adults with multi drug-resistant HIV infection. This follows a European approval in the third quarter. Sunlenca is the first six monthly subcutaneous medicines to be approved and we believe it represents the most exciting innovation in HIV therapeutics in recent years, with significant potential across prevention and treatment. We look forward to partnering with the HIV community to increase awareness of Sunlenca and to advancing our portfolio of long acting options. We are anticipating an another potential approval any day now with the upcoming PDUFA date for Trodelvy in pre-treated HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. We also expect to hear from European regulators later this year. In the meantime, Trodelvy\u2019s commercial momentum is building, with full year 2022 sales growth of 79%. In cell therapy, we continue to reinforce our leadership and to execute on plans to broaden availability, with Yescarta most recently approved in Japan for a second-line relapsed refractory large B cell lymphoma. Merdad will take you through our pipeline updates and key milestones in a few moments. For now, I'll simply note the significant expansion in our clinical programs, which are more than doubled in the last four years. We continue to add further programs, including our new preclinical candidates to partner with lenacapavir for a long-acting HIV treatment programs, the new Phase III OAK CRE study for a Novel Oral COVID-19 nucleoside, and the five Phase III trials that we expect to initiate this year. Before I hand over to Johanna, I want to briefly review the clinical goals we shared with you a year ago. The Gilead and Kite teams have done a terrific job in both delivering as plan and acting with agility in response to changing circumstances. We had an impressive year of discipline and determine execution in 2022 and fully expect to further strengthen our track record of execution in 2023 and beyond. With that, I'll hand over to Johanna for a review of our fourth quarter and full year commercial performance. Johanna?\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Before discussing our commercial results, I want to acknowledge our Gilead team for delivering another outstanding quarter and closing out a very successful year. 2022 was an exceptional year for Gilead with our virology franchise well positioned to continue its leadership for years to come. And significant progress in executing our oncology strategy and bringing new medicines to improve the lives of more patients all around the world. Starting on Slide 7, we had a very strong quarter, delivering a total product sales excluding Veklury at $6.3 billion, up 9% year-over-year, or 12%, excluding the impact of FX and the loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla. With solid growth in each of our core franchises and growth across all geographies, once again, led by HIV and oncology. Quarter-over-quarter sales grew 5%, driven by HIV, Trodelvy and cell therapy, partially offset by HCV. For the full year, total product sales, excluding Veklury, were $23.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year, or 11%, excluding the impact of FX and the Truvada Atripla LOE, driven by HIV and oncology. As expected, full year Veklury sales were down meaningfully in 2022 compared to 2021. That said, Veklury\u2019s performance has been more sustainable than we previously expected. And it's clear that it continues to play an essential role for hospitalized patients treated for COVID-19. In 2022, Veklury delivered $3.9 billion, including $1 billion in the fourth quarter. Overall, full year total product sales of $27 billion was flat compared to 2021, as growth in our base business was offset by the decline in Veklury sales. On Slide 8, HIV sales for the fourth quarter were $4.8 billion, a 5% year-over-year, driven by higher demand as well as favorable pricing dynamics. This was offset in part by a smaller than usual inventory build in the fourth quarter, reflecting our early efforts on seasonal inventory management. Sequentially, HIV sales in the fourth quarter were up 6%, primarily driven by favorable pricing and inventory dynamics as well as higher demand. For the full year, HIV sales of $17.2 billion were up 5% year-over-year due to higher demand primarily related to the continued strength of Biktarvy, in addition to channel mix, leading to higher average realized price. This was partially offset by inventory dynamics and FX. Overall, the HIV treatment market in the fourth quarter grew 1.5% year-over-year in the U.S. and over 2% in Europe. On an annual basis, the market has grown in line with our expectations of 2% to 3%. Moving to Prevention, the U.S. PrEP market grew 18% year-over-year and 3% sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting growing awareness. Descovy sales for the fourth quarter were $537 million, up 13% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Notably, despite generics and other entrants, demand for Descovy for PrEP continues to increase up more than 20% for the full year, in addition to maintaining a stable market share of over 40%. With these trends and the TAF IP settlement last year, Descovy\u2019s position in the growing PrEP market has only strengthened. Overall, this provides a strong foundation as we look to the potential launch of lenacapavir for PrEP as a true long acting every six months regimen in the middle part of the decade. Moving to Biktarvy on Slide 9, sales for the quarter were $2.9 billion, up 15% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher demand, as well as favorable pricing dynamics, offset in part by lower channel inventory. Quarter-over-quarter, sales were up 6%, similarly driven by higher demand, as well as favorable pricing and inventory dynamics. In every quarter since our launch, we've seen Biktarvy continue to gain market share, and the fourth quarter was no exception, getting more than 3 percentage points in share year-over-year. This continued momentum is a testament to Biktarvy\u2019s differentiated clinical profile, reinforced by the long-term five-year data we presented last year. Notably in U.S., Europe and other major markets, Biktarvy remains the number one regimen for new starts in addition to its number one position in treatments, which is across most of the major markets, including the U.S. At the end of 2022, there were almost 1 million people managing their HIV with Biktarvy worldwide. Taken all together, this has led Biktarvy for the first time to achieve full year sales of over $10 billion in 2022. Looking ahead, we're confident Biktarvy will remain the leading medicine for the treatment of HIV in U.S., Europe and other major markets for years to come. Now looking ahead for the first quarter of 2023 for HIV, a few points I just wanted to call out. First, with respect to pricing dynamics as we enter the New Year, we expect a typical first quarter reset in patient co-pay and deductibles. As always, these will have an unfavorable impact on average realized price in the first quarter. Second, a reminder that we've historically seen inventory build-up in Q4 that has led to notable drawdowns by wholesalers in Q1. While we've implemented new processes to better manage inventory dynamics from the fourth quarter into the first quarter, we continue to expect an inventory drawdown to occur in Q1, albeit at more modest levels compared to prior year. So with this in mind, we expect HIV sales for the first quarter to decline by low teens sequentially from the fourth quarter. This compares to the 18% sequential decline we reported in the first quarter of 2022. For the full year 2023, I'd like to remind you that some of our HIV performance in 2022 was driven by shifts in channel mix that had a favorable impact on average realized price, contributing in part to the 5% year-over-year revenue growth we reported in 2022. We expect channel mix in 2023 to be relatively similar to last year, and therefore do not expect HIV growth to benefit from changes in average realized price like we saw in 2022. As a result, we continue to expect HIV to grow in 2023, albeit at a modestly lower growth rate than 2022. As we think about the future of the HIV market, Gilead is well positioned to provide many people living with HIV and those at risk of HIV with multiple options for care. To that end, we're excited about the recent approvals for Sunlenca in U.S. and Europe for heavily treatment experienced adults with multi drug resistant HIV infection. This first indication represents only 1% to 2% of people living with HIV. There's a huge unmet medical need. These individuals have cycled through multiple antiretroviral regimen, and until now have had very few if any, effective options left available. Sunlenca is now approved in the U.S., U.K. and European markets and we're working as quickly as possible with regulators and reimbursement bodies to make Sunlenca available in many more countries. We believe that first launch of Sunlenca represents a key milestone for Gilead and looking forward in the treatment and potential prevention of HIV. With Sunlenca, a true long acting regimen is a reality as awareness and familiarity of Sunlenca every six months subcutaneous administration grow among health care providers, community groups and people living with and at risk of HIV, we believe Sunlenca is well positioned for the future. Turning to HCV on Slide 10, sales for the fourth quarter were $439 million up 12% year-over-year, reflecting timing of Department of Corrections or DOC purchases, and favorable pricing dynamics in the U.S. Quarter-over-quarter HCV sales were down 16% primarily due to resolution of a rebate claim in Europe in the third quarter of 2022 that did not repeat, as well as other pricing dynamics in the U.S. offset in part by timing of DOC purchases. Going forward, we continue to expect new starts to decline, but are encouraged that our market share remains over 50% in both U.S. and Europe. Sales of HPV and HDD for the fourth quarter were $255 million as shown on slide 11. Sales were down 4% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially, primarily due to lower than ready demand and pricing dynamics outside of the U.S. Moving to Veklury on slide 12, sales the fourth quarter $1 billion with a full year totaling $3.9 billion. It's clear that the pandemic has evolved Veklury\u2019s role in the treatment of COVID-19 has remained unchanged as a key part of the standard-of-care for hospitalized patients. In fact, Veklury is still the only antiviral approved and it's setting and in the U.S. Veklury continues to be used in over 50% of hospitalized patients who are being treated for COVID-19. We're excited to continue to work on our oral COVID-19 nucleoside which Merdad will discuss shortly. Moving to oncology, and beginning with Trodelvy on Slide 13. Sales of $195 million in the fourth quarter grew 65% year-over-year, and 8% sequentially. For the full year Trodelvy's sales were $680 million up 79% year-over-year. As we continue to broaden access to Trodelvy around the world, we're encouraged by the growing demand and existing market. Trodelvy is now reimbursed across the major European markets. And in the U.S. demand was up 13% quarter-over-quarter, a growth rate almost doubled from the prior quarter, reflecting the solid contribution of our expanded field force and growing awareness. We're also excited by the expected decision from the FDA later this month, which could expand Trodelvy\u2019s potentially clinically meaningful benefits into the pre-treated HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer setting. We estimate this represents at least 6000 addressable patients in the U.S. and our U.S. field force has just wrapped up its launch meeting and is energized for the upcoming approval. The opportunity for Trodelvy to benefit patients with pre-treated HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic disease is supported by the recent NCCN Category 1 preferred recommendation for Trodelvy based on the TROPiCS-02 data. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency recently validated our marketing authorization application for Trodelvy in HR-positive/HER2-negative and we look forward to a decision later this year. Now on to Slide 14 and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team Cell Therapy sales in the fourth quarter were $490 million up 75% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Full year Cell Therapy sales were $1.5 billion up 68% year-over-year. The growth in the fourth quarter and full year were driven by continued uptake of Yescarta in large B cell lymphoma, notably in the U.S. Growing physician familiarity with Yescarta data and Kite industry leading manufacturing continue to be key growth drivers. Yescarta sales was $337 million up 85% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and 6% sequentially. We're pleased to see not only strong momentum and second line LBCL in the U.S., but also continued uptake in third line LBCL in both the U.S. and across European market. Yescarta sales were $82 million in the fourth quarter up 2% quarter-over-quarter with growing volume demand in both mantle cell lymphoma and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Year-over-year Yescarta sales were up 44%. We're pleased to see the building momentum of CAR-T Cell Therapy as a treatment class with curative potential and Yescarta and Tecartus as the leading cell therapies of choice globally. More patients are getting access due to Kite\u2019s industry leading reliable manufacturing capabilities and the team's expanding footprint of authorized treatment centers around the world. And just last week, U.K\u2019s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence or NICE, recommended Yescarta for routine use in third line large B cell lymphoma. This makes Yescarta the first party available for commissioning in England. Approvals and reimbursement into additional indications that are currently available in the U.S. and other markets is expected to continue over the next year. Yescarta was recently approved for second-line LBCL in Japan, which has the potential to be the second largest cell therapy market outside of the U.S. And we look forward to the transfer of the marketing authorization to Gilead and Kite later this year. In the interim, other still early days, we'll continue to work with our partner Daiichi Sankyo to make Yescarta available to approximately 7000 patients in the second line plus setting. Kite will begin manufacturing supplies for the Japanese market through our El Segundo, California, facility. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline. Merdad?\nMerdad Parsey: Thanks, Johanna. I'm pleased to be starting 2023 with all the momentum and 2022 behind us. The positive data readouts for Trodelvy and domvanalimab and the recent approvals for lenacapavir the team is really excited to progress our programs in 2023 and beyond. Starting with Brage [ph] on slide 16 and as I just mentioned, Lenacapavir received its first U.S. FDA approval for people living with multi drug resistant HIV in combination with other anti retrovirals. Marketed as Sunlenca, Lenacapavir is the first and only twice yearly subcutaneous HIV treatment, bringing much needed option for people living with multi-drug resistant HIV, that until now had limited alternatives. Combined with the approval from the European Commission, the FDA approval is an important validation, while we continue to progress our other Lenacapavir based treatment and prevention programs. For HIV treatment, we currently have 10 partner agents for Lenacapavir in various stages of development, including two new integrase inhibitors or INSTI in the pre-IND space. We expect to share data this year from the Phase 1/b proof-of-concept study for Lenacapavir and two broadly neutralizing antibodies or bNAb directed at HIV. And in PrEP, our clinical development of Lenacapavir as a monotherapy for HIV prevention continues to progress with two trials underway, and two additional trials expected to achieve FPI in the second half of 2023. Moving to slide 17, we continue to progress our novel oral nucleoside for COVID-19 GS-5245. Treatments such as Gilead Veklury and vaccinations have improved the outlook for patients with COVID-19. But there's still a significant need for effective and convenient oral treatment options. We've been working with the FDA and other global regulators to launch a clinical development program that could enable global filings. We've initiated a Phase III [ph] Birch trial in high risk patients defined as unvaccinated patients with one or more risk factors, or vaccinated patients with two or more risk factors. The Phase III Oaktree trial will evaluate standard risk patients, which includes people aged 12 and older with no CDC defined risk factors. We expect this trial to enroll its first patients in the U.S. in the first quarter. And we'll share progress when we can just depends in part on the prevalence of COVID-19 year study sites. Moving to oncology on slide 18, and starting with Trodelvy, we continue to build on the momentum of our TOPiCS-02 data. And we announced the European Medicines agency's validation of our marketing authorization application for pre-treated HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer in early January. As Johanna noted, we expect a regulatory decision of our sBLA in the U.S. later this month, and a decision Europe in the latter part of the year. Trodelvy has already changed the standard-of-care for many patients with metastatic TNBC and advanced bladder cancer. And we expect that these regulatory approvals will be an important step forward in bringing this potentially practice changing therapy to certain HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients. Moreover, recently presented data demonstrated Trodelvy's PFS and OS benefit was consistent across a range of tumor Trop-2 expression levels. This late breaking post-hoc analysis presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium was consistent with Trodelvy's data in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, where baseline Trop-2 expression was not associated with treatment response. Moving on to slide 19, we were pleased to share data from the fourth interim analysis of the ARC-7 trial with our partner Arcus in December, as presented at the ASCO Plenary session. ARC-7 is a randomized Phase II proof-of-concept study that enrolled 150 patients, the largest dataset in anti-digit studies released today with more than 100 patients across the 2-DOM containing arms. We were pleased to see both DOM containing arms demonstrate clinically meaningful differentiation compared to ZIM monotherapy across all efficacy measures evaluated, clearly establishing that the addition of Domvanalimab improved the clinical responses to anti PD-1 therapy in this population. We were also encouraged by the consistency of the safety data in the DOM containing treatment arms, which showed no unexpected safety signals. This is an on-going trial, and we look forward to sharing updated data at ASCO 2023. While these efficacy and safety data will mature over time, this fourth interim analysis fully supports our joint DOM\u2019s in-clinical development program, and the importance of interrupting the TIGIT pathway. Based on the totality of the data seen today, we're very confident that DOM with an Fc-silent design has the potential to be differentiated compared to other anti-TIGIT molecules in this space. The on-going Phase III trials of DOM added to anti PD-1 treatments in non-small cell lung cancer will provide the opportunity to confirm this activity. We're moving very quickly with our partners in both proof-of-concept studies, as well as late stage trials, including the 4 on-going Phase III trials. Moving to magrolimab, our anti-CD47 therapeutics on Slide 20, we have three on-going pivotal trials, and six proof-of-concept studies across six solid tumor indications. As we shared last month, the independent data monitoring committee met to review data from the first interim analysis from the enhanced study in first line high risk MDS. I'm pleased to share that there were no new safety signals, and the study continues unchanged. As a reminder, based on previous discussions with the FDA, we are now pursuing mature OS data for filing. The study is powered for the final OS analysis and Gilead remains blinded to the data to preserve study integrity. We will update you again in the second half of 2023 after the second interim analysis, noting that these interim analyses are event driven so timing is provisional. Moving on to slide 21, and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, I'm pleased to share details of another strong quarter of clinical progress in our cell therapy programs. At ASH, Kite had more than 25 data presentations, further demonstrating the transformative impact of cell therapies, including three year follow up data from ZUMA-5 showing that 52% of patients with indolent lymphomas treated with Yescarta continued to respond. Following the compelling ZUMA-12 data on Yescarta in frontline LBCL, shared at ASH in 2021, we expect to achieve FPI in our Phase III ZUMA-23 trial and Frontline high risk LBCL in the first half of the year. We are also progressing our Phase II ZUMA-24 outpatient study in second line LBCL and look forward to sharing interim safety data in the first half of this year. While there's still so much we can explore with the Yescarta and Tecartus, we are also building out the pipeline to ensure the Kite will extend its leadership into new indications and next generation cell therapy technologies. In December, we announced the strategic collaboration with Arcellx for the late-stage product candidate, CART-ddBCMA, which is currently being evaluated for the treatment of multiple myeloma. If approved, together with our industry leading manufacturing capabilities, we believe we can reliably and consistently deliver much needed therapy to patients. Additionally, we announced the pending acquisition of Tmunity Therapeutics, which adds an armored CAR T platform and rapid manufacturing technology to Kite. The Arcellx transaction closed earlier this week and Tmunity is expected to close later this quarter. Both highlight Kite\u2019s continued leadership in cell therapy, and our commitment to building a robust and exciting pipeline in cell therapies. Wrapping up on slide 22, we are sharing the key pipeline milestones that we expect in 2023 which as you can see, spans FPI, data readouts, updates and regulatory approvals across oncology and neurology. This highlights the progress that Gilead has made on its transformation journey with 59 clinical programs that are well diversified across indications in stage. As the clinical pipeline has grown, our focus on execution has intensified, and we look forward to updating you on our programs as we progress through 2023. With that, I'll hand the call over to Andy. Andy?\nAndrew Dickinson: Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Gilead closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter, driven by Biktarvy, Veklury and oncology. For the full year, our sales, excluding Veklury, grew 8%, which is by far the strongest full year growth rate Gilead has reported since HCV sales peaked in 2015. Of note, and excluding the impact of the Atripla and Truvada LOEs, HIV grew 8% year-over-year, driven by continued strong performance of Biktarvy, which grew 20% from 2021 to $10.4 billion. Biktarvy continues to demonstrate strong potential for further growth in 2023 and beyond. Oncology full year revenues exceeded $2 billion for the first time and grew 71% from 2021. Moving to our quarterly results starting on Slide 24. The fourth quarter demonstrated another strong performance across our business. Total product sales, excluding Veklury, grew 9% year-over-year despite an approximately $130 million headwind from FX. If we exclude FX in addition to the impact of HIV LOEs, total underlying sales growth for the fourth quarter was 12% compared with the prior year. Moving to Slide 25. Veklury was down as expected, year-over-year although it grew 8% on a sequential basis from the third quarter, highlighting that Veklury will continue to play an important role even as COVID-19 progresses into its endemic phase. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 86.8%, up more than 16 percentage points from last year, primarily due to a $1.25 billion charge related to a legal settlement recorded in COGS in the fourth quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP R&D expenses for the fourth quarter 2022 were $1.5 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the same period in 2021. Higher R&D expenses were driven by timing of clinical investments, mainly in oncology in addition to the impact of inflation on expenses. Fourth quarter acquired IP R&D was $158 million, primarily reflecting the MacroGenics collaboration and the license amendment with Jounce. And lower than prior year due to the $625 million charge related to the exercise of opt-in rights for Arcus assets in the fourth quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP SG&A was $2 billion, up 23% year-over-year, primarily reflecting a charge of $406 million associated with the termination of the Trodelvy collaboration with Everest Medicines. This $406 million charge includes the $280 million that we agreed to pay Everest to acquire the development and commercial rights to Trodelvy in China and other Asian territories in addition to some other termination-related expenses. Excluding this Everest impact, SG&A was down 2% year-over-year. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 37%, down sequentially due to the factors referenced earlier, including the $406 million Everest charge and up year-over-year. Excluding the Everest charge, non-GAAP operating margin was 42%. Non-GAAP effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 16.8%, lower than the prior year, driven by discrete tax charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.67 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.69 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Of note, the Everest contract termination impacted non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.25 a share. This was not reflected in the guidance we shared back in October. Moving to the full year on Slide 26. Total product sales were $27 billion. Excluding Veklury, total product sales were $23.1 billion, up 8% compared to 2021, primarily driven by Biktarvy and oncology. Excluding around $380 million of FX headwinds and the $350 million impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs, total product sales, excluding Veklury, were up 11% as compared to 2021. I touched on the main P&L impacts in the overview, but we'll highlight on Slide 27 that our non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2022 was 19.3% and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $7.26 per share compared to $7.18 per share reported in 2021. I'll move now to guidance on Slide 28. We recognize that the macro environment continues to be uncertain. Our initial 2023 guidance assumes an overall stable macro environment and relatively stable FX at current rates. While inflation is expected to moderate, our 2023 guidance reflects a full year of higher expenses experienced in 2022 associated with inflation. With that in mind, we expect total product sales in the range of $26 billion to $26.5 billion. For total product sales, excluding Veklury, we expect sales in the range of $24 billion to $24.5 billion, representing growth of 4% to 6% for our base business year-over-year. And we expect Biktarvy sales of approximately $2 billion. As always, Biktarvy sales will continue to track hospitalization rates and will remain highly variable depending on the frequency and severity of surges. Notably, we have seen a decline in hospitalization rates in recent weeks, and we'll continue to monitor the landscape carefully. As a result and similar to last year, we will update you on our Biktarvy expectations on a quarterly basis. Moving to the rest of the P&L. We expect our non-GAAP product gross margin to be approximately 86%, just slightly below our 2022 results and primarily reflecting the growing contribution from oncology. For non-GAAP operating expenses, we expect R&D to increase by a high single-digit percentage compared to 2022 levels, reflecting our on-going investment in strategic areas of growth and an increase in activity from later-stage trials. As a reminder, we had 8 Phase III trials start in 2022, and we expect to have 23 active Phase III trials by the end of 2023. Looking ahead, we expect R&D growth to moderate although we will step up investments as needed to support promising programs based on clinical data. Acquired IP R&D includes previously announced payments for our SELEX community and milestone payments for existing collaborations. Consistent with our approach in 2022, we will continue to share our expected acquired IP R&D expenses as we announced additional transactions. Finally, we expect SG&A to decrease by a low single-digit percentage compared to 2022. However, this is primarily due to some expenses reported in 2022 that we don't expect to repeat in 2023. If we normalize the 2022 SG&A expense for these items, we expect full year 2023 SG&A expense to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage on a basis of approximately $5.1 billion in 2022. Altogether, we expect our non-GAAP operating income for 2023 to be $11 billion to $11.6 billion. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20% again this year. And finally, we expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $6.60 and $7 for the full year and GAAP diluted EPS to be between $5.30 and $5.70 per share. Moving to capital allocation on Slide 29. Our priorities have not changed. In 2022, we returned over $5 billion to shareholders. This included dividend payments and $1.4 billion in share repurchases. Fourth quarter share repurchases were approximately $800 million. For 2023, we have announced today a 2.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.75 per share and remain committed to growing our dividend over time in line with earnings growth. You can also expect to see continued judicious investments in our business, both internally and externally through select partnerships and business development transactions. Finally, we will continue to use share repurchases to offset equity dilution as well as additional repurchases on an opportunistic basis. With that, I'll invite the operator to open the call up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with Cowen. Please proceed.\nTyler Van Buren: Hey, guys, thanks very much for the questions. It's great to see yet another impressive quarter of performance from the core business. At the midpoint, guidance assumes 5% year-over-year growth for product sales, excluding Veklury, yet non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a decline of 6%. So should we expect roughly flat earnings for the next 2 to 3 years as you continue to invest aggressively in the pipeline to set up earnings growth for the second half of the decade? Or is that too conservative? And what levers do you have to increase earnings in the near to midterm?\nAndrew Dickinson: Hey Tyler, it's Andy. Thanks for the question. We appreciate it. Look, what we've said and obviously, we don't provide longer-term guidance, but I'll reiterate that the -- as you highlighted, the base business is performing very well. We had another good year with Veklury, but we expect, as you heard in our prepared comments that the COVID-19 market will continue to be dynamic. And again, this year, you saw -- if you look at our EPS, the growth of the base business offset the decline in Veklury despite the increase in expenses. Going forward, again, a lot of our shareholders, as you know, focus on non-GAAP EPS, excluding Veklury, based on their assumptions. We expect using kind of that metric for our EPS to grow and for that growth to accelerate over the longer run as our products continue to deliver with additional commercial approvals, expanded indications, new products entering the market, et cetera. So again, I think what you're highlighting is the difficulty of looking through the impact of Veklury. When we look at the base business, we have a lot of confidence in terms of the health of the business and the growth it's going to deliver over time, both on the top line and the bottom line.\nJacquie Ross: Hannah, may we have our next question please?\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nGeoff Meacham: Afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I will keep it just to one. When you look at lenacapavir in the U.S., just help us with maybe the expected kind of loss dynamics following the recent approval and just with consideration of the hurdles with regard to payer access. And obviously, you guys had a long history here, but wondering if the environment is different today versus sort of pre-pandemic. Thank you.\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Geoff, for your question. It's Johanna. I think that we're super excited with Sunlenca approval. Do remember, though, it's really for a very specific patient population for the heavily treatment experienced multi-drug resistant population. And so that's about 1% to 2% of people living without HIV. That's about 5,000 patients or so in the U.S. So just to give you a little bit of a perspective on it. The \u2013 that\u2019s one piece of the puzzle. So far, so we just launched. So it's still early days and we're excited about it. And I think physicians' response has been very strong as well. The -- I think they really see the innovation of having something every 6 months coming in and also the promise of what it could mean in future with prevention indication as well as treatment combination. So more to come on that one. I think it's an incredible opportunity for us to gain awareness for Sunlenca. How to use it the reimbursement systems. And as to your point about pre-COVID to COVID, I think that actually, we've really normalized the market. I think we're back on track, when it comes to HIV, both screening, diagnosis, et cetera, and treatment. So we do believe that, that's probably not in play as we go forward in 2023. But again, small revenue, huge unmet medical need, and an incredible opportunity for patients to have something to ensure that they don't proceed to more like Aids disease versus just saying HIV positive.\nJacquie Ross: Hannah, may we have our next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Michael Yee at Jefferies. Please proceed.\nMichael Yee: Hey thanks for the question. Maybe a question for Merdad. On Trop-2, the competitor AstraZeneca Daiichi continues to be quite bullish and actually as a Phase III lung cancer study readout and -- the Street is quite bullish on Trop-2. Can you explain your thoughts around your differentiation? Appreciating your study readout, I think in 2024, and what we should appreciate as to how you will compete there or differentiate and maybe its safety, but maybe walk me through that and help us understand Trop-2 for versus your competitor? Thank you.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes. Thanks, Michael. This is Merdad. You're absolutely right. We do think that there are a couple of things that we think about when we think about differentiation. The first is that -- we've now been on the market and have several approvals under our belt with Trodelvy. And I think that is an important factor for having now been on the market in important indications. To your point, with lung, we will be somewhat behind where our competition is we do think that the data will have to evolve for us and for them. And I think so far, we have been fortunate to not see ILD in our development program so far. And so we are going to continue advancing our program forward aggressively. We've had a lot of success so far -- and I think our plan is to keep going ahead with the differentiated clinical development program so we can get into the broadest population as possible.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Do Kim with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\nDo Kim: Hi thanks for taking my question. And congrats on the quarter. Keeping it on Trodelvy. Merdad, I was hoping if you could provide a little more detail on 7 in pre-chemo HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer that you're initiating later this year. Just what that study design would look like? And how did you come to conclude that this was the next best study for this population.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes, hi thanks, that's an excellent question. And I think we haven't really talked about the design yet. In large part, we are working through both with investigators and regulators on what the best approach is going to be in that patient population. We do think that there is an important need in a large population there. And we want to make sure that we navigate that pathway carefully. So I think as we develop that program as a protocol gets developed, we'll be able to share more detail over time.\nJacquie Ross: Hannah, may we have our next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Colin Bristow with UBS. Please proceed.\nColin Bristow: Hey, can you guys hear me?\nMerdad Parsey: Yes.\nColin Bristow: Good afternoon and congrats on all the progress. Maybe one on TIGIT and dompenanumab. The -- just what is it that gives you the confidence that the Fc silent construct is the right approach when I think at least the animal data suggest that this may not be preferred. And then as you think about the upcoming study, ARC-7, could you talk about the frequency of scanter [ph] because this has come up as a point of at least discussion with regards to the comparator trials and the frequency of scans. Thank you.\nMerdad Parsey: Sure. This is Merdad again. Excellent question. Thank you for that. We -- in terms of our confidence, I think to your point, look, I think there was a lot of debate a couple of years ago. We shared in that debate, with what the preclinical data was showing. And as you know, the data they were conflicting preclinical data, including some data that suggested maybe an FC-silent may not work. But which is why we ran the studies the way we did and very importantly, why we ran ARC-7. The objective there was really to establish whether an FC-silent now would demonstrate a benefit relative to FC-active molecule. Part of the hypothesis there is what happens in the periphery and whether depleting effector cells with TIGIT could actually be harmful with FC-competent molecule relative to an FC-nonmolecule. And our confidence really comes from our ARC-7 data. I think the ARC-7 data really answered that question. We clearly show a benefit when added on to a PD-1. The PFS data exceed our bar for moving forward. And so we really think that we've answered that question in the clinic as to whether the FC-now matters.\nJacquie Ross: Hannah, let\u2019s move to our next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nChris Schott: Hi, great. Thanks so much. Just a question on the COVID business. I know it's volatile, and I know at the same time, the Street doesn't seem to model much of a tail for Veklury or GS-5245 at all in numbers beyond this year. We've got Pfizer's and others, then talking about more sustainable COVID businesses, I guess, off of 2023 level. So I just missing your thoughts on just how you're thinking about the business longer term? And is this a meaningful franchise for you over time? Or are you really thinking of this continuing to fade down beyond this year? Thank you.\nJohanna Mercier: Sure, Chris. It's Johanna. Yes. So definitely, we've changed a little bit. Our position on this one has evolved from 2020 to where we are today, obviously. I think we do truly believe that the Veklury business is much more sustainable than we've ever seen before, let alone as we think about kind of where we're going with COVID-19, including the oral that Merdad can speak to. The one piece that we've seen is -- it's maybe a little bit different than some of the orals that you're referring to is One is Veklury has been part of a commercial model since October of 2020. So we haven't had such big inventory lows at the government level like some others have had. So really, what you see probably 85% to 90% of revenues in 2022 are truly reflecting the demand for Veklury in 2022. And so therefore, coming into 2023, we feel very strongly that Veklury, because it's still the only antiviral indicated at the hospital level at this point in time because of the fact that in many countries around the world, it is the treatment of choice when they decide to treat hospitalized patients. I think there's really an incredible continuing opportunity for us to ensure that Veklury has is accessible to all these patients. And so that's why we think the model is quite sustainable moving forward. I would also just add that our label has broadened over the last year in some. We have a very strong body of evidence, including mortality as well as we have guidelines endorsement with the NIH as well as the WHO. So all of those people all of those pieces together actually make for a strong Veklury color position in 2023, but actually and beyond. And maybe I'll just pass it over to Merdad to talk a little bit to how we're thinking about COVID-19 as a whole with the oral.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes. Just 2 seconds. I think you're right to point out the uncertainties that we all have and that we've seen with outpatient COVID. And we have a lot of confidence in the mechanism of 5245 given what our expertise in the molecule itself and how well behaved it is. And we are going to push forward and do our best with both the high-risk and standard risk study and the uncertainties in terms of the pandemic will really determine what happens from here. So we will definitely keep you updated as to how that goes from here on out.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Brian Abrahams with RBC. Please proceed.\nBrian Abrahams: Hey good afternoon. And congrats on the quarter, and thanks for taking my question. Maybe continuing on the COVID theme on 5245, the Oaktree study. Can you talk a little bit more about the assumptions you've made in powering the primary endpoint here for the standard risk patients? And then help us understand how Oaktree and Birch might fit together to support U.S. and ex-U.S. approvals across the 2 populations you're studying? Thanks.\nMerdad Parsey: Sure. Very briefly. The -- to your point, one is in the high-risk population, right? So I think that's important. Those are people who have risk factors, whether or not they've been vaccinated and then the standard risk, which is people without risk factors. And -- those are very different populations. The end points are different in terms of what we're looking for and the high risk we're going to be looking for the ability to prevent things like hospitalization. And the standard risk, it would be looking for things like symptom improvement. And I think, again, I'll just reiterate that I think the uncertainties in terms of those factors and importantly, the underlying event rate is real. And so we've made a number of assumptions around what that background rate will be. And we've built into the trials, checkpoints to make sure that our assumptions are correct. And we have the ability to modify our program based on what the underlying event rates are. So that sort of helps mitigate the risks and the uncertainties. So we've gone in fairly eyes open to that.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the progress. Maybe if you could comment on your overall market share in HIV space and how it has been progressing. What I want to understand is that is there a scenario where your entire business growth could be better than the market growth as you gain share at this point? Thank you.\nA - Johanna Mercier: Sure. Hi, Mohit, it's Johanna. I think as we look at HIV as a whole, we're looking at about a 5% year-on-year growth. And of course, that's mostly driven by demand, namely Biktarvy. And so it's probably important to talk about the share there. So our total Gilead share is still in the low 70s, and we've been quite stable at that level. We saw a little bit of the dip when we got the Truvada, Atripla LOEs, and that's the only decline that we've seen there and really held steady, where you see nice growth, of course, is Biktarvy. Our year-on-year growth for Biktarvy is 20% in 50-year post launch. And I think that's the piece of the puzzle that's really driving the overall HIV business. In addition, to what's going on in PrEP with Descovy. To your point about the market growth, we've seen market growth around 2% to 3% year-on-year, both in the U.S. as well as in Europe, and we've assumed that we're kind of assuming that for some years to come. And I do think there's still enormous opportunity for continued growth in that market. And one of the main reasons why is there's still an opportunity for increasing treatment rates so from diagnosis to treatment, but also further penetration in underserved patient populations. And so at this point in time, with United Nations goal at 95,95,95 for testing, treatment and virologic suppression we're only about 70%, 75%. So if we were to get to those goals, you're looking at over 350,000 more patients into the system. So I think you're absolutely right. I think there's a great opportunity for us to continue to grow Biktarvy and our HIV business at Gilead.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Umer Raffat at Evercore. Please proceed.\nUmer Raffat: Hi guys. I have a question on the model today. I feel like consensus models have a lot of operating leverage in the long-term estimates for Gilead. And don't -- consensus doesn't carry more than low single-digit OpEx growth across SG&A and R&D. So with SG&A growing mid-single digits this year after the onetimers and R&D growing high single digits, I guess, should we assume that given all the collaborations and recent acquisitions that you really do need to be growing R&D meaningfully from current levels? I'm just trying to understand where the OpEx is heading longer term.\nAndrew Dickinson: Hey Omar, it's Andy. Thanks for the question. maybe a couple of things. First, I'd highlight that as you'd expect, we are mindful of expenses and don't expect R&D or SG&A to grow indefinitely. That said, we're going to continue to invest thoughtfully in the pipeline, and you're already seeing, I'd highlight the tangible benefits of doing that. So that's a really important point. We started on the R&D side. As you know, we started 8 Phase III trials this year. We're going to -- as you heard, start at least another 5 in 2023. So we are in an investment cycle. Over the longer run, and maybe one other thing before I kind of talk about the long-run picture to your question, again, when you benchmark us relative to competitors, as you know, historically, for both SG&A and R&D we underspent. And it's partly why we didn't have the pipeline that would drive the top quartile sustainable growth, that we aspire to, and we think we're on track to achieve today. So we're going to continue to invest. As you've heard and especially in these late Phase III trials that have started, we'll continue to do BD not at the same pace or level that we have over the last 4 or 5 years as we've rebuilt the pipeline. But our percent, our R&D as a percent of revenue this past year was below industry averages, I think, right around 19%. Same thing is true for SG&A as a percent of revenue. And even our guide suggests, I think, reasonable spend levels relative to comps. In the longer run, to your point, so we think about things over a longer cycle, we will not -- we do not expect to grow R&D or SG&A above the rate of earnings growth. And there is a lot of leverage in the model, we expect over the long run. So we're getting to the point where you're starting to see that play through, especially at the top line and then over the coming years, we expect that you'll really see that play through on the bottom line as well. So thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Olivia Brayer with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed.\nOlivia Brayer: Hey good afternoon guys. Thank you for the question. What's the latest thinking with respect to the regulatory path forward for magrolimab? I guess the question really is, could we see survival data from that ENHANCE interim later this year that's actually mature enough to file on? And is there anything beyond OS benefit that FDA has pointed to for a complete submission package? Thank you.\nMerdad Parsey: Hi, Olivia, this is Merdad. Yes. I think maybe it's good to step back and just clarify in the sense of -- how we're approaching interim analysis for our studies. So the pivotal macro study is powered for events at the final analysis. And of course, we run interim analyses, I think, as is norm for the industry to evaluate things like safety, but also we spend a little bit of alpha in case there is a dramatic improvement in the primary endpoint and offer ourselves the opportunity to start early to benefit patients. So the OS data continue to mature. The next interim this year dependent on events, of course, is not the final analysis. So it really depends on how big the magnitude of improvement is in OS, whether that leads to a stop in the study or an unblinding in the study. Our expectation is that we go to the final OS analysis. Of course, we always hope an upside surprise at one of the earlier interim analysis. And then in terms of approval, I think we really need to have OS. We initially had hoped that we could get, for example, an accelerated approval with CR rates alone. We think we need to do both now to have both a complete response rate, but primarily be driven -- not primarily be driven but importantly, have OS data as well in order to support a file.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Simon Baker with Redburn. Please proceed.\nSimon Baker: Thank you. First on [indiscernible] on the NICE recommendation. Clearly, that's good from a U.K. perspective, but it's the case that NICE recommendations are closely followed by a much larger range of countries. So I just wondered if this does indeed have a spill over benefit beyond the U.K. for Yescarta. How important is this approval in the U.K.?\nChristi Shaw: Hey there Simon, it's Christi. Thank you for the question. So we think it's very important because first of all, it's the number of patients is still very similar at 450, but the process by which patients get approved, obviously should be much smoother and really giving access to -- this recommendation really helps patients get access much more quickly. And so to your point, we do think as you see this approval that this hopefully, will have an influence on other countries, just like we saw with reimbursement as we look at the reimbursement of Yescarta in over 20 countries, it was one at a time. And as certain countries starting to improve. We saw the other countries also do the same. So based on the second-line ZUMA-7 trial as well, that will be our next step, too to continue to provide the data that giving a patient a onetime treatment can really help the health care system and improve patient outcomes. So yes, we're very hopeful that it could have some influence.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist. Please proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. This is Nicole on for Robyn. Are you seeing any safety signals in a sense for NFLSC [Ph] with Trodelvy and pembro? Like are the safety probes comparable to both populations? And if so, would this hamper uptake in the first line?\nMerdad Parsey: Hi, Nicole, this is Merdad. We haven't really disclosed anything on the safety. Those studies have really just gotten underway. So I don't think we have anything to share yet. We'll, of course, be following that to see if anything emerges. Your question is exactly the one that we want to make sure we address as we move forward. But I don't -- we don't have enough data at this point to make a comment one way or the other.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will be from Evan Seigerman with BMO. Please proceed.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. One for Christi. You're annualizing well above $1 billion for cell therapy products. Can you talk about the recent work you've done to expand manufacturing and how you could think that could support further growth this year and beyond? Thank you.\nChristi Shaw: Sure. So that was our focus and has been our focus is really on the supply side and being able to ensure that we have the capacity to provide for patients. I think that's what you're seeing is our industry-leading manufacturing piece. And if you look at GCFO3 here in California, adding the new site to TCFO-4 in Amsterdam and in TCFO-5 in Maryland, we're really able to leverage that footprint to grow not only in the assets that we have today, but in future pipeline, especially as we look at the partnership we have now with our select to multiple myeloma. So we're very confident about our ability to supply and the capacity that we've built and today and for tomorrow. And really the next focus for us is we've had some really good gains on our margin improvements. But as we look at our operational -- our optimization of our manufacturing footprint. Yes, we need to continue to ensure the capacity, which we feel like we've really done. And now we're able to put a big focus too on the optimization piece, which we've made progress on but we have several levers there to pull as well. So I hope you're hearing from me a big confidence in our ability to deliver for patients from a capacity standpoint.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to the management team for any closing remarks.\nDaniel O'Day: Great. This is Dan. I just want to do a couple of things here. First of all, thank you all for joining and your on-going interest and questions for Gilead. As usual, if we didn't get to all of your questions, please reach out to Investor Relations. As you know, we're very happy to answer those on an on-going basis. Now let me just close by emphasizing that Gilead is in a very different place than it was a few years ago, thanks to the work the team has done to transform the company. We're going into 2023 in a very strong position with our current medicines performing well and tremendous growth potential in our neuro therapies as well as those in development. So what you can expect to see next is quarter-on-quarter execution and even faster progress and greater impact in the future. Thank you very much for your time today, and we look forward to speaking to you again soon.\nOperator: That concludes today's fourth quarter and full year 2022 Gilead Sciences earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Merdad Parsey",
            "content": "Thanks, Johanna. I'm pleased to be starting 2023 with all the momentum and 2022 behind us. The positive data readouts for Trodelvy and domvanalimab and the recent approvals for lenacapavir the team is really excited to progress our programs in 2023 and beyond. Starting with Brage [ph] on slide 16 and as I just mentioned, Lenacapavir received its first U.S. FDA approval for people living with multi drug resistant HIV in combination with other anti retrovirals. Marketed as Sunlenca, Lenacapavir is the first and only twice yearly subcutaneous HIV treatment, bringing much needed option for people living with multi-drug resistant HIV, that until now had limited alternatives. Combined with the approval from the European Commission, the FDA approval is an important validation, while we continue to progress our other Lenacapavir based treatment and prevention programs. For HIV treatment, we currently have 10 partner agents for Lenacapavir in various stages of development, including two new integrase inhibitors or INSTI in the pre-IND space. We expect to share data this year from the Phase 1/b proof-of-concept study for Lenacapavir and two broadly neutralizing antibodies or bNAb directed at HIV. And in PrEP, our clinical development of Lenacapavir as a monotherapy for HIV prevention continues to progress with two trials underway, and two additional trials expected to achieve FPI in the second half of 2023. Moving to slide 17, we continue to progress our novel oral nucleoside for COVID-19 GS-5245. Treatments such as Gilead Veklury and vaccinations have improved the outlook for patients with COVID-19. But there's still a significant need for effective and convenient oral treatment options. We've been working with the FDA and other global regulators to launch a clinical development program that could enable global filings. We've initiated a Phase III [ph] Birch trial in high risk patients defined as unvaccinated patients with one or more risk factors, or vaccinated patients with two or more risk factors. The Phase III Oaktree trial will evaluate standard risk patients, which includes people aged 12 and older with no CDC defined risk factors. We expect this trial to enroll its first patients in the U.S. in the first quarter. And we'll share progress when we can just depends in part on the prevalence of COVID-19 year study sites. Moving to oncology on slide 18, and starting with Trodelvy, we continue to build on the momentum of our TOPiCS-02 data. And we announced the European Medicines agency's validation of our marketing authorization application for pre-treated HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer in early January. As Johanna noted, we expect a regulatory decision of our sBLA in the U.S. later this month, and a decision Europe in the latter part of the year. Trodelvy has already changed the standard-of-care for many patients with metastatic TNBC and advanced bladder cancer. And we expect that these regulatory approvals will be an important step forward in bringing this potentially practice changing therapy to certain HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients. Moreover, recently presented data demonstrated Trodelvy's PFS and OS benefit was consistent across a range of tumor Trop-2 expression levels. This late breaking post-hoc analysis presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium was consistent with Trodelvy's data in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, where baseline Trop-2 expression was not associated with treatment response. Moving on to slide 19, we were pleased to share data from the fourth interim analysis of the ARC-7 trial with our partner Arcus in December, as presented at the ASCO Plenary session. ARC-7 is a randomized Phase II proof-of-concept study that enrolled 150 patients, the largest dataset in anti-digit studies released today with more than 100 patients across the 2-DOM containing arms. We were pleased to see both DOM containing arms demonstrate clinically meaningful differentiation compared to ZIM monotherapy across all efficacy measures evaluated, clearly establishing that the addition of Domvanalimab improved the clinical responses to anti PD-1 therapy in this population. We were also encouraged by the consistency of the safety data in the DOM containing treatment arms, which showed no unexpected safety signals. This is an on-going trial, and we look forward to sharing updated data at ASCO 2023. While these efficacy and safety data will mature over time, this fourth interim analysis fully supports our joint DOM's in-clinical development program, and the importance of interrupting the TIGIT pathway. Based on the totality of the data seen today, we're very confident that DOM with an Fc-silent design has the potential to be differentiated compared to other anti-TIGIT molecules in this space. The on-going Phase III trials of DOM added to anti PD-1 treatments in non-small cell lung cancer will provide the opportunity to confirm this activity. We're moving very quickly with our partners in both proof-of-concept studies, as well as late stage trials, including the 4 on-going Phase III trials. Moving to magrolimab, our anti-CD47 therapeutics on Slide 20, we have three on-going pivotal trials, and six proof-of-concept studies across six solid tumor indications. As we shared last month, the independent data monitoring committee met to review data from the first interim analysis from the enhanced study in first line high risk MDS. I'm pleased to share that there were no new safety signals, and the study continues unchanged. As a reminder, based on previous discussions with the FDA, we are now pursuing mature OS data for filing. The study is powered for the final OS analysis and Gilead remains blinded to the data to preserve study integrity. We will update you again in the second half of 2023 after the second interim analysis, noting that these interim analyses are event driven so timing is provisional. Moving on to slide 21, and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, I'm pleased to share details of another strong quarter of clinical progress in our cell therapy programs. At ASH, Kite had more than 25 data presentations, further demonstrating the transformative impact of cell therapies, including three year follow up data from ZUMA-5 showing that 52% of patients with indolent lymphomas treated with Yescarta continued to respond. Following the compelling ZUMA-12 data on Yescarta in frontline LBCL, shared at ASH in 2021, we expect to achieve FPI in our Phase III ZUMA-23 trial and Frontline high risk LBCL in the first half of the year. We are also progressing our Phase II ZUMA-24 outpatient study in second line LBCL and look forward to sharing interim safety data in the first half of this year. While there's still so much we can explore with the Yescarta and Tecartus, we are also building out the pipeline to ensure the Kite will extend its leadership into new indications and next generation cell therapy technologies. In December, we announced the strategic collaboration with Arcellx for the late-stage product candidate, CART-ddBCMA, which is currently being evaluated for the treatment of multiple myeloma. If approved, together with our industry leading manufacturing capabilities, we believe we can reliably and consistently deliver much needed therapy to patients. Additionally, we announced the pending acquisition of Tmunity Therapeutics, which adds an armored CAR T platform and rapid manufacturing technology to Kite. The Arcellx transaction closed earlier this week and Tmunity is expected to close later this quarter. Both highlight Kite's continued leadership in cell therapy, and our commitment to building a robust and exciting pipeline in cell therapies. Wrapping up on slide 22, we are sharing the key pipeline milestones that we expect in 2023 which as you can see, spans FPI, data readouts, updates and regulatory approvals across oncology and neurology. This highlights the progress that Gilead has made on its transformation journey with 59 clinical programs that are well diversified across indications in stage. As the clinical pipeline has grown, our focus on execution has intensified, and we look forward to updating you on our programs as we progress through 2023. With that, I'll hand the call over to Andy. Andy? Yes. Thanks, Michael. This is Merdad. You're absolutely right. We do think that there are a couple of things that we think about when we think about differentiation. The first is that -- we've now been on the market and have several approvals under our belt with Trodelvy. And I think that is an important factor for having now been on the market in important indications. To your point, with lung, we will be somewhat behind where our competition is we do think that the data will have to evolve for us and for them. And I think so far, we have been fortunate to not see ILD in our development program so far. And so we are going to continue advancing our program forward aggressively. We've had a lot of success so far -- and I think our plan is to keep going ahead with the differentiated clinical development program so we can get into the broadest population as possible. Yes, hi thanks, that's an excellent question. And I think we haven't really talked about the design yet. In large part, we are working through both with investigators and regulators on what the best approach is going to be in that patient population. We do think that there is an important need in a large population there. And we want to make sure that we navigate that pathway carefully. So I think as we develop that program as a protocol gets developed, we'll be able to share more detail over time. Yes. Sure. This is Merdad again. Excellent question. Thank you for that. We -- in terms of our confidence, I think to your point, look, I think there was a lot of debate a couple of years ago. We shared in that debate, with what the preclinical data was showing. And as you know, the data they were conflicting preclinical data, including some data that suggested maybe an FC-silent may not work. But which is why we ran the studies the way we did and very importantly, why we ran ARC-7. The objective there was really to establish whether an FC-silent now would demonstrate a benefit relative to FC-active molecule. Part of the hypothesis there is what happens in the periphery and whether depleting effector cells with TIGIT could actually be harmful with FC-competent molecule relative to an FC-nonmolecule. And our confidence really comes from our ARC-7 data. I think the ARC-7 data really answered that question. We clearly show a benefit when added on to a PD-1. The PFS data exceed our bar for moving forward. And so we really think that we've answered that question in the clinic as to whether the FC-now matters. Yes. Just 2 seconds. I think you're right to point out the uncertainties that we all have and that we've seen with outpatient COVID. And we have a lot of confidence in the mechanism of 5245 given what our expertise in the molecule itself and how well behaved it is. And we are going to push forward and do our best with both the high-risk and standard risk study and the uncertainties in terms of the pandemic will really determine what happens from here. So we will definitely keep you updated as to how that goes from here on out. Sure. Very briefly. The -- to your point, one is in the high-risk population, right? So I think that's important. Those are people who have risk factors, whether or not they've been vaccinated and then the standard risk, which is people without risk factors. And -- those are very different populations. The end points are different in terms of what we're looking for and the high risk we're going to be looking for the ability to prevent things like hospitalization. And the standard risk, it would be looking for things like symptom improvement. And I think, again, I'll just reiterate that I think the uncertainties in terms of those factors and importantly, the underlying event rate is real. And so we've made a number of assumptions around what that background rate will be. And we've built into the trials, checkpoints to make sure that our assumptions are correct. And we have the ability to modify our program based on what the underlying event rates are. So that sort of helps mitigate the risks and the uncertainties. So we've gone in fairly eyes open to that. Hi, Olivia, this is Merdad. Yes. I think maybe it's good to step back and just clarify in the sense of -- how we're approaching interim analysis for our studies. So the pivotal macro study is powered for events at the final analysis. And of course, we run interim analyses, I think, as is norm for the industry to evaluate things like safety, but also we spend a little bit of alpha in case there is a dramatic improvement in the primary endpoint and offer ourselves the opportunity to start early to benefit patients. So the OS data continue to mature. The next interim this year dependent on events, of course, is not the final analysis. So it really depends on how big the magnitude of improvement is in OS, whether that leads to a stop in the study or an unblinding in the study. Our expectation is that we go to the final OS analysis. Of course, we always hope an upside surprise at one of the earlier interim analysis. And then in terms of approval, I think we really need to have OS. We initially had hoped that we could get, for example, an accelerated approval with CR rates alone. We think we need to do both now to have both a complete response rate, but primarily be driven -- not primarily be driven but importantly, have OS data as well in order to support a file. Hi, Nicole, this is Merdad. We haven't really disclosed anything on the safety. Those studies have really just gotten underway. So I don't think we have anything to share yet. We'll, of course, be following that to see if anything emerges. Your question is exactly the one that we want to make sure we address as we move forward. But I don't -- we don't have enough data at this point to make a comment one way or the other."

            "name": "Daniel O'Day",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. We had the opportunity to connect with many of you a few weeks ago in San Francisco. And I'm excited to be able to reconnect now to share our strong fourth quarter and full year results for 2022 in addition to our guidance for 2023. These show the tangible impact of our business transformation, notably the growth trajectory for HIV portfolio and our fast-growing oncology business. The team will take you through our quarterly results in detail, but I am very pleased to highlight on Slide 4 the strongest full year growth in our base business since 2015 when growth was driven by the peak of HCV sales. Full year 2022 sales of Biktarvy grew 20% year-over-year to $10.4 billion, exceeding $10 billion for the first time. Excluding Biktarvy, our base business in 2022 grew 8% year-over-year and I'm pleased to share that our initial 2023 guidance points the base business growth between 4% and 6%. Andy will share our revenue guidance in detail, but I do want to take this opportunity to recognize the Gilead team for the progress we made in returning to growth. Thanks to their commitment to improving the health of people and communities around the world, Gilead is now poised to extend its reach to more patients and more challenging disesases and conditions than ever before. Beyond our financial results, our clinical progress in 2022 reinforces how far we've come. At the end of the year, Sunlenca received its first approval in the U.S. for heavily treatment-experienced adults with multi drug-resistant HIV infection. This follows a European approval in the third quarter. Sunlenca is the first six monthly subcutaneous medicines to be approved and we believe it represents the most exciting innovation in HIV therapeutics in recent years, with significant potential across prevention and treatment. We look forward to partnering with the HIV community to increase awareness of Sunlenca and to advancing our portfolio of long acting options. We are anticipating an another potential approval any day now with the upcoming PDUFA date for Trodelvy in pre-treated HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. We also expect to hear from European regulators later this year. In the meantime, Trodelvy's commercial momentum is building, with full year 2022 sales growth of 79%. In cell therapy, we continue to reinforce our leadership and to execute on plans to broaden availability, with Yescarta most recently approved in Japan for a second-line relapsed refractory large B cell lymphoma. Merdad will take you through our pipeline updates and key milestones in a few moments. For now, I'll simply note the significant expansion in our clinical programs, which are more than doubled in the last four years. We continue to add further programs, including our new preclinical candidates to partner with lenacapavir for a long-acting HIV treatment programs, the new Phase III OAK CRE study for a Novel Oral COVID-19 nucleoside, and the five Phase III trials that we expect to initiate this year. Before I hand over to Johanna, I want to briefly review the clinical goals we shared with you a year ago. The Gilead and Kite teams have done a terrific job in both delivering as plan and acting with agility in response to changing circumstances. We had an impressive year of discipline and determine execution in 2022 and fully expect to further strengthen our track record of execution in 2023 and beyond. With that, I'll hand over to Johanna for a review of our fourth quarter and full year commercial performance. Johanna? Great. This is Dan. I just want to do a couple of things here. First of all, thank you all for joining and your on-going interest and questions for Gilead. As usual, if we didn't get to all of your questions, please reach out to Investor Relations.

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Andrew Dickinson",
            "content": "Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Gilead closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter, driven by Biktarvy, Veklury and oncology. For the full year, our sales, excluding Veklury, grew 8%, which is by far the strongest full year growth rate Gilead has reported since HCV sales peaked in 2015. Of note, and excluding the impact of the Atripla and Truvada LOEs, HIV grew 8% year-over-year, driven by continued strong performance of Biktarvy, which grew 20% from 2021 to $10.4 billion. Biktarvy continues to demonstrate strong potential for further growth in 2023 and beyond. Oncology full year revenues exceeded $2 billion for the first time and grew 71% from 2021. Moving to our quarterly results starting on Slide 24. The fourth quarter demonstrated another strong performance across our business. Total product sales, excluding Veklury, grew 9% year-over-year despite an approximately $130 million headwind from FX. If we exclude FX in addition to the impact of HIV LOEs, total underlying sales growth for the fourth quarter was 12% compared with the prior year. Moving to Slide 25. Veklury was down as expected, year-over-year although it grew 8% on a sequential basis from the third quarter, highlighting that Veklury will continue to play an important role even as COVID-19 progresses into its endemic phase. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 86.8%, up more than 16 percentage points from last year, primarily due to a $1.25 billion charge related to a legal settlement recorded in COGS in the fourth quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP R&D expenses for the fourth quarter 2022 were $1.5 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the same period in 2021. Higher R&D expenses were driven by timing of clinical investments, mainly in oncology in addition to the impact of inflation on expenses. Fourth quarter acquired IP R&D was $158 million, primarily reflecting the MacroGenics collaboration and the license amendment with Jounce. And lower than prior year due to the $625 million charge related to the exercise of opt-in rights for Arcus assets in the fourth quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP SG&A was $2 billion, up 23% year-over-year, primarily reflecting a charge of $406 million associated with the termination of the Trodelvy collaboration with Everest Medicines. This $406 million charge includes the $280 million that we agreed to pay Everest to acquire the development and commercial rights to Trodelvy in China and other Asian territories in addition to some other termination-related expenses. Excluding this Everest impact, SG&A was down 2% year-over-year. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 37%, down sequentially due to the factors referenced earlier, including the $406 million Everest charge and up year-over-year. Excluding the Everest charge, non-GAAP operating margin was 42%. Non-GAAP effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 16.8%, lower than the prior year, driven by discrete tax charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.67 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.69 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Of note, the Everest contract termination impacted non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.25 a share. This was not reflected in the guidance we shared back in October. Moving to the full year on Slide 26. Total product sales were $27 billion. Excluding Veklury, total product sales were $23.1 billion, up 8% compared to 2021, primarily driven by Biktarvy and oncology. Excluding around $380 million of FX headwinds and the $350 million impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs, total product sales, excluding Veklury, were up 11% as compared to 2021. I touched on the main P&L impacts in the overview, but we'll highlight on Slide 27 that our non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2022 was 19.3% and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $7.26 per share compared to $7.18 per share reported in 2021. I'll move now to guidance on Slide 28. We recognize that the macro environment continues to be uncertain. Our initial 2023 guidance assumes an overall stable macro environment and relatively stable FX at current rates. While inflation is expected to moderate, our 2023 guidance reflects a full year of higher expenses experienced in 2022 associated with inflation. With that in mind, we expect total product sales in the range of $26 billion to $26.5 billion. For total product sales, excluding Veklury, we expect sales in the range of $24 billion to $24.5 billion, representing growth of 4% to 6% for our base business year-over-year. And we expect Biktarvy sales of approximately $2 billion. As always, Biktarvy sales will continue to track hospitalization rates and will remain highly variable depending on the frequency and severity of surges. Notably, we have seen a decline in hospitalization rates in recent weeks, and we'll continue to monitor the landscape carefully. As a result and similar to last year, we will update you on our Biktarvy expectations on a quarterly basis. Moving to the rest of the P&L. We expect our non-GAAP product gross margin to be approximately 86%, just slightly below our 2022 results and primarily reflecting the growing contribution from oncology. For non-GAAP operating expenses, we expect R&D to increase by a high single-digit percentage compared to 2022 levels, reflecting our on-going investment in strategic areas of growth and an increase in activity from later-stage trials. As a reminder, we had 8 Phase III trials start in 2022, and we expect to have 23 active Phase III trials by the end of 2023. Looking ahead, we expect R&D growth to moderate although we will step up investments as needed to support promising programs based on clinical data. Acquired IP R&D includes previously announced payments for our SELEX community and milestone payments for existing collaborations. Consistent with our approach in 2022, we will continue to share our expected acquired IP R&D expenses as we announced additional transactions. Finally, we expect SG&A to decrease by a low single-digit percentage compared to 2022. However, this is primarily due to some expenses reported in 2022 that we don't expect to repeat in 2023. If we normalize the 2022 SG&A expense for these items, we expect full year 2023 SG&A expense to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage on a basis of approximately $5.1 billion in 2022. Altogether, we expect our non-GAAP operating income for 2023 to be $11 billion to $11.6 billion. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20% again this year. And finally, we expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $6.60 and $7 for the full year and GAAP diluted EPS to be between $5.30 and $5.70 per share. Moving to capital allocation on Slide 29. Our priorities have not changed. In 2022, we returned over $5 billion to shareholders. This included dividend payments and $1.4 billion in share repurchases. Fourth quarter share repurchases were approximately $800 million. For 2023, we have announced today a 2.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.75 per share and remain committed to growing our dividend over time in line with earnings growth. You can also expect to see continued judicious investments in our business, both internally and externally through select partnerships and business development transactions. Finally, we will continue to use share repurchases to offset equity dilution as well as additional repurchases on an opportunistic basis. With that, I'll invite the operator to open the call up for questions. Hey Tyler, it's Andy. Thanks for the question. We appreciate it. Look, what we've said and obviously, we don't provide longer-term guidance, but I'll reiterate that the -- as you highlighted, the base business is performing very well. We had another good year with Veklury, but we expect, as you heard in our prepared comments that the COVID-19 market will continue to be dynamic. And again, this year, you saw -- if you look at our EPS, the growth of the base business offset the decline in Veklury despite the increase in expenses. Going forward, again, a lot of our shareholders, as you know, focus on non-GAAP EPS, excluding Veklury, based on their assumptions. We expect using kind of that metric for our EPS to grow and for that growth to accelerate over the longer run as our products continue to deliver with additional commercial approvals, expanded indications, new products entering the market, et cetera. So again, I think what you're highlighting is the difficulty of looking through the impact of Veklury. When we look at the base business, we have a lot of confidence in terms of the health of the business and the growth it's going to deliver over time, both on the top line and the bottom line. Hey Omar, it's Andy. Thanks for the question. maybe a couple of things. First, I'd highlight that as you'd expect, we are mindful of expenses and don't expect R&D or SG&A to grow indefinitely. That said, we're going to continue to invest thoughtfully in the pipeline, and you're already seeing, I'd highlight the tangible benefits of doing that. So that's a really important point. We started on the R&D side. As you know, we started 8 Phase III trials this year. We're going to -- as you heard, start at least another 5 in 2023. So we are in an investment cycle. Over the longer run, and maybe one other thing before I kind of talk about the long-run picture to your question, again, when you benchmark us relative to competitors, as you know, historically, for both SG&A and R&D we underspent. And it's partly why we didn't have the pipeline that would drive the top quartile sustainable growth, that we aspire to, and we think we're on track to achieve today. So we're going to continue to invest. As you've heard and especially in these late Phase III trials that have started, we'll continue to do BD not at the same pace or level that we have over the last 4 or 5 years as we've rebuilt the pipeline. But our percent, our R&D as a percent of revenue this past year was below industry averages, I think, right around 19%. Same thing is true for SG&A as a percent of revenue. And even our guide suggests, I think, reasonable spend levels relative to comps. In the longer run, to your point, so we think about things over a longer cycle, we will not -- we do not expect to grow R&D or SG&A above the rate of earnings growth. And there is a lot of leverage in the model, we expect over the long run. So we're getting to the point where you're starting to see that play through, especially at the top line and then over the coming years, we expect that you'll really see that play through on the bottom line as well. So thanks for the question."

Before discussing our commercial results, I want to acknowledge our Gilead team for delivering another outstanding quarter and closing out a very successful year. 2022 was an exceptional year for Gilead with our virology franchise well positioned to continue its leadership for years to come. And significant progress in executing our oncology strategy and bringing new medicines to improve the lives of more patients all around the world. Starting on Slide 7, we had a very strong quarter, delivering a total product sales excluding Veklury at $6.3 billion, up 9% year-over-year, or 12%, excluding the impact of FX and the loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla. With solid growth in each of our core franchises and growth across all geographies, once again, led by HIV and oncology. Quarter-over-quarter sales grew 5%, driven by HIV, Trodelvy and cell therapy, partially offset by HCV. For the full year, total product sales, excluding Veklury, were $23.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year, or 11%, excluding the impact of FX and the Truvada Atripla LOE, driven by HIV and oncology. As expected, full year Veklury sales were down meaningfully in 2022 compared to 2021. That said, Veklury's performance has been more sustainable than we previously expected. And it's clear that it continues to play an essential role for hospitalized patients treated for COVID-19. In 2022, Veklury delivered $3.9 billion, including $1 billion in the fourth quarter. Overall, full year total product sales of $27 billion was flat compared to 2021, as growth in our base business was offset by the decline in Veklury sales. On Slide 8, HIV sales for the fourth quarter were $4.8 billion, a 5% year-over-year, driven by higher demand as well as favorable pricing dynamics. This was offset in part by a smaller than usual inventory build in the fourth quarter, reflecting our early efforts on seasonal inventory management. Sequentially, HIV sales in the fourth quarter were up 6%, primarily driven by favorable pricing and inventory dynamics as well as higher demand. For the full year, HIV sales of $17.2 billion were up 5% year-over-year due to higher demand primarily related to the continued strength of Biktarvy, in addition to channel mix, leading to higher average realized price. This was partially offset by inventory dynamics and FX. Overall, the HIV treatment market in the fourth quarter grew 1.5% year-over-year in the U.S. and over 2% in Europe. On an annual basis, the market has grown in line with our expectations of 2% to 3%. Moving to Prevention, the U.S. PrEP market grew 18% year-over-year and 3% sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting growing awareness. Descovy sales for the fourth quarter were $537 million, up 13% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Notably, despite generics and other entrants, demand for Descovy for PrEP continues to increase up more than 20% for the full year, in addition to maintaining a stable market share of over 40%. With these trends and the TAF IP settlement last year, Descovy's position in the growing PrEP market has only strengthened. Overall, this provides a strong foundation as we look to the potential launch of lenacapavir for PrEP as a true long acting every six months regimen in the middle part of the decade. Moving to Biktarvy on Slide 9, sales for the quarter were $2.9 billion, up 15% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher demand, as well as favorable pricing dynamics, offset in part by lower channel inventory. Quarter-over-quarter, sales were up 6%, similarly driven by higher demand, as well as favorable pricing and inventory dynamics. In every quarter since our launch, we've seen Biktarvy continue to gain market share, and the fourth quarter was no exception, getting more than 3 percentage points in share year-over-year. This continued momentum is a testament to Biktarvy's differentiated clinical profile, reinforced by the long-term five-year data we presented last year. Notably in U.S., Europe and other major markets, Biktarvy remains the number one regimen for new starts in addition to its number one position in treatments, which is across most of the major markets, including the U.S. At the end of 2022, there were almost 1 million people managing their HIV with Biktarvy worldwide. Taken all together, this has led Biktarvy for the first time to achieve full year sales of over $10 billion in 2022. Looking ahead, we're confident Biktarvy will remain the leading medicine for the treatment of HIV in U.S., Europe and other major markets for years to come. Now looking ahead for the first quarter of 2023 for HIV, a few points I just wanted to call out. First, with respect to pricing dynamics as we enter the New Year, we expect a typical first quarter reset in patient co-pay and deductibles. As always, these will have an unfavorable impact on average realized price in the first quarter. Second, a reminder that we've historically seen inventory build-up in Q4 that has led to notable drawdowns by wholesalers in Q1. While we've implemented new processes to better manage inventory dynamics from the fourth quarter into the first quarter, we continue to expect an inventory drawdown to occur in Q1, albeit at more modest levels compared to prior year. So with this in mind, we expect HIV sales for the first quarter to decline by low teens sequentially from the fourth quarter. This compares to the 18% sequential decline we reported in the first quarter of 2022. For the full year 2023, I'd like to remind you that some of our HIV performance in 2022 was driven by shifts in channel mix that had a favorable impact on average realized price, contributing in part to the 5% year-over-year revenue growth we reported in 2022. We expect channel mix in 2023 to be relatively similar to last year, and therefore do not expect HIV growth to benefit from changes in average realized price like we saw in 2022. As a result, we continue to expect HIV to grow in 2023, albeit at a modestly lower growth rate than 2022. As we think about the future of the HIV market, Gilead is well positioned to provide many people living with HIV and those at risk of HIV with multiple options for care. To that end, we're excited about the recent approvals for Sunlenca in U.S. and Europe for heavily treatment experienced adults with multi drug resistant HIV infection. This first indication represents only 1% to 2% of people living with HIV. There's a huge unmet medical need. These individuals have cycled through multiple antiretroviral regimen, and until now have had very few if any, effective options left available. Sunlenca is now approved in the U.S., U.K. and European markets and we're working as quickly as possible with regulators and reimbursement bodies to make Sunlenca available in many more countries. We believe that first launch of Sunlenca represents a key milestone for Gilead and looking forward in the treatment and potential prevention of HIV. With Sunlenca, a true long acting regimen is a reality as awareness and familiarity of Sunlenca every six months subcutaneous administration grow among health care providers, community groups and people living with and at risk of HIV, we believe Sunlenca is well positioned for the future. Turning to HCV on Slide 10, sales for the fourth quarter were $439 million up 12% year-over-year, reflecting timing of Department of Corrections or DOC purchases, and favorable pricing dynamics in the U.S. Quarter-over-quarter HCV sales were down 16% primarily due to resolution of a rebate claim in Europe in the third quarter of 2022 that did not repeat, as well as other pricing dynamics in the U.S. offset in part by timing of DOC purchases. Going forward, we continue to expect new starts to decline, but are encouraged that our market share remains over 50% in both U.S. and Europe. Sales of HPV and HDD for the fourth quarter were $255 million as shown on slide 11. Sales were down 4% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially, primarily due to lower than ready demand and pricing dynamics outside of the U.S. Moving to Veklury on slide 12, sales the fourth quarter $1 billion with a full year totaling $3.9 billion. It's clear that the pandemic has evolved Veklury's role in the treatment of COVID-19 has remained unchanged as a key part of the standard-of-care for hospitalized patients. In fact, Veklury is still the only antiviral approved and it's setting and in the U.S. Veklury continues to be used in over 50% of hospitalized patients who are being treated for COVID-19. We're excited to continue to work on our oral COVID-19 nucleoside which Merdad will discuss shortly. Moving to oncology, and beginning with Trodelvy on Slide 13. Sales of $195 million in the fourth quarter grew 65% year-over-year, and 8% sequentially. For the full year Trodelvy's sales were $680 million up 79% year-over-year. As we continue to broaden access to Trodelvy around the world, we're encouraged by the growing demand and existing market. Trodelvy is now reimbursed across the major European markets. And in the U.S. demand was up 13% quarter-over-quarter, a growth rate almost doubled from the prior quarter, reflecting the solid contribution of our expanded field force and growing awareness. We're also excited by the expected decision from the FDA later this month, which could expand Trodelvy's potentially clinically meaningful benefits into the pre-treated HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer setting. We estimate this represents at least 6000 addressable patients in the U.S. and our U.S. field force has just wrapped up its launch meeting and is energized for the upcoming approval. The opportunity for Trodelvy to benefit patients with pre-treated HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic disease is supported by the recent NCCN Category 1 preferred recommendation for Trodelvy based on the TROPiCS-02 data. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency recently validated our marketing authorization application for Trodelvy in HR-positive/HER2-negative and we look forward to a decision later this year. Now on to Slide 14 and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team Cell Therapy sales in the fourth quarter were $490 million up 75% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Full year Cell Therapy sales were $1.5 billion up 68% year-over-year. The growth in the fourth quarter and full year were driven by continued uptake of Yescarta in large B cell lymphoma, notably in the U.S. Growing physician familiarity with Yescarta data and Kite industry leading manufacturing continue to be key growth drivers. Yescarta sales was $337 million up 85% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and 6% sequentially. We're pleased to see not only strong momentum and second line LBCL in the U.S., but also continued uptake in third line LBCL in both the U.S. and across European market. Yescarta sales were $82 million in the fourth quarter up 2% quarter-over-quarter with growing volume demand in both mantle cell lymphoma and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Year-over-year Yescarta sales were up 44%. We're pleased to see the building momentum of CAR-T Cell Therapy as a treatment class with curative potential and Yescarta and Tecartus as the leading cell therapies of choice globally. More patients are getting access due to Kite's industry leading reliable manufacturing capabilities and the team's expanding footprint of authorized treatment centers around the world. And just last week, U.K's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence or NICE, recommended Yescarta for routine use in third line large B cell lymphoma. This makes Yescarta the first party available for commissioning in England. Approvals and reimbursement into additional indications that are currently available in the U.S. and other markets is expected to continue over the next year. Yescarta was recently approved for second-line LBCL in Japan, which has the potential to be the second largest cell therapy market outside of the U.S. And we look forward to the transfer of the marketing authorization to Gilead and Kite later this year. In the interim, other still early days, we'll continue to work with our partner Daiichi Sankyo to make Yescarta available to approximately 7000 patients in the second line plus setting. Kite will begin manufacturing supplies for the Japanese market through our El Segundo, California, facility. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline. Merdad? Thanks, Geoff, for your question. It's Johanna. I think that we're super excited with Sunlenca approval. Do remember, though, it's really for a very specific patient population for the heavily treatment experienced multi-drug resistant population. And so that's about 1% to 2% of people living without HIV. That's about 5,000 patients or so in the U.S. So just to give you a little bit of a perspective on it. The \u2013 that's one piece of the puzzle. So far, so we just launched. So it's still early days and we're excited about it. And I think physicians' response has been very strong as well. The -- I think they really see the innovation of having something every 6 months coming in and also the promise of what it could mean in future with prevention indication as well as treatment combination. So more to come on that one. I think it's an incredible opportunity for us to gain awareness for Sunlenca. How to use it the reimbursement systems. And as to your point about pre-COVID to COVID, I think that actually, we've really normalized the market. I think we're back on track, when it comes to HIV, both screening, diagnosis, et cetera, and treatment. So we do believe that, that's probably not in play as we go forward in 2023. But again, small revenue, huge unmet medical need, and an incredible opportunity for patients to have something to ensure that they don't proceed to more like Aids disease versus just saying HIV positive. Sure, Chris. It's Johanna. Yes. So definitely, we've changed a little bit. Our position on this one has evolved from 2020 to where we are today, obviously. I think we do truly believe that the Veklury business is much more sustainable than we've ever seen before, let alone as we think about kind of where we're going with COVID-19, including the oral that Merdad can speak to. The one piece that we've seen is -- it's maybe a little bit different than some of the orals that you're referring to is One is Veklury has been part of a commercial model since October of 2020. So we haven't had such big inventory lows at the government level like some others have had. So really, what you see probably 85% to 90% of revenues in 2022 are truly reflecting the demand for Veklury in 2022. And so therefore, coming into 2023, we feel very strongly that Veklury, because it's still the only antiviral indicated at the hospital level at this point in time because of the fact that in many countries around the world, it is the treatment of choice when they decide to treat hospitalized patients. I think there's really an incredible continuing opportunity for us to ensure that Veklury has is accessible to all these patients. And so that's why we think the model is quite sustainable moving forward. I would also just add that our label has broadened over the last year in some. We have a very strong body of evidence, including mortality as well as we have guidelines endorsement with the NIH as well as the WHO. So all of those people all of those pieces together actually make for a strong Veklury color position in 2023, but actually and beyond. And maybe I'll just pass it over to Merdad to talk a little bit to how we're thinking about COVID-19 as a whole with the oral."

            "name": "Christi Shaw",
            "content": "Hey there Simon, it's Christi. Thank you for the question. So we think it's very important because first of all, it's the number of patients is still very similar at 450, but the process by which patients get approved, obviously should be much smoother and really giving access to -- this recommendation really helps patients get access much more quickly. And so to your point, we do think as you see this approval that this hopefully, will have an influence on other countries, just like we saw with reimbursement as we look at the reimbursement of Yescarta in over 20 countries, it was one at a time. And as certain countries starting to improve. We saw the other countries also do the same. So based on the second-line ZUMA-7 trial as well, that will be our next step, too to continue to provide the data that giving a patient a onetime treatment can really help the health care system and improve patient outcomes. So yes, we're very hopeful that it could have some influence. Sure. So that was our focus and has been our focus is really on the supply side and being able to ensure that we have the capacity to provide for patients. I think that's what you're seeing is our industry-leading manufacturing piece. And if you look at GCFO3 here in California, adding the new site to TCFO-4 in Amsterdam and in TCFO-5 in Maryland, we're really able to leverage that footprint to grow not only in the assets that we have today, but in future pipeline, especially as we look at the partnership we have now with our select to multiple myeloma. So we're very confident about our ability to supply and the capacity that we've built and today and for tomorrow. And really the next focus for us is we've had some really good gains on our margin improvements. But as we look at our operational -- our optimization of our manufacturing footprint. Yes, we need to continue to ensure the capacity, which we feel like we've really done. And now we're able to put a big focus too on the optimization piece, which we've made progress on but we have several levers there to pull as well. So I hope you're hearing from me a big confidence in our ability to deliver for patients from a capacity standpoint."

My name is Amber, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to our host, Jacquie Ross, VP of Investor Relations. Jacquie, please proceed.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the third quarter of 2022. The press release, slides, and supplementary data are available on the investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today\u2019s call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O\u2019Day, our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier, our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey, and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we\u2019ll open up the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Christi Shaw, the Chief Executive Officer of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward\u2010looking statements, including those related to Gilead\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations; plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections and the use of capital; and 2022 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.

The GAAP to non\u2010GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet, as well as on the Gilead website. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dan.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everybody. We\u2019re pleased to connect with all of you today to share the details of another very strong quarter. Thanks to strong commercial and clinical execution by our teams, the positive momentum continues to build. Total product sales excluding Veklury were $6.1 billion, growing 6% sequentially and 11% year\u2010over\u2010year. The total including Veklury was $7 billion. If we exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the tail\u2010end of the loss of exclusivity for Truvada and Atripla in HIV, total product sales excluding Veklury grew 15% from the third quarter of last year. The majority of this growth was driven by HIV and over 40% of the $620 million increase in sales came from oncology. The team will share more details, but this has been a great quarter for commercial execution, including: continued share gains for Biktarvy, growing momentum for Trodelvy, another impressive quarter for cell therapy, and a strong quarter for Veklury. We also saw continued clinical momentum this quarter. Some of the highlights include: the FDA priority review granted to Trodelvy for late line HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, the EU approvals for Yescarta for second line relapsed and refractory Large B\u2010Cell Lymphoma, and Tecartus in adult Acute Lymphoblastic Lymphoma, and in virology, lenacapavir received its first regulatory approval, in Europe. Marketed as Sunlenca, it is approved for heavily\u2010treatment experienced people living with multi\u2010drug resistant HIV, making it the first approved capsid inhibitor and the first therapy with a six\u2010month dosing schedule for HIV treatment. We are taking multiple important steps to advance our ambitious clinical pipeline, including: in oncology, we are expanding our lung program, with 8 trials now active, and 3 more planned to start in the coming months; we plan to resume our phase two trial investigating a once\u2010weekly oral combination of Merck\u2019s islatravir and our lenacapavir. This will be one of many ongoing combination studies we have for long\u2010acting HIV treatment, in addition to our extensive program for prevention; and we continue to further strengthen our early\u2010stage portfolio, adding a BTLA agonist for inflammation from MiroBio and an option for a bispecific antibody for oncology from MacroGenics. Moving to our clinical goals for 2022 on slide 5, we\u2019re on track to start the 2 remaining Phase 3 trials, namely EVOKE\u201003 for first line non\u2010small cell lung cancer and ZUMA\u201023 for first line high risk LBCL. We continue to expect another interim readout for the Phase 2 ARC\u20107 study in first line non\u2010small cell lung cancer before the end of the year. Overall, this has been another very strong quarter in a very strong year for Gilead. We\u2019re seeing impressive growth of our base business with continued share gains for Biktarvy, an excellent performance for cell therapy and growing demand for Trodelvy. On the clinical side, we\u2019ve had the first approval for lenacapavir, a foundational asset for the future of our HIV franchise. Trodelvy is now under priority review for HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer in the U.S. and we\u2019re executing on an extensive development program across virology, oncology and inflammation. Finally, the recent TAF settlement is expected to significantly extend the exclusivity of key components of our HIV franchise in the U.S. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank the Gilead and Kite teams for their outstanding clinical and commercial execution. This consistent execution of our strategy, along with a very robust portfolio has led to some terrific progress in 2022 and we look forward to building on that momentum through the rest of the year and beyond. With that, I\u2019ll invite Johanna to share an update on our third quarter commercial performance.\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I jump into the commercial results for the third quarter, I wanted to begin by acknowledging our teams for another exceptional quarter. We\u2019re making important progress in our goals of ensuring the strength and sustainability of our virology franchise, while also continuing to build our expertise and market presence in oncology. Turning to slide 7, we had a very strong quarter with total product sales excluding Veklury of $6.1 billion, up 11% year\u2010over\u2010year, or 15% excluding FX and the residual impact of the HIV LOEs, with growth in each of our core franchise areas, and notable strength in HIV and oncology. Sequentially, total product sales excluding Veklury grew 6%, driven by HIV, HCV, and oncology. Growth excluding FX impact and the LOEs was 8%. On slide 8, HIV sales of $4.5 billion were up 7% year\u2010over\u2010year. Excluding the impact of both FX and the LOEs, HIV revenue grew 10% year\u2010over\u2010year. Similar to last quarter, this was primarily channel mix driven by U.S. government utilization leading to higher average realized price, in addition to higher demand. Overall, despite the quarter\u2010over\u2010quarter shifts in average realized price, government plans continue to represent approximately 60% of our U.S. HIV treatment prescriptions, including Medicare in the low\u201020s. HIV revenue growth was driven by the U.S., while Europe was down year\u2010over\u2010year, due to FX and less favorable pricing dynamics, offset in part by higher demand. Quarter\u2010over\u2010quarter, HIV sales were up 6%, similarly driven by channel mix and inventory dynamics, as well as higher demand. Turning to the market more broadly, we are encouraged that on a year-over-year basis, the HIV treatment market across the U.S. and Europe has grown for five consecutive quarters. This reflects the work we have been doing with our partners to bring people living with HIV and people at risk of HIV back into care following the pandemic. The market growth we are seeing suggests that activity has returned to pre\u2010COVID trends. In the third quarter of 2022, the market grew 2% year\u2010over\u2010year both in the U.S. and Europe. Looking forward, we continue to expect annual treatment market growth in the 2% to 3% range. Descovy sales were $500 million, up 16% year\u2010over\u2010year and 9% sequentially, and PrEP market share remains stable despite generic and other entrants. For the quarter, the PrEP market continues to demonstrate robust growth, largely driven by the growing awareness for PrEP and demand well\u2010above pre\u2010pandemic levels. Overall, the PrEP market grew 19% year\u2010over\u2010year and 6% sequentially. Onto slide 9. Third quarter Biktarvy sales were $2.8 billion, up 22% year\u2010over\u2010year, driven by higher demand in both the U.S. and Europe, and favorable pricing dynamics. Sequentially, sales were up 8%, due to higher demand as well as favorable inventory and pricing dynamics. Once again, Biktarvy continues to command a leading position in the treatment of HIV, with another record quarter growing to 45% market share in the U.S., up 4 percentage points year\u2010over\u2010year. Moreover, Biktarvy remains the leading medicine for those seeking to switch to a new regimen in the U.S. as well as those starting treatment in both the U.S. and Europe, most notably, capturing 10 new starts for every 1 person prescribed another medicine in the U.S. Looking to the fourth quarter, I\u2019d like to call out a few points. First, given the historic trend towards a significant inventory build in the fourth quarter followed by inventory draw down in the first quarter, we are renewing our focus on inventory management in an effort to better align the timing of product delivery with end\u2010user demand. Second, while we continue to see strong market share gains for Biktarvy in addition to solid growth in both the treatment and prevention markets, we will remind you that some of our second and third quarter performance has been driven by shifts in channel mix that have had a favorable impact on average realized price. Given the favorable trends we observed over the last two quarters we do expect the channel mix to be more stable in the fourth quarter. With these factors in mind, and also allowing for further FX impact, we expect fourth quarter HIV sales to be roughly flat on a sequential basis, noting that full year 2022 HIV growth is therefore expected to be approximately 4%, or 7% excluding the LOEs and FX headwinds year to date. In summary, we\u2019re extremely proud of the portfolio we have built in HIV and excited about the way Gilead is positioned for 2023 and beyond. Specifically, Biktarvy\u2019s clinical profile continues to impress, evidenced by ongoing, strong growth rates even though its annual revenue run rate is now in excess of $10 billion. Descovy for PrEP, maintained over 40% market share despite competition and generic entrants. And most recently lenacapavir\u2019s approval as Sunlenca for heavily treatment experienced people living with multi\u2010drug resistant HIV in the EU. This is an important option for a group that has few treatment options, and is a great opportunity for physicians and the HIV community to get more familiar with a six monthly, subcutaneous HIV therapy. We believe this sets the stage well for our other planned lenacapavir\u2010based treatment and prevention regimens. All of this, combined with, the treatment and prevention markets showing solid recovery; the impact of the loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla now behind us; and the recent TAF settlement extending projected U.S. LOEs for Descovy and Odefsey into the early 2030s, and Genvoya\u2019s patent to 2029 in the U.S. All of this truly underpins our confidence that Gilead is well\u2010positioned for growth and continued leadership in the HIV market. Now onto slide 10. HCV sales for the third quarter were $524 million, up 22% year\u2010over\u2010year and 17% sequentially, primarily due to the favorable resolution of a prior year rebate claim in Europe and other favorable pricing dynamics in the U.S. Offsetting these benefits, there were fewer patient starts in both the U.S. and Europe, consistent with our expectations for both the quarter and the general trend that you should expect in HCV going forward. Despite the trend in patients starts, we\u2019re pleased to maintain HCV market share of more than 50% in both the U.S. and Europe, and third quarter share increased on a year\u2010over\u2010year basis. For HBV and HDV on slide 11, sales were up 7% year\u2010over\u2010year and 13% quarter\u2010over\u2010quarter, primarily driven by favorable inventory dynamics. Moving to Veklury on slide 12, third quarter revenues were $925 million. As expected, sales were down year\u2010over\u2010year given lower U.S. hospitalizations as compared to the same period last year. Indeed, though hospitalizations are below the peak seen at the start of the year, it\u2019s clear with the sequential increase that the path of the pandemic remains difficult to predict. Nonetheless, we\u2019re proud of the role Veklury continues to play in the fight against COVID\u201019. In the U.S., Veklury is used in approximately 60% of hospitalized patients who are being treated for COVID. And outside the U.S., Veklury\u2019s benefit to patients continues to be recognized by health authorities including the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency, based in part on the PINETREE data which demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalization after a three\u2010day IV treatment in the outpatient setting. These factors continue to support Veklury utilization where it is needed. Moving to Oncology, and beginning with Trodelvy on slide 13. Sales of $180 million grew 78% year\u2010 over\u2010year and 13% quarter\u2010over quarter, and we continue to work with regulators, payers and clinicians around the world to broaden access. Since its approval in second line metastatic TNBC late last year in Europe, Trodelvy is now reimbursed in 13 countries outside the U.S., with additional markets in Europe and elsewhere expected to come on line shortly. We\u2019ve also begun work on establishing the right infrastructure to support a potential launch into pretreated HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Reinforcing the significant unmet need in this population, and the clinically meaningful overall survival data demonstrated in the Phase 3 TROPiCS\u201002 study, FDA has accepted our supplemental Biologics License Application as Priority Review and we look to a decision in February of next year. We\u2019re excited by the potential for many more patients to benefit from Trodelvy. Now onto slide 14, and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, I\u2019m pleased to share that Cell Therapy sales in the third quarter were $398 million, up 79% year\u2010over\u2010year and up 8% sequentially. These strong results were driven by continued growth in large B\u2010cell lymphoma and Kite\u2019s ability to reliably meet customer demand. Together with our recently FDA\u2010approved viral vector manufacturing facility in Oceanside, Kite remains well\u2010positioned to ensure clinical and commercial supply availability while it continues to execute on its geographic expansion. For the quarter, Yescarta sales of $317 million were up 81% year\u2010over\u2010year and 8% quarter\u2010over\u2010 quarter, driven by a continued successful launch in second\u2010line LBCL in the U.S. and partially offset by FX headwinds in Europe. Just last week, Yescarta was approved in the EU for second\u2010line LBCL and we look forward to launching there in the months ahead. Tecartus grew 72% year\u2010over\u2010year to deliver $81 million in sales, driven by growth in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In early September, the European Marketing Authorization for Tecartus in relapsed or refractory ALL was granted. We continue to broaden awareness and access to our cell therapies through indication and Authorized Treatment Center expansion in existing markets as well as through geographic expansion, as demonstrated by our most recent regulatory applications in Brazil, Singapore, and Saudi Arabia. As always, Christi is available for Q&A later on the call. Overall, this was an incredibly strong quarter for Gilead oncology, with revenue of $578 million up 10% from last quarter and 79% from last year. This represents an almost $2.4 billion annual run rate as we move into the last few months of 2022, and hints at the possibilities ahead as we continue to execute on our commercial and clinical oncology goals. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline.\nMerdad Parsey: Thank you, Johanna. Before I start, I\u2019d like to recognize the strong execution of our internal team and external partners across a broad range of activities that\u2019s diversified across therapeutic area and clinical stage with milestones spanning study initiations, the sBLA submission for Trodelvy, two EC approvals in cell therapy, and our first approval for lenacapavir in the EU. On slide 16, you can see that we\u2019ve made a lot of progress so far this year, meeting nearly all our milestones. Regarding our BLA filing for Hepcludex, we received a Complete Response Letter from FDA, citing concerns about the manufacture and delivery of Hepcludex. We will take the time to fully digest the CRL, but note that no new safety or efficacy clinical trials were requested by the FDA. We plan to resubmit as quickly as possible and will work with the agency on the path forward. We remain confident in bulevirtide and the potential benefits it can bring to people living with HDV, and will share an update on the U.S. regulatory pathway when we can. Moving onto HIV on slide 17. We\u2019re thrilled that lenacapavir received its first marketing authorization from the European Commission as Sunlenca for people living with multi\u2010drug resistant HIV, in combination with other antiretrovirals. Sunlenca is a first\u2010in\u2010class capsid inhibitor. It is the first and only twice\u2010yearly, subcutaneous HIV treatment and adds a much\u2010needed option for those people living with HIV with limited alternatives. We continue to expect a decision on our NDA for lenacapavir from FDA in late December of this year. In the meantime, this first regulatory approval from the EC is an important validation while we continue to progress our other lenacapavir\u2010based treatment and prevention programs. For HIV treatment, a new clinical development plan allowing a lower dose of islatravir, Merck\u2019s investigational NRTTI, is moving forward after FDA review. As such, we are planning to resume the Phase 2 trial investigating an oral, once\u2010weekly lenacapavir and islatravir combination. Our internal combination programs are also ongoing, and we expect to share data next year from the Phase 1b proof\u2010of\u2010concept study for lenacapavir and two broadly\u2010neutralizing antibodies, or bNAbs, directed at HIV. In prevention, our clinical development continues to progress with four in\u2010process or planned clinical trials evaluating every six\u2010month subcutaneous lenacapavir. Moving to slide 18, Veklury continues to be recognized as a standard of care for patients with severe COVID\u201019, with updated guidelines for Veklury from the World Health Organization. Additionally, the CHMP issued a positive opinion on the use of Veklury for the treatment of pediatric patients with COVID\u201019. Although novel treatments and vaccinations have improved the COVID\u201019 outlook, there is a continued need for effective and convenient oral treatment options for patients. I am pleased to share that the FDA has just granted our novel oral nucleoside, GS\u20105245, Fast Track Designation, which aims to expedite development of promising new medicines. We continue to be in active discussions with the FDA and other global regulators on potential clinical pathways including a Phase 3 study that we expect to start within the next several months, either globally or outside the U.S. On slide 19, we show the Phase 3 TROPiCS\u201002 results in patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer that was a late breaking presentation at ESMO in September. Trodelvy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 3.2\u2010month overall survival benefit. Patients with metastatic HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer who have progressed on endocrine\u2010based therapies and chemotherapy have limited options. As a reminder, the patients enrolled in TROPiCS\u201002 were heavily pre\u2010treated with a median of three prior chemotherapy regimens in addition to prior CDK4/6 inhibitors. Importantly, the FDA recently accepted our sBLA for Trodelvy in HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and granted it a Priority Review. The PDUFA date is currently set for February 2023. We continue to work with regulatory agencies outside the U.S. to potentially make this medicine available to eligible patients. Additionally, following the acquisition of Trodelvy\u2019s Asian commercialization and development rights from Everest Medicines, we expect data from our Phase 3 metastatic TNBC China bridging trial in the next few months and our Phase 3 Asian HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer study in mid\u20102023. Moving to lung cancer on slide 20, you can see that we expect to have at least 9 active clinical trials in non\u2010small cell lung cancer by the end of 2022, including 5 with Trodelvy, as well as programs with zimberelimab, domvanalimab and etruma, Merck\u2019s Keytruda, AstraZeneca\u2019s durvalumab, and our own magrolimab. Eight trials are already underway, including the Phase 3 EVOKE\u201001 study in second to third line non\u2010small cell lung cancer and our Phase 2 EVOKE\u201002 study in first line non\u2010small cell lung cancer without actionable mutations. Our partner Merck also plans to initiate the Phase 3 EVOKE\u201003 study later this year to evaluate the combination of Trodelvy and Keytruda in first\u2010line patients with non\u2010small cell lung cancer whose tumors express high levels of PD\u2010L1. Additionally, with our partner Arcus, we\u2019re looking forward to the fourth interim analysis of the Phase 2 ARC\u20107 trial evaluating zim and dom in PD\u2010L1\u2010high non\u2010small cell lung cancer before the end of the year. Data from ARC\u20107 are expected to support our ongoing Phase 3 studies for dom\u2010based combinations in lung cancer, including STAR\u2010121 which just achieved first patient in. Lung cancer is a disease area with high unmet need, and we believe we have multiple promising MOAs and potential combinations that could help bring additional new treatment options to patients. To explore these opportunities, we plan to initiate two Phase 2 signal seeking platform studies, VELOCITY and the Arcus\u2010led EDGE\u2010lung in the coming months. Overall, we have initiated a comprehensive evaluation of the assets in our portfolio to address the significant unmet need in lung cancer, and look forward to sharing updates in the coming years. Moving to slide 21, and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, we are highlighting our expanding clinical pipeline as we build on the growing momentum and adoption of cell therapy based on the significant survival benefit that Yescarta and Tecartus are delivering to patients. We believe there are still opportunities to bring Yescarta and Tecartus to more patients by moving into earlier lines as well as new indications. As you can see, we have recently enrolled patients in several studies, including ZUMA\u201024, a Phase 2 study to evaluate Yescarta in an outpatient setting for second line LBCL, and ZUMA\u201022, a Phase 3 study for Yescarta in second line plus high\u2010risk follicular lymphoma. We also expect to begin screening patients for the ZUMA\u201023 study of Yescarta in Q4. The decision to initiate a Phase 3 trial in first line HR LBCL was based on the encouraging data from ZUMA\u201012, where Yescarta demonstrated 89% ORR and 78% CR. Additional studies include an evaluation of Tecartus in rare B\u2010cell malignancies, and KITE\u2010363 that\u2019s evaluating a CD19/20 bicistronic CAR T in post\u2010CD19 third line plus LBCL. We are committed to continuously improving the safety and efficacy of our cell therapies through both internal pipeline and external partnerships. On slide 22, we turn to hematology and highlight the breadth of our programs across MDS and AML. For magrolimab, we fully enrolled our Phase 3 ENHANCE study in MDS ahead of schedule. Our discussions with the FDA and other regulators continue, and we expect to share an update in early 2023. Moreover, enrollment for the two AML trials, ENHANCE\u20102 and \u20103, is well underway and we are targeting topline data in 2024. A few weeks ago, we announced our oncology collaboration with MacroGenics to develop bispecific antibodies. This includes the exclusive option to license MGD024, a bispecific antibody that binds to CD123 and CD3, currently in Phase 1, as well as 2 additional research programs. This complements magrolimab, and furthers our work as we explore therapies that could translate into better clinical outcomes for patients with AML and MDS. Finally, we were pleased FDA granted KITE\u2010222 orphan drug designation at the end of September. It\u2019s the first CLL\u20101 targeted CAR T and is currently enrolling patients in a Phase 1 study. On slide 23, I wanted to take a moment to welcome MiroBio to Gilead. We completed the acquisition a few weeks ago and are pleased to add the MiroBio team to the Gilead research family, and bring their proprietary discovery platform and immune inhibitory receptor agonists to our portfolio. This acquisition complements our inflammatory disease cornerstones including IBD, RA and systemic lupus and opens opportunities in other indications. We are excited to continue to explore and develop these antibody agonists, which we believe have the potential to induce immunosuppressive signaling and restore tolerance in autoimmunity. Wrapping up, I\u2019ll note that we now have 60 clinical programs underway here at Gilead, spanning a broad range of indications across virology, oncology and inflammation. We\u2019ve accomplished a lot in 2022, and yet feel we\u2019re really just getting started in exploring the possibilities offered by our portfolio. With that, Andy?\nAndrew Dickinson: Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon everyone. We\u2019re pleased to share another strong quarter of results, with sequential and year\u2010over\u2010year growth in every franchise across our core business. As shown on slide 25, product sales, excluding Veklury, grew 11% year\u2010over\u2010year, despite a $130 million headwind from FX. If we exclude this FX impact, in addition to the impact of previous HIV LOEs, total underlying sales growth year\u2010over\u2010year was 15%. Moving to slide 26, you can see that Veklury was down, as expected, year-over-year, although it more than doubled on a sequential basis from the second quarter. I\u2019ll note that with the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, the total FX impact on revenue, net of hedges, was higher than expected, at approximately $200 million compared to the third quarter of last year. Non\u2010GAAP product gross margin was 87%, down 320 basis points from last year, primarily due to the third quarter 2021 reversal of a previously recorded litigation reserve. Additionally, non\u2010GAAP product gross margin was impacted by higher Biktarvy\u2010related royalty expense and lower Veklury sales. Non\u2010 GAAP product gross margin improved sequentially due to higher HIV and Veklury product sales. Non\u2010GAAP R&D, excluding acquired IPR&D expenses was $1.2 billion, up 10% year\u2010over\u2010year, primarily due to investments in Oncology. Sequentially, R&D excluding acquired IPR&D expenses was up 6% driven by investments in Oncology and COVID treatments. Acquired IPR&D, reflecting acquisitions, milestones and upfront payments for the quarter was $448 million and includes $389 million of expense related to the MiroBio acquisition. Non\u2010GAAP SG&A was $1.2 billion, up 3% year\u2010over\u2010year. Non\u2010GAAP operating margin was 47%, down year\u2010over\u2010year and driven primarily by higher Acquired IPR&D expenses and lower Veklury sales. Sequentially, non\u2010GAAP operating margin increased 400 basis points due to higher HIV and Veklury sales, partially offset by higher acquired IPR&D expenses. Non\u2010GAAP effective tax in the third quarter was 22.4%, higher than normal due to the non\u2010deductibility of the upfront MiroBio payment. Overall, our non\u2010GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.90 in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $2.65 for the same period last year. Of note, the MiroBio transaction impacted post\u2010tax EPS by $0.31 a share, and this was not reflected in the full year guidance we shared back in August. On slide 27, we take a quick look at our performance year\u2010to\u2010date, which shows total product sales excluding Veklury of $16.7 billion, up 7% year\u2010over\u2010year. If we exclude the approximately $385 million of FX headwinds year\u2010to\u2010date as compared to the same period last year, in addition to the impact of the HIV LOEs, the underlying growth year\u2010to\u2010date is 11%. Veklury, as expected, is down year\u2010to\u2010date, highlighting the lower demand for COVID\u201019 treatments in this stage of the pandemic. Moving to slide 28, we are increasing our full year sales guidance to reflect our year\u2010to\u2010date results and our expectations for Q4, including our latest view of FX. For Revenues, we now expect total product sales of $25.9 billion to $26.2 billion, up from our previous range of $24.5 billion to $25.0 billion. This reflects the strong performance year\u2010to\u2010date, notably very strong growth in HIV, Veklury, and cell therapy, and incorporates our expectations for the broader macro environment, including FX which will, once again, be a headwind in the fourth quarter. In HIV, as Johanna discussed, we expect HIV revenue in Q4 to be roughly flat on a sequential basis. In cell therapy, we expect slower growth on a sequential basis, primarily due to stabilizing demand following the second line LBCL launch and FX headwinds. Additionally, we are taking a cautious view with regards to both the current shortage of fludarabine which we expect to be partially mitigated later in the fourth quarter, and to the competitive landscape as our peers improve their manufacturing reliability. Moving to Veklury, and with year\u2010to\u2010date revenue of $2.9 billion, we are increasing our expectations to approximately $3.4 billion for the full year. Note that we expect Veklury sales to continue to track hospitalization rates and our guidance assumes no significant increase in hospitalization rates from the third quarter levels. Excluding Veklury, we expect our total product sales to be $22.5 billion to $22.8 billion, representing growth of 5% to 6% year\u2010over year, compared to our prior range of $22.0 billion to $22.5 billion. As for the rest of the non\u2010GAAP P&L, product gross margin is now expected to be in the 86% to 87% range, compared to our prior guidance of approximately 85% to 86%. There is no change to our R&D guidance, where we expect full year R&D expense to increase by a mid\u2010single-digit percentage compared to the 2021 baseline of $4.5 billion. Moving to acquired IPR&D, we are not issuing guidance for the full year and similar to what we did with MiroBio this quarter we\u2019ll update our EPS guidance quarterly as needed to reflect any relevant activity during the quarter. What we have included here is the year\u2010to\u2010date acquired IPR&D amount, including approximately $0.04 per share associated with the MacroGenics collaboration that we announced last week. The guidance shared today does not include any upfront payments related to normal course of business partnerships or licensing deals that we might close in the fourth quarter. For SG\u2022&A, with our continued investment across our commercial organization, and expectations for higher costs as a result of inflation, we continue to expect SG&A expenses to grow by a low single digit percentage compared to 2021. Altogether, we expect operating income to be $11.8 billion to $12.2 billion for the full\u2010year, up from $11 billion to $11.6 billion previously. And finally, we now expect our non\u2010GAAP diluted earnings per share to range between $6.95 to $7.15 per share, up from $6.35 to $6.75 previously. This EPS guidance range is approaching our 2021 non\u2010GAAP EPS results, despite an expected $2.2 billion decline in Veklury revenue, and more than half a billion dollars in total FX headwinds anticipated through the end of the year, as compared to 2021 rates. This highlights the strength of our core business, which is now expected to grow in the 5% to 6% range in 2022. On a GAAP basis, we expect our diluted earnings per share to range between $3.35 and $3.55 per share, compared to $2.90 and $3.30 per share previously. Finally, on slide 29, you can see that there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. In the quarter, we returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders, including $928 million in dividend payments and $180 million in share repurchases. As we announced previously, we repaid $1 billion of debt early in the third quarter and have returned to the same debt level we were at prior to the Immunomedics acquisition. With that, I\u2019ll invite the operator to open the Q&A. With that, I\u2019ll invite the operator to open the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Schott with JPM.\nChristopher Schott: My question was on lenacapavir and in treatment. So, I want to talk a little bit about, maybe first, islatravir and the lift of the clinical hold. How interesting is that as a partnered asset relative to your internal programs? And then the second part of that, just a bigger picture one in treatment. Do you see the portfolio with lenacapavir resulting in, I guess, a number of different combos that serve different segments of the market, or is it more likely you\u2019re going to end up with one of these combos that really separates from the other and becomes an anchor type asset like we see with Biktarvy?\nMerdad Parsey: Hi Chris, this is Merdad. Let me first start by saying that we are really excited about the recent approval for lenacapavir in this -- in the highly treatment-experienced population. Obviously, that\u2019s a group of people who have limited options, and I think lenacapavir as a new class provides a new opportunity for them. In terms of islatravir, what we like about islatravir is that it is fairly late in its development. We are able to be in Phase 2 with that. And I think it provides us a relatively near-term opportunity to launch a partner in treatment for lenacapavir that could be given in a long-acting way. And I think that\u2019s really important in terms of where the market is going and what our goal is in terms of, as we\u2019ve said before, providing a long-acting parenteral option that is longer than in the 3 months or longer time frame. And we\u2019re optimistic about our ability to do that. So for that, we have our internal pipeline assets that are really providing our options there. For islatravir, that\u2019s part of our oral program. And for us, we do think that we have a number of opportunities in terms of oral programs to provide weekly oral treatment options for people using lenacapavir. And right now is a potential certainly islatravir is an option there, and we have other options in our pipeline that could potentially get that -- get to that level. So, the way I look at it, just to answer directly your last question, we do think that there will be a lenacapavir partner, and there will be probably one partner that will achieve our therapeutic goals in oral, potentially a different partner in parenteral. And as we go forward, if we can make improvements whether that\u2019s lenacapavir and being able to provide even longer than six-month therapy or to the partner that we could extend the duration of therapy with a different molecule or a different formulation, we\u2019ll always try to get to that longer exposure. So over time, I expect us to continue to try to innovate and move forward.\nJohanna Mercier: So maybe just to add to that, Chris, in light of what Merdad was just referring to, we\u2019ve done a lot of patient market research to really understand the segments within the oral market, but also with the long-acting market, specifically in treatment, which is quite different to your point, to prevention. And in the treatment setting, it is clear that you will always have a market for that daily oral, which we believe Biktarvy has really set the standard there. And then there are others that the weekly oral will be more preferred. Some people just want to make sure they\u2019re taking something every single day. Others don\u2019t want to be reminded that they have HIV. And then you have, obviously, the injectables or the subQ with lenacapavir combinations every 3 months or potentially even every 6 months that will be very appealing to some that don\u2019t want to be reminded at all. And so those are kind of the segments we\u2019re trying to play out. So, I do think as a long acting, there will be more of a split segment than we\u2019ve seen in the daily oral.\nJacquie Ross: Amber, you ready for the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.\nSalveen Richter: On the TIGIT program, what is the likelihood that we\u2019ll see PFS data at this point? And if we don\u2019t, when could that come? And then based on the interim updates, it does seem like you already have clear benefit on ORR at least on the doublet arm versus monotherapy. So, would love to see if you could just walk us through the possible scenarios with this data readout? And if there\u2019s any outcome that could impact the recently initiated Phase 3 studies.\nMerdad Parsey: Salveen, this is Merdad again. Yes, maybe I\u2019ll start by saying that really, nothing has really changed in terms of the ARC-7 study and where we\u2019re headed. And the reminder make is that this is going to be the fourth interim analysis for the ongoing Phase 2 study and enrollment was only recently completed over the summer. And so, when we look at that, if you think about it in that context, to your point, we continue to look for consistency in the dom and zim combination as a doublet in the ORR to bolster our ongoing Phase 3 program, right, just to underline our confidence in the TIGIT and dom combination. Based on the data we\u2019ve seen already, and this should continue to support that. In terms of PFS, I think PFS is -- as I tried to allude to, given the fact that enrollment went on until fairly recently, the likelihood is that PFS is going to be fairly immature and may not be informative. And certainly, when we think about the triplet there as well, it\u2019s unlikely that PFS is going to be informative, but it may be. And so, we\u2019ll look at that, and our plan is to evaluate the data and then decide with our partners at Arcus what the data and how we approach it. And certainly, as we\u2019ve said before, making sure that we are sharing the data at a medical conference next year. And exactly to your point, it\u2019s really about confirming the confidence we already have in TIGIT and moving into Phase 3 with our -- with the lead programs that we\u2019re moving with. So, I hope that answers your question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC.\nBrian Abrahams: Congrats on the quarter. And thanks for taking my question. A question on Trodelvy. With the maturing TROPiCS-02 overall survival data and the evolving competitive landscape, I\u2019m curious on your latest views on where you see Trodelvy fitting in, in the HR-positive/HER2-negative population. Any updates on market research on how it might be used, your commercial strategy to align with that? And curious also your latest expectations on how effective it could be post in HER2 in certain patients who may receive that first? Thanks.\nJohanna Mercier: Hi Brian, it\u2019s Johanna. Thanks for the question. So basically, let me start by saying with Trodelvy, the performance for the quarter has been really strong. We\u2019re seeing 78% year-on-year growth, 13% quarter-over-quarter. And we\u2019re seeing markets add in every week basically. And reimbursement kind of playing out. We have now over 13 countries ex U.S. that have gotten reimbursement. So, we\u2019re seeing really strong launches namely France, Germany right now and other markets coming in as we\u2019re speaking. So, strong foundations there. I think having OS data in both triple-negative breast cancer as well as now with TROPiCS-02 in the HR-positive/HER2-negative, patient population really helps the foundation for Trodelvy but really helps across breast cancer. To your specific question around kind of where do we position ourselves, obviously, with TROPiCS-02, we\u2019re in previously treated -- heavily-treated lines of therapy, right, when you think about this patient population, so a little bit different than some of our competitors. And so, we\u2019re excited actually because these patients have very limited options. And so, now with Trodelvy, there is a real potential for overall survival in these late-line patients. So, we do think that as we\u2019re playing it out, as we\u2019re doing our market research, we feel very confident that Trodelvy will be very well positioned in the marketplace, and we\u2019ll build on the success that we\u2019ve seen thus far in triple-negative breast cancer as well in how we\u2019re playing that out. So, we expect continued momentum in our base business. And I might have mentioned before in one of the previous calls, how we\u2019ve expanded our footprint, specifically in the U.S. to prepare for both not only the expansion of what we need to do in triple-negative breast cancer, but also what we need to do in HR-positive. And so we\u2019re well poised to make sure that we\u2019re ready for that PDUFA date coming up in February to make sure that we\u2019re successful.\nMerdad Parsey: And maybe -- this is Merdad. Maybe I\u2019ll add to that. We\u2019re not done, right? And I think we\u2019re excited about how much we\u2019ve been able to achieve with Trodelvy so far, and you\u2019ve seen consistent positive data across tumor types. And in particular, I think, as Johanna highlighted, the late-line therapy, certainly, those are patients who may now -- there\u2019s a potential that some of them will be getting in HER2 beforehand. We don\u2019t have data on sequencing, but I do believe that there may be those who decide to treat for those patients who may not respond adequately to in HER2 to later lines, right? So that\u2019s kind of where, certainly, there\u2019s an opportunity there. The other thing I would add is that we\u2019ve got really strong data in triple-negative breast, including the HER2 -- sorry, in HR-positive breast cancer, including the HER2 zero population. And I think that\u2019s a very important distinction and really important to remember. And then finally, based on what we\u2019ve seen so far and the clinical benefit we\u2019ve brought, we certainly believe that there\u2019s an opportunity for us to move to earlier lines of therapy as well in breast cancer in triple negative, in HR-positive and in other tumor types. I think that\u2019s -- our excitement about Trodelvy has always been the ability to go into broad tumor types, and our strategy has always been to advance into earlier lines of therapy as we generate positive data.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies.\nMichael Yee: Congrats on a great quarter. I also wanted to ask Merdad a question on Trodelvy in lung cancer. I mean I would think that this is an even bigger opportunity than breast cancer on EVOKE-01 which is ongoing. Can you confirm you think you would update next year and how you think about that opportunity versus second-line docetaxel? I know there\u2019s some early response rates based on the basket study when you acquired Immunomedics. And I was wondering if you had more data in lung cancer that you\u2019ve been observing to give you more confidence there? And then you commented on EVOKE-02 and EVOKE-03, which is first line. I just wanted to understand if you think we would update on EVOKE-02 next year. I would think that\u2019s pretty big trying to replace chemo. So maybe comment on EVOKE-01 and EVOKE-02. Thank you.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes, Michael, Merdad, thanks for the question. I think just to follow on, it\u2019s a great follow-on to the prior question around our ability to really look across tumor types and earlier lines. And in particular, I think what you\u2019re referencing is our confidence in going into early line lung cancer and starting those studies. To your point, we\u2019ve seen data, as you know, very well from our early Phase 1b study in lung cancer. And we continue to enroll and we\u2019ve initiated now studies looking at both the second- and third-line setting and we -- and then as well as in the frontline setting. As you know, we\u2019re doing a study in combination with EVOKE-03 [ph] with the PD-1 and the PD-L1 high population, which I think is really an important trial for us to proceed on. So, I think what I would say is that the timing of the data, Michael, is always difficult to predict. We have to see how the study enrollment goes, and it\u2019s early days. But we\u2019re really excited about the opportunity to bring a meaningful therapy to a group with a very high unmet need.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Skorney with Baird.\nBrian Skorney: Maybe perhaps for Merdad, just kind of jumping off on the long-acting HIV discussion. I noticed in the pipeline slides, long-acting bictegravir has been removed from the pipeline. Obviously, it would have been nice to have a known entity like the bictegravir part of the combo. I was just wondering maybe you could give us any insight to what happened in the Phase 1 there? Is it sort of bictegravir missing a PK threshold, or is it something that you\u2019re seeing with the 6212 or 5894 that gives you more confidence there? Thanks.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes. Thanks for the question. Happy to expand on that. Yes, look, bictegravir is an amazing molecule and has done a lot for patients. And one of the opportunities we looked at is in addition to thinking about bictegravir for long-acting oral was to see if we could give it as a long-acting subcutaneous. And really, what happened is we had tolerability issues just given that molecule subcu in terms of injection site reactions. So, it\u2019s not about the molecule itself. One of the challenges of developing long-acting subcutaneous therapies is tolerability. And so, I want to make sure that it\u2019s clear that bictegravir as an oral agent continues to be a huge part of where we want to go. And then maybe just to step back to your point, the way I think about it, maybe the way to think about is from a PrEP standpoint, long-acting, we are lenacapavir, it\u2019s prep for long-acting and that -- those studies are underway, moving along nicely. From a treatment standpoint, as I mentioned earlier, lenacapavir is a huge part of our backbone therapy for us. And now, we are looking at a number of different opportunities to get to long-acting oral and long-acting parenteral. And molecules like lenacapavir don\u2019t come along every day. We are looking for a number of -- at a number of molecules. We think we have the world-class expertise in chemistry and preclinical development that gives us a leg up on the competition to get to those molecules that will really get to the need that Johanna laid out, which is to get to the subcutaneous or every three-month dosing or even longer, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Harrison: I just wanted to ask a question on 5245. Can you just talk a little bit about the range of possibilities you might be thinking about in terms of what a Phase 3 might look like? And then, just sort of where you see commercially, what sort of data you might need to compete just given the fact that it may be hard to have the same kind of data set as some of those pills that were developed earlier in the pandemic? Thanks.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Hey Matthew, Dan O\u2019Day here. So we\u2019ll have Merdad take the first part of your question, and then Johanna can feed into the second.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes. Thanks, Dan. Yes. Thanks, Matthew. So, 5245 has -- as you know, we started those trials in Phase I earlier this year. Things are going well. And as you know, the pandemic has changed a lot. And I think you make an excellent point that looking at high-risk patients is a challenge right now in looking at high-risk patients who may get hospitalized as a challenge right now, giving vaccination, other treatment options. So exactly to your point, I think the discussion we\u2019re having internally and with our regulators is what\u2019s the best population for us to establish the benefit of 5245. And how does that anticipate what might come down the road, which has been the unpredictable part, whether that is resistance to other agents, the need for combination agents, new variants that may increase the hospitalization rates. Those are all the things that we have to be prepared for. And we really see 5245 as a way -- as we move forward with that and move into clinical trials once we demonstrate its efficacy as an important tool, should the pandemic start to pick up again, heaven forbid, but that\u2019s how we think about it. So both combinations and treating resistance or a new surge.\nJohanna Mercier: Yes. So in line with that, Matthew, it\u2019s Johanna. I would just add to what Merdad is saying. So I think from a commercial standpoint, what we\u2019re thinking is the fact that it doesn\u2019t have a boosting agent is a real plus here as well as the fact that we\u2019re going to look at rebound effects as we\u2019ve seen with current marketed products right now have that issue, and so, -- in addition to the antiviral activity. So I think those pieces are kind of what we\u2019re thinking about. As well as you well know, drug-drug interactions has been a bit of an issue with some of the current agents today. So I think if you -- without the boosting agent, I think those will just open up a little bit more for a broader patient population potentially to really benefit. And as we\u2019ve seen with this pandemic, it\u2019s not over. We\u2019ve seen hospitalizations go up and down. We\u2019ve seen a little bit of an increase most recently, and we\u2019re tracking that very closely with hospitalizations, of course, because of Veklury. But we do believe that there\u2019s still opportunity for more options here to make sure that we curve this pandemic.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: And Matthew, this is Dan O\u2019Day. I\u2019ll just add one other thing in addition to my colleagues, which is in our conversations with the U.S. government, particularly the recent Fast Track designation that was applied to GS-5245, there\u2019s 3 major things that they\u2019re interested in, too. Number one is more oral antivirals; number two, to the points that both Merdad and Johanna made, working across the variance as the virus continues to mutate; and then thirdly, lack of DDI, lack of boosting and this rebound issue. So, I think it\u2019s a recognition of the fact that there is a need for the ongoing pandemic/endemic, whatever you want to call it with COVID for additional options. And I think that\u2019s expressed in the way the U.S. government wants to work closely with us as we continue to develop this program.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren with Cowen.\nTyler Van Buren: Congratulations on the results. Great quarter. I had a follow-up, a high-level question on Biktarvy. So, the product continues to see very impressive uptake, and it looks like it will be around 60% of HIV product revenues this year. So, where do you expect the product to peak out as a percentage of HIV sales over the next several years?\nJohanna Mercier: Tyler, it\u2019s Joanna. Thanks for the question. I would say that we\u2019re really proud of the Biktarvy performance, but I would say even the increased momentum that we\u2019re seeing. And this is not just in the U.S., this is really around the globe. And so, we\u2019re just about 45% market share with Biktarvy. We\u2019ve seen 4% share gain year-on-year. And now, we\u2019re looking at an annual run rate in excess of about $10 billion. So, I do think we\u2019re very well poised for the future. The -- we\u2019re looking at both the na\u00efve share, obviously, just about under 60% of that share right now with Biktarvy, so really setting the standard for new patients coming into HIV. And obviously, the switch share, and you can\u2019t -- switch share is obviously a little bit lower because you can switch to Biktarvy if you\u2019re already on Biktarvy. So therefore, we\u2019re tracking that very closely as well, but making sure that when there is opportunity, either from older drugs or when there\u2019s been some issues for patients to really come on to Biktarvy just because it really does have a profile from an efficacy standpoint and safety standpoint. So, we do believe that continued growth with Biktarvy is on the agenda. And I would also add just a little bit of a note around the market as well, which also helps, right, because where the market goes, Biktarvy goes and where Biktarvy goes, the market goes. We\u2019ve seen market stabilization actually back to pre-pandemic levels and growing at about 2% or so year-on-year, both in the U.S. as well as in Europe. And so, that also really helps our momentum continue and Biktarvy is driving that as well, of course, in a lot of our efforts. The teams have worked very closely with community partners and physicians and advocacy groups to make sure that we get patients back into clinics, back into care, both from a screening standpoint and diagnosis standpoint. Now that we\u2019re -- and you really see those numbers back to pre-pandemic. So I think we\u2019re in good place moving forward and well poised for the future to continue this leadership in HIV driven by Biktarvy.\nJacquie Ross: Amber, we\u2019ll squeeze in just two more, please. Maybe go to the next caller.\nSalveen Richter: Our next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore.\nUmer Raffat: I wanted to touch up on a slightly different topic today, and I have a two-part question for Dan and Andy. And this is on the tenofovir litigation that\u2019s been ongoing. And then I guess my question really was there\u2019s a very unusual amount of plaintiffs aggregated up in this case. And I\u2019m curious, is it something you guys are looking to take to a final judgment, or would you be open to a settlement? And that brings me to sort of the second part, Andy, how much of a legal charge have you taken on this litigation to date? Because I know you\u2019ve been doing that on the Biktarvy and other indications in litigation in the past. And is there something more significant that has to happen for a more prominent charge to show up? I ask because every company handles the accounting differently. So, I was just curious. Thank you.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Umer. Let me just start before I hand it over to Andy to say, obviously, with any litigation, we\u2019re -- we don\u2019t comment on ongoing litigation in any level of detail. I do want to emphasize the confidence we have in our overall patent portfolio in general. And maybe with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Andy to answer some more specifics of your question as well.\nAndrew Dickinson: Yes. Thanks, Dan. Hi Umer, thanks for the question. Happy to touch base on this. This is a topic, as you know, that we\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions on with the Zantac litigation. So a number of things that I can provide some background and context. So first of all, like most companies, anyone operating in the U.S., we are routinely managing a lot of different litigation matters, as you know. Many of those are from our perspective, meritless or baseless. As a matter of practice, we don\u2019t typically -- or usually comment on specific litigation cases. What I can say stepping back is that we have won or resolved the 3 material litigation -- or 3 material litigation matters over the past year, as you know, on terms that were favorable to the Company and to our shareholders, that is the Juno Kite IP litigation, the ViiV IP litigation around bictegravir, then the third was the TAF litigation with generic companies. We have an outstanding legal team, both internally and externally. And then maybe to your specific question, I mean, we have complete confidence in the merits of the defense on the ongoing product liability case. So, it is very different than the Zantac litigation case. So just to your question on the number of plaintiffs, for instance, if I remember correctly in the Zantac cases, there were 250,000 patients in our case -- I\u2019m sorry, plantiffs. There were 25,000 in ours. But the key difference is that the issues at hand here, I mean, our TDF-based products are life-saving products that really transform care for HIV. And the side effects of the products were in the label from day one. The labels in the U.S. and Europe were slightly different but the labels were there. These were well known, well disclosed potential side effects. And I think that\u2019s an important piece of it. So, it\u2019s a very different case. Zantac, as I remember correctly was taken off the market and reformulated. So I\u2019d be careful about drawing too many parallels between what you saw with Zantac and some of the companies that were affected by that in this litigation. That doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t take it seriously. We do take it very seriously. And as I said, we have a great team that\u2019s working on it. The last thing, Umer, maybe the last two things, there are a number of amicus briefs that have been filed. Those are all publicly available. This is in the California state litigation that I would encourage you to read. I think there are 4 or 5 amicus briefs that really speak to how different this cause of action is relative to what you would typically expect to see in a case. And then finally, on the charge, no, we have not taken a charge. And as I said, we feel very strongly about the merits of our case and look forward to proceeding with the litigation over the coming months and years. So good question. Thank you.\nJacquie Ross: Amber, may we go to our last question, please?\nOperator: Our last question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: Merdad, I want to follow up on a few questions that you\u2019ve gotten on long-acting HIV. I know it\u2019s been tricky to develop a doublet that has a comparable profile to lenacapavir, but is there a mechanism that you have either in-house or that you\u2019ve seen in HIV that looks like it\u2019s more straightforward to develop long-acting? I wasn\u2019t sure if integrase would be better than nuke versus non-nuke, something of that category? Thank you.\nMerdad Parsey: Thanks, Geoff. This is Merdad. Yes, we\u2019re -- I think our chemistry and our virology team do favor the INSTIs as a class where we believe that we have a better shot at getting to a long-acting partner for the capsid inhibitors. So, I would say a fair bit of our effort is going into those. But -- and we are open to looking at a variety of mechanisms to achieve our goal. We just think that the INSTIs are more likely to get there. I will remind you, this may have gone under the radar, but we do have the program where we are looking at the bnAb. I did mention it in the script and that does provide us another option for people from a long-acting standpoint where we\u2019re looking at every six months potentially there. So, we are pretty open and committed to finding the right partner that will achieve our goals.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Terrific. With that -- this is Dan. I just want to thank all of you for joining today. And I just wanted to emphasize how we believe our third quarter performance demonstrates the tangible impact of delivering on our strategy. After putting the right foundation in place over the past three years, we\u2019re now seeing the positive momentum that continues to build. It\u2019s an exciting time for the Company as we realize our potential to do more, to reach further and to help more patients and the communities we serve. So, I just want to take this opportunity to thank all the colleagues again at Gilead and Kite to thank all of you for joining your interest in Gilead. And as usual, if you have any additional questions, please reach out to our Investor Relations team. As you know, they\u2019re more than happy to help. And thank you for joining today.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s Third Quarter 2022 Gilead Sciences Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation.

            "name": "Daniel O'Day",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everybody. We're pleased to connect with all of you today to share the details of another very strong quarter. Thanks to strong commercial and clinical execution by our teams, the positive momentum continues to build. Total product sales excluding Veklury were $6.1 billion, growing 6% sequentially and 11% year\u2010over\u2010year. The total including Veklury was $7 billion. If we exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the tail\u2010end of the loss of exclusivity for Truvada and Atripla in HIV, total product sales excluding Veklury grew 15% from the third quarter of last year. The majority of this growth was driven by HIV and over 40% of the $620 million increase in sales came from oncology. The team will share more details, but this has been a great quarter for commercial execution, including: continued share gains for Biktarvy, growing momentum for Trodelvy, another impressive quarter for cell therapy, and a strong quarter for Veklury. We also saw continued clinical momentum this quarter. Some of the highlights include: the FDA priority review granted to Trodelvy for late line HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, the EU approvals for Yescarta for second line relapsed and refractory Large B\u2010Cell Lymphoma, and Tecartus in adult Acute Lymphoblastic Lymphoma, and in virology, lenacapavir received its first regulatory approval, in Europe. Marketed as Sunlenca, it is approved for heavily\u2010treatment experienced people living with multi\u2010drug resistant HIV, making it the first approved capsid inhibitor and the first therapy with a six\u2010month dosing schedule for HIV treatment. We are taking multiple important steps to advance our ambitious clinical pipeline, including: in oncology, we are expanding our lung program, with 8 trials now active, and 3 more planned to start in the coming months; we plan to resume our phase two trial investigating a once\u2010weekly oral combination of Merck's islatravir and our lenacapavir. This will be one of many ongoing combination studies we have for long\u2010acting HIV treatment, in addition to our extensive program for prevention; and we continue to further strengthen our early\u2010stage portfolio, adding a BTLA agonist for inflammation from MiroBio and an option for a bispecific antibody for oncology from MacroGenics. Moving to our clinical goals for 2022 on slide 5, we're on track to start the 2 remaining Phase 3 trials, namely EVOKE\u201003 for first line non\u2010small cell lung cancer and ZUMA\u201023 for first line high risk LBCL. We continue to expect another interim readout for the Phase 2 ARC\u20107 study in first line non\u2010small cell lung cancer before the end of the year. Overall, this has been another very strong quarter in a very strong year for Gilead. We're seeing impressive growth of our base business with continued share gains for Biktarvy, an excellent performance for cell therapy and growing demand for Trodelvy. On the clinical side, we've had the first approval for lenacapavir, a foundational asset for the future of our HIV franchise. Trodelvy is now under priority review for HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer in the U.S. and we're executing on an extensive development program across virology, oncology and inflammation. Finally, the recent TAF settlement is expected to significantly extend the exclusivity of key components of our HIV franchise in the U.S. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the Gilead and Kite teams for their outstanding clinical and commercial execution. This consistent execution of our strategy, along with a very robust portfolio has led to some terrific progress in 2022 and we look forward to building on that momentum through the rest of the year and beyond. With that, I'll invite Johanna to share an update on our third quarter commercial performance. Hey Matthew, Dan O'Day here. So we'll have Merdad take the first part of your question, and then Johanna can feed into the second. And Matthew, this is Dan O'Day. I'll just add one other thing in addition to my colleagues, which is in our conversations with the U.S. government, particularly the recent Fast Track designation that was applied to GS-5245, there's 3 major things that they're interested in, too.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Johanna Mercier",
            "content": "Thanks Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I jump into the commercial results for the third quarter, I wanted to begin by acknowledging our teams for another exceptional quarter. We're making important progress in our goals of ensuring the strength and sustainability of our virology franchise, while also continuing to build our expertise and market presence in oncology. Turning to slide 7, we had a very strong quarter with total product sales excluding Veklury of $6.1 billion, up 11% year\u2010over\u2010year, or 15% excluding FX and the residual impact of the HIV LOEs, with growth in each of our core franchise areas, and notable strength in HIV and oncology. Sequentially, total product sales excluding Veklury grew 6%, driven by HIV, HCV, and oncology. Growth excluding FX impact and the LOEs was 8%. On slide 8, HIV sales of $4.5 billion were up 7% year\u2010over\u2010year. Excluding the impact of both FX and the LOEs, HIV revenue grew 10% year\u2010over\u2010year. Similar to last quarter, this was primarily channel mix driven by U.S. government utilization leading to higher average realized price, in addition to higher demand. Overall, despite the quarter\u2010over\u2010quarter shifts in average realized price, government plans continue to represent approximately 60% of our U.S. HIV treatment prescriptions, including Medicare in the low\u201020s. HIV revenue growth was driven by the U.S., while Europe was down year\u2010over\u2010year, due to FX and less favorable pricing dynamics, offset in part by higher demand. Quarter\u2010over\u2010quarter, HIV sales were up 6%, similarly driven by channel mix and inventory dynamics, as well as higher demand. Turning to the market more broadly, we are encouraged that on a year-over-year basis, the HIV treatment market across the U.S. and Europe has grown for five consecutive quarters. This reflects the work we have been doing with our partners to bring people living with HIV and people at risk of HIV back into care following the pandemic. The market growth we are seeing suggests that activity has returned to pre\u2010COVID trends. In the third quarter of 2022, the market grew 2% year\u2010over\u2010year both in the U.S. and Europe. Looking forward, we continue to expect annual treatment market growth in the 2% to 3% range. Descovy sales were $500 million, up 16% year\u2010over\u2010year and 9% sequentially, and PrEP market share remains stable despite generic and other entrants. For the quarter, the PrEP market continues to demonstrate robust growth, largely driven by the growing awareness for PrEP and demand well\u2010above pre\u2010pandemic levels. Overall, the PrEP market grew 19% year\u2010over\u2010year and 6% sequentially. Onto slide 9. Third quarter Biktarvy sales were $2.8 billion, up 22% year\u2010over\u2010year, driven by higher demand in both the U.S. and Europe, and favorable pricing dynamics. Sequentially, sales were up 8%, due to higher demand as well as favorable inventory and pricing dynamics. Once again, Biktarvy continues to command a leading position in the treatment of HIV, with another record quarter growing to 45% market share in the U.S., up 4 percentage points year\u2010over\u2010year. Moreover, Biktarvy remains the leading medicine for those seeking to switch to a new regimen in the U.S. as well as those starting treatment in both the U.S. and Europe, most notably, capturing 10 new starts for every 1 person prescribed another medicine in the U.S. Looking to the fourth quarter, I'd like to call out a few points. First, given the historic trend towards a significant inventory build in the fourth quarter followed by inventory draw down in the first quarter, we are renewing our focus on inventory management in an effort to better align the timing of product delivery with end\u2010user demand. Second, while we continue to see strong market share gains for Biktarvy in addition to solid growth in both the treatment and prevention markets, we will remind you that some of our second and third quarter performance has been driven by shifts in channel mix that have had a favorable impact on average realized price. Given the favorable trends we observed over the last two quarters we do expect the channel mix to be more stable in the fourth quarter. With these factors in mind, and also allowing for further FX impact, we expect fourth quarter HIV sales to be roughly flat on a sequential basis, noting that full year 2022 HIV growth is therefore expected to be approximately 4%, or 7% excluding the LOEs and FX headwinds year to date. In summary, we're extremely proud of the portfolio we have built in HIV and excited about the way Gilead is positioned for 2023 and beyond. Specifically, Biktarvy's clinical profile continues to impress, evidenced by ongoing, strong growth rates even though its annual revenue run rate is now in excess of $10 billion. Descovy for PrEP, maintained over 40% market share despite competition and generic entrants. And most recently lenacapavir's approval as Sunlenca for heavily treatment experienced people living with multi\u2010drug resistant HIV in the EU. This is an important option for a group that has few treatment options, and is a great opportunity for physicians and the HIV community to get more familiar with a six monthly, subcutaneous HIV therapy. We believe this sets the stage well for our other planned lenacapavir\u2010based treatment and prevention regimens. All of this, combined with, the treatment and prevention markets showing solid recovery; the impact of the loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla now behind us; and the recent TAF settlement extending projected U.S. LOEs for Descovy and Odefsey into the early 2030s, and Genvoya's patent to 2029 in the U.S. All of this truly underpins our confidence that Gilead is well\u2010positioned for growth and continued leadership in the HIV market. Now onto slide 10. HCV sales for the third quarter were $524 million, up 22% year\u2010over\u2010year and 17% sequentially, primarily due to the favorable resolution of a prior year rebate claim in Europe and other favorable pricing dynamics in the U.S. Offsetting these benefits, there were fewer patient starts in both the U.S. and Europe, consistent with our expectations for both the quarter and the general trend that you should expect in HCV going forward. Despite the trend in patients starts, we're pleased to maintain HCV market share of more than 50% in both the U.S. and Europe, and third quarter share increased on a year\u2010over\u2010year basis. For HBV and HDV on slide 11, sales were up 7% year\u2010over\u2010year and 13% quarter\u2010over\u2010quarter, primarily driven by favorable inventory dynamics. Moving to Veklury on slide 12, third quarter revenues were $925 million. As expected, sales were down year\u2010over\u2010year given lower U.S. hospitalizations as compared to the same period last year. Indeed, though hospitalizations are below the peak seen at the start of the year, it's clear with the sequential increase that the path of the pandemic remains difficult to predict. Nonetheless, we're proud of the role Veklury continues to play in the fight against COVID\u201019. In the U.S., Veklury is used in approximately 60% of hospitalized patients who are being treated for COVID. And outside the U.S., Veklury's benefit to patients continues to be recognized by health authorities including the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency, based in part on the PINETREE data which demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalization after a three\u2010day IV treatment in the outpatient setting. These factors continue to support Veklury utilization where it is needed. Moving to Oncology, and beginning with Trodelvy on slide 13. Sales of $180 million grew 78% year\u2010 over\u2010year and 13% quarter\u2010over quarter, and we continue to work with regulators, payers and clinicians around the world to broaden access. Since its approval in second line metastatic TNBC late last year in Europe, Trodelvy is now reimbursed in 13 countries outside the U.S., with additional markets in Europe and elsewhere expected to come on line shortly. We've also begun work on establishing the right infrastructure to support a potential launch into pretreated HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Reinforcing the significant unmet need in this population, and the clinically meaningful overall survival data demonstrated in the Phase 3 TROPiCS\u201002 study, FDA has accepted our supplemental Biologics License Application as Priority Review and we look to a decision in February of next year. We're excited by the potential for many more patients to benefit from Trodelvy. Now onto slide 14, and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, I'm pleased to share that Cell Therapy sales in the third quarter were $398 million, up 79% year\u2010over\u2010year and up 8% sequentially. These strong results were driven by continued growth in large B\u2010cell lymphoma and Kite's ability to reliably meet customer demand. Together with our recently FDA\u2010approved viral vector manufacturing facility in Oceanside, Kite remains well\u2010positioned to ensure clinical and commercial supply availability while it continues to execute on its geographic expansion. For the quarter, Yescarta sales of $317 million were up 81% year\u2010over\u2010year and 8% quarter\u2010over\u2010 quarter, driven by a continued successful launch in second\u2010line LBCL in the U.S. and partially offset by FX headwinds in Europe. Just last week, Yescarta was approved in the EU for second\u2010line LBCL and we look forward to launching there in the months ahead. Tecartus grew 72% year\u2010over\u2010year to deliver $81 million in sales, driven by growth in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In early September, the European Marketing Authorization for Tecartus in relapsed or refractory ALL was granted. We continue to broaden awareness and access to our cell therapies through indication and Authorized Treatment Center expansion in existing markets as well as through geographic expansion, as demonstrated by our most recent regulatory applications in Brazil, Singapore, and Saudi Arabia. As always, Christi is available for Q&A later on the call. Overall, this was an incredibly strong quarter for Gilead oncology, with revenue of $578 million up 10% from last quarter and 79% from last year. This represents an almost $2.4 billion annual run rate as we move into the last few months of 2022, and hints at the possibilities ahead as we continue to execute on our commercial and clinical oncology goals. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline. So maybe just to add to that, Chris, in light of what Merdad was just referring to, we've done a lot of patient market research to really understand the segments within the oral market, but also with the long-acting market, specifically in treatment, which is quite different to your point, to prevention. And in the treatment setting, it is clear that you will always have a market for that daily oral, which we believe Biktarvy has really set the standard there. And then there are others that the weekly oral will be more preferred. Some people just want to make sure they're taking something every single day. Others don't want to be reminded that they have HIV. And then you have, obviously, the injectables or the subQ with lenacapavir combinations every 3 months or potentially even every 6 months that will be very appealing to some that don't want to be reminded at all. And so those are kind of the segments we're trying to play out. So, I do think as a long acting, there will be more of a split segment than we've seen in the daily oral. Hi Brian, it's Johanna. Thanks for the question. So basically, let me start by saying with Trodelvy, the performance for the quarter has been really strong. We're seeing 78% year-on-year growth, 13% quarter-over-quarter. And we're seeing markets add in every week basically. And reimbursement kind of playing out. We have now over 13 countries ex U.S. that have gotten reimbursement. So, we're seeing really strong launches namely France, Germany right now and other markets coming in as we're speaking. So, strong foundations there. I think having OS data in both triple-negative breast cancer as well as now with TROPiCS-02 in the HR-positive/HER2-negative, patient population really helps the foundation for Trodelvy but really helps across breast cancer. To your specific question around kind of where do we position ourselves, obviously, with TROPiCS-02, we're in previously treated -- heavily-treated lines of therapy, right, when you think about this patient population, so a little bit different than some of our competitors. And so, we're excited actually because these patients have very limited options. And so, now with Trodelvy, there is a real potential for overall survival in these late-line patients. So, we do think that as we're playing it out, as we're doing our market research, we feel very confident that Trodelvy will be very well positioned in the marketplace, and we'll build on the success that we've seen thus far in triple-negative breast cancer as well in how we're playing that out. So, we expect continued momentum in our base business. And I might have mentioned before in one of the previous calls, how we've expanded our footprint, specifically in the U.S. to prepare for both not only the expansion of what we need to do in triple-negative breast cancer, but also what we need to do in HR-positive. And so we're well poised to make sure that we're ready for that PDUFA date coming up in February to make sure that we're successful. Yes. So in line with that, Matthew, it's Johanna. I would just add to what Merdad is saying. So I think from a commercial standpoint, what we're thinking is the fact that it doesn't have a boosting agent is a real plus here as well as the fact that we're going to look at rebound effects as we've seen with current marketed products right now have that issue, and so, -- in addition to the antiviral activity. So I think those pieces are kind of what we're thinking about. As well as you well know, drug-drug interactions has been a bit of an issue with some of the current agents today. So I think if you -- without the boosting agent, I think those will just open up a little bit more for a broader patient population potentially to really benefit. And as we've seen with this pandemic, it's not over. We've seen hospitalizations go up and down. We've seen a little bit of an increase most recently, and we're tracking that very closely with hospitalizations, of course, because of Veklury. But we do believe that there's still opportunity for more options here to make sure that we curve this pandemic. Tyler, it's Joanna. Thanks for the question. I would say that we're really proud of the Biktarvy performance, but I would say even the increased momentum that we're seeing. And this is not just in the U.S., this is really around the globe. And so, we're just about 45% market share with Biktarvy. We've seen 4% share gain year-on-year. And now, we're looking at an annual run rate in excess of about $10 billion. So, I do think we're very well poised for the future. The -- we're looking at both the nai\u0308ve share, obviously, just about under 60% of that share right now with Biktarvy, so really setting the standard for new patients coming into HIV. And obviously, the switch share, and you can't -- switch share is obviously a little bit lower because you can switch to Biktarvy if you're already on Biktarvy. So therefore, we're tracking that very closely as well, but making sure that when there is opportunity, either from older drugs or when there's been some issues for patients to really come on to Biktarvy just because it really does have a profile from an efficacy standpoint and safety standpoint. So, we do believe that continued growth with Biktarvy is on the agenda. And I would also add just a little bit of a note around the market as well, which also helps, right, because where the market goes, Biktarvy goes and where Biktarvy goes, the market goes. We've seen market stabilization actually back to pre-pandemic levels and growing at about 2% or so year-on-year, both in the U.S. as well as in Europe. And so, that also really helps our momentum continue and Biktarvy is driving that as well, of course, in a lot of our efforts. The teams have worked very closely with community partners and physicians and advocacy groups to make sure that we get patients back into clinics, back into care, both from a screening standpoint and diagnosis standpoint. Now that we're -- and you really see those numbers back to pre-pandemic. So I think we're in good place moving forward and well poised for the future to continue this leadership in HIV driven by Biktarvy."

            "name": "Andrew Dickinson",
            "content": "Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon everyone. We're pleased to share another strong quarter of results, with sequential and year\u2010over\u2010year growth in every franchise across our core business. As shown on slide 25, product sales, excluding Veklury, grew 11% year\u2010over\u2010year, despite a $130 million headwind from FX. If we exclude this FX impact, in addition to the impact of previous HIV LOEs, total underlying sales growth year\u2010over\u2010year was 15%. Moving to slide 26, you can see that Veklury was down, as expected, year-over-year, although it more than doubled on a sequential basis from the second quarter. I'll note that with the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, the total FX impact on revenue, net of hedges, was higher than expected, at approximately $200 million compared to the third quarter of last year. Non\u2010GAAP product gross margin was 87%, down 320 basis points from last year, primarily due to the third quarter 2021 reversal of a previously recorded litigation reserve. Additionally, non\u2010GAAP product gross margin was impacted by higher Biktarvy\u2010related royalty expense and lower Veklury sales. Non\u2010 GAAP product gross margin improved sequentially due to higher HIV and Veklury product sales. Non\u2010GAAP R&D, excluding acquired IPR&D expenses was $1.2 billion, up 10% year\u2010over\u2010year, primarily due to investments in Oncology. Sequentially, R&D excluding acquired IPR&D expenses was up 6% driven by investments in Oncology and COVID treatments. Acquired IPR&D, reflecting acquisitions, milestones and upfront payments for the quarter was $448 million and includes $389 million of expense related to the MiroBio acquisition. Non\u2010GAAP SG&A was $1.2 billion, up 3% year\u2010over\u2010year. Non\u2010GAAP operating margin was 47%, down year\u2010over\u2010year and driven primarily by higher Acquired IPR&D expenses and lower Veklury sales. Sequentially, non\u2010GAAP operating margin increased 400 basis points due to higher HIV and Veklury sales, partially offset by higher acquired IPR&D expenses. Non\u2010GAAP effective tax in the third quarter was 22.4%, higher than normal due to the non\u2010deductibility of the upfront MiroBio payment. Overall, our non\u2010GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.90 in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $2.65 for the same period last year. Of note, the MiroBio transaction impacted post\u2010tax EPS by $0.31 a share, and this was not reflected in the full year guidance we shared back in August. On slide 27, we take a quick look at our performance year\u2010to\u2010date, which shows total product sales excluding Veklury of $16.7 billion, up 7% year\u2010over\u2010year. If we exclude the approximately $385 million of FX headwinds year\u2010to\u2010date as compared to the same period last year, in addition to the impact of the HIV LOEs, the underlying growth year\u2010to\u2010date is 11%. Veklury, as expected, is down year\u2010to\u2010date, highlighting the lower demand for COVID\u201019 treatments in this stage of the pandemic. Moving to slide 28, we are increasing our full year sales guidance to reflect our year\u2010to\u2010date results and our expectations for Q4, including our latest view of FX. For Revenues, we now expect total product sales of $25.9 billion to $26.2 billion, up from our previous range of $24.5 billion to $25.0 billion. This reflects the strong performance year\u2010to\u2010date, notably very strong growth in HIV, Veklury, and cell therapy, and incorporates our expectations for the broader macro environment, including FX which will, once again, be a headwind in the fourth quarter. In HIV, as Johanna discussed, we expect HIV revenue in Q4 to be roughly flat on a sequential basis. In cell therapy, we expect slower growth on a sequential basis, primarily due to stabilizing demand following the second line LBCL launch and FX headwinds. Additionally, we are taking a cautious view with regards to both the current shortage of fludarabine which we expect to be partially mitigated later in the fourth quarter, and to the competitive landscape as our peers improve their manufacturing reliability. Moving to Veklury, and with year\u2010to\u2010date revenue of $2.9 billion, we are increasing our expectations to approximately $3.4 billion for the full year. Note that we expect Veklury sales to continue to track hospitalization rates and our guidance assumes no significant increase in hospitalization rates from the third quarter levels. Excluding Veklury, we expect our total product sales to be $22.5 billion to $22.8 billion, representing growth of 5% to 6% year\u2010over year, compared to our prior range of $22.0 billion to $22.5 billion. As for the rest of the non\u2010GAAP P&L, product gross margin is now expected to be in the 86% to 87% range, compared to our prior guidance of approximately 85% to 86%. There is no change to our R&D guidance, where we expect full year R&D expense to increase by a mid\u2010single-digit percentage compared to the 2021 baseline of $4.5 billion. Moving to acquired IPR&D, we are not issuing guidance for the full year and similar to what we did with MiroBio this quarter we'll update our EPS guidance quarterly as needed to reflect any relevant activity during the quarter. What we have included here is the year\u2010to\u2010date acquired IPR&D amount, including approximately $0.04 per share associated with the MacroGenics collaboration that we announced last week. The guidance shared today does not include any upfront payments related to normal course of business partnerships or licensing deals that we might close in the fourth quarter. For SG\u2022&A, with our continued investment across our commercial organization, and expectations for higher costs as a result of inflation, we continue to expect SG&A expenses to grow by a low single digit percentage compared to 2021. Altogether, we expect operating income to be $11.8 billion to $12.2 billion for the full\u2010year, up from $11 billion to $11.6 billion previously. And finally, we now expect our non\u2010GAAP diluted earnings per share to range between $6.95 to $7.15 per share, up from $6.35 to $6.75 previously. This EPS guidance range is approaching our 2021 non\u2010GAAP EPS results, despite an expected $2.2 billion decline in Veklury revenue, and more than half a billion dollars in total FX headwinds anticipated through the end of the year, as compared to 2021 rates. This highlights the strength of our core business, which is now expected to grow in the 5% to 6% range in 2022. On a GAAP basis, we expect our diluted earnings per share to range between $3.35 and $3.55 per share, compared to $2.90 and $3.30 per share previously. Finally, on slide 29, you can see that there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. In the quarter, we returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders, including $928 million in dividend payments and $180 million in share repurchases. As we announced previously, we repaid $1 billion of debt early in the third quarter and have returned to the same debt level we were at prior to the Immunomedics acquisition. With that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A. With that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A. Yes. Thanks, Dan. Hi Umer, thanks for the question. Happy to touch base on this. This is a topic, as you know, that we've been getting a lot of questions on with the Zantac litigation. So a number of things that I can provide some background and context. So first of all, like most companies, anyone operating in the U.S., we are routinely managing a lot of different litigation matters, as you know. Many of those are from our perspective, meritless or baseless. As a matter of practice, we don't typically -- or usually comment on specific litigation cases. What I can say stepping back is that we have won or resolved the 3 material litigation -- or 3 material litigation matters over the past year, as you know, on terms that were favorable to the Company and to our shareholders, that is the Juno Kite IP litigation, the ViiV IP litigation around bictegravir, then the third was the TAF litigation with generic companies. We have an outstanding legal team, both internally and externally. And then maybe to your specific question, I mean, we have complete confidence in the merits of the defense on the ongoing product liability case. So, it is very different than the Zantac litigation case. So just to your question on the number of plaintiffs, for instance, if I remember correctly in the Zantac cases, there were 250,000 patients in our case -- I'm sorry, plantiffs. There were 25,000 in ours. But the key difference is that the issues at hand here, I mean, our TDF-based products are life-saving products that really transform care for HIV. And the side effects of the products were in the label from day one. The labels in the U.S. and Europe were slightly different but the labels were there. These were well known, well disclosed potential side effects. And I think that's an important piece of it. So, it's a very different case. Zantac, as I remember correctly was taken off the market and reformulated. So I'd be careful about drawing too many parallels between what you saw with Zantac and some of the companies that were affected by that in this litigation. That doesn't mean that we don't take it seriously. We do take it very seriously. And as I said, we have a great team that's working on it. The last thing, Umer, maybe the last two things, there are a number of amicus briefs that have been filed. Those are all publicly available. This is in the California state litigation that I would encourage you to read. I think there are 4 or 5 amicus briefs that really speak to how different this cause of action is relative to what you would typically expect to see in a case. And then finally, on the charge, no, we have not taken a charge. And as I said, we feel very strongly about the merits of our case and look forward to proceeding with the litigation over the coming months and years. So good question. Thank you."

            "name": "Merdad Parsey",
            "content": "Thank you, Johanna. Before I start, I'd like to recognize the strong execution of our internal team and external partners across a broad range of activities that's diversified across therapeutic area and clinical stage with milestones spanning study initiations, the sBLA submission for Trodelvy, two EC approvals in cell therapy, and our first approval for lenacapavir in the EU. On slide 16, you can see that we've made a lot of progress so far this year, meeting nearly all our milestones. Regarding our BLA filing for Hepcludex, we received a Complete Response Letter from FDA, citing concerns about the manufacture and delivery of Hepcludex. We will take the time to fully digest the CRL, but note that no new safety or efficacy clinical trials were requested by the FDA. We plan to resubmit as quickly as possible and will work with the agency on the path forward. We remain confident in bulevirtide and the potential benefits it can bring to people living with HDV, and will share an update on the U.S. regulatory pathway when we can. Moving onto HIV on slide 17. We're thrilled that lenacapavir received its first marketing authorization from the European Commission as Sunlenca for people living with multi\u2010drug resistant HIV, in combination with other antiretrovirals. Sunlenca is a first\u2010in\u2010class capsid inhibitor. It is the first and only twice\u2010yearly, subcutaneous HIV treatment and adds a much\u2010needed option for those people living with HIV with limited alternatives. We continue to expect a decision on our NDA for lenacapavir from FDA in late December of this year. In the meantime, this first regulatory approval from the EC is an important validation while we continue to progress our other lenacapavir\u2010based treatment and prevention programs. For HIV treatment, a new clinical development plan allowing a lower dose of islatravir, Merck's investigational NRTTI, is moving forward after FDA review. As such, we are planning to resume the Phase 2 trial investigating an oral, once\u2010weekly lenacapavir and islatravir combination. Our internal combination programs are also ongoing, and we expect to share data next year from the Phase 1b proof\u2010of\u2010concept study for lenacapavir and two broadly\u2010neutralizing antibodies, or bNAbs, directed at HIV. In prevention, our clinical development continues to progress with four in\u2010process or planned clinical trials evaluating every six\u2010month subcutaneous lenacapavir. Moving to slide 18, Veklury continues to be recognized as a standard of care for patients with severe COVID\u201019, with updated guidelines for Veklury from the World Health Organization. Additionally, the CHMP issued a positive opinion on the use of Veklury for the treatment of pediatric patients with COVID\u201019. Although novel treatments and vaccinations have improved the COVID\u201019 outlook, there is a continued need for effective and convenient oral treatment options for patients. I am pleased to share that the FDA has just granted our novel oral nucleoside, GS\u20105245, Fast Track Designation, which aims to expedite development of promising new medicines. We continue to be in active discussions with the FDA and other global regulators on potential clinical pathways including a Phase 3 study that we expect to start within the next several months, either globally or outside the U.S. On slide 19, we show the Phase 3 TROPiCS\u201002 results in patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer that was a late breaking presentation at ESMO in September. Trodelvy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 3.2\u2010month overall survival benefit. Patients with metastatic HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer who have progressed on endocrine\u2010based therapies and chemotherapy have limited options. As a reminder, the patients enrolled in TROPiCS\u201002 were heavily pre\u2010treated with a median of three prior chemotherapy regimens in addition to prior CDK4/6 inhibitors. Importantly, the FDA recently accepted our sBLA for Trodelvy in HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and granted it a Priority Review. The PDUFA date is currently set for February 2023. We continue to work with regulatory agencies outside the U.S. to potentially make this medicine available to eligible patients. Additionally, following the acquisition of Trodelvy's Asian commercialization and development rights from Everest Medicines, we expect data from our Phase 3 metastatic TNBC China bridging trial in the next few months and our Phase 3 Asian HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer study in mid\u20102023. Moving to lung cancer on slide 20, you can see that we expect to have at least 9 active clinical trials in non\u2010small cell lung cancer by the end of 2022, including 5 with Trodelvy, as well as programs with zimberelimab, domvanalimab and etruma, Merck's Keytruda, AstraZeneca's durvalumab, and our own magrolimab. Eight trials are already underway, including the Phase 3 EVOKE\u201001 study in second to third line non\u2010small cell lung cancer and our Phase 2 EVOKE\u201002 study in first line non\u2010small cell lung cancer without actionable mutations. Our partner Merck also plans to initiate the Phase 3 EVOKE\u201003 study later this year to evaluate the combination of Trodelvy and Keytruda in first\u2010line patients with non\u2010small cell lung cancer whose tumors express high levels of PD\u2010L1. Additionally, with our partner Arcus, we're looking forward to the fourth interim analysis of the Phase 2 ARC\u20107 trial evaluating zim and dom in PD\u2010L1\u2010high non\u2010small cell lung cancer before the end of the year. Data from ARC\u20107 are expected to support our ongoing Phase 3 studies for dom\u2010based combinations in lung cancer, including STAR\u2010121 which just achieved first patient in. Lung cancer is a disease area with high unmet need, and we believe we have multiple promising MOAs and potential combinations that could help bring additional new treatment options to patients. To explore these opportunities, we plan to initiate two Phase 2 signal seeking platform studies, VELOCITY and the Arcus\u2010led EDGE\u2010lung in the coming months. Overall, we have initiated a comprehensive evaluation of the assets in our portfolio to address the significant unmet need in lung cancer, and look forward to sharing updates in the coming years. Moving to slide 21, and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, we are highlighting our expanding clinical pipeline as we build on the growing momentum and adoption of cell therapy based on the significant survival benefit that Yescarta and Tecartus are delivering to patients. We believe there are still opportunities to bring Yescarta and Tecartus to more patients by moving into earlier lines as well as new indications. As you can see, we have recently enrolled patients in several studies, including ZUMA\u201024, a Phase 2 study to evaluate Yescarta in an outpatient setting for second line LBCL, and ZUMA\u201022, a Phase 3 study for Yescarta in second line plus high\u2010risk follicular lymphoma. We also expect to begin screening patients for the ZUMA\u201023 study of Yescarta in Q4. The decision to initiate a Phase 3 trial in first line HR LBCL was based on the encouraging data from ZUMA\u201012, where Yescarta demonstrated 89% ORR and 78% CR. Additional studies include an evaluation of Tecartus in rare B\u2010cell malignancies, and KITE\u2010363 that's evaluating a CD19/20 bicistronic CAR T in post\u2010CD19 third line plus LBCL. We are committed to continuously improving the safety and efficacy of our cell therapies through both internal pipeline and external partnerships. On slide 22, we turn to hematology and highlight the breadth of our programs across MDS and AML. For magrolimab, we fully enrolled our Phase 3 ENHANCE study in MDS ahead of schedule. Our discussions with the FDA and other regulators continue, and we expect to share an update in early 2023. Moreover, enrollment for the two AML trials, ENHANCE\u20102 and \u20103, is well underway and we are targeting topline data in 2024. A few weeks ago, we announced our oncology collaboration with MacroGenics to develop bispecific antibodies. This includes the exclusive option to license MGD024, a bispecific antibody that binds to CD123 and CD3, currently in Phase 1, as well as 2 additional research programs. This complements magrolimab, and furthers our work as we explore therapies that could translate into better clinical outcomes for patients with AML and MDS. Finally, we were pleased FDA granted KITE\u2010222 orphan drug designation at the end of September. It's the first CLL\u20101 targeted CAR T and is currently enrolling patients in a Phase 1 study. On slide 23, I wanted to take a moment to welcome MiroBio to Gilead. We completed the acquisition a few weeks ago and are pleased to add the MiroBio team to the Gilead research family, and bring their proprietary discovery platform and immune inhibitory receptor agonists to our portfolio. This acquisition complements our inflammatory disease cornerstones including IBD, RA and systemic lupus and opens opportunities in other indications. We are excited to continue to explore and develop these antibody agonists, which we believe have the potential to induce immunosuppressive signaling and restore tolerance in autoimmunity. Wrapping up, I'll note that we now have 60 clinical programs underway here at Gilead, spanning a broad range of indications across virology, oncology and inflammation. We've accomplished a lot in 2022, and yet feel we're really just getting started in exploring the possibilities offered by our portfolio. With that, Andy? Hi Chris, this is Merdad. Let me first start by saying that we are really excited about the recent approval for lenacapavir in this -- in the highly treatment-experienced population. Obviously, that's a group of people who have limited options, and I think lenacapavir as a new class provides a new opportunity for them. In terms of islatravir, what we like about islatravir is that it is fairly late in its development. We are able to be in Phase 2 with that. And I think it provides us a relatively near-term opportunity to launch a partner in treatment for lenacapavir that could be given in a long-acting way. And I think that's really important in terms of where the market is going and what our goal is in terms of, as we've said before, providing a long-acting parenteral option that is longer than in the 3 months or longer time frame. And we're optimistic about our ability to do that. So for that, we have our internal pipeline assets that are really providing our options there. For islatravir, that's part of our oral program. And for us, we do think that we have a number of opportunities in terms of oral programs to provide weekly oral treatment options for people using lenacapavir. And right now is a potential certainly islatravir is an option there, and we have other options in our pipeline that could potentially get that -- get to that level. So, the way I look at it, just to answer directly your last question, we do think that there will be a lenacapavir partner, and there will be probably one partner that will achieve our therapeutic goals in oral, potentially a different partner in parenteral. And as we go forward, if we can make improvements whether that's lenacapavir and being able to provide even longer than six-month therapy or to the partner that we could extend the duration of therapy with a different molecule or a different formulation, we'll always try to get to that longer exposure. So over time, I expect us to continue to try to innovate and move forward. Salveen, this is Merdad again. Yes, maybe I'll start by saying that really, nothing has really changed in terms of the ARC-7 study and where we're headed. And the reminder make is that this is going to be the fourth interim analysis for the ongoing Phase 2 study and enrollment was only recently completed over the summer. And so, when we look at that, if you think about it in that context, to your point, we continue to look for consistency in the dom and zim combination as a doublet in the ORR to bolster our ongoing Phase 3 program, right, just to underline our confidence in the TIGIT and dom combination. Based on the data we've seen already, and this should continue to support that. In terms of PFS, I think PFS is -- as I tried to allude to, given the fact that enrollment went on until fairly recently, the likelihood is that PFS is going to be fairly immature and may not be informative. And certainly, when we think about the triplet there as well, it's unlikely that PFS is going to be informative, but it may be. And so, we'll look at that, and our plan is to evaluate the data and then decide with our partners at Arcus what the data and how we approach it. And certainly, as we've said before, making sure that we are sharing the data at a medical conference next year. And exactly to your point, it's really about confirming the confidence we already have in TIGIT and moving into Phase 3 with our -- with the lead programs that we're moving with. So, I hope that answers your question. And maybe -- this is Merdad. Maybe I'll add to that. We're not done, right? And I think we're excited about how much we've been able to achieve with Trodelvy so far, and you've seen consistent positive data across tumor types. And in particular, I think, as Johanna highlighted, the late-line therapy, certainly, those are patients who may now -- there's a potential that some of them will be getting in HER2 beforehand. We don't have data on sequencing, but I do believe that there may be those who decide to treat for those patients who may not respond adequately to in HER2 to later lines, right? So that's kind of where, certainly, there's an opportunity there. The other thing I would add is that we've got really strong data in triple-negative breast, including the HER2 -- sorry, in HR-positive breast cancer, including the HER2 zero population. And I think that's a very important distinction and really important to remember. And then finally, based on what we've seen so far and the clinical benefit we've brought, we certainly believe that there's an opportunity for us to move to earlier lines of therapy as well in breast cancer in triple negative, in HR-positive and in other tumor types. I think that's -- our excitement about Trodelvy has always been the ability to go into broad tumor types, and our strategy has always been to advance into earlier lines of therapy as we generate positive data. Yes, Michael, Merdad, thanks for the question. I think just to follow on, it's a great follow-on to the prior question around our ability to really look across tumor types and earlier lines. And in particular, I think what you're referencing is our confidence in going into early line lung cancer and starting those studies. To your point, we've seen data, as you know, very well from our early Phase 1b study in lung cancer. And we continue to enroll and we've initiated now studies looking at both the second- and third-line setting and we -- and then as well as in the frontline setting. As you know, we're doing a study in combination with EVOKE-03 [ph] with the PD-1 and the PD-L1 high population, which I think is really an important trial for us to proceed on. So, I think what I would say is that the timing of the data, Michael, is always difficult to predict. We have to see how the study enrollment goes, and it's early days. But we're really excited about the opportunity to bring a meaningful therapy to a group with a very high unmet need. Yes. Thanks for the question. Happy to expand on that. Yes, look, bictegravir is an amazing molecule and has done a lot for patients. And one of the opportunities we looked at is in addition to thinking about bictegravir for long-acting oral was to see if we could give it as a long-acting subcutaneous. And really, what happened is we had tolerability issues just given that molecule subcu in terms of injection site reactions. So, it's not about the molecule itself. One of the challenges of developing long-acting subcutaneous therapies is tolerability. And so, I want to make sure that it's clear that bictegravir as an oral agent continues to be a huge part of where we want to go. And then maybe just to step back to your point, the way I think about it, maybe the way to think about is from a PrEP standpoint, long-acting, we are lenacapavir, it's prep for long-acting and that -- those studies are underway, moving along nicely. From a treatment standpoint, as I mentioned earlier, lenacapavir is a huge part of our backbone therapy for us. And now, we are looking at a number of different opportunities to get to long-acting oral and long-acting parenteral. And molecules like lenacapavir don't come along every day. We are looking for a number of -- at a number of molecules. We think we have the world-class expertise in chemistry and preclinical development that gives us a leg up on the competition to get to those molecules that will really get to the need that Johanna laid out, which is to get to the subcutaneous or every three-month dosing or even longer, and that's what we're looking for. Yes. Thanks, Dan. Yes. Thanks, Matthew. So, 5245 has -- as you know, we started those trials in Phase I earlier this year. Things are going well. And as you know, the pandemic has changed a lot. And I think you make an excellent point that looking at high-risk patients is a challenge right now in looking at high-risk patients who may get hospitalized as a challenge right now, giving vaccination, other treatment options. So exactly to your point, I think the discussion we're having internally and with our regulators is what's the best population for us to establish the benefit of 5245. And how does that anticipate what might come down the road, which has been the unpredictable part, whether that is resistance to other agents, the need for combination agents, new variants that may increase the hospitalization rates. Those are all the things that we have to be prepared for. And we really see 5245 as a way -- as we move forward with that and move into clinical trials once we demonstrate its efficacy as an important tool, should the pandemic start to pick up again, heaven forbid, but that's how we think about it. So both combinations and treating resistance or a new surge. Thanks, Geoff. This is Merdad. Yes, we're -- I think our chemistry and our virology team do favor the INSTIs as a class where we believe that we have a better shot at getting to a long-acting partner for the capsid inhibitors. So, I would say a fair bit of our effort is going into those. But -- and we are open to looking at a variety of mechanisms to achieve our goal. We just think that the INSTIs are more likely to get there. I will remind you, this may have gone under the radar, but we do have the program where we are looking at the bnAb. I did mention it in the script and that does provide us another option for people from a long-acting standpoint where we're looking at every six months potentially there. So, we are pretty open and committed to finding the right partner that will achieve our goals."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent background noises. After today\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Jacquie Ross, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the second quarter of 2022. The press release, slides and supplemental data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open up the call to Q&A where the team will be joined by Christi Shaw, the Chief Executive Officer of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including those related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gilead's business; financial condition and results of operations; plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations; financial projections and use of capital; and 2022 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet as well as on the Gilead website. Now I'll turn the call over to Dan.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everybody. We really appreciate you joining today. We look forward to sharing our second quarter results, which highlighted a quarter of strong commercial and clinical execution. This was a very strong quarter for our business, delivering revenue of US$6.1 billion. Excluding Veklury, total product sales grew 7% year-over-year. If we look at the underlying business and also exclude the impact of the HIV LOEs and the currency headwinds in the second quarter, growth was actually 11%. Our HIV portfolio continues to deliver, and this quarter was no exception with higher demand for both treatment and PrEP. Biktarvy sales grew by 28% year-over-year, and we expect to see continued market growth for treatment and prevention with the ongoing market recovery. This was a record quarter for our oncology business. Revenues topped $0.5 billion for the first time with a strong contribution from Trodelvy and a standout performance by our cell therapies. Yescarta was approved by the FDA for second-line relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma in April. This increased awareness and go demand not only for Yescarta's second-line patients but also for those in later lines of treatment. Yescarta is a potentially curative therapy, and Kite has uniquely and effectively scaled manufacturing to meet the needs of patients through the benefit. Turning to our clinical progress. Our NDA submission has been accepted by the FDA for lenacapavir for heavily treatment-experienced people living with HIV, and we are now expecting the decision in late December. If approved, lenacapavir will be the first approved cased inhibitor and the first therapy with a 6-month dosing schedule for HIV treatment. Moving to Trodelvy. We are in discussions with the FDA regarding a potential regulatory pathway for late-stage hormone-receptor-positive/HER2-negative patients, and we will update you as things progress. We have also begun screening patients in ASCENT-3 and ASCENT-4 evaluating Trodelvy in the first-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients. We dosed the first patient in our new Phase 2 study evaluating Trodelvy in non-small cell lung cancer, EVOKE\u201002. And earlier this month, we dosed the first patient in a new Trodelvy combination arm in our ongoing magrolimab triple-negative breast cancer study. Also from magrolimab, we are targeting an interim analysis no later than early 2023 for ENHANCE, our Phase 3 study in first-line, high-risk MDS. Additionally, we dosed the first patient for ENHANCE-3, a Phase 3 magrolimab study for first-line unfit AML. Moving to Slide 5. Later this year, we expect to initiate an additional 5 studies for Trodelvy in a mix of monotherapy and combination studies. We also plan to start enrolling patients in three cell therapy trials and two domvanalimab combination trials. The extent of existing and planned studies really highlights the scale of our ambitious oncology program. I want to take this opportunity to thank the teams across Gilead and Kite for a terrific quarter of commercial execution and for the continued momentum in our clinical programs to continue to lay the critical groundwork for Gilead's future success. With that, I'll invite Johanna to share an update on our second quarter commercial performance.\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. We had a very strong second quarter with total product sales excluding Veklury of $5.7 billion, up 7% year-over-year, driven by HIV, cell therapy and Trodelvy and offset in part by HCV. Sequentially, total product sales excluding Veklury were up 14%, driven by the seasonal pricing and inventory dynamics we see coming out of the first quarter of every year, primarily in our HIV business, as well as higher demand across our total portfolio. On Slide 8, HIV sales were up 7% year-over-year to $4.2 billion, primarily driven by channel mix associated with lower government utilization, leading to a higher average realized price as well as higher demand for both treatment and PrEP. Excluding the impact of the loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla, HIV sales increased 11%. Quarter\u2010over\u2010quarter, HIV sales were up 14%, due to demand and channel mix leading to higher average realized price as well as the favorable seasonal inventory dynamics that we typically see in the second quarter relative to the first. Year\u2010over\u2010year, the HIV treatment market grew over 4% in the U.S., and was largely flat in Europe but, sequentially grew over 2% in the U.S. and 1% in Europe. We\u2019re encouraged to see the market recovering and, on a year\u2010over\u2010year basis, continue to expect annual treatment market growth in the 2% to 3% range. Descovy sales in the second quarter were $460 million, up 6% year\u2010over\u2010year and 23% sequentially. We are pleased to see continued PrEP market growth with broader awareness and market volumes that are well above pre\u2010pandemic levels. For the quarter, the overall market growth was up 25% year\u2010over\u2010year, and 5% sequentially, highlighting both robust recovery and growing adoption of PrEP. Despite generic and other market participants, Descovy share in PrEP is holding in the mid\u201040 percent range. As awareness continues to grow and the overall market expands, we expect Descovy to continue to play an important role in PrEP, and really look forward to adding lenacapavir as a potential long\u2010 acting alternative for those seeking preventative care, as early as 2025. Onto Slide 9, Biktarvy grew 28% year\u2010over\u2010year to $2.6 billion, primarily driven by strong demand and channel mix. Biktarvy\u2019s market share in the U.S. grew from 40% in Q2 of last year to 44% in the second quarter of 2022, and continues -- by a wide margin -- to be the leading treatment for HIV, as well as the fastest growing. In fact, Biktarvy\u2019s differentiated clinical profile was once again reinforced this past weekend at the International AIDS Conference in Montreal. At five years, Biktarvy had zero cases of treatment failure due to resistance, as well as sustained efficacy and a demonstrated safety profile in people living with HIV. Notably, this 5\u2010year trial duration demonstrating zero cases of resistance is unprecedented for an HIV regimen. Share also increased sequentially, up 1% from the first quarter of 2022, contributing to 19% growth in Biktarvy revenue quarter-over-quarter in addition to the channel mix and the seasonal inventory dynamics we referenced earlier. Moving to Slide 10. HCV sales in the quarter were down 18% year-over-year due to the channel mix leading to lower average realized price and fewer patient starts, partially offset by higher volume in Eastern Europe. Sequentially, HCV was up 12%, driven by the timing of a large order in addition to higher patient start. Overall in HCV, we maintained steady market share of 50% to 60% both in the U.S. as well as Europe. For HBV and HDV on Slide 11, sales were roughly flat quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by unfavorable adjustments associated with the recent volume-based procurement updates in China and offset by higher year-over-year demand and volume growth in all other regions. Veklury revenues in the second quarter were $445 million, as shown on Slide 12. As expected, sales declined both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter as hospitalization rates declined in most geographies. Additionally, U.S. revenue reflected inventory drawdown in the second quarter. While COVID-19 is still prevalent, the most recent subvariants have been less severe and contributed to pure hospitalized patients, although roughly 60% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients that are being treated in the U.S. are receiving Veklury. We continue to be committed to supporting patients with COVID\u201019 globally. Last month, we signed our second Joint Procurement Agreement with the European Commission that enables participating countries to purchase Veklury for a period of up to 18 months. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, adopted a positive opinion recommending Veklury receive full marketing authorization for the treatment of appropriate patients with COVID\u201019. This builds on our prior, conditional authorization, and we look forward to the final decision by the European Commission later this year. We're proud of our track record of meeting global demand for Veklury since the fall of 2020, and will maintain a readiness to supply the clear where it's needed and have increased our full year guidance to reflect anticipated patient need in the second half. Turning to Oncology, and beginning with Trodelvy on Slide 13, sales of $159 million grew 79% year\u2010 over\u2010year and 9% quarter\u2010over\u2010quarter. Sequentially, Trodelvy grew 41% outside the U.S., with particularly strong growth in Germany and France due to increased awareness and adoption. Sequential 7% volume growth in the U.S. was offset by unfavorable pricing dynamics. We expect to see continued growth in the second half, driven by the impact of our expanded sales force in the U.S. as well as reimbursement approvals in the EU. We are committed to broadening access for Trodelvy and continue to work with regulators and payers around the world. We\u2019re pleased with the recent decisions by both NCCN in the U.S. and NICE in the UK, recognizing the significant clinical benefit of Trodelvy in patients with metastatic triple\u2010negative breast cancer based on the Phase 3 ASCENT trial. These decisions add to the building support for Trodelvy\u2019s use following positive Health Technology Assessments in a number of other countries.  Trodelvy is the first ADC to demonstrate statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall survival benefit in this mTNBC patient population. In fact, the NCCN guidelines elevated Trodelvy to a Category 1 recommendation for second\u2010line and later mTNBC, its highest recommendation available. Additionally, while Trodelvy is not approved by FDA for use in the HR-positive/HER2\u2010negative setting, we are pleased that the NCCN has issued a Category 2A recommendation for Trodelvy\u2019s use for these patients with advanced disease.  Turning to Slide 14. I'm pleased to share some incredibly strong results on behalf of Christi and the Kite team. Cell therapy sales for the second quarter were $368 million, up 68% year-over-year and 34% sequentially, driven by a very strong U.S. second-line launch for Yescarta in relapsed or refractory LBCL, which exceeded our expectations and continued strong growth in third-line plus Yescarta. As a reminder, strong data and an NCCN recommendation, which predated the second-line approval, helped drive our impressive early uptake, especially in large volume authorized treatment centers with a high familiarity with CAR T therapies. Additionally, Yescarta second-line LBCL is already available in two other large markets: in France through the early access program and in Germany through reimbursement decisions ahead of approval. The decision on Yescarta second-line LBCL approval in Europe is expected later this fall. Third-line plus LBCL deliveries also increased sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting growing overall awareness and confidence in the use of Yescarta. This follows the presentation of 5-year ZUMA-1 data at last year's American Society of Hematology meeting and more recently, our second-line approval in the U.S. For the quarter overall, Yescarta sales of $295 million were up 66% year-over-year and 40% sequentially. Of note, Yescarta deliveries increased 67% year-over-year and 39% sequentially, demonstrating the effectiveness of Kite's manufacturing expansion strategy and our ability to meet demand for our cell therapies. We're proud of our reputation for consistent and reliable deliveries that further differentiates Kite's cell therapies and was a continued source of strength in Q2. While we saw very strong demand in the first half of 2022, we expect this growth to normalize in Q3 as second-line usage expand beyond the early adopters and more towards community referrals. Turning to Tecartus. Sales for the quarter were $73 million, up 78% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, driven by continued demand and expansion into new geographies for relapsed/refractory mental cell lymphoma as well as uptake in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the U.S. Christi is available for Q&A later on the call. In summary, this was a really strong quarter for the entire Gilead and Kite commercial organization. And so with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline.\nMerdad Parsey : Thank you, Johanna. From a clinical perspective, we made solid progress in the second quarter, including a wealth of data updates spanning our oncology and virology portfolios. Starting with HIV on Slide 16, we are very pleased to share that our NDA submission for lenacapavir for heavily treatment experienced people living with HIV was accepted last week, and we now have a PDUFA date set for the end of December. Outside the U.S., we received a positive CHMP opinion for this indication, based on data from the Phase 2/3 CAPELLA trial. Week 26 data from this trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in May with updated, 1\u2010year data presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections earlier this year. In this very difficult to treat population, 83\u201086% of those treated with lenacapavir achieved virologic suppression at 1\u2010year, sustaining the rates achieved at Week 26. We continue to expect a decision from the European Commission later this year. Looking to Trodelvy on Slide 17. We shared new data at ASCO that increases our confidence in Trodelvy's potential applicability across a broad range of tumor types. These positive data from the Phase 3 ASCENT study reinforced Trodelvy's survival and health-related quality-of-life benefit over treatment of physician's choice in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. We also highlighted positive PFS and quality-of-life data from our Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 study, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 34% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in light-line, endocrine-resistant patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, who had received a median of three prior lines of treatment in the metastatic setting after having failed hormone therapy. This study also demonstrated a positive trend in overall survival at the first interim analysis. The TROPiCS-02 data, coupled with the NCCN recommendation, support Trodelvy's potential as a treatment option for late-line HR-positive/HER2-negative patients. As Dan mentioned, our discussions with the FDA are ongoing on the potential regulatory path, and we'll update you when we can. In the meantime, TROPiCS-02 continues with patients being followed for subsequent planned OS analyses. Separately, we continue to expand our Trodelvy clinical program. We began screening for patients in ASCENT-03, valuing Trodelvy in first-line metastatic TNBC patients who have PD-L1 negative tumors as well as in the ASCENT-04 study evaluating first-line patients with PD-L1 positive metastatic TNBC. Moving to Trodelvy in bladder cancer, the ongoing Phase 3 TROPiCS\u201004 study is our confirmatory trial designed to enable global registration for Trodelvy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. This study follows the encouraging data from TROPHY\u2010U01 supporting accelerated approval of Trodelvy in the U.S. for patients with mUC. Pending results from our first line expansion cohorts in the Phase 2 TROPHY\u2010U01 study, we plan to open two Phase 3 studies in front line mUC. In our Trodelvy lung program, we initiated the Phase 2 EVOKE\u201002 non\u2010small cell lung cancer study in the second quarter evaluating the combination of Trodelvy with Merck\u2018s Keytruda in patients without actionable genomic mutations. Looking forward to the second half of this year, we expect to begin enrolling patients for the Phase 3 EVOKE\u201003 or KEYNOTE\u2010D46 study in first\u2010line non\u2010small cell lung cancer with PD\u2010L1 expression level of greater than equal to 50%, in collaboration with our partners at Merck. Additionally, later this year we expect to initiate several other Trodelvy combinations, including evaluating Trodelvy in castrate\u2010resistant prostate cancer. Moving to magrolimab on Slide 18. We're pleased that both divisions of the FDA have now lifted the partial clinical hold on magrolimab. All magrolimab programs have resumed enrolling patients without FDA requiring any additional protocol changes. Our confidence in magrolimab's potential efficacy and safety profile is unchanged. At ASCO, we shared MDS and AML data from our Phase 1b study when magrolimab continues to demonstrate high and durable response rates in high-risk MDS with encouraging complete response rate of 33% compared with the historical rates of azacitadine alone. We also observed promising efficacy in patients with TP53 mutant AML with an ORR of 49% and a CR of 33%. Notably, our Phase 3 study in front line HR MDS, ENHANCE, is enrolling nicely and we expect the interim analysis no later than early 2023. Moving to cell therapy on Slide 19, and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, it is gratifying to see that more patients are benefiting from our cell therapies given the growing body of clinical evidence. Building on ZUMA\u20107 data, we presented real\u2010world data at ASCO that demonstrated consistent outcomes for survival and safety, regardless of race and ethnicity. And in a sub\u2010analysis of ZUMA\u20107 patients over 65, Yescarta demonstrated more than 8 times greater median Event Free Survival and a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life.  These data further establish the efficacy and safety profile of Yescarta for patients with relapsed or refractory LBCL, and support ongoing exploration of Yescarta in more settings. We expect to enroll our first patient for ZUMA\u201024, a Phase 2 study to evaluate Yescarta in second line LBCL in an outpatient setting, as well as ZUMA\u201023, a Phase 3 study to evaluate Yescarta in first line, high\u2010risk LBCL patients in the second half of this year. Additionally, we expect first-patient-in in a new Phase 3 trial evaluating the use of Yescarta in second line HR follicular lymphoma patients, ZUMA\u201022, later this year. Now to Slide 20. As Dan mentioned, we made steady progress in the first half of the year and continue to focus on clinical execution. The key clinical milestones in the second half include: an update on our regulatory discussions for Trodelvy for late line HR-positive/HER2\u2010negative patients in the US; a number of potential regulatory decisions, including for lenacapavir, Yescarta, and Tecartus; at least six more trial initiations spanning Trodelvy, cell therapy and domvanalimab; as well as several data updates with our partner Arcus, including Phase 2 data from ARC\u20107. Later this year, we also expect to have interim Phase 2 data for etruma from the ARC\u20106 study as well as ARC\u20108\u2019s Phase 2 data for quemli. We are encouraged with early Phase 1 data for GS\u20105245, our investigational novel oral nucleoside in development for the treatment of COVID\u201019. We are discussing these early data with regulatory agencies and are planning to move into the clinic.  We are also pleased to see our earlier stage pipeline with our partners, such as Tizona and Pionyr, continue to advance nicely. For example, Tizona\u2019s HLA\u2010G program is currently enrolling its dose expansion cohorts and Tizona expects to share interim data mid\u20102023. With our robust internal pipeline and external partners, we are confident our portfolio across virology, oncology, and inflammation will deliver many life\u2010changing treatments to help those patients in need.  With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Andy.\nAndrew Dickinson : Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I discuss our second quarter results and starting on Slide 22, I would like to remind everyone that following the SEC guidance earlier this year, similar to our peers, acquired in-process R&D expenses or IP R&D, including upfront payments for business development transactions, are now included in our non-GAAP financial measures and reported under acquired IP R&D. As a reminder, the $300 million payment associated with the Dragonfly collaboration announced in May is included in our Q2 results but was not reflected in our prior 2022 full year guidance. Additionally, we have shifted prior period milestone and opt-in payments from R&D to acquired IP R&D. We believe this presentation better reflects the total costs incurred to acquire IP R&D projects. The most notable example is the $625 million opt-in payment we made to Arcus that we reported in the fourth quarter of last year. There are a few other smaller payments that have been moved, and this slide highlights the changes that you'll now see reflected in our 2021 P&L. I'll further note that this change impacts our 2022 R&D guidance because our R&D guidance is given relative to our 2021 results. I'll touch on that again later in this call. Moving to our second quarter results, starting on Slide 23. This was a very strong quarter with a notable contribution from both our HIV and our oncology businesses. As expected, Veklury sales were substantially lower sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting the lower COVID hospitalization rates in the quarter. Total product sales, excluding Veklury, were up 7% year-over-year. Foreign currency impacted second quarter sales, excluding Veklury, by approximately $65 million net of hedges. If we exclude this impact as well as the impact of the HIV LOEs, total underlying sales growth year-over-year was 11% in the quarter. For the first half, total product sales growth excluding Veklury was 5%. Also excluding FX and the impact of the HIV LOEs, underlying growth for the first half was 8%. Back to our reported results on Slide 24. Johanna took you through our revenue results and the drivers there. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 85.6% for the second quarter, down 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the Biktarvy-related royalty following the settlement in the first quarter of this year. Non-GAAP R&D excluding acquired IP R&D expenses, such as milestones and upfront payments, was $1.1 billion, up 6% year-over-year, primarily due to increased investment in development and timing of clinical trial activities, primarily for our oncology business. Acquired IP R&D for the quarter was $330 million, including $300 million related to the Dragonfly collaboration. Non-GAAP SG&A was $1.3 billion, up 13% year-over-year, primarily due to increased promotional and marketing activities, including for Trodelvy as well as higher corporate expenses, including IT investments and grants. Non-GAAP operating margin was 43%, reflecting higher operating expenses and the upfront Dragonfly payment. Excluding the Dragonfly payment, non-GAAP operating margin was 47.5% for the quarter. Moving to tax, our non\u2010GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 19.3%. Our non\u2010GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.58 in the second quarter of 2022, compared to $1.81 for the same period last year, reflecting the Dragonfly payment, which represented $0.18 on a post\u2010tax per share basis, as well as the Biktarvy\u2010related royalty. Overall, we had a strong first half of the year, as shown on Slide 25, with growth across HIV, cell therapy, and Trodelvy, offset in part by HCV. Of note, currency headwinds impacted first half total product sales by approximately $180 million, net of hedges, compared with the first half of 2021. Moving to Slide 26, we are increasing our full year sales guidance to reflect our year\u2010to\u2010date results and our expectations for the second half, including our expectations for FX. In addition to the impact in the first half, we expect continued FX headwinds in the second half, impacting total product sales by approximately $200 million in the rest of the year, compared to our initial February guidance For revenues, we now expect total product sales of $24.5 billion to $25 billion compared to our previous range of $23.8 billion to $24.3 billion. This reflects the strong performance year-to-date, notably very strong growth in cell therapy and HIV, and it also incorporates our expectations for the broader macro environment. In HIV, we expect modest sequential growth in the third quarter, keeping in mind the strength we experienced in the second quarter. And in cell therapy, we expect flat to modestly higher revenue in the third quarter compared to Q2. Following the launch bolus of orders we experienced in the second quarter, we expect demand to stabilize. Moving to Veklury. And with the first half revenue of almost $2 billion, we're increasing our expectations to approximately $2.5 billion for the year. Following inventory drawdown in the second quarter, we expect sales to increase sequentially in the United States and to continue to track hospitalization rates. Note that our Veklury guidance assumes no significant increase in hospitalization rates from Q2 levels. Excluding Veklury, we expect our total product sales to be $22 billion to $22.5 billion, representing growth of 3% to 5% year-over-year and compared to our prior range of $21.8 billion to $22.3 billion. As for the rest of the non-GAAP P&L, there is no change to our product gross margin guidance range of 85% to 86%. R&D, as described earlier, will no longer include BD-related payments such as milestones and opt-in fees. These will be reported as acquired IP R&D along with upfront payments. With this change, we have moved $762 million of full year 2021 expense from R&D to acquired IP R&D. As a result of this change, we now expect full year R&D expense to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage compared to the new 2021 baseline of $4.5 billion. Our expectations for full year R&D expense remained largely unchanged from the start of the year, and this guidance revision reflects only the recasting of acquired IP R&D items, including Arcus, previously reported in R&D in 2021. Moving to acquired IP R&D. We are not issuing guidance for the full year and similar to what we did with the Dragonfly deal this quarter, we'll update our EPS guidance quarterly as needed to reflect any relevant activity during the quarter. What we have included here is the year-to-date acquired IP R&D amounts. For SG&A, with our continued investment across our commercial organization and expectations for higher costs as a result of inflation, we now expect SG&A expenses to grow by a low single-digit percentage compared to 2021. Altogether, we expect operating income to be $11 billion to $11.6 billion for the full year compared to $10.7 billion to $11.5 billion previously. Similarly, we now expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to range between $6.35 to $6.75, up from $6.20 to $6.70 previously. On a GAAP basis, we expect our diluted earnings per share to range between $2.90 and $3.30 compared to $3 and $3.50 previously, primarily reflecting net unrealized losses from strategic equity investments. As a reminder, this revised EPS guidance reflects the $300 million upfront payment associated with the Dragonfly collaboration we announced in May, which was not included in our previous guidance as well as our FX expectations and operating expenses for the second half. The guidance share today does not include additional upfront payments related to normal course of business partnerships or licensing deals that we might announce in the third or fourth quarters. As discussed previously, we will continue to update our guidance as needed to reflect the impact of any new business development transactions closed in the prior quarter. Finally, on Slide 27, you can see there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. In the quarter, we returned almost $1 billion to shareholders, including $920 million in dividend payments. And just after the close of the quarter, we repaid $1 billion of debt, fulfilling our commitment to repay $1.5 billion of debt this year. I'm pleased to share that as of July 1, we have returned to the same debt level we were at prior to the Immunomedics acquisition. With that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital.\nBrian Abrahams : Congratulations on the quarter. I recognize that the discussions around Trodelvy in HR-positive/HER2-negative population are ongoing. But I'm just wondering, broadly speaking, if you can talk about the key things that you'll be focusing on with regards to the data and if there are certain subpopulations you might expect to gear towards from either a labeling or commercial perspective.\nMerdad Parsey : Brian, this is Merdad. I guess I'll start with that. For us right now, as we go forward with the study, I think we'll continue our focus on, of course, the OS evolution of the trial. And I think as we see how those data evolve over time, we will use that in our discussions with regulators as we go forward. In terms of additional subpopulations, of course, we'll keep an eye on a number of things in terms of whether it's line of therapy or those sorts of subpopulations or duration of prior therapy, which were all part of the original analysis. But those were -- it's consistent with what we've already shown at ASCO and the data that we've presented and shared with you. So it will be consistent with what we've already shown.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\nGeoffrey Meacham : Johanna or Christi, the cell therapy segment which you guys called out had a huge quarter, I'm just curious how much of the demand do you think is sustainable? I mean, was it mostly driven by the new second-line label? Or did the total end market expand meaningfully? I guess I'm trying to figure out whether we reached a tipping point overall for reimbursement access in cell therapy.\nDaniel O'Day : Thanks, Geoff. Christi, over to you, please.\nChristi Shaw : Yes. Thanks, Geoff, for the question. I'll start with the second piece, reimbursement. Our reimbursement is really good. We have 98% access, and that's Medicaid, Medicare and commercial. Even with the second-line launch, in less than one quarter, we already have -- we already had 94% paid for across the three group. So reimburse in terms of the uptake, your first point of your question, the uptake that we've seen since launch is first primarily due to second line. We've seen the patients that are going for stem cell transplants are the ones that are getting referred instead of that transplant to second-line Yescarta. So that is our initial both. So what we expect is we've had this 68% year-over-year growth, 34% quarter-over-quarter. But we do believe that this is a bolus, and we expect the second half of the year going forward that -- we expect that growth to normalize to historical rates as that growth becomes more dependent on the referrals from the community. So we expect it to be still a really good growth, but we do believe that this is a bolus in the second line of the patients that exist in the ADCs and for the rest of the year. Just to reiterate that, that growth will return to more historic growth rates.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren with Cowen.\nTyler Van Buren : Can you guys please provide your latest thoughts regarding the potential impact that drug pricing reform could have on Gilead's business and perhaps Biktarvy in particular given the significant concentration of HIV sales to the product and its longer patent life?\nDaniel O'Day : Yes. Thanks, Tyler. I mean I'll start. This is Dan. I mean, I think it's important for everybody on the call to note that we, as a company, and I think as an industry, are very focused on the fundamental issue in the U.S., which is reducing patient out-of-pocket costs. And there are lots of different ways to do that. Unfortunately, the current legislation falls very short of making an impact upon patients. And in particular, the negotiation part of the proposal is really a -- I think a real dangerous precedent in terms of potentially reducing forward innovation. I think in terms of how -- as you know, Tyler, the bill is still very much in discussion right now, and it's very difficult to determine the full impact. What I would say is, it's several years away, first of all, from the first impact. And of course, in the Part D area of the reform, that could have some impact on our business but also help patient out-of-pocket costs. I think when one starts to think about the negotiation aspect of the bill, it's still, I think, too premature to think about exactly how that could affect, and it is later in the decade in terms of its impact. So let's take it one step at a time, I think, to first see what happens with the current legislation, the discussions going on in Washington. Rest assured that we are actively involved in supporting what we think are patient-oriented benefits here and adjustments to the program. And then once -- and we'll see where that goes over the coming weeks and months, we'll be able to give you even more clarity on how things might impact our business. But overall, I would just emphasize the strength of our portfolio is strong. I mean we have tremendous new innovations coming out of the pipeline. We have continued growth in our HIV business and beyond. And I think the innovation cycle at Gilead is very sound.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Olivia Brayer with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nOlivia Brayer : Are you guys seeing any impact from monkeypox on the HIV business? Is that a headwind you're factoring into guidance at this point for second half of the year?\nJohanna Mercier : Sure, Olivia. It's Johanna. Let me take that one on. Speaking with a lot of our specialists across the U.S. but also in Europe, they have seen obviously the rising number of monkeypox. And there is a correlation with both our HIV treatment business but also with prevention because the general percentage, the higher percentage of folks that are experiencing monkeypox are actually men having sex with men. And so obviously, that's the overlap. So on the contrary, we're not seeing an impact to our HIV business. We're actually seeing more screening and diagnosis that are coming in, in light of that and because of that close association. So I do think -- and the same people are treating. The prevention piece is actually a really important piece of the puzzle to try to prevent moving forward with monkeypox and getting the vaccines in. So definitely more on the positive front of our HIV business and how ever we can support that, that's what we're trying to do right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore.\nUmer Raffat : I had a question on a clarification. First, maybe the question. I think, Merdad, you hinted, you are or you will be discussing early oral Remdesivir data with FDA. I'm curious if you saw any viral load benefit as well as whether the EC90 -- how much EC90 tracks above the C trough. And then clarification was on TIGIT ARC-7 because the slides on last quarter implied we're expecting PFS data -- Phase 2 PFS data in the second half, but today's slides only say Phase 2 data. So maybe if you could clarify if there's still a chance PFS could be part of the data update.\nMerdad Parsey : Yes. Thanks for the questions. So as far as the oral new program for COVID-19 goes, the Phase 1 study is in healthy volunteers. So we don't expect to see anything other than safety and PK in that study. And all I can say is I think things have gone very well with that trial so far both from a tolerability and an exposure standpoint. So we're very happy with where we are. And now we'll move into the proof-of-concept and clinical development stage. So no viral load data to share. And then in terms of the ARC-7 data, I don't think -- I guess I would suggest not overreading. We are working with Arcus, and we will -- as the data roll out, we will be sharing data Arcus, and we will be sharing data from the ARC-7 study later on this year and the data that we will have. We're not really detailing what those data are going to look like right now. But be assured that we'll work with them to show data later this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Harrison : I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about Trodelvy demand in the U.S. Sort of sequentially, growth has slowed pretty significantly over the last couple of quarters here. Is that mostly a reflection that you've penetrated most of the triple-negative market and you need label expansion in that growth? Or are there other factors there from a sequential growth standpoint?\nJohanna Mercier : Thanks, Matthew. It's Johanna. Let me try to give you a little bit more context. So as you saw from a global standpoint, we had really strong growth across the board. A lot of that growth, as you're referring to, comes from some of the market launches in Europe, namely France and Germany, where there's been a bit of a bolus but also real learnings as to making sure that we increase awareness for Trodelvy early on. And so from a U.S. standpoint, we actually did see strong demand growth quarter-over-quarter. We saw it at about 7%. Unfortunately, it got impacted by unfavorable onetime pricing dynamics. And so that's where you see the net revenues are only up 1%. No concerns on our end because we do see the momentum actually continuing from a share standpoint, and we definitely haven't maximized our opportunity in Trodelvy. Let me tell you, I think that with the incredible overall survival data and the only overall survival data that's shown in this patient population, there's a real opportunity for us to educate and increase the awareness. That's something that we've been tracking really closely is that awareness piece. We got a little slowed down through the COVID era just because offices and cancer centers were quite shut down. But having said that, that picked up really quite nicely over the last three to four months and we've expanded our footprint. As you may recall, we close to tripled our footprint as of April-May time frame.  Now obviously, as you know, when you do that, you're not -- you shouldn't expect results, I would love it, but you shouldn't expect results within the first month. It usually takes about six months or so to start seeing those through, and we should see those come through in the fall as well as additional countries getting reimbursement as you've seen from some of the HTA decisions that have come through and launching in Europe as well. So looking forward to that, but definitely more opportunity ahead and definitely on track to make sure we capture that opportunity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Risinger of SVB Securities.\nDavid Risinger : Congrats on the results. So we are obviously in the unfortunate situation in which the government may be working against small molecule innovation in particular, but innovation more broadly. And in light of the possibility that legislation could be signed into law, could you comment on the percentage of Biktarvy net revenue that currently comes from Medicare Part D, just so we have a sense for the potential exposure to Biktarvy drug price controls in 2027?\nDaniel O'Day : Thanks, Dave. Do you want to start with that, Johanna?\nJohanna Mercier : Yes. Let me start with that. So thanks, David, for your question. I think we touched on a little bit about some of the potential impact. Having said that, from a split government to, I guess, commercial business, it's around -- depending on the different pieces, you're looking at around 40%, 50% versus about a 30% commercial. So that -- what I'm including in that is more your Medicaid/Medicare kind of business, and that's what's kind of playing out to your -- as well as your 340B. So I think it's really -- I don't think you should look at it more -- just looking at the percentage of the business. I think it's going to be really interesting to see how all this plays out and when it plays out because it's nothing is really going to impact us for quite some time. I would also suggest that we look at the incredible diversity of our portfolio that we're growing year-on-year and also the geographical diversity as well, which I think will really help mitigate some of these pressures as we go forward. But just from a government business, you are looking probably close to 50% of our total business is in the government setting.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.\nSalveen Richter : On HIV, could you just comment on what's keeping the screening and diagnosis below pre-pandemic levels and whether you'd expect a full recovery by year-end? And separately, could you give us a quick update on where you stand with [long-acting] programs?\nJohanna Mercier : What's the last part? Can you repeat the last part of that question?\nSalveen Richter : Where you stand with the long-acting programs when we might see positive data?\nJohanna Mercier : Yes. Thanks. You cut out a little bit. Apologies. So let me get the first part of that question, and then I'll throw it over to Merdad for the long-acting. So from an HIV screening standpoint, we're about 8% below pre-pandemic levels, so very much in line with kind of where we were pre-2019. From a diagnosis standpoint, what you're seeing is that 30% or so below pre-pandemic, but that's kind of normal. What we've seen in the past, even prior to COVID-19, we're seeing a decline of the diagnosis rate about 10% year-over-year. And so if you think about three years, that's about your 30%. So not a huge surprise there and good news, right, as you're thinking about how this HIV market is -- its evolution. What I would like to focus you on, though, is the fact that from a treatment and PrEP standpoint, we are above pre-pandemic levels from a market growth standpoint. And so we feel very confident that the market has recovered. And actually, in PrEP, it's more than recovered. It's actually higher than it's ever been before. So it's actually an expansion of the market. So I think we're in much better shape, and it's taken a little bit more time for treatment. But I think as of Q2, I can honestly say that it is really in a very good place, which is great news for patients.\nMerdad Parsey : And from a long-acting standpoint, I'd just reiterate with the PDUFA date at the end of the year for lenacapavir in highly treatment experience, I think that will be the first approval, knock wood, for lenacapavir, and I think that gets us started. After that, remember then we have multiple efforts ongoing. On the PrEP side, we have the purpose studies that are underway. Those are longer-term studies because they're prevention studies, so they'll take a little bit longer to read out. We're looking at few years there, a couple of years, at least for those studies. And then on the treatment side, we are -- we have a number of shots on goal there, both oral long-acting as well as subcutaneous long-acting. And there, we are -- we have our own efforts. And you may have noticed we have a number of partner molecules that are coming through our pipeline that could be partnered with lenacapavir for a full treatment regimen that would include lenacapavir. And we continue to work with Merck on the potential for lenacapavir combinations with islatravir. So a lot of different options and a lot of work that's ongoing. And as those progress further along, we'll keep you updated.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies.\nMichael Yee : One question but two parts. On Trodelvy, maybe Andy or Merdad, you could remind us, have you actually met with FDA on the potential filing? Or what's the holdup there? And how soon is soon to hear back at this? And I think you've already taken a write-down if it was not to be filed, so that would be a different scenario there. But I don't think there'll be any further write-downs if that was the case. And then maybe just comment on lung cancer opportunity. I think in your slide, you say there would be Phase 3 data in lung cancer next year, and I know that EGS read out next year as well. So just wanted to understand that and your confidence level in lung cancer.\nMerdad Parsey : Thanks, Michael. Thanks for the questions. So on Trodelvy, yes, I think nothing has changed from what we said earlier in that we are excited about the data that we generate in TROPiCS-02 and are having ongoing discussions with the agency. And I think if things continue to go well, we will discuss with them the potential for filing. We're cautiously optimistic that, that should be able to continue to go forward, and we'll be able to update you in due course. In terms of lung, the primary focus for us in lung is actually the initiation of our Phase 3 trials in lung. Whether it's the combination trials I referenced earlier with Merck or some of the other combinations that we're doing, we will have some additional data in line that will be coming -- that will be generated over time. But I think the focus should be on those Phase 3 studies that we'll be reading out. And then maybe, Andy, do you want to address the write-downs?\nAndrew Dickinson : Sure. Yes, I'd be happy. Michael, thanks for the question. As you recall, we took a conservative approach to the write-down that we took earlier this year as we looked at the potential path forward. We will continue to monitor on a quarterly basis as we have historically and as we should the progress on the program both in lung cancer and in hormone-receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, both of which we had caring value on the balance sheet and IP R&D, as you know. So we'll continue to monitor it over time. And each major event, whether it's regulatory discussions or filings or potential approvals, we'll look at that value. Again, we remain confident in the program overall, like where the program is going, and we'll update you as soon as we can on our discussions with the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Seedhouse with Raymond James.\nSteven Seedhouse : I had another one on Yescarta just given the strong second line launch. I was wondering how you view the market size or opportunity in second line versus some of the potential upcoming opportunities, ZUMA-23 or -24 populations and outpatients high-risk, first-line and if those could be similar legs up and just how you're thinking about the sort of peak overall opportunity here for Yescarta?\nDaniel O'Day : Great. Thanks. Christi, over to you.\nChristi Shaw : Thank you for the question, Steve. It's really great news for patients right now. Not only is Yescarta being used, but more importantly, we're seeing the class grow. So the use of cell therapy overall is growing, which means instead of the two out of 10 patients receiving cell therapy, more are. And that was really -- the impetus for that was really the second-line approval in April. Also all of the data that you saw at ASH with our ZUMA 5-year data -- ZUMA-1 5-year data of overall survival, ZUMA-7 second-line NCCN guidelines, Yescarta being the only Category 1 NCCN product approved for second line. So we do see that this momentum is starting to happen, where it is the only curative potential that physicians have in this grave disease safer patients. So as we look to the future, we're very optimistic that we're trying to get this closer to patients in the outpatient setting, which we are doing through clinical trials. And also some of our authorized treatment centers have already published their data on utilization of Yescarta in the outpatient setting, i.e. Vanderbilt. And as we look at the frontline setting, we're in negotiations right now with the regulatory authorities on exactly how do we define high risk for that trial. So I do think we're finally starting to realize the potential of this curative therapy for patients. And I think that this will continue. I will say, though, that this bolus is -- I'll reiterate what I said before. This is a bolus, we believe, with the second-line launch of this pent-up demand in the [HCC] treating patients who are immune to authorized treatment centers, stem cell transplant. So the heavy lifting is over. We have a lot of work to do to educate physicians in the community to ensure that they're referring patients to treatment centers at a timely fashion. So we do have work to do in education, and that's included in the community and also the -- as we launch in multiple countries across the globe. So we do see a steady growth continuing for the next quarters and years to come.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays.\nCarter Gould : I guess one question, one clarification. First on sort of the CAR T business, can you just talk about the phasing of the supply ramp on the manufacturing side to the extent that might help out this year? Should we think about that really just sort of weighted to year-end? And I guess in answering that, if you could also address sort of the EU manufacturing side, we don't hear much on that. And then on the clarification piece, Johanna, I appreciate the comments on sort of the 50% government for Biktarvy. But could you spell out, I guess, Medicare versus Medicaid there? It's been getting a lot of incoming on that.\nDaniel O'Day : Great. Christi, do you want to start and then we'll move to the\u2026.\nChristi Shaw : Happy to. So one of the things we're probably particularly proud of is our ability to supply patients both consistently, reliably into the high-quality standards. And that started with El Segundo, California. But to your point, in the EU, Amsterdam is now supplying all of Europe for Yescarta, and they're starting to do Tecartus as well. And so we expect all of the manufacturing for European patients to move to the Amsterdam site by the end of this year. In addition, we just opened the Maryland site, which is the first time we'll actually have automation. One of our -- one of two modules of automation is up and running in Maryland. And that had -- that Maryland site has allowed us to actually increase our number of slots for patients by 50%. So we feel very confident that we not only can provide patients for what we have today, but what we have in the future and for the future ramp-up that we have plenty of capacity to supply and continue to ensure that we have the high-quality standards. The last piece I'll say on supply is we made a decision about 2.5, three years ago to bring in viral vector at Oceanside, California. So we're not at the whim of ups and downs, if you will, of viral vector supply. So we have both internal and external ability to ensure that we can keep that continuity for patients and not be disrupted.\nDaniel O'Day : Thanks, Christi. Over to you, Johanna.\nJohanna Mercier : Yes. Thanks. So just to clarify, and thanks for allowing me the opportunity, Carter, and maybe give a little bit more insight to the question. I gave you full numbers on government, but obviously, not all of those numbers get impacted by this reform or what we think might be the reform that we're talking about. And so from a Medicaid standpoint, it's less than 20% of our total business. And so that's really what we should focus on as we think about potential for impact. And again, that impact doesn't happen anytime soon. It's really later in this decade. Dan, did you want to add?\nDaniel O'Day : I'll just add. Thanks, Carter. I know there's a lot of moving parts here, so I just want to kind of reinforce a couple of things. As you know, there are three different aspects of the bill. I mean one is, of course, the Part D reform. And here, a major difference from what occurs today, instead of 10% in the catastrophic phase, it goes to 20% in catastrophic phase. It is potentially in the second half of the [decade]. I think something -- from our perspective, that as we look at our business is quite manageable. The second thing is inflation rebate, which I think we would have a low to 0 exposure to. And then the third one is negotiation. I just want to be clear on negotiations. There's a lot of moving parts here. And to Johanna's point, it does not affect the entirety of the government business. Much of the government business is already contracted and under negotiation. And so I really think -- and I'm sure you'll find this with most companies that it's extraordinarily difficult to measure that impact. It also compressed later in the decade. And there's quite a bit of ambiguity about what's products and how and when. And there'll be a lot of discussions should this legislation be passed about the details associated with that. So again, as much as I believe this is not the right thing to do for the industry, I also believe that we've got a very robust underlying business here and that these impacts are not short term at this stage. So, yes. And just to be clear, on that 20% figure that's...\nJohanna Mercier: Medicare, Medicaid.\nDaniel O'Day : Sorry?\nJohanna Mercier : Medicaid, Medicare.\nDaniel O'Day : Right.\nJacquie Ross: Andrea, we still have a couple of minutes. So we will take one last question Andrea please.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal : So maybe, Johanna, if you can talk a little bit about the COVID trends in PrEP market. So I know last couple of years, you took a little bit of price decline just to maintain market share. So where do you stand on the pricing? Has it stabilized at this point? And where does the market share of Descovy versus Truvada in this market stand at this point?\nJohanna Mercier : Sure. So let me take that one, Mohit. The -- so basically from a market share standpoint, we basically -- we lost maybe a point or so over the last year, but we're at about 44% market share for Descovy in PrEP, which I think is pretty incredible if you think about the generic competition that we've been facing. The balance of that market share right now is pretty much all Truvada, Truvada generics. There's about less than 1% if you think of aptitude as you think about new entrants in the marketplace. So it's really a mix of Descovy for PrEP as well as Truvada genericization. The -- from a pricing standpoint, what you were referring to, the -- it has stabilized, although the rebates are definitely higher than what we were doing in the past just because there's choice now. And we are really trying to ensure that Descovy is a choice for physicians when people at risk need something. And so we want to make sure that that's an option for them and making sure that we have the best on the marketplace with -- if you think about the bone and renal safety profile that Descovy can offer. So that's really why we've been playing in that field, and that's why it's come -- it's put a little bit of more pressure on the commercial fund, specifically on the rebate front. And so I think that's stabilizing, but every year is a new year as we enter negotiations, so more to come as we go into 2023. But for 2022, we're in good shape. And we're also leveraging the incredible market growth for prevention that's been playing out. So all the things are very positive things for Descovy in prevention as well as for people at risk.\nDaniel O'Day : Great. So thanks so much for joining today. I just want to thank you again. I just want to reinforce what a strong quarter this was and thank the team for really significant momentum, I would say, in our business. You saw our first quarter or second quarter. We're committed to delivering quarter after quarter on this on both the commercial execution of the pipeline side and really excited about where we stand right now and where we're heading. With that, I'll turn it over to Jacquie for some closing comments.\nJacquie Ross : Thanks, Dan, and thank you all for joining us today. Please do feel free to reach out to Investor Relations if you have any follow-up questions on the quarter. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call.

This was a very strong quarter for our business, delivering revenue of US$6.1 billion. Excluding Veklury, total product sales grew 7% year-over-year. If we look at the underlying business and also exclude the impact of the HIV LOEs and the currency headwinds in the second quarter, growth was actually 11%. Our HIV portfolio continues to deliver, and this quarter was no exception with higher demand for both treatment and PrEP. Biktarvy sales grew by 28% year-over-year, and we expect to see continued market growth for treatment and prevention with the ongoing market recovery. This was a record quarter for our oncology business. Revenues topped $0.5 billion for the first time with a strong contribution from Trodelvy and a standout performance by our cell therapies. Yescarta was approved by the FDA for second-line relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma in April. This increased awareness and go demand not only for Yescarta's second-line patients but also for those in later lines of treatment. Yescarta is a potentially curative therapy, and Kite has uniquely and effectively scaled manufacturing to meet the needs of patients through the benefit. Turning to our clinical progress. Our NDA submission has been accepted by the FDA for lenacapavir for heavily treatment-experienced people living with HIV, and we are now expecting the decision in late December. If approved, lenacapavir will be the first approved cased inhibitor and the first therapy with a 6-month dosing schedule for HIV treatment. Moving to Trodelvy. We are in discussions with the FDA regarding a potential regulatory pathway for late-stage hormone-receptor-positive/HER2-negative patients, and we will update you as things progress. We have also begun screening patients in ASCENT-3 and ASCENT-4 evaluating Trodelvy in the first-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients. We dosed the first patient in our new Phase 2 study evaluating Trodelvy in non-small cell lung cancer, EVOKE\u201002. And earlier this month, we dosed the first patient in a new Trodelvy combination arm in our ongoing magrolimab triple-negative breast cancer study. Also from magrolimab, we are targeting an interim analysis no later than early 2023 for ENHANCE, our Phase 3 study in first-line, high-risk MDS. Additionally, we dosed the first patient for ENHANCE-3, a Phase 3 magrolimab study for first-line unfit AML. Moving to Slide 5. Later this year, we expect to initiate an additional 5 studies for Trodelvy in a mix of monotherapy and combination studies. We also plan to start enrolling patients in three cell therapy trials and two domvanalimab combination trials. The extent of existing and planned studies really highlights the scale of our ambitious oncology program. I want to take this opportunity to thank the teams across Gilead and Kite for a terrific quarter of commercial execution and for the continued momentum in our clinical programs to continue to lay the critical groundwork for Gilead's future success. With that, I'll invite Johanna to share an update on our second quarter commercial performance. Thanks, Geoff. Christi, over to you, please. Yes. Thanks, Tyler. I mean I'll start. This is Dan. I mean, I think it's important for everybody on the call to note that we, as a company, and I think as an industry, are very focused on the fundamental issue in the U.S., which is reducing patient out-of-pocket costs. And there are lots of different ways to do that. Unfortunately, the current legislation falls very short of making an impact upon patients. And in particular, the negotiation part of the proposal is really a -- I think a real dangerous precedent in terms of potentially reducing forward innovation. I think in terms of how -- as you know, Tyler, the bill is still very much in discussion right now, and it's very difficult to determine the full impact. What I would say is, it's several years away, first of all, from the first impact. And of course, in the Part D area of the reform, that could have some impact on our business but also help patient out-of-pocket costs. I think when one starts to think about the negotiation aspect of the bill, it's still, I think, too premature to think about exactly how that could affect, and it is later in the decade in terms of its impact. So let's take it one step at a time, I think, to first see what happens with the current legislation, the discussions going on in Washington. Rest assured that we are actively involved in supporting what we think are patient-oriented benefits here and adjustments to the program. And then once -- and we'll see where that goes over the coming weeks and months, we'll be able to give you even more clarity on how things might impact our business. But overall, I would just emphasize the strength of our portfolio is strong. I mean we have tremendous new innovations coming out of the pipeline. We have continued growth in our HIV business and beyond. And I think the innovation cycle at Gilead is very sound. Thanks, Dave. Do you want to start with that, Johanna? Great. Thanks. Christi, over to you. Great. Christi, do you want to start and then we'll move to the.... Thanks, Christi. Over to you, Johanna. I'll just add. Thanks, Carter. I know there's a lot of moving parts here, so I just want to kind of reinforce a couple of things. As you know, there are three different aspects of the bill. I mean one is, of course, the Part D reform. And here, a major difference from what occurs today, instead of 10% in the catastrophic phase, it goes to 20% in catastrophic phase. It is potentially in the second half of the [decade]. I think something -- from our perspective, that as we look at our business is quite manageable. The second thing is inflation rebate, which I think we would have a low to 0 exposure to. And then the third one is negotiation. I just want to be clear on negotiations. There's a lot of moving parts here. And to Johanna's point, it does not affect the entirety of the government business. Much of the government business is already contracted and under negotiation. And so I really think -- and I'm sure you'll find this with most companies that it's extraordinarily difficult to measure that impact. It also compressed later in the decade. And there's quite a bit of ambiguity about what's products and how and when. And there'll be a lot of discussions should this legislation be passed about the details associated with that. So again, as much as I believe this is not the right thing to do for the industry, I also believe that we've got a very robust underlying business here and that these impacts are not short term at this stage. So, yes. And just to be clear, on that 20% figure that's... Sorry? Right. Great. So thanks so much for joining today. I just want to thank you again. I just want to reinforce what a strong quarter this was and thank the team for really significant momentum, I would say, in our business. You saw our first quarter or second quarter. We're committed to delivering quarter after quarter on this on both the commercial execution of the pipeline side and really excited about where we stand right now and where we're heading. With that, I'll turn it over to Jacquie for some closing comments."

            "name": "Johanna Mercier",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. We had a very strong second quarter with total product sales excluding Veklury of $5.7 billion, up 7% year-over-year, driven by HIV, cell therapy and Trodelvy and offset in part by HCV. Sequentially, total product sales excluding Veklury were up 14%, driven by the seasonal pricing and inventory dynamics we see coming out of the first quarter of every year, primarily in our HIV business, as well as higher demand across our total portfolio. On Slide 8, HIV sales were up 7% year-over-year to $4.2 billion, primarily driven by channel mix associated with lower government utilization, leading to a higher average realized price as well as higher demand for both treatment and PrEP. Excluding the impact of the loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla, HIV sales increased 11%. Quarter\u2010over\u2010quarter, HIV sales were up 14%, due to demand and channel mix leading to higher average realized price as well as the favorable seasonal inventory dynamics that we typically see in the second quarter relative to the first. Year\u2010over\u2010year, the HIV treatment market grew over 4% in the U.S., and was largely flat in Europe but, sequentially grew over 2% in the U.S. and 1% in Europe. We're encouraged to see the market recovering and, on a year\u2010over\u2010year basis, continue to expect annual treatment market growth in the 2% to 3% range. Descovy sales in the second quarter were $460 million, up 6% year\u2010over\u2010year and 23% sequentially. We are pleased to see continued PrEP market growth with broader awareness and market volumes that are well above pre\u2010pandemic levels. For the quarter, the overall market growth was up 25% year\u2010over\u2010year, and 5% sequentially, highlighting both robust recovery and growing adoption of PrEP. Despite generic and other market participants, Descovy share in PrEP is holding in the mid\u201040 percent range. As awareness continues to grow and the overall market expands, we expect Descovy to continue to play an important role in PrEP, and really look forward to adding lenacapavir as a potential long\u2010 acting alternative for those seeking preventative care, as early as 2025. Onto Slide 9, Biktarvy grew 28% year\u2010over\u2010year to $2.6 billion, primarily driven by strong demand and channel mix. Biktarvy's market share in the U.S. grew from 40% in Q2 of last year to 44% in the second quarter of 2022, and continues -- by a wide margin -- to be the leading treatment for HIV, as well as the fastest growing. In fact, Biktarvy's differentiated clinical profile was once again reinforced this past weekend at the International AIDS Conference in Montreal. At five years, Biktarvy had zero cases of treatment failure due to resistance, as well as sustained efficacy and a demonstrated safety profile in people living with HIV. Notably, this 5\u2010year trial duration demonstrating zero cases of resistance is unprecedented for an HIV regimen. Share also increased sequentially, up 1% from the first quarter of 2022, contributing to 19% growth in Biktarvy revenue quarter-over-quarter in addition to the channel mix and the seasonal inventory dynamics we referenced earlier. Moving to Slide 10. HCV sales in the quarter were down 18% year-over-year due to the channel mix leading to lower average realized price and fewer patient starts, partially offset by higher volume in Eastern Europe. Sequentially, HCV was up 12%, driven by the timing of a large order in addition to higher patient start. Overall in HCV, we maintained steady market share of 50% to 60% both in the U.S. as well as Europe. For HBV and HDV on Slide 11, sales were roughly flat quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by unfavorable adjustments associated with the recent volume-based procurement updates in China and offset by higher year-over-year demand and volume growth in all other regions. Veklury revenues in the second quarter were $445 million, as shown on Slide 12. As expected, sales declined both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter as hospitalization rates declined in most geographies. Additionally, U.S. revenue reflected inventory drawdown in the second quarter. While COVID-19 is still prevalent, the most recent subvariants have been less severe and contributed to pure hospitalized patients, although roughly 60% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients that are being treated in the U.S. are receiving Veklury. We continue to be committed to supporting patients with COVID\u201019 globally. Last month, we signed our second Joint Procurement Agreement with the European Commission that enables participating countries to purchase Veklury for a period of up to 18 months. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, adopted a positive opinion recommending Veklury receive full marketing authorization for the treatment of appropriate patients with COVID\u201019. This builds on our prior, conditional authorization, and we look forward to the final decision by the European Commission later this year. We're proud of our track record of meeting global demand for Veklury since the fall of 2020, and will maintain a readiness to supply the clear where it's needed and have increased our full year guidance to reflect anticipated patient need in the second half. Turning to Oncology, and beginning with Trodelvy on Slide 13, sales of $159 million grew 79% year\u2010 over\u2010year and 9% quarter\u2010over\u2010quarter. Sequentially, Trodelvy grew 41% outside the U.S., with particularly strong growth in Germany and France due to increased awareness and adoption. Sequential 7% volume growth in the U.S. was offset by unfavorable pricing dynamics. We expect to see continued growth in the second half, driven by the impact of our expanded sales force in the U.S. as well as reimbursement approvals in the EU. We are committed to broadening access for Trodelvy and continue to work with regulators and payers around the world. We're pleased with the recent decisions by both NCCN in the U.S. and NICE in the UK, recognizing the significant clinical benefit of Trodelvy in patients with metastatic triple\u2010negative breast cancer based on the Phase 3 ASCENT trial. These decisions add to the building support for Trodelvy's use following positive Health Technology Assessments in a number of other countries.  Trodelvy is the first ADC to demonstrate statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall survival benefit in this mTNBC patient population. In fact, the NCCN guidelines elevated Trodelvy to a Category 1 recommendation for second\u2010line and later mTNBC, its highest recommendation available. Additionally, while Trodelvy is not approved by FDA for use in the HR-positive/HER2\u2010negative setting, we are pleased that the NCCN has issued a Category 2A recommendation for Trodelvy's use for these patients with advanced disease.  Turning to Slide 14. I'm pleased to share some incredibly strong results on behalf of Christi and the Kite team. Cell therapy sales for the second quarter were $368 million, up 68% year-over-year and 34% sequentially, driven by a very strong U.S. second-line launch for Yescarta in relapsed or refractory LBCL, which exceeded our expectations and continued strong growth in third-line plus Yescarta. As a reminder, strong data and an NCCN recommendation, which predated the second-line approval, helped drive our impressive early uptake, especially in large volume authorized treatment centers with a high familiarity with CAR T therapies. Additionally, Yescarta second-line LBCL is already available in two other large markets: in France through the early access program and in Germany through reimbursement decisions ahead of approval. The decision on Yescarta second-line LBCL approval in Europe is expected later this fall. Third-line plus LBCL deliveries also increased sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting growing overall awareness and confidence in the use of Yescarta. This follows the presentation of 5-year ZUMA-1 data at last year's American Society of Hematology meeting and more recently, our second-line approval in the U.S. For the quarter overall, Yescarta sales of $295 million were up 66% year-over-year and 40% sequentially. Of note, Yescarta deliveries increased 67% year-over-year and 39% sequentially, demonstrating the effectiveness of Kite's manufacturing expansion strategy and our ability to meet demand for our cell therapies. We're proud of our reputation for consistent and reliable deliveries that further differentiates Kite's cell therapies and was a continued source of strength in Q2. While we saw very strong demand in the first half of 2022, we expect this growth to normalize in Q3 as second-line usage expand beyond the early adopters and more towards community referrals. Turning to Tecartus. Sales for the quarter were $73 million, up 78% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, driven by continued demand and expansion into new geographies for relapsed/refractory mental cell lymphoma as well as uptake in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the U.S. Christi is available for Q&A later on the call. In summary, this was a really strong quarter for the entire Gilead and Kite commercial organization. And so with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline. Sure, Olivia. It's Johanna. Let me take that one on. Speaking with a lot of our specialists across the U.S. but also in Europe, they have seen obviously the rising number of monkeypox. And there is a correlation with both our HIV treatment business but also with prevention because the general percentage, the higher percentage of folks that are experiencing monkeypox are actually men having sex with men. And so obviously, that's the overlap. So on the contrary, we're not seeing an impact to our HIV business. We're actually seeing more screening and diagnosis that are coming in, in light of that and because of that close association. So I do think -- and the same people are treating. The prevention piece is actually a really important piece of the puzzle to try to prevent moving forward with monkeypox and getting the vaccines in. So definitely more on the positive front of our HIV business and how ever we can support that, that's what we're trying to do right now. Thanks, Matthew. It's Johanna. Let me try to give you a little bit more context. So as you saw from a global standpoint, we had really strong growth across the board. A lot of that growth, as you're referring to, comes from some of the market launches in Europe, namely France and Germany, where there's been a bit of a bolus but also real learnings as to making sure that we increase awareness for Trodelvy early on. And so from a U.S. standpoint, we actually did see strong demand growth quarter-over-quarter. We saw it at about 7%. Unfortunately, it got impacted by unfavorable onetime pricing dynamics. And so that's where you see the net revenues are only up 1%. No concerns on our end because we do see the momentum actually continuing from a share standpoint, and we definitely haven't maximized our opportunity in Trodelvy. Let me tell you, I think that with the incredible overall survival data and the only overall survival data that's shown in this patient population, there's a real opportunity for us to educate and increase the awareness. That's something that we've been tracking really closely is that awareness piece. We got a little slowed down through the COVID era just because offices and cancer centers were quite shut down. But having said that, that picked up really quite nicely over the last three to four months and we've expanded our footprint. As you may recall, we close to tripled our footprint as of April-May time frame.  Now obviously, as you know, when you do that, you're not -- you shouldn't expect results, I would love it, but you shouldn't expect results within the first month. It usually takes about six months or so to start seeing those through, and we should see those come through in the fall as well as additional countries getting reimbursement as you've seen from some of the HTA decisions that have come through and launching in Europe as well. So looking forward to that, but definitely more opportunity ahead and definitely on track to make sure we capture that opportunity. Yes. Let me start with that. So thanks, David, for your question. I think we touched on a little bit about some of the potential impact. Having said that, from a split government to, I guess, commercial business, it's around -- depending on the different pieces, you're looking at around 40%, 50% versus about a 30% commercial. So that -- what I'm including in that is more your Medicaid/Medicare kind of business, and that's what's kind of playing out to your -- as well as your 340B. So I think it's really -- I don't think you should look at it more -- just looking at the percentage of the business. I think it's going to be really interesting to see how all this plays out and when it plays out because it's nothing is really going to impact us for quite some time. I would also suggest that we look at the incredible diversity of our portfolio that we're growing year-on-year and also the geographical diversity as well, which I think will really help mitigate some of these pressures as we go forward. But just from a government business, you are looking probably close to 50% of our total business is in the government setting. What's the last part? Can you repeat the last part of that question? Yes. Thanks. You cut out a little bit. Apologies. So let me get the first part of that question, and then I'll throw it over to Merdad for the long-acting. So from an HIV screening standpoint, we're about 8% below pre-pandemic levels, so very much in line with kind of where we were pre-2019. From a diagnosis standpoint, what you're seeing is that 30% or so below pre-pandemic, but that's kind of normal. What we've seen in the past, even prior to COVID-19, we're seeing a decline of the diagnosis rate about 10% year-over-year. And so if you think about three years, that's about your 30%. So not a huge surprise there and good news, right, as you're thinking about how this HIV market is -- its evolution. What I would like to focus you on, though, is the fact that from a treatment and PrEP standpoint, we are above pre-pandemic levels from a market growth standpoint. And so we feel very confident that the market has recovered. And actually, in PrEP, it's more than recovered. It's actually higher than it's ever been before. So it's actually an expansion of the market. So I think we're in much better shape, and it's taken a little bit more time for treatment. But I think as of Q2, I can honestly say that it is really in a very good place, which is great news for patients. Yes. Thanks. So just to clarify, and thanks for allowing me the opportunity, Carter, and maybe give a little bit more insight to the question. I gave you full numbers on government, but obviously, not all of those numbers get impacted by this reform or what we think might be the reform that we're talking about. And so from a Medicaid standpoint, it's less than 20% of our total business. And so that's really what we should focus on as we think about potential for impact. And again, that impact doesn't happen anytime soon. It's really later in this decade. Dan, did you want to add? Medicare, Medicaid. Medicaid, Medicare. Sure. So let me take that one, Mohit. The -- so basically from a market share standpoint, we basically -- we lost maybe a point or so over the last year, but we're at about 44% market share for Descovy in PrEP, which I think is pretty incredible if you think about the generic competition that we've been facing. The balance of that market share right now is pretty much all Truvada, Truvada generics. There's about less than 1% if you think of aptitude as you think about new entrants in the marketplace. So it's really a mix of Descovy for PrEP as well as Truvada genericization. The -- from a pricing standpoint, what you were referring to, the -- it has stabilized, although the rebates are definitely higher than what we were doing in the past just because there's choice now. And we are really trying to ensure that Descovy is a choice for physicians when people at risk need something. And so we want to make sure that that's an option for them and making sure that we have the best on the marketplace with -- if you think about the bone and renal safety profile that Descovy can offer. So that's really why we've been playing in that field, and that's why it's come -- it's put a little bit of more pressure on the commercial fund, specifically on the rebate front. And so I think that's stabilizing, but every year is a new year as we enter negotiations, so more to come as we go into 2023. But for 2022, we're in good shape. And we're also leveraging the incredible market growth for prevention that's been playing out. So all the things are very positive things for Descovy in prevention as well as for people at risk."

            "name": "Andrew Dickinson",
            "content": "Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I discuss our second quarter results and starting on Slide 22, I would like to remind everyone that following the SEC guidance earlier this year, similar to our peers, acquired in-process R&D expenses or IP R&D, including upfront payments for business development transactions, are now included in our non-GAAP financial measures and reported under acquired IP R&D. As a reminder, the $300 million payment associated with the Dragonfly collaboration announced in May is included in our Q2 results but was not reflected in our prior 2022 full year guidance. Additionally, we have shifted prior period milestone and opt-in payments from R&D to acquired IP R&D. We believe this presentation better reflects the total costs incurred to acquire IP R&D projects. The most notable example is the $625 million opt-in payment we made to Arcus that we reported in the fourth quarter of last year. There are a few other smaller payments that have been moved, and this slide highlights the changes that you'll now see reflected in our 2021 P&L. I'll further note that this change impacts our 2022 R&D guidance because our R&D guidance is given relative to our 2021 results. I'll touch on that again later in this call. Moving to our second quarter results, starting on Slide 23. This was a very strong quarter with a notable contribution from both our HIV and our oncology businesses. As expected, Veklury sales were substantially lower sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting the lower COVID hospitalization rates in the quarter. Total product sales, excluding Veklury, were up 7% year-over-year. Foreign currency impacted second quarter sales, excluding Veklury, by approximately $65 million net of hedges. If we exclude this impact as well as the impact of the HIV LOEs, total underlying sales growth year-over-year was 11% in the quarter. For the first half, total product sales growth excluding Veklury was 5%. Also excluding FX and the impact of the HIV LOEs, underlying growth for the first half was 8%. Back to our reported results on Slide 24. Johanna took you through our revenue results and the drivers there. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 85.6% for the second quarter, down 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the Biktarvy-related royalty following the settlement in the first quarter of this year. Non-GAAP R&D excluding acquired IP R&D expenses, such as milestones and upfront payments, was $1.1 billion, up 6% year-over-year, primarily due to increased investment in development and timing of clinical trial activities, primarily for our oncology business. Acquired IP R&D for the quarter was $330 million, including $300 million related to the Dragonfly collaboration. Non-GAAP SG&A was $1.3 billion, up 13% year-over-year, primarily due to increased promotional and marketing activities, including for Trodelvy as well as higher corporate expenses, including IT investments and grants. Non-GAAP operating margin was 43%, reflecting higher operating expenses and the upfront Dragonfly payment. Excluding the Dragonfly payment, non-GAAP operating margin was 47.5% for the quarter. Moving to tax, our non\u2010GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 19.3%. Our non\u2010GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.58 in the second quarter of 2022, compared to $1.81 for the same period last year, reflecting the Dragonfly payment, which represented $0.18 on a post\u2010tax per share basis, as well as the Biktarvy\u2010related royalty. Overall, we had a strong first half of the year, as shown on Slide 25, with growth across HIV, cell therapy, and Trodelvy, offset in part by HCV. Of note, currency headwinds impacted first half total product sales by approximately $180 million, net of hedges, compared with the first half of 2021. Moving to Slide 26, we are increasing our full year sales guidance to reflect our year\u2010to\u2010date results and our expectations for the second half, including our expectations for FX. In addition to the impact in the first half, we expect continued FX headwinds in the second half, impacting total product sales by approximately $200 million in the rest of the year, compared to our initial February guidance For revenues, we now expect total product sales of $24.5 billion to $25 billion compared to our previous range of $23.8 billion to $24.3 billion. This reflects the strong performance year-to-date, notably very strong growth in cell therapy and HIV, and it also incorporates our expectations for the broader macro environment. In HIV, we expect modest sequential growth in the third quarter, keeping in mind the strength we experienced in the second quarter. And in cell therapy, we expect flat to modestly higher revenue in the third quarter compared to Q2. Following the launch bolus of orders we experienced in the second quarter, we expect demand to stabilize. Moving to Veklury. And with the first half revenue of almost $2 billion, we're increasing our expectations to approximately $2.5 billion for the year. Following inventory drawdown in the second quarter, we expect sales to increase sequentially in the United States and to continue to track hospitalization rates. Note that our Veklury guidance assumes no significant increase in hospitalization rates from Q2 levels. Excluding Veklury, we expect our total product sales to be $22 billion to $22.5 billion, representing growth of 3% to 5% year-over-year and compared to our prior range of $21.8 billion to $22.3 billion. As for the rest of the non-GAAP P&L, there is no change to our product gross margin guidance range of 85% to 86%. R&D, as described earlier, will no longer include BD-related payments such as milestones and opt-in fees. These will be reported as acquired IP R&D along with upfront payments. With this change, we have moved $762 million of full year 2021 expense from R&D to acquired IP R&D. As a result of this change, we now expect full year R&D expense to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage compared to the new 2021 baseline of $4.5 billion. Our expectations for full year R&D expense remained largely unchanged from the start of the year, and this guidance revision reflects only the recasting of acquired IP R&D items, including Arcus, previously reported in R&D in 2021. Moving to acquired IP R&D. We are not issuing guidance for the full year and similar to what we did with the Dragonfly deal this quarter, we'll update our EPS guidance quarterly as needed to reflect any relevant activity during the quarter. What we have included here is the year-to-date acquired IP R&D amounts. For SG&A, with our continued investment across our commercial organization and expectations for higher costs as a result of inflation, we now expect SG&A expenses to grow by a low single-digit percentage compared to 2021. Altogether, we expect operating income to be $11 billion to $11.6 billion for the full year compared to $10.7 billion to $11.5 billion previously. Similarly, we now expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to range between $6.35 to $6.75, up from $6.20 to $6.70 previously. On a GAAP basis, we expect our diluted earnings per share to range between $2.90 and $3.30 compared to $3 and $3.50 previously, primarily reflecting net unrealized losses from strategic equity investments. As a reminder, this revised EPS guidance reflects the $300 million upfront payment associated with the Dragonfly collaboration we announced in May, which was not included in our previous guidance as well as our FX expectations and operating expenses for the second half. The guidance share today does not include additional upfront payments related to normal course of business partnerships or licensing deals that we might announce in the third or fourth quarters. As discussed previously, we will continue to update our guidance as needed to reflect the impact of any new business development transactions closed in the prior quarter. Finally, on Slide 27, you can see there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. In the quarter, we returned almost $1 billion to shareholders, including $920 million in dividend payments. And just after the close of the quarter, we repaid $1 billion of debt, fulfilling our commitment to repay $1.5 billion of debt this year. I'm pleased to share that as of July 1, we have returned to the same debt level we were at prior to the Immunomedics acquisition. With that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A. Sure. Yes, I'd be happy. Michael, thanks for the question. As you recall, we took a conservative approach to the write-down that we took earlier this year as we looked at the potential path forward. We will continue to monitor on a quarterly basis as we have historically and as we should the progress on the program both in lung cancer and in hormone-receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, both of which we had caring value on the balance sheet and IP R&D, as you know. So we'll continue to monitor it over time. And each major event, whether it's regulatory discussions or filings or potential approvals, we'll look at that value. Again, we remain confident in the program overall, like where the program is going, and we'll update you as soon as we can on our discussions with the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Johanna. From a clinical perspective, we made solid progress in the second quarter, including a wealth of data updates spanning our oncology and virology portfolios. Starting with HIV on Slide 16, we are very pleased to share that our NDA submission for lenacapavir for heavily treatment experienced people living with HIV was accepted last week, and we now have a PDUFA date set for the end of December. Outside the U.S., we received a positive CHMP opinion for this indication, based on data from the Phase 2/3 CAPELLA trial. Week 26 data from this trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in May with updated, 1\u2010year data presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections earlier this year. In this very difficult to treat population, 83\u201086% of those treated with lenacapavir achieved virologic suppression at 1\u2010year, sustaining the rates achieved at Week 26. We continue to expect a decision from the European Commission later this year. Looking to Trodelvy on Slide 17. We shared new data at ASCO that increases our confidence in Trodelvy's potential applicability across a broad range of tumor types. These positive data from the Phase 3 ASCENT study reinforced Trodelvy's survival and health-related quality-of-life benefit over treatment of physician's choice in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. We also highlighted positive PFS and quality-of-life data from our Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 study, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 34% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in light-line, endocrine-resistant patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, who had received a median of three prior lines of treatment in the metastatic setting after having failed hormone therapy. This study also demonstrated a positive trend in overall survival at the first interim analysis. The TROPiCS-02 data, coupled with the NCCN recommendation, support Trodelvy's potential as a treatment option for late-line HR-positive/HER2-negative patients. As Dan mentioned, our discussions with the FDA are ongoing on the potential regulatory path, and we'll update you when we can. In the meantime, TROPiCS-02 continues with patients being followed for subsequent planned OS analyses. Separately, we continue to expand our Trodelvy clinical program. We began screening for patients in ASCENT-03, valuing Trodelvy in first-line metastatic TNBC patients who have PD-L1 negative tumors as well as in the ASCENT-04 study evaluating first-line patients with PD-L1 positive metastatic TNBC. Moving to Trodelvy in bladder cancer, the ongoing Phase 3 TROPiCS\u201004 study is our confirmatory trial designed to enable global registration for Trodelvy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. This study follows the encouraging data from TROPHY\u2010U01 supporting accelerated approval of Trodelvy in the U.S. for patients with mUC. Pending results from our first line expansion cohorts in the Phase 2 TROPHY\u2010U01 study, we plan to open two Phase 3 studies in front line mUC. In our Trodelvy lung program, we initiated the Phase 2 EVOKE\u201002 non\u2010small cell lung cancer study in the second quarter evaluating the combination of Trodelvy with Merck\u2018s Keytruda in patients without actionable genomic mutations. Looking forward to the second half of this year, we expect to begin enrolling patients for the Phase 3 EVOKE\u201003 or KEYNOTE\u2010D46 study in first\u2010line non\u2010small cell lung cancer with PD\u2010L1 expression level of greater than equal to 50%, in collaboration with our partners at Merck. Additionally, later this year we expect to initiate several other Trodelvy combinations, including evaluating Trodelvy in castrate\u2010resistant prostate cancer. Moving to magrolimab on Slide 18. We're pleased that both divisions of the FDA have now lifted the partial clinical hold on magrolimab. All magrolimab programs have resumed enrolling patients without FDA requiring any additional protocol changes. Our confidence in magrolimab's potential efficacy and safety profile is unchanged. At ASCO, we shared MDS and AML data from our Phase 1b study when magrolimab continues to demonstrate high and durable response rates in high-risk MDS with encouraging complete response rate of 33% compared with the historical rates of azacitadine alone. We also observed promising efficacy in patients with TP53 mutant AML with an ORR of 49% and a CR of 33%. Notably, our Phase 3 study in front line HR MDS, ENHANCE, is enrolling nicely and we expect the interim analysis no later than early 2023. Moving to cell therapy on Slide 19, and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, it is gratifying to see that more patients are benefiting from our cell therapies given the growing body of clinical evidence. Building on ZUMA\u20107 data, we presented real\u2010world data at ASCO that demonstrated consistent outcomes for survival and safety, regardless of race and ethnicity. And in a sub\u2010analysis of ZUMA\u20107 patients over 65, Yescarta demonstrated more than 8 times greater median Event Free Survival and a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life.  These data further establish the efficacy and safety profile of Yescarta for patients with relapsed or refractory LBCL, and support ongoing exploration of Yescarta in more settings. We expect to enroll our first patient for ZUMA\u201024, a Phase 2 study to evaluate Yescarta in second line LBCL in an outpatient setting, as well as ZUMA\u201023, a Phase 3 study to evaluate Yescarta in first line, high\u2010risk LBCL patients in the second half of this year. Additionally, we expect first-patient-in in a new Phase 3 trial evaluating the use of Yescarta in second line HR follicular lymphoma patients, ZUMA\u201022, later this year. Now to Slide 20. As Dan mentioned, we made steady progress in the first half of the year and continue to focus on clinical execution. The key clinical milestones in the second half include: an update on our regulatory discussions for Trodelvy for late line HR-positive/HER2\u2010negative patients in the US; a number of potential regulatory decisions, including for lenacapavir, Yescarta, and Tecartus; at least six more trial initiations spanning Trodelvy, cell therapy and domvanalimab; as well as several data updates with our partner Arcus, including Phase 2 data from ARC\u20107. Later this year, we also expect to have interim Phase 2 data for etruma from the ARC\u20106 study as well as ARC\u20108's Phase 2 data for quemli. We are encouraged with early Phase 1 data for GS\u20105245, our investigational novel oral nucleoside in development for the treatment of COVID\u201019. We are discussing these early data with regulatory agencies and are planning to move into the clinic.  We are also pleased to see our earlier stage pipeline with our partners, such as Tizona and Pionyr, continue to advance nicely. For example, Tizona's HLA\u2010G program is currently enrolling its dose expansion cohorts and Tizona expects to share interim data mid\u20102023. With our robust internal pipeline and external partners, we are confident our portfolio across virology, oncology, and inflammation will deliver many life\u2010changing treatments to help those patients in need.  With that, I'll hand the call over to Andy. Brian, this is Merdad. I guess I'll start with that. For us right now, as we go forward with the study, I think we'll continue our focus on, of course, the OS evolution of the trial. And I think as we see how those data evolve over time, we will use that in our discussions with regulators as we go forward. In terms of additional subpopulations, of course, we'll keep an eye on a number of things in terms of whether it's line of therapy or those sorts of subpopulations or duration of prior therapy, which were all part of the original analysis. But those were -- it's consistent with what we've already shown at ASCO and the data that we've presented and shared with you. So it will be consistent with what we've already shown. Yes. Thanks for the questions. So as far as the oral new program for COVID-19 goes, the Phase 1 study is in healthy volunteers. So we don't expect to see anything other than safety and PK in that study. And all I can say is I think things have gone very well with that trial so far both from a tolerability and an exposure standpoint. So we're very happy with where we are. And now we'll move into the proof-of-concept and clinical development stage. So no viral load data to share. And then in terms of the ARC-7 data, I don't think -- I guess I would suggest not overreading. We are working with Arcus, and we will -- as the data roll out, we will be sharing data Arcus, and we will be sharing data from the ARC-7 study later on this year and the data that we will have. We're not really detailing what those data are going to look like right now. But be assured that we'll work with them to show data later this year. And from a long-acting standpoint, I'd just reiterate with the PDUFA date at the end of the year for lenacapavir in highly treatment experience, I think that will be the first approval, knock wood, for lenacapavir, and I think that gets us started. After that, remember then we have multiple efforts ongoing. On the PrEP side, we have the purpose studies that are underway. Those are longer-term studies because they're prevention studies, so they'll take a little bit longer to read out. We're looking at few years there, a couple of years, at least for those studies. And then on the treatment side, we are -- we have a number of shots on goal there, both oral long-acting as well as subcutaneous long-acting. And there, we are -- we have our own efforts. And you may have noticed we have a number of partner molecules that are coming through our pipeline that could be partnered with lenacapavir for a full treatment regimen that would include lenacapavir. And we continue to work with Merck on the potential for lenacapavir combinations with islatravir. So a lot of different options and a lot of work that's ongoing. And as those progress further along, we'll keep you updated. Thanks, Michael. Thanks for the questions. So on Trodelvy, yes, I think nothing has changed from what we said earlier in that we are excited about the data that we generate in TROPiCS-02 and are having ongoing discussions with the agency. And I think if things continue to go well, we will discuss with them the potential for filing. We're cautiously optimistic that, that should be able to continue to go forward, and we'll be able to update you in due course. In terms of lung, the primary focus for us in lung is actually the initiation of our Phase 3 trials in lung. Whether it's the combination trials I referenced earlier with Merck or some of the other combinations that we're doing, we will have some additional data in line that will be coming -- that will be generated over time. But I think the focus should be on those Phase 3 studies that we'll be reading out. And then maybe, Andy, do you want to address the write-downs?"

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Gilead Sciences First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now like to hand the call over to your host for today's program, Jacquie Ross, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the first quarter of 2022. The press release, slides and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com.  The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer; Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open up the call to Q&A where the team will be joined by Christi Shaw, the Chief Executive Officer of Kite.  Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including those related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gilead's business, financial condition and results of operations, plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections and the use of capital, and 2022 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.  Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet as well as on the Gilead website.  Now I'll turn the call over to Dan.\nDaniel O'Day: Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everybody. We appreciate you taking the time with Gilead today, and I also want to thank those of you who joined our virology and oncology deep dives over the last few months. These 2 events provided a more in-depth view of our portfolio, our strategy and the teams behind them. We shared a much broader view of our growing clinical pipeline than we had in the past, highlighting its potential to deliver a number of new therapies to address unmet needs for patients across a diverse range of conditions.  For those of you who joined, I hope you got a deeper sense of why we're confident of sustaining our leadership in virology and growing our oncology revenue so that it becomes more than 1/3 of our total revenue in 2030.  I'll turn now to our performance this quarter, and I'm pleased to share that the year is off to a strong start in line with guidance, as shown on Slide 4. Total product revenue was up 3% from last year to USD 6.5 billion, with cell therapy, Veklury, Trodelvy and HIV driving growth. HIV grew 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by Biktarvy, which grew 18%, and reported more than 4% market share growth compared to the first quarter of 2021. This is notable given the impact of our Truvada LOE.  Sequentially, HIV was down 18%, primarily as a result of first quarter seasonality. Our growing oncology portfolio performed well, with Trodelvy revenue doubling compared to the first quarter of 2021 and cell therapy delivering another strong quarter of growth.  We recently expanded our portfolio of marketed cancer therapies following the FDA approval of Yescarta for second-line relapsed and refractory LBCL. I'm also pleased to highlight the FDA approval of our new cell therapy facility in Maryland, which is part of the expected 50% increase in our manufacturing capacity by the end of 2022. The new facility will support our cell therapy growth expectations over the next several years.  Moving to the pipeline. We shared the Phase III top line readout from TROPiCS-02 in March showing that the study met its primary endpoint with a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival versus physician's choice in chemotherapy. Additionally, the first interim analysis of the key secondary endpoint of overall survival demonstrated a trend in improvement.  As you know, we are exploring potential pathways for approval with regulatory authorities to bring Trodelvy to these later-stage patients. The details of the study results will be shared at ASCO in June.  At the oncology deep dive earlier this month, we highlighted the broad potential for Trodelvy across multiple tumor types and lines of therapy, with plans to initiate 13 more Trodelvy trials through 2023, including 4 more in 2022.  Turning to Slide 5. As you know, the timing for TROPiCS-02 and the NDA decision for CAPELLA are subject to change. In the case of CAPELLA, this is due to the biocompatibility issue that we're working to resolve, and we're fully confident in lenacapavir itself. Other than that, we are on track with the remaining targeted milestones we shared with you in January.  We've added some of the newly disclosed trials from our oncology deep dive as well on this slide. Additionally, we're pleased to note that the partial clinical hold for the pivotal magrolimab trials, including ENHANCE free for first-line unfit AML shown on the slide have been lifted. I'm also pleased to share that despite the hold, there's no change to the timing of the first interim readout for ENHANCE for first-line high-risk MDS, which we expect in the first half of 2023. Merdad will share more pipeline details later in the call.  Before I pass it over to Johanna, I just want to take a moment to thank the Gilead and Kite teams who are putting the full weight of their expertise, passion and commitment behind all of this work that you're seeing. It's thanks to our 14,000 employees across the world that we\u2019re delivering for patients with diverse conditions and diseases today and advancing a pipeline of innovative new therapies for the future. We have some gold ambitions for the coming years, and we're confident in achieving them given the level of innovation and capabilities that we have in place today.  Now I'll invite Johanna to share an update on our first quarter commercial performance. Over to you, Johanna.\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. So turning to Slide 7. We had a solid start to the year with total product sales, excluding Veklury, of USD 5 billion for the quarter, up 2% year-over-year driven by cell therapy, Trodelvy and HIV, and offset in part by HCV pricing dynamics. Quarter-over-quarter, total product sales, excluding Veklury, were down 14% as a result of the seasonality we typically see in the first quarter of the year, primarily in our HIV business.  On Slide 8, you can see that HIV sales were down 18% quarter-over-quarter to $3.7 billion, consistent with our guidance, given the seasonality we customarily experienced in the first quarter of every year. First, the channels build their inventories over the fourth quarter and then draw them down during Q1. On a dollar basis, the majority of the sequential decline was associated with inventory drawdown. Second, we realized lower net prices in part due to increased copay support, Part D discounts and other efforts to maintain access and affordability of our HIV medicines as patients' insurance plans reset. This is a customary Q1 dynamic that we expect to normalize throughout the rest of this year.  Year-over-year, HIV sales were up 2% driven by market growth for both treatment and PrEP, often in part by the impact of the lost exclusivity for Truvada in 2020. The year-over-year impact of this LOE is expected to be minimal starting in this quarter, second quarter of this year. And excluding the LOE impact, HIV sales increased 5%.  Overall, we're encouraged by the signs of recovery seen in the HIV treatment market despite screening and diagnosis rates still below prepandemic levels and the continued impact on market growth due to the Omicron surge in Q1. As a result, both the U.S. and European HIV treatment markets were down slightly on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, the European market was roughly flat, and the U.S. market grew a little over 3%.  The PrEP market grew 33% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Notably, Descovy continues to hold approximately 45% market share, and we'll continue to engage with payers to ensure those who benefit from PrEP have access to their preferred regimen.  We believe Gilead remains well positioned in PrEP. And as highlighted during our virology deep dive in February, we expect the market to double by 2030, catalyzed by the launch of long-acting regimens such as lenacapavir.  Descovy sales in the first quarter were $374 million, up 4% year-over-year, driven by continued PrEP market growth and partially offset by generic competition in switches to newer treatment medicines such as Biktarvy.  Turning to Slide 9. Biktarvy sales of $2.2 billion in the first quarter were up 18% year-over-year driven by U.S. market growth, and notably, continued share gains in both the U.S. and in Europe. Biktarvy remains the leading regimen for new starts and switches in the U.S. and new starts in Europe. In fact, Biktarvy share is up 4.5% year-over-year to 43% share in the U.S., almost 8x larger than the next leading promoted medicine and representing the highest share of any complete regimen for the treatment of HIV.  Moving to Slide 10 in HCV. We maintained steady market share, and the 22% decline year-over-year was primarily driven by unfavorable pricing dynamics. Sequentially, HCV was up 2%, while the overall market and new patient starts continue to be impacted by the pandemic.  HBV and HDV on Slide 11 were up 7% year-over-year due to higher demand for Vemlidy, namely in Asia. Sequentially, HBV and HDV declined 11% driven by the same HBV seasonal inventory and pricing dynamics impacting HIV.  Hepcludex sales were $11 million for the quarter, primarily reflecting sales in Germany and France where full reimbursement has been established. Our discussions with regulatory values and other countries across Europe are ongoing. And of course, we look forward to potential approval in the U.S. in the second half of this year.  Veklury revenues in the first quarter were $1.5 billion, as shown on Slide 12. The clear utilization tracks hospitalization rates, and therefore, due to the timing of Omicron surges, was lower in the U.S. after January but higher in Europe and Asia later in the quarter. We're optimistic that there will not be another surge this year in the U.S. And overall, we will maintain our readiness to support hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. There's no change to our commitment to COVID-19 patients globally. And in that regard, we were very pleased to receive the World Health Organization's revised COVID-19 guidelines. These guidelines now conditionally recommend Veklury for the treatment of patients with nonsevere COVID-19 at highest risk of hospitalization. And earlier this week, Veklury received FDA approval for the treatment of certain pediatric patients for at least 28 days old, highlighting our ongoing commitment to extend the reach of Veklury where we can.  Now turning to oncology. Trodelvy sales were up 103% year-over-year and 24% sequentially, as shown on Slide 13. We're encouraged by adoption not just in the U.S., but notably, in Germany and France, and continue to work with health authorities and reimbursement bodies to extend Trodelvy's reach to patients globally. We've completed the expansion of our field force to support the U.S. and Europe and believe we are now at right scale to support physicians and make Trodelvy available across all approved indications to patients who could benefit from it.  We're extremely excited by the feedback from physicians about Trodelvy's impact on patients, both those who are prescribing Trodelvy today and those who expect to have access to it soon. With strong physician uptake and our expanded field footprint starting in April, we believe Trodelvy will benefit more than the 1 in 4 second-line metastatic TNBC patients we're reaching in the U.S. today.  We look forward to sharing more updates as we progress throughout the year.  Turning to Slide 14. And on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, cell therapy sales for the first quarter of 2022 were $274 million, up 43% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. For the quarter, Yescarta sales of $211 million were up 32% year-over-year and 16% sequentially driven by continued global demand in relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma as well as in follicular lymphoma. This highlights the growing recognition of the durable long-term survival benefit showcased at last December's American Society of Hematology Meeting.  For Tecartus, sales of $63 million were up 103% year-over-year due to strong demand in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. We're pleased with the strong early uptake for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the U.S. following approval last October, which contributed to the 11% sequential growth in Tecartus.  The strong momentum we've seen across our cell therapy portfolio continued with the approval of Yescarta in second-line relapsed or refractory LBCL earlier this month as well as FDA's approval for our new Maryland manufacturing facility announced just last week. Through capacity improvements across our existing in-house CAR-T manufacturing site in addition to the new Maryland site, we expect our manufacturing capacity to increase by up to 50% and support our aspiration to serve a cumulative 25,000-plus patients by the end of 2025.  Second-line orders started coming in the day after the FDA approval and have been steady ever since. It is truly heartening to see the immediate help we can provide for patients.  Given the Yescarta second-line inclusion in the NCCN guidelines and robust clinical data, we expect Yescarta to shift the paradigm in the standard of care for LBCL patients.  Christi is here with the team and is available to take any questions on cell therapy during our Q&A. And so with that, I will hand over the call to Merdad for an update on our clinical pipeline.\nMerdad Parsey: Thank you, Johanna, and hi, everyone. 2022 is full of clinical activity here at Gilead, and I hope the virology and oncology deep dives were helpful in highlighting the breadth and depth of our portfolio.  By the end of 2022, we expect to have more than 90 clinical trials underway across oncology, virology and inflammation. With such a broad portfolio, our focus is firmly on innovation and execution to ensure that we fully leverage its potential.  Moving to HIV on Slide 16. We shared exciting 1-year data from the CAPELLA trials at CROI in February, reporting 83% virologic suppression and heavily treatment-experienced people living with multidrug-resistant HIV. Given the significant unmet need of this patient population, the lenacapavir NDA was designated prior review by the FDA, and we're planning to resubmit the NDA as soon as we resolve the clinical hold and complete response letter.  As you know, the basis of these FDA actions was the compatibility of lenacapavir with vials in use at that time, not lenacapavir itself. We're an ongoing dialogue with the agency to consider an alternative vial and look forward to updating you of our progress in due course. Separately, we're on track for the HTE MAA approval in Europe in the second half of the year.  At a virology deep dive in February, we shared details of the 8 internal candidates that could partner with lenacapavir for treatment and highlighted the additional early development or discovery assets shown on Slide 17. In addition to our PrEP programs, these assets give us a high degree of confidence that Gilead will sustain its leadership in HIV through the 2020s and beyond.  In the immediate term, we continue to generate very strong data for Biktarvy. At CROI, we showed biologic suppression at or above 98% in the MA analysis and 0 cases of treatment failure due to resistance to any components of the single-tablet regimen in 2 5-year Phase III trials. Of note, this 5-year duration is unprecedented for an HIV regimen.  Moving to Slide 18. Veklury is playing an important role in the fight against COVID-19 and is the only antiviral approved for use in both hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. Just in the past few days, the FDA approved an sNDA for Veklury for the treatment of pediatric patients who are at least 28 days old and either hospitalized with COVID-19 or with mild to moderate COVID-19 and considered high risk for progression to severe COVID-19.  In addition to Veklury, we have an ongoing Phase I trial GS-5245, our investigational oral COVID-19 nucleoside that once metabolized works in the same way as remdesivir. Results from this study could lead to a registrational trial. So even while we hope the worst of this pandemic is behind us, we will continue to work to ensure that COVID-19 therapies are available to as many patients as possible.  Moving to oncology, and specifically Trodelvy, on Slide 19, we'll share more detailed data from the TROPiCS-02 study at ASCO in June. As a reminder, we announced that the study minutes primary endpoint with statistically significant PFS versus physician's choice of chemotherapy in late-line patients. And that results are consistent with the Trodelvy arm in the Immunomedics-132-01 Phase I/II trial. OS showed a trended improvement at the first interim analysis, and we're now targeting a final OS analysis in 2024, depending on the timing of events.  In the meantime, we're engaging with regulatory authorities to explore potential pathways given the high unmet need. As a reminder, TROPiCS-02 targeted a more advanced patient population than best knee breast 04. The encouraging clinical data we've seen in this more challenging patient group has strengthened our excitement in exploring earlier-stage patients.  As we shared 2 weeks ago, we're planning a pivotal study for frontline HR-positive/HER2-negative patients, and we'll share more information in due course. In addition to TROPiCS-02, we're targeting first patient in, or FPI, for a number of new Trodelvy trials this year. In the first half of 2022, this includes front-line studies for non-small cell lung cancer and PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative metastatic TNBC. In the second half of the year, we're targeting FPI for the EVOQUE 3 Phase III trial for first-line non-small cell lung cancer. TROPiCS-04 for metastatic urothelial carcinoma is ongoing, and we anticipate a readout in the 2023, 2024 time frame.  As you can see on this slide, shared for the first time in our oncology deep dive earlier this month, we are in the earliest stages of evaluating how Trodelvy, either alone or in combination, could bring new options to people with cancer. In total, we're studying more than 25 combinations, including 7 Phase III combination studies.  On behalf of my Kite colleagues and on Slide 20, I'm pleased to highlight the FDA approval of Yescarta for the second-line treatment of relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma earlier this month. The approval is based on the ZUMA-7 trial data that showed that 2.5x more patients receiving Yescarta were alive at 2 years without disease progression or need for additional cancer treatment versus the standard of care. This was the first cell therapy approved by FDA for initial treatment of refractory or relapsed LBCL and within 12 months of initial treatment. Yescarta was also added to the NCCN's B-cell lymphoma treatment guidelines for these patients.  Moving to magrolimab on Slide 21. We're very pleased that the FDA lifted the partial clinical holds for our MDS and AML trials, and we resumed enrollment in our 3 pivotal studies. I'll note that the remaining partial clinical holds on DLBCL and multiple myeloma are being reviewed by a different division of the FDA, and we're actively working to resolve them as quickly as possible. In the meantime, the impact of these remaining partial holds is limited since the DLBCL trial was already fully enrolled at the time of the partial clinical hold and the multiple myeloma trial had just initiated.  Overall, we're excited by magrolimab's potential to be the first new treatment for first-line high-risk MDS patients in 15 years and have completed patient enrollment for the first interim analysis that we expect to share in early 2023. In the meantime, we look forward to sharing data from our Phase Ib trial for high-risk MDS and first-line TP53 AML with more patients and longer follow-up at ASCO in June.  Finally, on Slide 22 and noting that the timing for the potential submission of TROPiCS-02 NDA decision for CAPELLA are subject to change, there are no updates to the targeted milestones shared with you in January. With our partner, Arcus, we're targeting a number of data readouts in the second half of the year and have added some new trials, including STAR-121, evaluating zimberelimab and dominilumab in combination with chemotherapy for front-line non-small cell lung cancer and R-21 to evaluate the same combination of upper GI malignancies.  With that, I'll hand the call over to Andy.\nAndrew Dickinson: Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the Q1 P&L review and the guidance update, I wanted to touch on the $2.7 billion partial in-process R&D impairment related to assets acquired from Immunomedics in 2020. This had a $1.63 per share impact on our Q1 GAAP results and on our full year GAAP EPS guidance. There is no impact to our non-GAAP EPS in Q1 or to our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year. With the TROPiCS-02 data readout in March, we have reassessed the value of the assets acquired. While no final decisions have been made pending discussions with regulatory authorities, as a result of the data, we have taken a $2.7 billion impairment to reflect the likelihood of a delayed launch of Trodelvy for third-line-plus HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer in the United States as well as Europe and the possibility of a reduced market share in late-line patients given the emerging competitive landscape. Prior to today's update, Gilead was carrying $14.7 billion for the IP R&D indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired with Immunomedics. This now values these assets at $12 billion.  Recall that the carrying value of Trodelvy reflected 4 potential indications in progress at the time of the acquisition, triple-negative breast cancer and hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, bladder cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. At that time, we knew that Trodelvy's potential extended beyond these indications, but for accounting purposes did not assign value for the incremental opportunities that we are exploring in prostate, endometrial and other solid tumors as well as potential combinations such as with magrolimab, venelumab and PD-1s like pembrolizumab.  As you saw at our oncology deep dive earlier this month, there are 13 Trodelvy programs targeted for initiation through 2023, including a number of incremental opportunities. As a result, we remain confident Trodelvy will deliver an attractive return to our shareholders over time.  Moving to Slide 24. The first quarter was a strong start to the year despite the expected seasonality observed in our HIV business and was stronger-than-expected Veklury sales. Total product sales were $6.5 billion, up 3% year-over-year, with growth in cell therapy, Veklury, Trodelvy and HIV, offset in part by lower HCV revenue. Of note, FX negatively impacted first quarter revenue by almost $100 million, net of hedges, representing approximately 160 basis points of growth. Total product sales, excluding Veklury, were up 2% from the first quarter of 2021 to $5 billion.  In HIV, on a sequential basis, we were impacted, as expected, by the normal seasonality associated with Q1 inventory burn following a build in Q4 in addition to the typical first quarter pricing headwinds that improved throughout the rest of the year. With Q1 now behind us, we expect sequential growth in HIV throughout the rest of the year.  Non-GAAP product gross margin was 87.4% for Q1, up 90 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to lower inventory reserve adjustment. First quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were largely consistent with our expectations as we support the expansion of our oncology business. Non-GAAP R&D was $1.2 billion, up 10% year-over-year. And non-GAAP SG&A was $1.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year, both primarily due to higher costs associated with Trodelvy.  Moving to tax. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the first quarter was 18.4%. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.12 in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $2.04 for the same period last year, reflecting the higher revenue and higher gross margin, offset in part by higher operating expenses.  On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate and earnings per share were impacted by the $2.7 billion impairment.  We are excited about the strong start to the year. And as you can see on Slide 25, the only revision to our outlook is to our GAAP EPS, primarily to reflect the $1.63 share impact of the impairment discussed earlier. We now expect GAAP EPS in the range of $3 to $3.50 per share from $4.70 to $5.20.  On Veklury, we note the strong revenue start to the year, but also, fortunately, the significant drop-off in U.S. hospitalizations during the first quarter and into the second quarter so far. With that in mind, we will monitor demand through the second quarter and evaluate our full year guidance in the middle of the year.  One housekeeping item before we wrap up. Following recent guidance from the SEC, beginning in the first quarter and similar to many of our peers, Gilead will no longer exclude acquired in-process R&D expenses from non-GAAP financial measures. Prior period results have been updated to reflect this new methodology and are shared in our supplementary data posted on the Investor Relations website.  As a reminder, our full year guidance does not include the impact of any future upfront payments related to the normal course of business partnerships or licensing deals. Going forward, we plan to update our guidance on a quarterly basis to reflect the impact of any new corporate development transactions closed in the prior quarter.  Moving to Slide 26. You can see there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. In the first quarter, we repaid $500 million in debt. Additionally, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through our dividend and repurchase of shares.  Finally, on M&A, there is no change to our philosophy here either. We are very comfortable with the breadth and the quality of the pipeline that we have built, acquired or partnered, and the growth that it will enable in the coming years. With that in mind, you can expect us to continue to opportunistically access high-quality assets through partnerships or make smaller acquisitions in the normal course of business.  With that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies.\nMichael Yee: Maybe I could ask about the planned or potential Trodelvy filing. You note that it's subject to change. Maybe you could just describe what you think the conversation is with FDA. Is it combination of a modest PFS and OS trend? And is there a magnitude of OS trend that you think will be attractive and allow a green light to a filing? Maybe just talk a little bit about that and what would drive a filing.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Michael. I'll turn it over to Merdad in just a second, but I'll just remind folks that we will be discussing the data more at ASCO coming up there in early June. We look forward to engaging with regulatory authorities in the coming months to further discuss the data and the path forward. I'll see if Merdad has anything to add on that at this stage, but...\nMerdad Parsey: Yes. Michael, I think as a normal course of business, we'll always discuss the data -- the totality of the data with the agency prior to a filing and have that conversation with them. As we've said, the primary endpoint was statistically significant. And so we will have that conversation with them looking at all the data and come to a conclusion based on the feedback we get.\nDaniel O'Day: Right. And we continue to look at earlier lines of therapy and plan those trials to move up in lines of therapy given the results we saw in TROPiCS-02 as well and hormone receptor-positive. So thanks a lot, Michael, for that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.\nCharlie Yang: This is Charlie Yang, on for Matthew. So I guess my question is, is Veklury being -- currently being used in China and then actually benefit from the COVID outbreak there? And maybe if that's the case, can you talk about what the economics look like over there?\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks for the question. We'll go right to Johanna.\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks for your question. So Veklury has been used now with over 11 million patients worldwide, which I think is really impressive. And it's still 1 out of 2 hospitalized patients in the U.S. What we are seeing, though, is trends of less severe disease, and therefore, less hospitalizations, but also less treatments.  Specific to your question to China, we don't have approval in China at this point in time. And we're continuing those discussions with health authorities in light of the fact that what's going on in China with the pandemic, obviously. I do think the WHO guidelines being updated just most recently is also going to help those discussions as well. So more to come on that, but not currently in play at this point in time in China. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets.\nBrian Abrahams: Sticking with the COVID theme. Anything that - new that you're seeing that increases your level of confidence in 5245\u2019s potential for success? And are there any ways to potentially expedite future development of that asset?\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Brian. I'll hand over to you, Merdad.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes. Nothing new to report, Brian. It's a great question. We continue to move along really well in our Phase I study that's moving forward expeditiously. And we are working with the agency to design a Phase II/III program and really moving as fast as possible. We've got a great partnership with the agency and others and are really ready to count. So right now, so far, so good.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simon Baker from Redburn.\nSimon Baker: On HIV, Johanna, you alluded to the market dynamics. I just wondered if you could give us a little bit more color and update us on how diagnosis rates are now compared to the beginning of the year. And also if you are seeing any initial impact from Glaxo\u2019s launch of CABENUVA.\nJohanna Mercier: Sure. So both market and CABENUVA. Thanks, Simon, for your question. So let me start with the market. So if you look at the screening and diagnosis levels, they're still somewhat below prepandemic, but they're definitely catching up. I think what we saw in the first half '21 was a really depressed market and started picking back up in Q3 and Q4 of last year. What we saw in Q1 of this year despite the Omicron surge that obviously impacts, what we saw quarter-over-quarter pretty much flat in the U.S. and overall Europe as well. Year-on-year change, though, we have a 3.6% growth. And I think that's really -- that's the signal that we need to watch for and continue to focus on. And since Gilead has close to 75% market share of the total HIV market, I think it's really -- it's part of our responsibility to ensure that we get screening and diagnosis up and make sure we [end this pandemic] (ph). So more to come on that, but there's a lot of activities the team is taking on to ensure that we get people back in and screened so that we don't have full-fledge cases of AIDS which, unfortunately, we've seen in the recent past, and you've seen that anecdotally.  On the prevention market, it's a little bit different. Prevention market bounces back a lot faster post this pandemic, and we've seen that time and time again after every single surge. So what we've seen quarter-over-quarter was about a 3% growth in the U.S. for prevention. So slightly modest growth, which declined a little bit, but that's because of the Omicron surge in January. Year-over-year, the growth was 33%. And so I think that's really telling in the sense of how it bounces back much faster post these surges. And that's been kind of consistent year-on-year as we've seen the different, I guess, variants.  On your question around CABENUVA., specific to CABENUVA., treatment share in CABENUVA. is 0.6%. So no, we haven't seen an impact. What we see is new entrants coming into the market. You always see a little bit of switching going on, which is normal. I do think that there's an [ask] (ph) from a patient standpoint, this is the first long-acting, so it is exciting. What we're also seeing is a higher-than-usual drop-off rate with CABENUVA as well. And a lot of that share is going to Biktarvy back. So I do think it's interesting to watch. And I think the more agents on the market, the better, but definitely one that at this point in time very limited impact to the HIV market share for Gilead. Thanks for your questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.\nGeoffrey Meacham: I had an HIV question for Merdad or maybe even Dan. So you built an increasingly broad pipeline around Lenacapavir. And I know getting long-acting right is strategically very important to Gilead. So the question is, what's been the main bottleneck so far? Is it a matter of matching up the PK/PD for lena? And would you wait to go into a larger scale trial if there is a candidate that may make an optimal doublet with lenacapavir?\nDaniel O'Day: Yes. Thanks, Geoff. Appreciate it. I'm going to turn it over to Merdad in a second here. But just remind -- for those of you that didn't have the chance to look at the virology deep dive day, we really did spend a lot of time in the entirety of the portfolio and the many shots on goal we have along with lenacapavir. Lenacapavir is a truly unique molecule and presents opportunities and challenges to find exactly the right partner. But we certainly have many that will be progressing to the clinic. But Merdad, maybe you want to give a little more meat to the...\nMerdad Parsey: Sure. Yes. I mean maybe I'll start by saying on the PrEP side, we obviously don't need to wait for a partner molecule. And really, at this point, it's about resolving the issues with the clinical hold. Once that gets resolved, we'll be back in business with the trials and we'll move as fast as possible to get the PrEP studies completed and get our filing done.  In treatment, you're absolutely right. And again, I think you're right, we've built the portfolio to provide as numerous options to then combine with lenacapavir for treatment in a long-acting mode. And that's a mix of oral approaches where we could have an oral long-acting molecule or a parenteral long-acting agent. And for parenteral, we're trying to go for longer than 2 months. And for oral, we are looking at, hopefully, getting to weekly or thereabouts. So we have a number of candidates that are progressing to show us -- essentially, you said it right, which is do they have the right properties from a PK/PD standpoint for an oral agent? And do they have the right properties parenterally, including things like injection site reactions and tolerability? So it's less about the ability to inhibit HIV replication. It's more about the molecule and the formulation characteristics that allow us to get to long-acting therapy.  And I'll just say again that lenacapavir is a very unique and special molecule that enables us to do that. Finding another molecule that has those sorts of characteristics is the challenge that we're undertaking.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Do Kim from Piper Sandler.\nGuyn Kim: I wanted to ask about Yescarta and the launch in second-line LBCL. Was hoping you could provide some first impressions of the launch and whether your sense of the demand out there is matching with your expectations.\nDaniel O'Day: Yes. Thanks, Do. We're delighted to have Christi here with us. So we'll hear it from the source here. Over to you, Christi.\nChristi Shaw: Thanks, Do. So we're very encouraged. First, before the approval, the NCCN guidelines that changed and now put Yescarta for LBCL second-line as category 1 which, as you may know, physicians and providers use to identify standard of care. So that happened a month before approval, which is unusual in these times. And then with the approval -- right after the approval, our manufacturing site was approved in Maryland. So we really feel like we're hitting on all cylinders in terms of really bringing this important therapy to patients. And so the second-line launch was approved on a Friday at about 3 p.m. And on Saturday, orders started to come in. So we're already manufacturing commercial product in our site in the Maryland facility.  So definitely, it's really early days, obviously, but the demand was building up, I think, when the data came out at ASH in December, and we're starting to see the orders come in as soon as we get approval.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.\nGavin Scott: It's Gavin, on for Cory. Just on Trodelvy label expansion opportunities and lung cancer, in particular, with the EVOQUE-02 study. It looks like there's multiple cohorts in the study. And we're just curious if, one, is there evidence of synergy with PD-1 inhibitors and you plan on sharing any of that this year? And then two, are you going to utilize a Trop-2 biomarker in any of these cohorts?\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks for the question. Merdad, why don't you cover that?\nMerdad Parsey: Sure. Yes. On the biomarker side, we continue to evaluate the role of Trop-2 expression in responses. And as we discussed, actually, for the breast cancer study in our experience so far, we are not seeing a big impact of Trop-2 expression on responsiveness. So we'll -- but we'll keep looking because lung cancer may behave differently than what we're seeing. And we do expect expression patterns to be different. So maybe there'll be a different cutoff in a different tumor type. So that remains to be seen.  In terms of synergy, we are -- I think that's the nature of where we're going with the studies. And that in order to see additive benefit, we need to conduct the larger clinical trials. We do think that coming at the tumors with the 2 different approaches, we'll add. I'm always careful about using the term synergy. I think that implies a different mechanistic approach. So I do think we expect additivity of the 2 components. And yes, we do feel that we will have additivity that Trodelvy should bring additional benefit to patients over and above what the immuno-oncology agents, PD-1, PD-L1 inhibitors, bring to the treatment of those patients.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Congrats on the Yescarta data, by the way. So I just want to [indiscernible] a little bit on your comments around M&A. I think some investors believe that you have all these great programs, but we're not going to see them read out. And I think you did a good job highlighting that in the oncology day. So for near-term growth, are you thinking about -- would you be open to acquiring something that would provide some near-term growth to gap you before a lot of your Trodelvy trials and your magro trials like start reading out? How are you thinking about that as a company?\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Robyn, and I'll start and then maybe Andy can add. But I appreciate you bringing that up. I think it's been a really purposeful strategic approach that we've taken over the past -- last 3 years to build our oncology portfolio beyond cell therapy, which is obviously now has a history with us for almost 5 years. And I'd just remind the folks on the phone that in addition to whatever is acquired at the time of the acquisition in terms of trials and potential and capability of that size organization, naturally, when a large organization acquires particularly these pan-tumor potential molecules, you begin really the process of extending the potential for that medicine alone in late lines, earlier lines and in combinations and thoughtful combinations.  I think actually, Kite is a terrific example of that, going back now 5 years post the acquisition, and I appreciate, Robyn, that you started out with congratulations on Yescarta. But to see the potential for a technology like cell therapy and the leadership that Kite took by bringing this up into earlier lines of therapy and the number of patients, of course, then that you can impact on with a potentially curative therapy is exactly kind of the playbook that we will be -- we are pursuing right now with Trodelvy, with magrolimab, and obviously, with the combination of Arcus assets, which -- albeit a bit earlier in the process. So I think we always have to remember the time frame and which one evaluates the success of M&A.  The other thing I would just say is that, of course, we constantly are looking to complement that. I mean the bar is much higher now for Gilead than it was several years ago because the number of possibilities and opportunities we have and the bandwidth that any one company can do, but you see on the bandwidth side, we're also doing a lot of collaborations with other companies, including folks like Merck who are operationalizing, in fact, a study of ours with Trodelvy. So there's different ways, I think, to work on the bandwidth. But we will constantly be looking at different types of opportunities out there that complement our virology, our oncology and our early inflammation program to add those to the growth story that we are creating here at Gilead.  I'll just -- I know Andy spends a lot of time thinking about this. I'd love Andy's additional thoughts on this as well.\nAndrew Dickinson: Thanks, Dan. And thank you, Robyn, for the question. Look, I would just go back to start with fundamentally, we have a lot of confidence in where we are in our growth profile today. And I think it's fair to say that the market maybe underappreciates the growth. Even, Robyn, if you look at our first quarter results, especially when you adjust for the impact of LOE and FX, there's really reasonably strong growth in our business. And this is just the beginning from our perspective. So there are always things that we can do to work on our growth profile. But when you look at the strength of the HIV business, what we're seeing in our oncology business, hopefully, that gives you a sense of why we as a management team have so much confidence about not only where we are today, but where we're going. And we recognize, to your question, that the growth profile should get meaningfully better in the next couple of years as the portfolio matures in the way that Dan was describing.  So while we will look at things, including commercial assets, as you know, those are far and few between. Many of them are expensive, and that's not really where our focus is. We really genuinely believe we have everything that we need today to be a leading growth company in the sector, and it's just going to take a little more time. But we're definitely seeing all the right signs that we are looking for as a management team. So you should not expect that we're going to go out chasing commercial assets or large deals. The guidance is very clear. It's ordinary course partnerships, maybe smaller commercial acquisitions. Again, we'll be opportunistic. But that's not where our focus is today. Thank you.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Andy. And the last thing I'd say in addition to the molecules and the medicines, the expertise that we're bringing into Gilead is second to none. And hopefully, you saw some of that. And it's just really the -- some representation of that at both virology and oncology deep dive days because that's really critical in any company that we've all -- as the leadership team worked in is really getting the right teams together at the right time to make sure we're making the right choices and decisions on the portfolios as we move forward. So that's a really big focus for us, and we're really pleased with the progress we're making there.\nOperator: It comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore.\nUmer Raffat: I just wanted to expand on a prior question on remdesivir. And Dan, Merdad, it feels like the pace at which this program is moving forward and sort of the time line to the pivotal trial start and the amount of time it will take, it feels materially slower than how Paxlovid and [indiscernible] moved. So I guess my question is, what are the expedited pathways you guys are thinking about when talking to FDA? Because presumably, a 505(b)(2) path is not unreasonable given the public health emergency and/or maybe even an active comparator trial versus Paxlovid established non-inferiority relatively fast given the pace at which infections are happening right now. So there's a path where this could all wrap up this summer. Is that too accelerated in your view?\nDaniel O'Day: Yes. Umer, I'll start, and then I'll hand it over to Merdad. So first of all, I mean, just to reinforce this message for everybody on the phone, I mean, we are absolutely moving with tremendous focus and speed. And of course, we have great lessons within our organization. Remdesivir was arguably the fastest development of an antiviral that's ever occurred from standing still essentially to an approval in the United States. So -- and as you know, we've got a lot of experience from that in terms of working both property groups around accelerating trials, with the FDA around pursuing unique regulatory path. And those learnings and those lessons I just want to say are certainly being put to use now for 5 2 4 5.  Having said that, we're, of course, at a very different stage of the pandemic at this stage. And therefore, both from a regulatory perspective and also our ability to recruit clinical trials, particularly with a somewhat raining pandemic in the developed world, has implications on the path we'll take.  And with that, maybe I'll turn it over to Merdad on any other details he wants to add.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes. I mean not much to add other than I think our Phase I study is moving very quickly. It's moving very nicely without any issues. I know, Umer, you've asked about the 505(b)(2) approach in the past. As you can imagine, those are all -- the avenues you've mentioned are all avenues that we've thought about and explored. And so we will move with the fastest pathway available to us, and that's the nature of the discussions we're having with the agency.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets.\nEvan Seigerman: It might be a combo one for Andy and Merdad. So can you walk me through some of the -- some of the math behind the $2.7 billion write-down? Maybe how some of the data you've seen inform the magnitude of the impairment? I'm just trying to square how your assumptions may have changed from August 2020 to now based on data updates that we've had.\nAndrew Dickinson: Evan, it's Andy. Thanks for the question. It's a great question. Look, it's relatively simple. And just to back up, remember, this is an accounting construct that we are required to reassess the value even before we have the discussions with the regulatory authorities. So I just want to back up and reiterate what we said when the data came out. The study was positive. This is strong data. There was a range of outcomes that we expected when we did the deal. This was within the range of outcomes, but it wasn't at the point that we had modeled specifically because we are required to when we put together the intangible indefinite-lived asset schedule after the acquisition. So it's a very simple model, too.  So the key, by the way, is our valuation when we have discussions in the coming months with the FDA could change again, of course. And we'll have to continue to look at the valuation of the assets that are still sitting on the balance sheet, which is the valuation attributed to hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer over the coming years, as you'd expect, consistent with any business combination transaction. But it's relatively simple.  It's your standard probability-weighted discounted cash flow analysis where you look at the probability of approval. We are assuming, Evan -- I think this is the key for you. We took a conservative approach, and we were looking at this and assume that there is not a path forward based on the PFS data and that we need to wait for overall survival, even though we're not certain that that's the case and we will know more in the coming months. So for purposes -- for the accounting treatment, we had to make a call, and that's the call that we made, and that leads to the 2.7.  The other thing I would add is we had Trodelvy-related IP R&D of $14.7 billion at the end of 2021, a little over half of that or $8.8 billion of it related to hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. The remainder was non-small cell lung cancer. And again, we're already -- in the other indications that are approved, we're already amortizing that. Those are now finite-lived assets. So now we have $6.1 billion relating to the cash flows expected from third line plus -- as well as the earlier line hormone receptor positive breast cancer indication. But hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color.  And again, I'd reiterate what we said on the call, which is when we did this originally, when we did the acquisition, we highlighted explicitly that we were going to explore other tumor types and combinations that were not part of our deal model. There is no need to build them into the deal model from bottoms up. So when you step back, more importantly, outside of the accounting construct, we continue to believe that there are many, many paths forward to create a lot of value for patients and for our shareholders with this. So I'm happy to take it off-line if it's helpful to give you more color.\nDaniel O'Day: Yes. Thanks a lot, Andy. I mean, Evan, I think the bottom line is that, again, we took a somewhat conservative approach in the absence of having regulatory discussions so far. We thought it was a prudent thing to do. And to Andy's point, I mean, this is an evaluation of value at the time of the transaction, which, of course, several years later in terms of the indications, the combinations, the potential for Trodelvy is never, as you know, reflective in the initial accounting treatment of it. So hopefully, there's plenty of information in there in our press release and more than happy to take it up with you as well. So thanks, Evan, for that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren from Cowen.\nTyler Van Buren: Can you please give us your latest thoughts regarding a successful outcome for the [indiscernible] trial when we get the Phase II PFS data later in the year? And related to the readout for the upcoming Roche results, what are you most interested in seeing other than the primary endpoint?\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks a lot, Tyler. So over to Merdad, please.\nMerdad Parsey: Sure. Yes. I think our thinking has been that dominolumab as a TIGIT agent will add to the ORR. But to your point, it's not only that, that we would be looking for. And what we would be hoping for in addition to the overall response rate is going to be the depth of the responses and the durability of responses, right? So those are the factors that we'll be looking for. We will also be looking to see what the Roche data looks like when they -- when it comes out at ASCO to see what they've seen is sort of a benchmark, if you will. But those are the various factors we'll be looking for. Obviously, tolerability is going to be in there as well and the overall profile.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal: Maybe a question for Andy regarding FX. So Andy, you mentioned that in 1Q, there was a $100 million impact. And then since you provided the guidance, I mean, U.S. dollar has been strong, about 7% U.S. dollar to European -- euro decline. So just what I'm trying to understand is how much of the FX impact you are absorbing in this guidance which you are maintaining right now. From my math, it could be $300 million plus. But that means that this base business is really stronger than you anticipated, if you could help us understand where this strength is coming from.\nAndrew Dickinson: Sure. That's a great question, Mohit. I'm happy to take it. The -- look, it's relatively simple. And that you're absolutely right. And even in April, we've seen a continued deterioration of exchange rates or strengthening of the dollar, which impacts the revenues coming from our European business. So to be clear, the $100 million impact was a year-over-year comparison Q1 to Q1. Johanna and I are watching the budget impact of the exchange rates very carefully. And part of the confidence in maintaining the guidance is that, yes, there are FX headwinds. There are also, for instance -- related to your question, there's also this change in the accounting treatment of in-process R&D, which will lead to additional expenses from upfront payments that weren't previously part of how we reported non-GAAP earnings.  On the flip side, there are parts of our business that are outperforming. Again, you think of the strength of Veklury that we've seen so far. So Johanna and I and the rest of the management team will look at the puts and takes of this in the middle of the year, and we'll provide a more thoughtful update. But I think the key for you is recognizing the couple of things that have changed that could impact negatively our EPS GAAP and non-GAAP EPS. There are also things that will have additional strength we expect over the course of the year that will offset that to some extent. And so we'll give you additional color later in the year, but we're very comfortable maintaining our guidance where we are today. Hopefully, that helps.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow from UBS.\nColin Bristow: Just a quick one, just following on, on the TIGIT and adenosine asset. The -- I just wanted to really understand where your -- what is it you're most enthused about and how you're just thinking about this strategically? Is it the TIGIT and PD-1 doublet that you really see the value, but there's some concern about market timing? Or are you absolutely excited about the triplet data? Can you just help me through that?\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Colin. Merdad, go ahead.\nMerdad Parsey: Sure. Look, I think we obviously are going to be looking across all the data across all the assets. Maybe the way I would say it is that we're seeing the TIGIT/PD-1 combination is likely to be sort of the benchmark or the basis for treatment at least in lung cancer and potentially more broadly. And as such, our hope is to have a great combination there to make sure that we then have something to which we can add other potential agents that could bring us to even better responsiveness. So whether that's adenosine or Trodelvy or something else in our pipeline, I think those are all options for us to consider. But we're seeing -- I would say the floor is being raised is our belief and that TIGIT/PD-1 combination becomes sort of the baseline that we need to aim for.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks. Very nice conceptual there. So out of respect for everybody's time, we'll take one last question. Jonathan, can we have the last question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. Our final question for today comes from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] for Salveen. Just to go back to TIGIT real quick. You and Arcus have previously noted that you'd want to see an ORR greater than 50%, but what would you like to see on PFS and, most importantly, OS? It seems like 30-plus months might be sufficient on OS given KEYTRUDA mono data and maybe a year plus for PFS. Just would be great to hear your thoughts on this.\nMerdad Parsey: Well, what I would say is those milestones -- I would agree with the milestones that you've got there. And it's important to remember that those milestones will take time to play out. And we are going to make our bets without being able to look at OS for 30 months, right? We're going to have a less mature data set from which to make that decision. So you're absolutely right that we will be looking at all of those things.  The driver will be to see that, again, tolerability and a benefit as far as the overall response rate is concerned and look for benefits in the depth and duration of response that we can garner from the data set at the maturity that we will have when we look at it. And there, I would just say we'll be, in a sense, watch our actions because you'll be seeing the studies will be getting underway, and that should give you a sense of our confidence in those assets.\nDaniel O'Day: With that, I just want to thank everybody. I really appreciate the attention today for the couple of deep dives we've had. We look forward to chatting with you at ASCO and beyond to keep you updated on our progress for the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jacquie for some final comments.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you all for joining us today. We do appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and look forward to updating you throughout the year, as Dan said. Have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Merdad Parsey",
            "content": "Thank you, Johanna, and hi, everyone. 2022 is full of clinical activity here at Gilead, and I hope the virology and oncology deep dives were helpful in highlighting the breadth and depth of our portfolio.  By the end of 2022, we expect to have more than 90 clinical trials underway across oncology, virology and inflammation. With such a broad portfolio, our focus is firmly on innovation and execution to ensure that we fully leverage its potential.  Moving to HIV on Slide 16. We shared exciting 1-year data from the CAPELLA trials at CROI in February, reporting 83% virologic suppression and heavily treatment-experienced people living with multidrug-resistant HIV. Given the significant unmet need of this patient population, the lenacapavir NDA was designated prior review by the FDA, and we're planning to resubmit the NDA as soon as we resolve the clinical hold and complete response letter.  As you know, the basis of these FDA actions was the compatibility of lenacapavir with vials in use at that time, not lenacapavir itself. We're an ongoing dialogue with the agency to consider an alternative vial and look forward to updating you of our progress in due course. Separately, we're on track for the HTE MAA approval in Europe in the second half of the year.  At a virology deep dive in February, we shared details of the 8 internal candidates that could partner with lenacapavir for treatment and highlighted the additional early development or discovery assets shown on Slide 17. In addition to our PrEP programs, these assets give us a high degree of confidence that Gilead will sustain its leadership in HIV through the 2020s and beyond.  In the immediate term, we continue to generate very strong data for Biktarvy. At CROI, we showed biologic suppression at or above 98% in the MA analysis and 0 cases of treatment failure due to resistance to any components of the single-tablet regimen in 2 5-year Phase III trials. Of note, this 5-year duration is unprecedented for an HIV regimen.  Moving to Slide 18. Veklury is playing an important role in the fight against COVID-19 and is the only antiviral approved for use in both hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. Just in the past few days, the FDA approved an sNDA for Veklury for the treatment of pediatric patients who are at least 28 days old and either hospitalized with COVID-19 or with mild to moderate COVID-19 and considered high risk for progression to severe COVID-19.  In addition to Veklury, we have an ongoing Phase I trial GS-5245, our investigational oral COVID-19 nucleoside that once metabolized works in the same way as remdesivir. Results from this study could lead to a registrational trial. So even while we hope the worst of this pandemic is behind us, we will continue to work to ensure that COVID-19 therapies are available to as many patients as possible.  Moving to oncology, and specifically Trodelvy, on Slide 19, we'll share more detailed data from the TROPiCS-02 study at ASCO in June. As a reminder, we announced that the study minutes primary endpoint with statistically significant PFS versus physician's choice of chemotherapy in late-line patients. And that results are consistent with the Trodelvy arm in the Immunomedics-132-01 Phase I/II trial. OS showed a trended improvement at the first interim analysis, and we're now targeting a final OS analysis in 2024, depending on the timing of events.  In the meantime, we're engaging with regulatory authorities to explore potential pathways given the high unmet need. As a reminder, TROPiCS-02 targeted a more advanced patient population than best knee breast 04. The encouraging clinical data we've seen in this more challenging patient group has strengthened our excitement in exploring earlier-stage patients.  As we shared 2 weeks ago, we're planning a pivotal study for frontline HR-positive/HER2-negative patients, and we'll share more information in due course. In addition to TROPiCS-02, we're targeting first patient in, or FPI, for a number of new Trodelvy trials this year. In the first half of 2022, this includes front-line studies for non-small cell lung cancer and PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative metastatic TNBC. In the second half of the year, we're targeting FPI for the EVOQUE 3 Phase III trial for first-line non-small cell lung cancer. TROPiCS-04 for metastatic urothelial carcinoma is ongoing, and we anticipate a readout in the 2023, 2024 time frame.  As you can see on this slide, shared for the first time in our oncology deep dive earlier this month, we are in the earliest stages of evaluating how Trodelvy, either alone or in combination, could bring new options to people with cancer. In total, we're studying more than 25 combinations, including 7 Phase III combination studies.  On behalf of my Kite colleagues and on Slide 20, I'm pleased to highlight the FDA approval of Yescarta for the second-line treatment of relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma earlier this month. The approval is based on the ZUMA-7 trial data that showed that 2.5x more patients receiving Yescarta were alive at 2 years without disease progression or need for additional cancer treatment versus the standard of care. This was the first cell therapy approved by FDA for initial treatment of refractory or relapsed LBCL and within 12 months of initial treatment. Yescarta was also added to the NCCN's B-cell lymphoma treatment guidelines for these patients.  Moving to magrolimab on Slide 21. We're very pleased that the FDA lifted the partial clinical holds for our MDS and AML trials, and we resumed enrollment in our 3 pivotal studies. I'll note that the remaining partial clinical holds on DLBCL and multiple myeloma are being reviewed by a different division of the FDA, and we're actively working to resolve them as quickly as possible. In the meantime, the impact of these remaining partial holds is limited since the DLBCL trial was already fully enrolled at the time of the partial clinical hold and the multiple myeloma trial had just initiated.  Overall, we're excited by magrolimab's potential to be the first new treatment for first-line high-risk MDS patients in 15 years and have completed patient enrollment for the first interim analysis that we expect to share in early 2023. In the meantime, we look forward to sharing data from our Phase Ib trial for high-risk MDS and first-line TP53 AML with more patients and longer follow-up at ASCO in June.  Finally, on Slide 22 and noting that the timing for the potential submission of TROPiCS-02 NDA decision for CAPELLA are subject to change, there are no updates to the targeted milestones shared with you in January. With our partner, Arcus, we're targeting a number of data readouts in the second half of the year and have added some new trials, including STAR-121, evaluating zimberelimab and dominilumab in combination with chemotherapy for front-line non-small cell lung cancer and R-21 to evaluate the same combination of upper GI malignancies.  With that, I'll hand the call over to Andy. Yes. Michael, I think as a normal course of business, we'll always discuss the data -- the totality of the data with the agency prior to a filing and have that conversation with them. As we've said, the primary endpoint was statistically significant. And so we will have that conversation with them looking at all the data and come to a conclusion based on the feedback we get. Yes. Nothing new to report, Brian. It's a great question. We continue to move along really well in our Phase I study that's moving forward expeditiously. And we are working with the agency to design a Phase II/III program and really moving as fast as possible. We've got a great partnership with the agency and others and are really ready to count. So right now, so far, so good. Sure. Yes. I mean maybe I'll start by saying on the PrEP side, we obviously don't need to wait for a partner molecule. And really, at this point, it's about resolving the issues with the clinical hold. Once that gets resolved, we'll be back in business with the trials and we'll move as fast as possible to get the PrEP studies completed and get our filing done.  In treatment, you're absolutely right. And again, I think you're right, we've built the portfolio to provide as numerous options to then combine with lenacapavir for treatment in a long-acting mode. And that's a mix of oral approaches where we could have an oral long-acting molecule or a parenteral long-acting agent. And for parenteral, we're trying to go for longer than 2 months. And for oral, we are looking at, hopefully, getting to weekly or thereabouts. So we have a number of candidates that are progressing to show us -- essentially, you said it right, which is do they have the right properties from a PK/PD standpoint for an oral agent? And do they have the right properties parenterally, including things like injection site reactions and tolerability? So it's less about the ability to inhibit HIV replication. It's more about the molecule and the formulation characteristics that allow us to get to long-acting therapy.  And I'll just say again that lenacapavir is a very unique and special molecule that enables us to do that. Finding another molecule that has those sorts of characteristics is the challenge that we're undertaking. Sure. Yes. On the biomarker side, we continue to evaluate the role of Trop-2 expression in responses. And as we discussed, actually, for the breast cancer study in our experience so far, we are not seeing a big impact of Trop-2 expression on responsiveness. So we'll -- but we'll keep looking because lung cancer may behave differently than what we're seeing. And we do expect expression patterns to be different. So maybe there'll be a different cutoff in a different tumor type. So that remains to be seen.  In terms of synergy, we are -- I think that's the nature of where we're going with the studies. And that in order to see additive benefit, we need to conduct the larger clinical trials. We do think that coming at the tumors with the 2 different approaches, we'll add. I'm always careful about using the term synergy. I think that implies a different mechanistic approach. So I do think we expect additivity of the 2 components. And yes, we do feel that we will have additivity that Trodelvy should bring additional benefit to patients over and above what the immuno-oncology agents, PD-1, PD-L1 inhibitors, bring to the treatment of those patients. Yes. I mean not much to add other than I think our Phase I study is moving very quickly. It's moving very nicely without any issues. I know, Umer, you've asked about the 505(b)(2) approach in the past. As you can imagine, those are all -- the avenues you've mentioned are all avenues that we've thought about and explored. And so we will move with the fastest pathway available to us, and that's the nature of the discussions we're having with the agency. Sure. Yes. I think our thinking has been that dominolumab as a TIGIT agent will add to the ORR. But to your point, it's not only that, that we would be looking for. And what we would be hoping for in addition to the overall response rate is going to be the depth of the responses and the durability of responses, right? So those are the factors that we'll be looking for. We will also be looking to see what the Roche data looks like when they -- when it comes out at ASCO to see what they've seen is sort of a benchmark, if you will. But those are the various factors we'll be looking for. Obviously, tolerability is going to be in there as well and the overall profile. Sure. Look, I think we obviously are going to be looking across all the data across all the assets. Maybe the way I would say it is that we're seeing the TIGIT/PD-1 combination is likely to be sort of the benchmark or the basis for treatment at least in lung cancer and potentially more broadly. And as such, our hope is to have a great combination there to make sure that we then have something to which we can add other potential agents that could bring us to even better responsiveness. So whether that's adenosine or Trodelvy or something else in our pipeline, I think those are all options for us to consider. But we're seeing -- I would say the floor is being raised is our belief and that TIGIT/PD-1 combination becomes sort of the baseline that we need to aim for. Well, what I would say is those milestones -- I would agree with the milestones that you've got there. And it's important to remember that those milestones will take time to play out. And we are going to make our bets without being able to look at OS for 30 months, right? We're going to have a less mature data set from which to make that decision. So you're absolutely right that we will be looking at all of those things.  The driver will be to see that, again, tolerability and a benefit as far as the overall response rate is concerned and look for benefits in the depth and duration of response that we can garner from the data set at the maturity that we will have when we look at it. And there, I would just say we'll be, in a sense, watch our actions because you'll be seeing the studies will be getting underway, and that should give you a sense of our confidence in those assets."

            "name": "Daniel O'Day",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everybody. We appreciate you taking the time with Gilead today, and I also want to thank those of you who joined our virology and oncology deep dives over the last few months. These 2 events provided a more in-depth view of our portfolio, our strategy and the teams behind them. We shared a much broader view of our growing clinical pipeline than we had in the past, highlighting its potential to deliver a number of new therapies to address unmet needs for patients across a diverse range of conditions.  For those of you who joined, I hope you got a deeper sense of why we're confident of sustaining our leadership in virology and growing our oncology revenue so that it becomes more than 1/3 of our total revenue in 2030.  I'll turn now to our performance this quarter, and I'm pleased to share that the year is off to a strong start in line with guidance, as shown on Slide 4. Total product revenue was up 3% from last year to USD 6.5 billion, with cell therapy, Veklury, Trodelvy and HIV driving growth. HIV grew 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by Biktarvy, which grew 18%, and reported more than 4% market share growth compared to the first quarter of 2021. This is notable given the impact of our Truvada LOE.  Sequentially, HIV was down 18%, primarily as a result of first quarter seasonality. Our growing oncology portfolio performed well, with Trodelvy revenue doubling compared to the first quarter of 2021 and cell therapy delivering another strong quarter of growth.  We recently expanded our portfolio of marketed cancer therapies following the FDA approval of Yescarta for second-line relapsed and refractory LBCL. I'm also pleased to highlight the FDA approval of our new cell therapy facility in Maryland, which is part of the expected 50% increase in our manufacturing capacity by the end of 2022. The new facility will support our cell therapy growth expectations over the next several years.  Moving to the pipeline. We shared the Phase III top line readout from TROPiCS-02 in March showing that the study met its primary endpoint with a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival versus physician's choice in chemotherapy. Additionally, the first interim analysis of the key secondary endpoint of overall survival demonstrated a trend in improvement.  As you know, we are exploring potential pathways for approval with regulatory authorities to bring Trodelvy to these later-stage patients. The details of the study results will be shared at ASCO in June.  At the oncology deep dive earlier this month, we highlighted the broad potential for Trodelvy across multiple tumor types and lines of therapy, with plans to initiate 13 more Trodelvy trials through 2023, including 4 more in 2022.  Turning to Slide 5. As you know, the timing for TROPiCS-02 and the NDA decision for CAPELLA are subject to change. In the case of CAPELLA, this is due to the biocompatibility issue that we're working to resolve, and we're fully confident in lenacapavir itself. Other than that, we are on track with the remaining targeted milestones we shared with you in January.  We've added some of the newly disclosed trials from our oncology deep dive as well on this slide. Additionally, we're pleased to note that the partial clinical hold for the pivotal magrolimab trials, including ENHANCE free for first-line unfit AML shown on the slide have been lifted. I'm also pleased to share that despite the hold, there's no change to the timing of the first interim readout for ENHANCE for first-line high-risk MDS, which we expect in the first half of 2023. Merdad will share more pipeline details later in the call.  Before I pass it over to Johanna, I just want to take a moment to thank the Gilead and Kite teams who are putting the full weight of their expertise, passion and commitment behind all of this work that you're seeing. It's thanks to our 14,000 employees across the world that we're delivering for patients with diverse conditions and diseases today and advancing a pipeline of innovative new therapies for the future. We have some gold ambitions for the coming years, and we're confident in achieving them given the level of innovation and capabilities that we have in place today.  Now I'll invite Johanna to share an update on our first quarter commercial performance. Over to you, Johanna. Thanks, Michael. I'll turn it over to Merdad in just a second, but I'll just remind folks that we will be discussing the data more at ASCO coming up there in early June. We look forward to engaging with regulatory authorities in the coming months to further discuss the data and the path forward. I'll see if Merdad has anything to add on that at this stage, but... Right. And we continue to look at earlier lines of therapy and plan those trials to move up in lines of therapy given the results we saw in TROPiCS-02 as well and hormone receptor-positive. So thanks a lot, Michael, for that. Thanks for the question. We'll go right to Johanna. Thanks, Brian. I'll hand over to you, Merdad. Yes. Thanks, Geoff. Appreciate it. I'm going to turn it over to Merdad in a second here. But just remind -- for those of you that didn't have the chance to look at the virology deep dive day, we really did spend a lot of time in the entirety of the portfolio and the many shots on goal we have along with lenacapavir. Lenacapavir is a truly unique molecule and presents opportunities and challenges to find exactly the right partner. But we certainly have many that will be progressing to the clinic. But Merdad, maybe you want to give a little more meat to the... Yes. Thanks, Do. We're delighted to have Christi here with us. So we'll hear it from the source here. Over to you, Christi. Thanks for the question. Merdad, why don't you cover that? Thanks, Robyn, and I'll start and then maybe Andy can add. But I appreciate you bringing that up. I think it's been a really purposeful strategic approach that we've taken over the past -- last 3 years to build our oncology portfolio beyond cell therapy, which is obviously now has a history with us for almost 5 years. And I'd just remind the folks on the phone that in addition to whatever is acquired at the time of the acquisition in terms of trials and potential and capability of that size organization, naturally, when a large organization acquires particularly these pan-tumor potential molecules, you begin really the process of extending the potential for that medicine alone in late lines, earlier lines and in combinations and thoughtful combinations.  I think actually, Kite is a terrific example of that, going back now 5 years post the acquisition, and I appreciate, Robyn, that you started out with congratulations on Yescarta. But to see the potential for a technology like cell therapy and the leadership that Kite took by bringing this up into earlier lines of therapy and the number of patients, of course, then that you can impact on with a potentially curative therapy is exactly kind of the playbook that we will be -- we are pursuing right now with Trodelvy, with magrolimab, and obviously, with the combination of Arcus assets, which -- albeit a bit earlier in the process. So I think we always have to remember the time frame and which one evaluates the success of M&A.  The other thing I would just say is that, of course, we constantly are looking to complement that. I mean the bar is much higher now for Gilead than it was several years ago because the number of possibilities and opportunities we have and the bandwidth that any one company can do, but you see on the bandwidth side, we're also doing a lot of collaborations with other companies, including folks like Merck who are operationalizing, in fact, a study of ours with Trodelvy. So there's different ways, I think, to work on the bandwidth. But we will constantly be looking at different types of opportunities out there that complement our virology, our oncology and our early inflammation program to add those to the growth story that we are creating here at Gilead.  I'll just -- I know Andy spends a lot of time thinking about this. I'd love Andy's additional thoughts on this as well. Thanks, Andy. And the last thing I'd say in addition to the molecules and the medicines, the expertise that we're bringing into Gilead is second to none. And hopefully, you saw some of that. And it's just really the -- some representation of that at both virology and oncology deep dive days because that's really critical in any company that we've all -- as the leadership team worked in is really getting the right teams together at the right time to make sure we're making the right choices and decisions on the portfolios as we move forward. So that's a really big focus for us, and we're really pleased with the progress we're making there. Yes. Umer, I'll start, and then I'll hand it over to Merdad. So first of all, I mean, just to reinforce this message for everybody on the phone, I mean, we are absolutely moving with tremendous focus and speed. And of course, we have great lessons within our organization. Remdesivir was arguably the fastest development of an antiviral that's ever occurred from standing still essentially to an approval in the United States. So -- and as you know, we've got a lot of experience from that in terms of working both property groups around accelerating trials, with the FDA around pursuing unique regulatory path. And those learnings and those lessons I just want to say are certainly being put to use now for 5 2 4 5.  Having said that, we're, of course, at a very different stage of the pandemic at this stage. And therefore, both from a regulatory perspective and also our ability to recruit clinical trials, particularly with a somewhat raining pandemic in the developed world, has implications on the path we'll take.  And with that, maybe I'll turn it over to Merdad on any other details he wants to add. Yes. Thanks a lot, Andy. I mean, Evan, I think the bottom line is that, again, we took a somewhat conservative approach in the absence of having regulatory discussions so far. We thought it was a prudent thing to do. And to Andy's point, I mean, this is an evaluation of value at the time of the transaction, which, of course, several years later in terms of the indications, the combinations, the potential for Trodelvy is never, as you know, reflective in the initial accounting treatment of it. So hopefully, there's plenty of information in there in our press release and more than happy to take it up with you as well. So thanks, Evan, for that. Thanks a lot, Tyler. So over to Merdad, please. Thanks, Colin. Merdad, go ahead. Thanks. Very nice conceptual there. So out of respect for everybody's time, we'll take one last question. Jonathan, can we have the last question, please? With that, I just want to thank everybody. I really appreciate the attention today for the couple of deep dives we've had. We look forward to chatting with you at ASCO and beyond to keep you updated on our progress for the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jacquie for some final comments."

            "name": "Andrew Dickinson",
            "content": "Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the Q1 P&L review and the guidance update, I wanted to touch on the $2.7 billion partial in-process R&D impairment related to assets acquired from Immunomedics in 2020. This had a $1.63 per share impact on our Q1 GAAP results and on our full year GAAP EPS guidance. There is no impact to our non-GAAP EPS in Q1 or to our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year. With the TROPiCS-02 data readout in March, we have reassessed the value of the assets acquired. While no final decisions have been made pending discussions with regulatory authorities, as a result of the data, we have taken a $2.7 billion impairment to reflect the likelihood of a delayed launch of Trodelvy for third-line-plus HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer in the United States as well as Europe and the possibility of a reduced market share in late-line patients given the emerging competitive landscape. Prior to today's update, Gilead was carrying $14.7 billion for the IP R&D indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired with Immunomedics. This now values these assets at $12 billion.  Recall that the carrying value of Trodelvy reflected 4 potential indications in progress at the time of the acquisition, triple-negative breast cancer and hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, bladder cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. At that time, we knew that Trodelvy's potential extended beyond these indications, but for accounting purposes did not assign value for the incremental opportunities that we are exploring in prostate, endometrial and other solid tumors as well as potential combinations such as with magrolimab, venelumab and PD-1s like pembrolizumab.  As you saw at our oncology deep dive earlier this month, there are 13 Trodelvy programs targeted for initiation through 2023, including a number of incremental opportunities. As a result, we remain confident Trodelvy will deliver an attractive return to our shareholders over time.  Moving to Slide 24. The first quarter was a strong start to the year despite the expected seasonality observed in our HIV business and was stronger-than-expected Veklury sales. Total product sales were $6.5 billion, up 3% year-over-year, with growth in cell therapy, Veklury, Trodelvy and HIV, offset in part by lower HCV revenue. Of note, FX negatively impacted first quarter revenue by almost $100 million, net of hedges, representing approximately 160 basis points of growth. Total product sales, excluding Veklury, were up 2% from the first quarter of 2021 to $5 billion.  In HIV, on a sequential basis, we were impacted, as expected, by the normal seasonality associated with Q1 inventory burn following a build in Q4 in addition to the typical first quarter pricing headwinds that improved throughout the rest of the year. With Q1 now behind us, we expect sequential growth in HIV throughout the rest of the year.  Non-GAAP product gross margin was 87.4% for Q1, up 90 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to lower inventory reserve adjustment. First quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were largely consistent with our expectations as we support the expansion of our oncology business. Non-GAAP R&D was $1.2 billion, up 10% year-over-year. And non-GAAP SG&A was $1.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year, both primarily due to higher costs associated with Trodelvy.  Moving to tax. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the first quarter was 18.4%. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.12 in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $2.04 for the same period last year, reflecting the higher revenue and higher gross margin, offset in part by higher operating expenses.  On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate and earnings per share were impacted by the $2.7 billion impairment.  We are excited about the strong start to the year. And as you can see on Slide 25, the only revision to our outlook is to our GAAP EPS, primarily to reflect the $1.63 share impact of the impairment discussed earlier. We now expect GAAP EPS in the range of $3 to $3.50 per share from $4.70 to $5.20.  On Veklury, we note the strong revenue start to the year, but also, fortunately, the significant drop-off in U.S. hospitalizations during the first quarter and into the second quarter so far. With that in mind, we will monitor demand through the second quarter and evaluate our full year guidance in the middle of the year.  One housekeeping item before we wrap up. Following recent guidance from the SEC, beginning in the first quarter and similar to many of our peers, Gilead will no longer exclude acquired in-process R&D expenses from non-GAAP financial measures. Prior period results have been updated to reflect this new methodology and are shared in our supplementary data posted on the Investor Relations website.  As a reminder, our full year guidance does not include the impact of any future upfront payments related to the normal course of business partnerships or licensing deals. Going forward, we plan to update our guidance on a quarterly basis to reflect the impact of any new corporate development transactions closed in the prior quarter.  Moving to Slide 26. You can see there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. In the first quarter, we repaid $500 million in debt. Additionally, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through our dividend and repurchase of shares.  Finally, on M&A, there is no change to our philosophy here either. We are very comfortable with the breadth and the quality of the pipeline that we have built, acquired or partnered, and the growth that it will enable in the coming years. With that in mind, you can expect us to continue to opportunistically access high-quality assets through partnerships or make smaller acquisitions in the normal course of business.  With that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A. Thanks, Dan. And thank you, Robyn, for the question. Look, I would just go back to start with fundamentally, we have a lot of confidence in where we are in our growth profile today. And I think it's fair to say that the market maybe underappreciates the growth. Even, Robyn, if you look at our first quarter results, especially when you adjust for the impact of LOE and FX, there's really reasonably strong growth in our business. And this is just the beginning from our perspective. So there are always things that we can do to work on our growth profile. But when you look at the strength of the HIV business, what we're seeing in our oncology business, hopefully, that gives you a sense of why we as a management team have so much confidence about not only where we are today, but where we're going. And we recognize, to your question, that the growth profile should get meaningfully better in the next couple of years as the portfolio matures in the way that Dan was describing.  So while we will look at things, including commercial assets, as you know, those are far and few between. Many of them are expensive, and that's not really where our focus is. We really genuinely believe we have everything that we need today to be a leading growth company in the sector, and it's just going to take a little more time. But we're definitely seeing all the right signs that we are looking for as a management team. So you should not expect that we're going to go out chasing commercial assets or large deals. The guidance is very clear. It's ordinary course partnerships, maybe smaller commercial acquisitions. Again, we'll be opportunistic. But that's not where our focus is today. Thank you. Evan, it's Andy. Thanks for the question. It's a great question. Look, it's relatively simple. And just to back up, remember, this is an accounting construct that we are required to reassess the value even before we have the discussions with the regulatory authorities. So I just want to back up and reiterate what we said when the data came out. The study was positive. This is strong data. There was a range of outcomes that we expected when we did the deal. This was within the range of outcomes, but it wasn't at the point that we had modeled specifically because we are required to when we put together the intangible indefinite-lived asset schedule after the acquisition. So it's a very simple model, too.  So the key, by the way, is our valuation when we have discussions in the coming months with the FDA could change again, of course. And we'll have to continue to look at the valuation of the assets that are still sitting on the balance sheet, which is the valuation attributed to hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer over the coming years, as you'd expect, consistent with any business combination transaction. But it's relatively simple.  It's your standard probability-weighted discounted cash flow analysis where you look at the probability of approval. We are assuming, Evan -- I think this is the key for you. We took a conservative approach, and we were looking at this and assume that there is not a path forward based on the PFS data and that we need to wait for overall survival, even though we're not certain that that's the case and we will know more in the coming months. So for purposes -- for the accounting treatment, we had to make a call, and that's the call that we made, and that leads to the 2.7.  The other thing I would add is we had Trodelvy-related IP R&D of $14.7 billion at the end of 2021, a little over half of that or $8.8 billion of it related to hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. The remainder was non-small cell lung cancer. And again, we're already -- in the other indications that are approved, we're already amortizing that. Those are now finite-lived assets. So now we have $6.1 billion relating to the cash flows expected from third line plus -- as well as the earlier line hormone receptor positive breast cancer indication. But hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color.  And again, I'd reiterate what we said on the call, which is when we did this originally, when we did the acquisition, we highlighted explicitly that we were going to explore other tumor types and combinations that were not part of our deal model. There is no need to build them into the deal model from bottoms up. So when you step back, more importantly, outside of the accounting construct, we continue to believe that there are many, many paths forward to create a lot of value for patients and for our shareholders with this. So I'm happy to take it off-line if it's helpful to give you more color. Sure. That's a great question, Mohit. I'm happy to take it. The -- look, it's relatively simple. And that you're absolutely right. And even in April, we've seen a continued deterioration of exchange rates or strengthening of the dollar, which impacts the revenues coming from our European business. So to be clear, the $100 million impact was a year-over-year comparison Q1 to Q1. Johanna and I are watching the budget impact of the exchange rates very carefully. And part of the confidence in maintaining the guidance is that, yes, there are FX headwinds. There are also, for instance -- related to your question, there's also this change in the accounting treatment of in-process R&D, which will lead to additional expenses from upfront payments that weren't previously part of how we reported non-GAAP earnings.  On the flip side, there are parts of our business that are outperforming. Again, you think of the strength of Veklury that we've seen so far. So Johanna and I and the rest of the management team will look at the puts and takes of this in the middle of the year, and we'll provide a more thoughtful update. But I think the key for you is recognizing the couple of things that have changed that could impact negatively our EPS GAAP and non-GAAP EPS. There are also things that will have additional strength we expect over the course of the year that will offset that to some extent. And so we'll give you additional color later in the year, but we're very comfortable maintaining our guidance where we are today. Hopefully, that helps."

            "name": "Johanna Mercier",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. So turning to Slide 7. We had a solid start to the year with total product sales, excluding Veklury, of USD 5 billion for the quarter, up 2% year-over-year driven by cell therapy, Trodelvy and HIV, and offset in part by HCV pricing dynamics. Quarter-over-quarter, total product sales, excluding Veklury, were down 14% as a result of the seasonality we typically see in the first quarter of the year, primarily in our HIV business.  On Slide 8, you can see that HIV sales were down 18% quarter-over-quarter to $3.7 billion, consistent with our guidance, given the seasonality we customarily experienced in the first quarter of every year. First, the channels build their inventories over the fourth quarter and then draw them down during Q1. On a dollar basis, the majority of the sequential decline was associated with inventory drawdown. Second, we realized lower net prices in part due to increased copay support, Part D discounts and other efforts to maintain access and affordability of our HIV medicines as patients' insurance plans reset. This is a customary Q1 dynamic that we expect to normalize throughout the rest of this year.  Year-over-year, HIV sales were up 2% driven by market growth for both treatment and PrEP, often in part by the impact of the lost exclusivity for Truvada in 2020. The year-over-year impact of this LOE is expected to be minimal starting in this quarter, second quarter of this year. And excluding the LOE impact, HIV sales increased 5%.  Overall, we're encouraged by the signs of recovery seen in the HIV treatment market despite screening and diagnosis rates still below prepandemic levels and the continued impact on market growth due to the Omicron surge in Q1. As a result, both the U.S. and European HIV treatment markets were down slightly on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, the European market was roughly flat, and the U.S. market grew a little over 3%.  The PrEP market grew 33% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Notably, Descovy continues to hold approximately 45% market share, and we'll continue to engage with payers to ensure those who benefit from PrEP have access to their preferred regimen.  We believe Gilead remains well positioned in PrEP. And as highlighted during our virology deep dive in February, we expect the market to double by 2030, catalyzed by the launch of long-acting regimens such as lenacapavir.  Descovy sales in the first quarter were $374 million, up 4% year-over-year, driven by continued PrEP market growth and partially offset by generic competition in switches to newer treatment medicines such as Biktarvy.  Turning to Slide 9. Biktarvy sales of $2.2 billion in the first quarter were up 18% year-over-year driven by U.S. market growth, and notably, continued share gains in both the U.S. and in Europe. Biktarvy remains the leading regimen for new starts and switches in the U.S. and new starts in Europe. In fact, Biktarvy share is up 4.5% year-over-year to 43% share in the U.S., almost 8x larger than the next leading promoted medicine and representing the highest share of any complete regimen for the treatment of HIV.  Moving to Slide 10 in HCV. We maintained steady market share, and the 22% decline year-over-year was primarily driven by unfavorable pricing dynamics. Sequentially, HCV was up 2%, while the overall market and new patient starts continue to be impacted by the pandemic.  HBV and HDV on Slide 11 were up 7% year-over-year due to higher demand for Vemlidy, namely in Asia. Sequentially, HBV and HDV declined 11% driven by the same HBV seasonal inventory and pricing dynamics impacting HIV.  Hepcludex sales were $11 million for the quarter, primarily reflecting sales in Germany and France where full reimbursement has been established. Our discussions with regulatory values and other countries across Europe are ongoing. And of course, we look forward to potential approval in the U.S. in the second half of this year.  Veklury revenues in the first quarter were $1.5 billion, as shown on Slide 12. The clear utilization tracks hospitalization rates, and therefore, due to the timing of Omicron surges, was lower in the U.S. after January but higher in Europe and Asia later in the quarter. We're optimistic that there will not be another surge this year in the U.S. And overall, we will maintain our readiness to support hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. There's no change to our commitment to COVID-19 patients globally. And in that regard, we were very pleased to receive the World Health Organization's revised COVID-19 guidelines. These guidelines now conditionally recommend Veklury for the treatment of patients with nonsevere COVID-19 at highest risk of hospitalization. And earlier this week, Veklury received FDA approval for the treatment of certain pediatric patients for at least 28 days old, highlighting our ongoing commitment to extend the reach of Veklury where we can.  Now turning to oncology. Trodelvy sales were up 103% year-over-year and 24% sequentially, as shown on Slide 13. We're encouraged by adoption not just in the U.S., but notably, in Germany and France, and continue to work with health authorities and reimbursement bodies to extend Trodelvy's reach to patients globally. We've completed the expansion of our field force to support the U.S. and Europe and believe we are now at right scale to support physicians and make Trodelvy available across all approved indications to patients who could benefit from it.  We're extremely excited by the feedback from physicians about Trodelvy's impact on patients, both those who are prescribing Trodelvy today and those who expect to have access to it soon. With strong physician uptake and our expanded field footprint starting in April, we believe Trodelvy will benefit more than the 1 in 4 second-line metastatic TNBC patients we're reaching in the U.S. today.  We look forward to sharing more updates as we progress throughout the year.  Turning to Slide 14. And on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, cell therapy sales for the first quarter of 2022 were $274 million, up 43% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. For the quarter, Yescarta sales of $211 million were up 32% year-over-year and 16% sequentially driven by continued global demand in relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma as well as in follicular lymphoma. This highlights the growing recognition of the durable long-term survival benefit showcased at last December's American Society of Hematology Meeting.  For Tecartus, sales of $63 million were up 103% year-over-year due to strong demand in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. We're pleased with the strong early uptake for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the U.S. following approval last October, which contributed to the 11% sequential growth in Tecartus.  The strong momentum we've seen across our cell therapy portfolio continued with the approval of Yescarta in second-line relapsed or refractory LBCL earlier this month as well as FDA's approval for our new Maryland manufacturing facility announced just last week. Through capacity improvements across our existing in-house CAR-T manufacturing site in addition to the new Maryland site, we expect our manufacturing capacity to increase by up to 50% and support our aspiration to serve a cumulative 25,000-plus patients by the end of 2025.  Second-line orders started coming in the day after the FDA approval and have been steady ever since. It is truly heartening to see the immediate help we can provide for patients.  Given the Yescarta second-line inclusion in the NCCN guidelines and robust clinical data, we expect Yescarta to shift the paradigm in the standard of care for LBCL patients.  Christi is here with the team and is available to take any questions on cell therapy during our Q&A. And so with that, I will hand over the call to Merdad for an update on our clinical pipeline. Thanks for your question. So Veklury has been used now with over 11 million patients worldwide, which I think is really impressive. And it's still 1 out of 2 hospitalized patients in the U.S. What we are seeing, though, is trends of less severe disease, and therefore, less hospitalizations, but also less treatments.  Specific to your question to China, we don't have approval in China at this point in time. And we're continuing those discussions with health authorities in light of the fact that what's going on in China with the pandemic, obviously. I do think the WHO guidelines being updated just most recently is also going to help those discussions as well. So more to come on that, but not currently in play at this point in time in China. Thank you. Sure. So both market and CABENUVA. Thanks, Simon, for your question. So let me start with the market. So if you look at the screening and diagnosis levels, they're still somewhat below prepandemic, but they're definitely catching up. I think what we saw in the first half '21 was a really depressed market and started picking back up in Q3 and Q4 of last year. What we saw in Q1 of this year despite the Omicron surge that obviously impacts, what we saw quarter-over-quarter pretty much flat in the U.S. and overall Europe as well. Year-on-year change, though, we have a 3.6% growth. And I think that's really -- that's the signal that we need to watch for and continue to focus on. And since Gilead has close to 75% market share of the total HIV market, I think it's really -- it's part of our responsibility to ensure that we get screening and diagnosis up and make sure we [end this pandemic] (ph). So more to come on that, but there's a lot of activities the team is taking on to ensure that we get people back in and screened so that we don't have full-fledge cases of AIDS which, unfortunately, we've seen in the recent past, and you've seen that anecdotally.  On the prevention market, it's a little bit different. Prevention market bounces back a lot faster post this pandemic, and we've seen that time and time again after every single surge. So what we've seen quarter-over-quarter was about a 3% growth in the U.S. for prevention. So slightly modest growth, which declined a little bit, but that's because of the Omicron surge in January. Year-over-year, the growth was 33%. And so I think that's really telling in the sense of how it bounces back much faster post these surges. And that's been kind of consistent year-on-year as we've seen the different, I guess, variants.  On your question around CABENUVA., specific to CABENUVA., treatment share in CABENUVA. is 0.6%. So no, we haven't seen an impact. What we see is new entrants coming into the market. You always see a little bit of switching going on, which is normal. I do think that there's an [ask] (ph) from a patient standpoint, this is the first long-acting, so it is exciting. What we're also seeing is a higher-than-usual drop-off rate with CABENUVA as well. And a lot of that share is going to Biktarvy back. So I do think it's interesting to watch. And I think the more agents on the market, the better, but definitely one that at this point in time very limited impact to the HIV market share for Gilead. Thanks for your questions."

            "content": "Thanks, Do. So we're very encouraged. First, before the approval, the NCCN guidelines that changed and now put Yescarta for LBCL second-line as category 1 which, as you may know, physicians and providers use to identify standard of care. So that happened a month before approval, which is unusual in these times. And then with the approval -- right after the approval, our manufacturing site was approved in Maryland. So we really feel like we're hitting on all cylinders in terms of really bringing this important therapy to patients. And so the second-line launch was approved on a Friday at about 3 p.m. And on Saturday, orders started to come in. So we're already manufacturing commercial product in our site in the Maryland facility.  So definitely, it's really early days, obviously, but the demand was building up, I think, when the data came out at ASH in December, and we're starting to see the orders come in as soon as we get approval."

My name is Victoria, and I'll be your moderator today. All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with the opportunity for questions and answers at the end. I would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Jacquie Ross. Thank you. You may proceed, Jacquie.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you, Operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. The press release, slides, and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today\u2019s call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O\u2019Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we\u2019ll open the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Cindy Perettie, the Executive Vice President of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including those related to Gilead\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections and the use of capital, and 2024 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company\u2019s underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet, as well as on the Gilead website. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dan.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. The team and I are pleased you could join us today as we share the details of our full year and fourth quarter performance and the latest on our clinical portfolio. Starting with our full year performance, 2023 was a strong year for Gilead, with 7% growth in product sales, excluding Veklury, driven by HIV and Oncology. HIV grew by almost $1 billion, with Biktarvy sales growing 14% to almost $12 billion and increasing its market share in the US to 48%. Oncology grew 37% to almost $3 billion, an increase of almost $800 million in just one year. This growth was split evenly between our Kite cell therapies and Trodelvy. Veklury for COVID-19 contributed $2.2 billion in 2023, ahead of our expectations, but down year-over-year, as expected, given the evolution of the pandemic. In the last two years combined, Gilead\u2019s base business has grown approximately $3.3 billion, or more than 7% annually, largely offsetting the decline in Veklury revenues over the same period. The consistent growth in our base business gives us a strong foundation as we continue into 2024 and look to deliver on our broad clinical portfolio. This is a catalyst-rich phase for Gilead with more than 20 updates this year and many more to come beyond 2024. Starting with Oncology, we expect at least 12 further updates by the end of 2024. These include Phase 3 updates for Trodelvy in bladder and triple-negative breast cancer, and results from the pivotal Phase 2 iMMagine-1 study for anito-cel in multiple myeloma, for which we saw encouraging Phase 1 data at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December. Also in Cell Therapy, we are very pleased to have shortened our manufacturing time for Yescarta by another two days in the US, reinforcing our industry-leading median turnaround time, which is now at an anticipated 14 days. As you know, we did not reach the primary endpoint for EVOKE-01, our Phase 3 trial for second-line plus metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Merdad will go into detail on this later, but while we did not see the outcome we hoped for, the data are encouraging on a number of levels, namely, a numerical improvement in overall survival favoring Trodelvy, including in both squamous and non-squamous tumors, a safety profile consistent with our product label that could continue to differentiate Trodelvy versus other TROP2 ADCs, and while not statistically powered, a potential benefit for a pre-specified sub-population that saw more than three months\u2019 median overall improvement. The team is evaluating next steps given the data and the significant unmet need and we look forward to discussing the data with regulators. Based on the totality of the results in both EVOKE-02 and EVOKE-01, we are confident in Trodelvy\u2019s potential in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, including in earlier lines of therapy. In Virology, we are looking forward to a very important year for our HIV portfolio. Among the multiple updates we are expecting are the Phase 3 data for lenacapavir in HIV prevention and at least eight updates from our HIV treatment program. These are milestones that could bring us closer to our goal of helping to end the HIV epidemic, building on Gilead\u2019s decades of leadership in HIV. In COVID-19, today we are announcing that our Phase 3 trial, OAKTREE, evaluating obeldesivir did not meet its primary endpoint. We conducted this study to explore whether obeldesivir could address the public health need that existed with COVID-19 for standard-risk patients. Again, Merdad will share details later, but essentially, because of the way things have evolved, the standard-risk population is now better able to fight COVID-19 without antiviral therapy. This made it more difficult for obeldesivir to show a benefit compared to the placebo. We know that the world needs to be equipped for other viruses and the broad antiviral activity of obeldesivir shown preclinically means it has potential for other viral infections. The updates we are expecting in 2024 have the potential to unlock multiple opportunities across Virology and Oncology. With a broad portfolio where the risk is balanced, we look forward to following the science and continuing to make a positive impact for patients and communities. Gilead has set an ambitious goal of delivering at least 10 transformative therapies by 2030, and we are driving confidently to that goal. Before I hand over to the team for their updates, I\u2019ll move to Slide 6 and recap that we executed well in 2023 and achieved all the remaining targeted goals that we expected to in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ll share our 2024 milestones later in the presentation, but it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s going to be a very busy year for Gilead. I\u2019d like to thank the teams for their work in bringing us to this important catalyst-rich phase for the company, and for the strong commercial performance that gives us a firm foundation on which to build. With that I will hand it over to Johanna.\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Beginning on Slide 8, total product sales for the full year were at the high-end of our guidance range at $26.9 billion, reflecting solid base business growth, with total product sales, excluding Veklury, up 7% year-over-year to $24.7 billion. This was almost entirely offset by the expected decline in Veklury sales. For the full-year, Veklury sales were $2.2 billion, reflecting the uptick in hospitalizations at the end of 2023, though still below levels seen in 2022. Turning to the fourth quarter on Slide 9, total product sales were $7.1 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Our base business sales were roughly flat year-over-year at $6.3 billion, primarily driven by higher Oncology sales, offset by lower HIV sales due to changes in channel mix that resulted in lower average realized price, in addition to the expected decline of our portfolio of non-promoted products. Moving to Slide 10, our HIV business delivered very strong results for the full-year, up 6% year-over-year to $18.2 billion and contributing almost $1 billion in base business growth, primarily driven by demand, as well as higher average realized price due to channel mix and inventory dynamics. More specifically, almost half of the full-year HIV growth was driven by higher demand, most notably by Biktarvy which delivered solid double-digit year-over-year growth of 14%, with annualized revenues now more than $12 billion. Already the clear market leader, Biktarvy continues to demonstrate impressive share gains, growing almost 3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2023, to approximately 48% share in the US. This growth once again outpaced all other branded regimens for HIV treatment, and represented the 22nd quarter of consecutive year-over-year share gains. For the fourth quarter, as highlighted on Slide 11, HIV sales of $4.7 billion reflected strong demand in line with our expectations. On a year-over-year basis, this was offset by lower average realized price due to channel mix that was notably favorable in the fourth quarter of 2022, and resulted in a decline of 2%. Sequentially, sales were up 1%, similarly driven by strong demand as well as favorable inventory dynamics, partially offset by lower average realized price due to channel mix. As we have noted previously, the pricing tailwinds we saw in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023 are not expected to repeat, and will make year-over-year comparisons more challenging in the immediate term, as we saw in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, quarterly HIV growth is, in general, significantly more variable and less indicative of overall trends than the full year, particularly as certain quarterly pricing and inventory dynamics tend to normalize over the course of the year. Factors include, first, gross-to-net adjustments which can be difficult to forecast due to the lag between product sales and claim payments that frequently occur in different quarters. Second, the timing of bulk government purchases which contribute to overall demand but can have a significant, negative impact on pricing in the quarter in which they occur. For example, certain discounted government segments are unpredictable in terms of bulk order timing, and this impacts overall average realized price. And then finally, the inventory build by subchannel wholesalers and customers that typically occurs towards the end of the year. Historically, this happens in the fourth quarter. In 2023, we saw the build start in the third quarter and continue, albeit to a lesser extent relative to prior years, into the fourth quarter. Overall, despite these quarterly variables, we remain confident that overall demand trends are strong and unchanged. With our HIV treatment market share above 70% in US and above 40% in PrEP, Gilead remains well-positioned to continue delivering demand-driven growth. For 2024, we expect HIV sales to grow approximately 4%, reflecting, annual treatment demand growth of 2% to 3%, Biktarvy market share gains and continued double-digit growth in demand for HIV prevention. In terms of quarterly HIV revenue, keep in mind that the first quarter is always impacted by the reset of patient copays and deductibles. Additionally, we\u2019ve historically seen inventory build-up in the fourth quarter that has led to notable draw-downs by wholesalers in the first quarter. In the first quarter of 2023, this contributed to HIV sales declining 12% sequentially, and we expect a similar decline in the 10% to 12% range for the first quarter of 2024. The continued strong performance of both Biktarvy and Descovy for PrEP are shown on Slide 12. Overall, Gilead\u2019s leadership in HIV is unmatched, with a solid commercial portfolio and robust pipeline of potentially best-in-class regimens to serve the daily oral, long-acting oral, and long-acting injectable markets. And I can share that we are off to a strong start in terms of HIV demand, which gives us confidence in our full year expectations for 2024. Moving to Liver Disease portfolio on Slide 13. Sales of $2.8 billion for the full year highlight the consistently strong and stable contribution from our Liver Disease portfolio. In the fourth quarter, sales were $691 million, flat year-over-year and down 2% sequentially, primarily driven by unfavorable pricing dynamics, offset by higher HCV market share and our efforts to increase linkage to care, in addition to growing HDV demand in new and existing European geographies. In HCV, we continue to reinforce Gilead\u2019s leadership with market share of over 60% in the US and over 50% in Europe. While we continue to expect the rate of HCV new starts to trend downwards over time, given the curative nature of our medicines, demand growth in both HDV and HBV is largely offsetting that headwind. Onto Slide 14. Veklury sales continue to be highly variable with the fourth quarter down 28% year-over- year, though up 13% sequentially due to higher COVID-related hospitalizations in the fourth quarter. For the full-year, Veklury sales of $2.2 billion exceeded the expectations we set out at the beginning of 2023. Turning to Slide 15, our Oncology business has achieved an annualized run-rate that now exceeds $3 billion with strong fourth quarter sales of $765 million, up 24% year-over-year. In just three years, Trodelvy revenue has grown to more than $1 billion, and we continue to see strong growth across our approved indications. And in Cell Therapy, sales approached $2 billion in 2023 and Kite remains firmly established as the leading provider of CAR T-cell therapies globally. Looking more closely at Trodelvy on Slide 16, sales for the full year were $1.1 billion, up 56% year-over-year. For the fourth quarter, sales were $299 million, up 53% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. With over 30,000 patients treated to date, Trodelvy\u2019s solid demand trends continue to reinforce its robust clinical profile as the only TROP2-directed antibody-drug conjugate approved and available in multiple tumor types. Awareness and utilization continue to increase, driving notable share gains. In second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, approximately one-third of patients are receiving Trodelvy, reinforcing its position as the leading regimen across the US and other major markets. In pre-treated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, we\u2019re encouraged to see share growth overall, driven by increasing adoption in the IHC0 setting as well as continued use in HER2-low. Additionally, we look forward to potentially making Trodelvy more broadly available in metastatic bladder cancer. Data from the confirmatory Phase 3 TROPiCS-04 study in the first half of the year could enable global filings and subsequent launches, as well as potentially drive adoption in the US, altogether expanding Trodelvy\u2019s potential reach to nearly 25,000 second-line plus patients with metastatic bladder cancer. Turning to Slide 17, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, Cell Therapy sales of $1.9 billion in 2023 grew 28% from 2022, driven by impressive growth, particularly outside the US as we expanded our network of authorized treatment centers, and secured reimbursement following recent approvals. In the fourth quarter, Cell Therapy product sales were $466 million, up 11% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially, with strong growth in both Yescarta and Tecartus in Europe and other international markets, offset in part by near-term headwinds for Yescarta in the US, from both in-class and out-of-class competition. As previously discussed, CAR T class share of eligible second-line plus large B-cell lymphoma patients remains at roughly 15% in the US as growth continues to be slower-than-anticipated despite the compelling clinical data that suggests these therapies are potentially transformative for many patients. In Europe and other markets, CAR T class share in this same second-line plus setting continues to be stronger, at approximately 30%. Following a restructuring in November, the Kite team has been focused on extending the reach of cell therapies from primarily academic medical centers to community practices, especially in the US. In late 2023, we established partnerships with leading community networks, which include over 1,750 physicians nationally. We are certifying affiliated practices to become authorized treatment centers to provide Kite cell therapies. So far, we\u2019ve made notable headway across centers in the southeast United States, for example, that operate over 40 locations to serve cancer patients. We expect to see the initial impact of these initiatives in mid-2024. In the meantime, we expect our Cell Therapy business to be flat to slightly up in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Importantly, alongside our 96% reliability rate, we\u2019re also thrilled to share that we have shortened our manufacturing time in the US by two days for Yescarta, bringing our anticipated median turnaround time to 14 days. This further extends our industry leadership in terms of manufacturing, and the Kite team continues to innovate in this critical element of the cell therapy business. We look forward to inviting you to visit one of our manufacturing facilities later this quarter during an analyst and investor event. In conclusion, I would like to thank our teams for a strong 2023 performance and setting up such great momentum for continued growth in 2024. The team is excited to continue to make our medicines accessible to all those who can benefit from them. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Merdad.\nMerdad Parsey: Thank you, Johanna. We\u2019ve had a busy start to 2024, and I\u2019ll begin by discussing the results of our EVOKE-01 study in second-line plus metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and our Phase 3 OAKTREE study of obeldesivir in standard-risk, non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19. While we are disappointed that these studies did not meet their primary endpoints, we are also encouraged by what we are learning from the data to inform our clinical programs and support our commitment to deliver innovative new therapies for patients. Let me cover each of these readouts in turn. First, on Slide 19, our Phase 3 study of Trodelvy in second-line plus metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, EVOKE-01, missed its primary endpoint of overall survival in this hard-to-treat setting. We plan to share the detailed data at the earliest opportunity. In the meantime, we\u2019d like to highlight what we believe to be important set of observations from EVOKE-01 that give us continued confidence in Trodelvy as a pipeline-in-a product and its potential to benefit some patients with lung cancer: We saw a numerical improvement favoring Trodelvy, including in patients with both squamous and non-squamous histologies. This is encouraging for our ongoing Phase 3 EVOKE-03 first-line trial evaluating Trodelvy in PD-L1 high patients, in combination with pembrolizumab. Importantly, Trodelvy continues to demonstrate a potentially differentiated safety, efficacy, and tolerability profile, with an adverse event profile that is consistent with our label. Further, Trodelvy achieved more than three months of improvement in median overall survival in a pre-specified subgroup of patients non-responsive to their prior anti-PD-L1 therapy. This subgroup is defined as those who achieved stable disease or progressive disease as their best outcome to last prior I/O therapy, and represented more than 60% of the trial population. This analysis was not alpha-controlled for formal statistical testing, and we are continuing to analyze these data. We will discuss these data with regulators and KOLs to determine the best path forward. As a reminder, we required all patients to have received prior I/O therapy, regardless of driver mutation status, and responsiveness to prior I/O was a stratification factor. Additional analyses, including TROP2 expression, are ongoing and we will share these data as quickly as possible. Based on these observations and the data from the ongoing EVOKE-02 study, we remain confident in Trodelvy\u2019s potential in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. For now, given these findings, we currently do not plan changes to our Phase 3 EVOKE-03 study that is enrolling as expected. Moving to Slide 20, our novel twice-daily, oral antiviral, obeldesivir, did not demonstrate statistically significant symptom relief in standard-risk, non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in our Phase 3 OAKTREE trial. Obeldesivir was well-tolerated in this large study population, and we will share the data at a future medical meeting. Overall, the OAKTREE results reflect the decreasing severity and duration of COVID-19 symptoms observed in standard-risk patients, driven by the evolution of variants and improved immunity to COVID-19 in our trial population. The time to symptom alleviation in untreated, standard-risk patients is now less than a week, as compared to almost two weeks at the peak of the pandemic. As a result, it was challenging for obeldesivir to show a benefit in the standard-risk population. We continue to assess whether obeldesivir could address other virologic infections given the broad antiviral activity that we have observed in preclinical data. Moving to another clinical update in Oncology, the Phase 3 ENHANCE-3 trial evaluating magrolimab in front-line unfit AML has been discontinued based on a futility analysis and a higher observed incidence of Grade 5 serious adverse events. Following the discontinuation of ENHANCE and ENHANCE-2 last year, we do not plan further development of magrolimab in hematologic cancers. Wrapping up on clinical updates, I want to thank all those who were involved with EVOKE-01, OAKTREE and ENHANCE-3. Every trial adds important advancements in our understanding of the treatment of these diseases and will inform our future development plans. We look forward to sharing more on that in due course. Transitioning to our HIV program on Slide 21, we expect the Phase 3 readout of PURPOSE-1 evaluating lenacapavir for HIV prevention later this year. Along with PURPOSE-2, expected in late 2024 or early 2025, PURPOSE-1 forms the basis of our potential regulatory filing. We continue to target our first approval for lenacapavir in prevention in late 2025, potentially making lenacapavir the first twice-yearly dosing regimen available for PrEP. Looking at our HIV program more broadly, you can see we will be sharing at least nine updates this year across our next generation daily, weekly, three-monthly, and twice-yearly programs, all based on lenacapavir, our novel, first-in-class long-acting capsid inhibitor. We are excited to have over 75 presentations at CROI this year across Gilead-led and supported studies. Among them, some notable updates from our treatment pipeline include, encouraging data from our Phase 2 ARTISTRY-1 trial evaluating our lenacapavir and bictegravir once-daily oral. We are exploring this combination as a potential additional option for virologically suppressed people living with HIV, Phase 1 data on GS-1720, our once-weekly oral integrase inhibitor, and Phase 2 data on lenacapavir plus islatravir, our once-weekly oral combination in development with Merck. In the second half of this year, we look forward to providing an update on the Phase 2 trial evaluating lenacapavir plus bNAbs as a twice-yearly regimen. Turning to Cell Therapy on Slide 22, you may have seen that FDA recently proposed safety label changes for all approved CD19 and BCMA CAR T-cell therapies, including Yescarta and Tecartus. There is no change to our confidence in the benefit-risk profile of Yescarta and Tecartus. Based on analysis of our Global Safety Database, with over 16,800 patients treated with Yescarta, there has been no causal link established between Yescarta and those reported to the FDA public safety dashboard. Additionally, no cases of T-cell malignancies have been reported with Tecartus. In the fourth quarter of last year, we presented 26 abstracts at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December, showing that Yescarta and Tecartus continue to generate some of the longest follow-up and most robust datasets for cell therapies with the potential to transform patient lives. Also at ASH, our partner Arcellx presented impressive, updated data from the Phase 1 trial evaluating anito-cel in 38 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. At a median follow-up of 26.5 months, median progression-free survival was not yet reached, despite 70% of patients having one or more high-risk prognosis factors. Given its potentially differentiated safety profile, with notably no delayed neurotoxicity to date, including parkinsonism, anito-cel has the potential to become the best-in- class BCMA CAR T. We look forward to sharing an update from the pivotal Phase 2 iMMagine-1 study and initiating an earlier-line multiple myeloma trial later this year. In terms of manufacturing, while Kite is already the clear leader, we\u2019re pleased to highlight that the FDA approved our updated process that reduces the turnaround time for Yescarta in the US from 16 days down to 14 days. This further extends our leadership in cell therapy and we continue to identify additional opportunities to reliably bring these much-needed therapies to more patients as quickly as possible. Beyond manufacturing, we have eight ongoing cell therapy trials, of which four are evaluating new indications and four are exploring earlier lines of therapy. As we formally wrap up 2023, on Slide 23, I would like to acknowledge the work of our clinical teams who executed on our ambitious and broad portfolio that extends far beyond the list shown, including, the advancement of eight new assets into the clinic, the delivery of 15 late-breaking oral presentations at major clinical congresses and the initiation of three new Phase 3 programs. For 2024, our targeted milestones laid out on Slide 24 include, an update on ASCENT-03 in first-line PD-L1 negative metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, an update on TROPiCS-04 assessing overall survival in second-line metastatic or locally-advanced bladder cancer, and an update on our Phase 3 PURPOSE-1 trial assessing lenacapavir in HIV prevention, as previously highlighted. We are also looking forward to the start of Phase 3 trials for Trodelvy in endometrial cancer, and the ARTISTRY trials evaluating lenacapavir and bictegravir oral combination for HIV treatment. Our commitment to develop innovative new therapeutic options is unchanged and we are confident that we will make progress on that commitment in 2024. And now, I hand the call over to Andy.\nAndrew Dickinson: Thank you Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on Slide 26, we closed the year with total product sales of $26.9 billion, at the top-end of our guidance range due to a strong contribution from Veklury. For the full-year, total product sales, excluding Veklury, grew 7%, driven by growth in both HIV and Oncology. HIV increased 6% year-over-year, driven by Biktarvy, which grew 14% from 2022 to $11.8 billion. And, Oncology grew to $2.9 billion for the full year, an increase of $792 million or 37% from 2022. Altogether, total product sales, excluding Veklury were $24.7 billion, modestly below the lower-end of our full-year guidance range largely due to quarterly pricing variability in HIV in the fourth quarter. Importantly, HIV volumes were in line with our expectations and we are confident in our full-year revenue growth expectations for HIV in 2024. Veklury revenue of $2.2 billion exceeded our guidance of approximately $1.9 billion, and reflected higher hospitalization rates in the latter part of 2023. Compared to 2022, full year Veklury revenue declined as expected, and represented a headwind of more than $1.7 billion to total product sales. This was largely offset by almost $1.7 billion in growth from our base business, resulting in roughly flat total product sales year-over-year. On Slide 27, our non-GAAP results were largely as expected, including gross margin and operating expenses, notably R&D which showed disciplined moderation as we progressed through 2023. Non-GAAP EPS was $6.72, and within our guidance range despite the incremental $0.10 cents of acquired IPR&D associated with the Arcellx and Compugen partnerships that we announced following our guidance revision in November 2023. A quick note that our GAAP results were impacted by some restructuring expenses, primarily related to our manufacturing strategy and our activities at Kite. As we discussed in the later part of 2023, we have been taking steps to evolve our business model and expense structure to set us up for a strong 2024. As a result, our GAAP results reflect approximately $500 million of associated expenses in 2023, or $0.40 per share, and contributed to GAAP EPS of $4.40 for the full year. Moving to our fourth quarter results starting on Slide 28. Total product sales, excluding Veklury, were $6.3 billion. Including Veklury, total product sales of $7.1 billion were down 4% from the same quarter in 2022. As expected, Veklury sales decreased year-over-year due to lower rates of COVID-19 related hospitalizations. On Slide 29, you can see that on a non-GAAP basis, product gross margin was 86%, down 66 basis points from the prior year. R&D expenses were $1.5 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Acquired IPR&D was $347 million, reflecting payments related to our collaborations with Arcellx, Assembly Biosciences, and Compugen and our XinThera acquisition. SG&A was $1.6 billion, down 21% year-over-year, primarily related to the 2022 charge for the termination of the Everest collaboration that did not repeat in 2023. Excluding this 2022 charge, non-GAAP SG&A was down 1%. Operating margin was 39%, up from 37% in the fourth quarter of 2022, and effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17%, flat compared to the prior year. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.72 in the fourth quarter, compared to $1.67 in the fourth quarter of 2022. I\u2019ll move now to Slide 30 and our guidance which assumes a generally stable macro environment including FX at current rates. For the full-year 2024, we expect total product sales in the range of $27.1 billion to $27.5 billion. We expect total product sales, excluding Veklury, in the range of $25.8 billion to $26.2 billion, representing growth of 4% to 6% for our base business year-over-year. Within total product sales, and as Johanna discussed, we expect HIV revenue to grow approximately 4%, and we expect Veklury sales of approximately $1.3 billion although, as always, we caution you that Veklury sales remain highly variable depending on hospitalization rates. We do not expect to update our Veklury guidance until our third quarter earnings call, absent a very clear trend in COVID-19 infections. Moving to the rest of the P&L, and on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product gross margin to range between 85% and 86%, modestly lower than the 86.1% reported in 2023 due to the growing contribution from our oncology portfolio. We expect R&D to grow by a low to mid-single digit percentage compared to 2023, highlighting the substantial moderation in expense growth as we approach a steadier state of active Phase 3 programs. We expect acquired IPR&D to be approximately $350 million. Consistent with our approach in 2023, we will highlight incremental acquired IPR&D expenses as we announce new transactions and update our guidance each quarter. And we expect SG&A to decline by a mid-single digit percentage compared to 2023. Excluding the $525 million legal settlement in 2023, we expect SG&A to grow in the low-to-mid single digit percentage range compared to SG&A of $5.5 billion in 2023, excluding this settlement. As a result, we expect our operating income for 2024 to be between $11.2 billion and $11.7 billion. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. And finally, we expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $6.85 and $7.25 for the full year, and GAAP diluted EPS to be between $5.15 and $5.55. As a reminder, for the first quarter of 2024, we expect HIV to decline sequentially in the 10-12% range from Q4 2023, similar to what we saw in the first quarter of 2023, and Cell Therapy to be flat to slightly up from Q4 of 2023. Moving to capital allocation on Slide 31, our priorities have not changed. In 2023, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders. This included $3.8 billion in dividend payments and $1 billion in share repurchases. Fourth quarter share repurchases were $150 million. For 2024, we announced today a 2.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.77 per share and we remain committed to growing our dividend over time, in-line with earnings growth. You can also expect to see continued investments in our business both internally and externally through select partnerships and business development transactions. Finally, we will continue to utilize share repurchases to offset equity dilution, as well as additional repurchases on an opportunistic basis. With that, I\u2019ll invite the Operator to begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Of course, Andrew. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nTyler Van Buren: Hey guys, good afternoon. Regarding the 2024 product sales guidance, I understand you guys are guiding to a near $900 million sales drop-off year over year for Veklury, but the guidance, ex- Veklury looks to be a 5% year-over-year growth at the midpoint versus 7% for this year. So what do you view as some of the levers to ex-Veklury product sales guidance in 2024 where we could see upside?\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Thanks, Tyler. Welcome. Let's have Andy start, please. Thanks.\nAndrew Dickinson: Hey, Tyler. It's Andy. Thanks for the question. You're absolutely right. Our product sales guidance for products excluding Veklury implies 4% to 6% growth year-over-year, again continuing the trend of strong growth that you've seen over the last two years. I'd also highlight that it implies a substantial moderation of our operating expense growth, which is an important piece of the puzzle that we spent a lot of time talking about. To your question specifically on product growth, the growth drivers for 2024 are the same as the growth drivers last year. You continue to see strong growth in our HIV business. As you see in the quarter, you really need to focus on the full year for the HIV to see the growth trend. And we saw another year of very strong growth across our HIV business for the full year in \u201823. We expect the same thing in \u201824. And you heard on the call that we're expecting at least 4% growth for the HIV business next year. And then of course, the Cell Therapy business and Trodelvy are expected to continue to grow as well. So those are the key growth drivers. We look forward to updating you throughout the year, but we're excited about the set up as we move into 2024.\nJacquie Ross: Victoria, may we have our next question?\nOperator: Thank you so much. Of course, Thank you so much for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nSalveen Richter: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On business development, you have noted the potential for a $5 billion to $6 billion deal in Oncology or [I&I] (ph). Where are you seeing the greatest opportunity to leverage your current clinical and commercial infrastructure? Thank you.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Great. Thanks, Salveen. This is Dan. Maybe I'll start and then ask others to add, but appreciate the question. I think just to reinforce our M&A strategy, I mean, nothing has changed from a business development perspective. And particularly, that's against the context of the background of nearly doubling our clinical trials underway over the past four years, multiple late stage results. As you know, we're expecting more than 20 results still this year and against the backdrop of no significant patent expirations in our business until early parts of the next decade. So I think we'll continue to be opportunistic about pursuing business development in the three areas that we are focused on, which is obviously Virology, Oncology, and Inflammation. We'll be driven by the science. We continue to articulate that building our late research, early development pipeline is probably one of our biggest focuses and we'll continue to look at later stage deals as they fit into our portfolio and our range. It might also be important to note that we are back to pre-immunomatics levels now relative to our leverage ratios. And so we're comfortable with our ability to put capital to work. But nothing has changed and we feel we have everything within Gilead right now to achieve our ambitions over the second half of this decade.\nJacquie Ross: Victoria, may we have our next question, please?\nOperator: Of course. The next question comes from a line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nLeon Wang: Hi, this is Leon. Hi, this is Leon Wang on for Carter. Thanks for taking my question. So at this point, what conviction do you have anito-cel will differentiate on neurotox or parkinsonism versus your competitors? And if the lack of neurotox data recapitulate later this year, would that be a de-risking in your view and how important would that be in the market? Thank you.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Thank you, Leon. So we've got Cindy Perettie here to handle that. Thanks.\nCindy Perettie: Thank you. Thank you for the question. I think with the anito-cel data, we expect to complete the enrollment of our IMAGINE-1 study this year, where we would have then 100 patients worth of data. And obviously, we're going to continue to look for safety signals, neurotox as you suggested but to date, we have not observed any. Your second part of that question was do we see that as a differentiator and I would definitely see that as a differentiator in the marketplace if we were to come forward with a differentiated safety profile. I think the other component to remind you of is we also believe it's possible to have a differentiated efficacy profile. And today, based on the D-domain and our transduction efficiency, we're able to use half the dose that we're seeing with our competitors, and that could play both with safety and efficacy. Thank you.\nJacquie Ross: Great. Victoria, we are ready for our next question, please?\nOperator: Of course. Our next question comes from the line of Terrence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nTerrence Flynn: Thanks so much for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could speak to your confidence level in Trodelvy in the front line, non-small cell lung trial setting here, given the EVOKE-01 data, and if you're considering any potential changes to that frontline trial as a result? Thank you.\nMerdad Parsey: Hi, Terrence, this is Merdad. I think when we have looked at the data so far, And we're looking forward to sharing it with everyone as quickly as we can, probably one of the most important things in that dataset that confirmed where we were before is that we have not seen a difference in response rates between squamous cell carcinoma and non-squamous cell carcinoma. I think that was a bit of an overhang in the fall. And as we had mentioned earlier, we had not seen that to date, and that has been bolstered by the results of EVOKE-01. So we do think that that increases our confidence that we don't need to think about -- look at that. Now there are other analyses we need to do to make sure that there are other predictors of response or not, and we'll be doing that and we'll be sharing that over time. But right now, our overall confidence in Trodelvy, broadly speaking, remains very high. We have three approvals and we have a broad development program against which we are executing really well. We continue to have additional trials that we'll read out this year in Phase 3, specifically the [TROPHY-U-04] (ph) study that we'll be looking at the bladder cancer confirmation study with hopefully an OS signal. That study could actually give us beyond confirmatory trial in the US. It allows us to open conversations with regulators outside the US. And then we have promised an update on ASCENT-03 in breast cancer, which we also think will broaden that. And then we now have a number of trials going on in a variety of indications, including ones we've mentioned in, for example, endometrial cancer. So overall, what we've seen EVOKE-01, and we're looking forward to sharing with you, really maintains our level of enthusiasm about Trodelvy\u2019s term potential from an efficacy and safety standpoint across the board, and we have no plans to change EVOKE-03 at this time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Look, it's very well understood for folks in the biopharma community that no one can truly understand the full safety profile of any new drug based on Phase 1 data. But this point has a lot of implications for your TAF litigation, obviously. So my question is, in a scenario where the Supreme Court takes up your petition, would that potentially be a venue where you could prove the level of evidence that's actually needed to make a decision on exception to duty and the type of decisions to make?\nDaniel O\u2019Day: All right. I think Andy is going to take this one.\nAndrew Dickinson: Hi, Umer. Yeah, thanks for the question. Yes, of course, I mean, in front of the Supreme Court, just like the appellate court, we'll be able to present the facts and our arguments as you'd expect. If you look at some of the briefing documents in the appellate court, I think they spell that out very clearly in terms of what happened over time with the development of TAF and what we knew at different points in time. And that would be available, as you'd expect, not only to the appellate court, but to the Supreme Court. And of course, those same facts would be presented at any trial if we ever get to that point. One other update on the TAF litigation, again, Umer, nothing's changed from our perspective. We continue to have a lot of confidence. The one update I can provide is that the -- one of the very first trial in the federal court has been dismissed as of yesterday, I believe. So it now looks like, and again, this is consistent, as you know, with thousands of other cases. I think it's now over 5,300 cases that have been dismissed by the courts, over 4,300 in the California state courts and over 1,000 in the federal courts before they get to trial. So the first bellwether trial in the federal courts, Umar, would now be in November instead of April. So we'll keep you up to date and thanks for your question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Brayer with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.\nOlivia Brayer: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for the question. What were some of the dynamics that happened with Yescarta this quarter? And how should we be thinking about growth for 2024 from your Cell Therapy franchise, just in light of the sequentially down quarter in 4Q? Thanks.\nCindy Perettie: Thanks a lot, Olivia, for the question. This is Cindy. We continue to be the leaders in Cell Therapy. And I think the piece that Johanna mentioned is that we are looking at how do we expand beyond the existing ATCs. So the dynamics that we observed this quarter were capacity constraints within the existing ATCs that we have. We saw a little bit of in-class and out-of-class competition. And in parallel, we have been continuing to work on expanding our ATCs. So today we have over 400 ATCs globally. We are moving out of urban centers and those academic centers into the community to meet patients where they are. As Andy suggested, that -- bringing up those ATCs in the community is going to be really important part of our future strategy, but it does take a little bit longer than bringing an academic center up. So we expect to be flat to slightly up in quarter one, and you'll start to see that return to growth in the second half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nGeoff Meacham: Great, thank you. We have another one on Cell Therapy but more on the profitability. This is a franchise that's almost $2 billion in sales. You guys have improved the turnaround time. You've reached scale. You've treated a ton of patients. What can you tell us about the progress that you've made to making this a profitable franchise? I'm just thinking not for the current products, but also looking out five years plus. Thank you.\nAndrew Dickinson: Hey, Geoff, it\u2019s Andy. Thanks for the question. It's a great question. You're absolutely right. The Cell Therapy business has made tremendous progress over the last five or six years and evidenced most recently by the faster turnaround time in manufacturing that we talked about on our prepared remarks, going from 16 days to 14 days. And again, it's just the beginning from our perspective of what we can continue to do with this business. So while we don't provide specific guidance, we have said when we announced the Kite transaction that we expected to be profitable, breakeven or profitable and accretive by the end of year four. We got there shortly after that. All of the metrics that we look at on the business have improved over time. We've continued to make significant progress on our manufacturing efficiency, manufacturing costs, despite the fact that we've opened three global manufacturing centers. And each time you do that, when you move to commercial manufacturing, it impacts your gross margin. So I'm really proud of what the team has done. And same thing on the operating costs. You see in the fourth quarter, we announced some restructuring charges, Geoff, that hit our GAAP results. Part of that was a restructuring at Kite. Cindy and her team looked at the structure and made changes to the structure that we think will continue to drive growth and efficiency in the business over the long run. So maybe the last thing I'd say is that when we look at the business, this is a business that we have line of sight to biologics margins and profitability. We're really growing the business, Geoff, as you know, for long-term sustainability and growth and less near-term profitability, but it's certainly exciting that the business is doing as well as it is.\nCindy Perettie: I think the only thing I would add to Andy's comment is beyond the three manufacturing facilities, we also have our own viral vector facility. So given the fact that viral vector has had some supply challenges, That's something that we are not suffering from. So we own these sort of end-to-end cost of goods for our products.\nJacquie Ross: Can we have our next question please, Victoria?\nOperator: Of course. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nMichael Yee: Hey, guys. Thank you for the question. We have a HIV question. There were some comments around the dynamics of the channel mix as it relates to HIV pricing. And I was wondering if you could just remind us about what the driver of the benefit was in \u201822 and \u201823 and how that changed as we go into \u201824 and why the difficulty comps? Is that a change in mix between commercial and Medicaid [indiscernible] just explain that that would help us understand what's going on there for 2024? Thank you.\nJohanna Mercier: Sure, Michael. Hi, it's Johanna. Let me take that one. So what you're referring to is actually we saw some pricing favorability in Q4 of \u201822 and the first half of 2023. That pricing favorability was namely driven by actually just the inflation being so high and therefore some of our rebates are actually based on that inflation rate. And so therefore there was actually upside during those quarters. We knew that that was not going to repeat itself. So we had kind of shared with you, I think, from Q3 on that this was going to normalize. And so that was kind of what happened in the first half of 2023. As we think about the second half of 2023, and mainly the fourth quarter, what we did see there is very strong demand, and that continued throughout the whole year, but we had some fluctuations, some quarterly variabilities, mainly due to channel mix and more government channels resulting in lower average realized price because of higher rebates. And so you really have to look at it on a full year basis. And so that's why it's so important to know that HIV performance on it will always have some quarterly variabilities. And we always need to look at the full year to really get the full picture of what's going on. HIV for the full year of 2023 grew 6% with nearly $1 billion in revenue growth driven by Biktarvy obviously growing at 14% and at 48% share with 3% share growth in that year outpacing all competitors. And so we're really proud of the demand driven results that we've seen in 2023. And as we think about 2024 and our predictions for \u201824, we believe that our expectations is going to be in line with HIV treatment, which is still about 2 to 3 points. Layer on top of that, the demand growth from Biktarvy and Descovy for PrEP, and that's why we're expecting about a 4% growth in HIV. So that gives you the full picture of what's going on and what happened in the past. So we don't expect that on a yearly basis, but on a quarterly basis we do expect that variability and I would expect that that will continue as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the question. Can you just talk about the TIGIT program and what drove the decision to step up your investments here? And maybe as part of that, can you elaborate a little bit more on the decision to de-emphasize the PD-L1 high population in favor of the [indiscernible]. So any color there would be appreciated. Thank you.\nAndrew Dickinson: Hey, Chris, it's Andy. Maybe I'll start on the TIGIT program and the revised agreement with Arcus that we announced last week, and then Merdad can answer the second part of your question. It's relatively simple. If you step back, you've heard us say this before, but I'd reiterate that we value the partnership that we have with Arcus and the programs that their team has developed. And the recent updates to your question to the partnership really allow both companies to more efficiently deploy our teams and capital. We also focused on streamlining decision-making and the additional capital allows us to expand the overall clinical study footprint. So there are a number of things that both companies accomplish through the amendment. It does reinforce our support and belief in their programs broadly, not just TIGIT. There's a lot to be excited about there that you'll see play out over the coming years.\nMerdad Parsey: And excuse me, this is Merdad. I think you're referring to the ARC-10 study. And as you may recall, we started that study together with Arcus back in 2021 outside the US with a chemo comparator arm. And at the time, there was really limited access to PD-1 -- PD-L1 inhibitors outside the US. And so, we subsequently updated that study march of last year to include PD-L1 inhibitors as the standard of care was evolving. It took us time to get this all going. And while that was happening, we had a number of competitors launch similar trials in the space with their TIGIT antibodies. So as a result of all that, the enrollment for the ARC-10 trial wasn't as robust as we had hoped for and as it had been. And STAR-121, which is the all-comer study, was recruiting very well. And so we decided to really prioritize our efforts for that all-comers population where we think we could be first or second in class. And it was really a prioritization to ensure that we could stay ahead and keep moving the molecules forward as quickly as possible.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nBrian Abrahams: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking my question. I realize this is pending KOL and regulatory discussions, but I was wondering if you could frame the potential next steps for the PD-L1 poor responders. Do you think this is a fileable population for Trodelvy in second-line lung, or might you also consider running another study in that population? And along those lines, I'm curious what you're expecting to see from the updated EVOKE-02 data this year and how that might shape your overall plans for Trodelvy in lung? Thanks.\nMerdad Parsey: Sure. This is Merdad again, Brian. So maybe I'll take the second part first. On EVOKE-02, as you can imagine, we showed last year ORR data and [Technical Difficulty]",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Merdad Parsey",
            "content": "Thank you, Johanna. We've had a busy start to 2024, and I'll begin by discussing the results of our EVOKE-01 study in second-line plus metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and our Phase 3 OAKTREE study of obeldesivir in standard-risk, non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19. While we are disappointed that these studies did not meet their primary endpoints, we are also encouraged by what we are learning from the data to inform our clinical programs and support our commitment to deliver innovative new therapies for patients. Let me cover each of these readouts in turn. First, on Slide 19, our Phase 3 study of Trodelvy in second-line plus metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, EVOKE-01, missed its primary endpoint of overall survival in this hard-to-treat setting. We plan to share the detailed data at the earliest opportunity. In the meantime, we'd like to highlight what we believe to be important set of observations from EVOKE-01 that give us continued confidence in Trodelvy as a pipeline-in-a product and its potential to benefit some patients with lung cancer: We saw a numerical improvement favoring Trodelvy, including in patients with both squamous and non-squamous histologies. This is encouraging for our ongoing Phase 3 EVOKE-03 first-line trial evaluating Trodelvy in PD-L1 high patients, in combination with pembrolizumab. Importantly, Trodelvy continues to demonstrate a potentially differentiated safety, efficacy, and tolerability profile, with an adverse event profile that is consistent with our label. Further, Trodelvy achieved more than three months of improvement in median overall survival in a pre-specified subgroup of patients non-responsive to their prior anti-PD-L1 therapy. This subgroup is defined as those who achieved stable disease or progressive disease as their best outcome to last prior I/O therapy, and represented more than 60% of the trial population. This analysis was not alpha-controlled for formal statistical testing, and we are continuing to analyze these data. We will discuss these data with regulators and KOLs to determine the best path forward. As a reminder, we required all patients to have received prior I/O therapy, regardless of driver mutation status, and responsiveness to prior I/O was a stratification factor. Additional analyses, including TROP2 expression, are ongoing and we will share these data as quickly as possible. Based on these observations and the data from the ongoing EVOKE-02 study, we remain confident in Trodelvy's potential in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. For now, given these findings, we currently do not plan changes to our Phase 3 EVOKE-03 study that is enrolling as expected. Moving to Slide 20, our novel twice-daily, oral antiviral, obeldesivir, did not demonstrate statistically significant symptom relief in standard-risk, non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in our Phase 3 OAKTREE trial. Obeldesivir was well-tolerated in this large study population, and we will share the data at a future medical meeting. Overall, the OAKTREE results reflect the decreasing severity and duration of COVID-19 symptoms observed in standard-risk patients, driven by the evolution of variants and improved immunity to COVID-19 in our trial population. The time to symptom alleviation in untreated, standard-risk patients is now less than a week, as compared to almost two weeks at the peak of the pandemic. As a result, it was challenging for obeldesivir to show a benefit in the standard-risk population. We continue to assess whether obeldesivir could address other virologic infections given the broad antiviral activity that we have observed in preclinical data. Moving to another clinical update in Oncology, the Phase 3 ENHANCE-3 trial evaluating magrolimab in front-line unfit AML has been discontinued based on a futility analysis and a higher observed incidence of Grade 5 serious adverse events. Following the discontinuation of ENHANCE and ENHANCE-2 last year, we do not plan further development of magrolimab in hematologic cancers. Wrapping up on clinical updates, I want to thank all those who were involved with EVOKE-01, OAKTREE and ENHANCE-3. Every trial adds important advancements in our understanding of the treatment of these diseases and will inform our future development plans. We look forward to sharing more on that in due course. Transitioning to our HIV program on Slide 21, we expect the Phase 3 readout of PURPOSE-1 evaluating lenacapavir for HIV prevention later this year. Along with PURPOSE-2, expected in late 2024 or early 2025, PURPOSE-1 forms the basis of our potential regulatory filing. We continue to target our first approval for lenacapavir in prevention in late 2025, potentially making lenacapavir the first twice-yearly dosing regimen available for PrEP. Looking at our HIV program more broadly, you can see we will be sharing at least nine updates this year across our next generation daily, weekly, three-monthly, and twice-yearly programs, all based on lenacapavir, our novel, first-in-class long-acting capsid inhibitor. We are excited to have over 75 presentations at CROI this year across Gilead-led and supported studies. Among them, some notable updates from our treatment pipeline include, encouraging data from our Phase 2 ARTISTRY-1 trial evaluating our lenacapavir and bictegravir once-daily oral. We are exploring this combination as a potential additional option for virologically suppressed people living with HIV, Phase 1 data on GS-1720, our once-weekly oral integrase inhibitor, and Phase 2 data on lenacapavir plus islatravir, our once-weekly oral combination in development with Merck. In the second half of this year, we look forward to providing an update on the Phase 2 trial evaluating lenacapavir plus bNAbs as a twice-yearly regimen. Turning to Cell Therapy on Slide 22, you may have seen that FDA recently proposed safety label changes for all approved CD19 and BCMA CAR T-cell therapies, including Yescarta and Tecartus. There is no change to our confidence in the benefit-risk profile of Yescarta and Tecartus. Based on analysis of our Global Safety Database, with over 16,800 patients treated with Yescarta, there has been no causal link established between Yescarta and those reported to the FDA public safety dashboard. Additionally, no cases of T-cell malignancies have been reported with Tecartus. In the fourth quarter of last year, we presented 26 abstracts at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December, showing that Yescarta and Tecartus continue to generate some of the longest follow-up and most robust datasets for cell therapies with the potential to transform patient lives. Also at ASH, our partner Arcellx presented impressive, updated data from the Phase 1 trial evaluating anito-cel in 38 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. At a median follow-up of 26.5 months, median progression-free survival was not yet reached, despite 70% of patients having one or more high-risk prognosis factors. Given its potentially differentiated safety profile, with notably no delayed neurotoxicity to date, including parkinsonism, anito-cel has the potential to become the best-in- class BCMA CAR T. We look forward to sharing an update from the pivotal Phase 2 iMMagine-1 study and initiating an earlier-line multiple myeloma trial later this year. In terms of manufacturing, while Kite is already the clear leader, we're pleased to highlight that the FDA approved our updated process that reduces the turnaround time for Yescarta in the US from 16 days down to 14 days. This further extends our leadership in cell therapy and we continue to identify additional opportunities to reliably bring these much-needed therapies to more patients as quickly as possible. Beyond manufacturing, we have eight ongoing cell therapy trials, of which four are evaluating new indications and four are exploring earlier lines of therapy. As we formally wrap up 2023, on Slide 23, I would like to acknowledge the work of our clinical teams who executed on our ambitious and broad portfolio that extends far beyond the list shown, including, the advancement of eight new assets into the clinic, the delivery of 15 late-breaking oral presentations at major clinical congresses and the initiation of three new Phase 3 programs. For 2024, our targeted milestones laid out on Slide 24 include, an update on ASCENT-03 in first-line PD-L1 negative metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, an update on TROPiCS-04 assessing overall survival in second-line metastatic or locally-advanced bladder cancer, and an update on our Phase 3 PURPOSE-1 trial assessing lenacapavir in HIV prevention, as previously highlighted. We are also looking forward to the start of Phase 3 trials for Trodelvy in endometrial cancer, and the ARTISTRY trials evaluating lenacapavir and bictegravir oral combination for HIV treatment. Our commitment to develop innovative new therapeutic options is unchanged and we are confident that we will make progress on that commitment in 2024. And now, I hand the call over to Andy. Hi, Terrence, this is Merdad. I think when we have looked at the data so far, And we're looking forward to sharing it with everyone as quickly as we can, probably one of the most important things in that dataset that confirmed where we were before is that we have not seen a difference in response rates between squamous cell carcinoma and non-squamous cell carcinoma. I think that was a bit of an overhang in the fall. And as we had mentioned earlier, we had not seen that to date, and that has been bolstered by the results of EVOKE-01. So we do think that that increases our confidence that we don't need to think about -- look at that. Now there are other analyses we need to do to make sure that there are other predictors of response or not, and we'll be doing that and we'll be sharing that over time. But right now, our overall confidence in Trodelvy, broadly speaking, remains very high. We have three approvals and we have a broad development program against which we are executing really well. We continue to have additional trials that we'll read out this year in Phase 3, specifically the [TROPHY-U-04] (ph) study that we'll be looking at the bladder cancer confirmation study with hopefully an OS signal. That study could actually give us beyond confirmatory trial in the US. It allows us to open conversations with regulators outside the US. And then we have promised an update on ASCENT-03 in breast cancer, which we also think will broaden that. And then we now have a number of trials going on in a variety of indications, including ones we've mentioned in, for example, endometrial cancer. So overall, what we've seen EVOKE-01, and we're looking forward to sharing with you, really maintains our level of enthusiasm about Trodelvy's term potential from an efficacy and safety standpoint across the board, and we have no plans to change EVOKE-03 at this time. And excuse me, this is Merdad. I think you're referring to the ARC-10 study. And as you may recall, we started that study together with Arcus back in 2021 outside the US with a chemo comparator arm. And at the time, there was really limited access to PD-1 -- PD-L1 inhibitors outside the US. And so, we subsequently updated that study march of last year to include PD-L1 inhibitors as the standard of care was evolving. It took us time to get this all going. And while that was happening, we had a number of competitors launch similar trials in the space with their TIGIT antibodies. So as a result of all that, the enrollment for the ARC-10 trial wasn't as robust as we had hoped for and as it had been. And STAR-121, which is the all-comer study, was recruiting very well. And so we decided to really prioritize our efforts for that all-comers population where we think we could be first or second in class. And it was really a prioritization to ensure that we could stay ahead and keep moving the molecules forward as quickly as possible. Sure. This is Merdad again, Brian. So maybe I'll take the second part first. On EVOKE-02, as you can imagine, we showed last year ORR data and [Technical Difficulty]"

            "name": "Daniel O'Day",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. The team and I are pleased you could join us today as we share the details of our full year and fourth quarter performance and the latest on our clinical portfolio. Starting with our full year performance, 2023 was a strong year for Gilead, with 7% growth in product sales, excluding Veklury, driven by HIV and Oncology. HIV grew by almost $1 billion, with Biktarvy sales growing 14% to almost $12 billion and increasing its market share in the US to 48%. Oncology grew 37% to almost $3 billion, an increase of almost $800 million in just one year. This growth was split evenly between our Kite cell therapies and Trodelvy. Veklury for COVID-19 contributed $2.2 billion in 2023, ahead of our expectations, but down year-over-year, as expected, given the evolution of the pandemic. In the last two years combined, Gilead's base business has grown approximately $3.3 billion, or more than 7% annually, largely offsetting the decline in Veklury revenues over the same period. The consistent growth in our base business gives us a strong foundation as we continue into 2024 and look to deliver on our broad clinical portfolio. This is a catalyst-rich phase for Gilead with more than 20 updates this year and many more to come beyond 2024. Starting with Oncology, we expect at least 12 further updates by the end of 2024. These include Phase 3 updates for Trodelvy in bladder and triple-negative breast cancer, and results from the pivotal Phase 2 iMMagine-1 study for anito-cel in multiple myeloma, for which we saw encouraging Phase 1 data at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December. Also in Cell Therapy, we are very pleased to have shortened our manufacturing time for Yescarta by another two days in the US, reinforcing our industry-leading median turnaround time, which is now at an anticipated 14 days. As you know, we did not reach the primary endpoint for EVOKE-01, our Phase 3 trial for second-line plus metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Merdad will go into detail on this later, but while we did not see the outcome we hoped for, the data are encouraging on a number of levels, namely, a numerical improvement in overall survival favoring Trodelvy, including in both squamous and non-squamous tumors, a safety profile consistent with our product label that could continue to differentiate Trodelvy versus other TROP2 ADCs, and while not statistically powered, a potential benefit for a pre-specified sub-population that saw more than three months' median overall improvement. The team is evaluating next steps given the data and the significant unmet need and we look forward to discussing the data with regulators. Based on the totality of the results in both EVOKE-02 and EVOKE-01, we are confident in Trodelvy's potential in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, including in earlier lines of therapy. In Virology, we are looking forward to a very important year for our HIV portfolio. Among the multiple updates we are expecting are the Phase 3 data for lenacapavir in HIV prevention and at least eight updates from our HIV treatment program. These are milestones that could bring us closer to our goal of helping to end the HIV epidemic, building on Gilead's decades of leadership in HIV. In COVID-19, today we are announcing that our Phase 3 trial, OAKTREE, evaluating obeldesivir did not meet its primary endpoint. We conducted this study to explore whether obeldesivir could address the public health need that existed with COVID-19 for standard-risk patients. Again, Merdad will share details later, but essentially, because of the way things have evolved, the standard-risk population is now better able to fight COVID-19 without antiviral therapy. This made it more difficult for obeldesivir to show a benefit compared to the placebo. We know that the world needs to be equipped for other viruses and the broad antiviral activity of obeldesivir shown preclinically means it has potential for other viral infections. The updates we are expecting in 2024 have the potential to unlock multiple opportunities across Virology and Oncology. With a broad portfolio where the risk is balanced, we look forward to following the science and continuing to make a positive impact for patients and communities. Gilead has set an ambitious goal of delivering at least 10 transformative therapies by 2030, and we are driving confidently to that goal. Before I hand over to the team for their updates, I'll move to Slide 6 and recap that we executed well in 2023 and achieved all the remaining targeted goals that we expected to in the fourth quarter. We'll share our 2024 milestones later in the presentation, but it's clear that it's going to be a very busy year for Gilead. I'd like to thank the teams for their work in bringing us to this important catalyst-rich phase for the company, and for the strong commercial performance that gives us a firm foundation on which to build. With that I will hand it over to Johanna. Thanks, Tyler. Welcome. Let's have Andy start, please. Thanks. Great. Thanks, Salveen. This is Dan. Maybe I'll start and then ask others to add, but appreciate the question. I think just to reinforce our M&A strategy, I mean, nothing has changed from a business development perspective. And particularly, that's against the context of the background of nearly doubling our clinical trials underway over the past four years, multiple late stage results. As you know, we're expecting more than 20 results still this year and against the backdrop of no significant patent expirations in our business until early parts of the next decade. So I think we'll continue to be opportunistic about pursuing business development in the three areas that we are focused on, which is obviously Virology, Oncology, and Inflammation. We'll be driven by the science. We continue to articulate that building our late research, early development pipeline is probably one of our biggest focuses and we'll continue to look at later stage deals as they fit into our portfolio and our range. It might also be important to note that we are back to pre-immunomatics levels now relative to our leverage ratios. And so we're comfortable with our ability to put capital to work. But nothing has changed and we feel we have everything within Gilead right now to achieve our ambitions over the second half of this decade. Thank you, Leon. So we've got Cindy Perettie here to handle that. Thanks. All right. I think Andy is going to take this one."

            "name": "Andrew Dickinson",
            "content": "Thank you Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on Slide 26, we closed the year with total product sales of $26.9 billion, at the top-end of our guidance range due to a strong contribution from Veklury. For the full-year, total product sales, excluding Veklury, grew 7%, driven by growth in both HIV and Oncology. HIV increased 6% year-over-year, driven by Biktarvy, which grew 14% from 2022 to $11.8 billion. And, Oncology grew to $2.9 billion for the full year, an increase of $792 million or 37% from 2022. Altogether, total product sales, excluding Veklury were $24.7 billion, modestly below the lower-end of our full-year guidance range largely due to quarterly pricing variability in HIV in the fourth quarter. Importantly, HIV volumes were in line with our expectations and we are confident in our full-year revenue growth expectations for HIV in 2024. Veklury revenue of $2.2 billion exceeded our guidance of approximately $1.9 billion, and reflected higher hospitalization rates in the latter part of 2023. Compared to 2022, full year Veklury revenue declined as expected, and represented a headwind of more than $1.7 billion to total product sales. This was largely offset by almost $1.7 billion in growth from our base business, resulting in roughly flat total product sales year-over-year. On Slide 27, our non-GAAP results were largely as expected, including gross margin and operating expenses, notably R&D which showed disciplined moderation as we progressed through 2023. Non-GAAP EPS was $6.72, and within our guidance range despite the incremental $0.10 cents of acquired IPR&D associated with the Arcellx and Compugen partnerships that we announced following our guidance revision in November 2023. A quick note that our GAAP results were impacted by some restructuring expenses, primarily related to our manufacturing strategy and our activities at Kite. As we discussed in the later part of 2023, we have been taking steps to evolve our business model and expense structure to set us up for a strong 2024. As a result, our GAAP results reflect approximately $500 million of associated expenses in 2023, or $0.40 per share, and contributed to GAAP EPS of $4.40 for the full year. Moving to our fourth quarter results starting on Slide 28. Total product sales, excluding Veklury, were $6.3 billion. Including Veklury, total product sales of $7.1 billion were down 4% from the same quarter in 2022. As expected, Veklury sales decreased year-over-year due to lower rates of COVID-19 related hospitalizations. On Slide 29, you can see that on a non-GAAP basis, product gross margin was 86%, down 66 basis points from the prior year. R&D expenses were $1.5 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Acquired IPR&D was $347 million, reflecting payments related to our collaborations with Arcellx, Assembly Biosciences, and Compugen and our XinThera acquisition. SG&A was $1.6 billion, down 21% year-over-year, primarily related to the 2022 charge for the termination of the Everest collaboration that did not repeat in 2023. Excluding this 2022 charge, non-GAAP SG&A was down 1%. Operating margin was 39%, up from 37% in the fourth quarter of 2022, and effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17%, flat compared to the prior year. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.72 in the fourth quarter, compared to $1.67 in the fourth quarter of 2022. I'll move now to Slide 30 and our guidance which assumes a generally stable macro environment including FX at current rates. For the full-year 2024, we expect total product sales in the range of $27.1 billion to $27.5 billion. We expect total product sales, excluding Veklury, in the range of $25.8 billion to $26.2 billion, representing growth of 4% to 6% for our base business year-over-year. Within total product sales, and as Johanna discussed, we expect HIV revenue to grow approximately 4%, and we expect Veklury sales of approximately $1.3 billion although, as always, we caution you that Veklury sales remain highly variable depending on hospitalization rates. We do not expect to update our Veklury guidance until our third quarter earnings call, absent a very clear trend in COVID-19 infections. Moving to the rest of the P&L, and on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product gross margin to range between 85% and 86%, modestly lower than the 86.1% reported in 2023 due to the growing contribution from our oncology portfolio. We expect R&D to grow by a low to mid-single digit percentage compared to 2023, highlighting the substantial moderation in expense growth as we approach a steadier state of active Phase 3 programs. We expect acquired IPR&D to be approximately $350 million. Consistent with our approach in 2023, we will highlight incremental acquired IPR&D expenses as we announce new transactions and update our guidance each quarter. And we expect SG&A to decline by a mid-single digit percentage compared to 2023. Excluding the $525 million legal settlement in 2023, we expect SG&A to grow in the low-to-mid single digit percentage range compared to SG&A of $5.5 billion in 2023, excluding this settlement. As a result, we expect our operating income for 2024 to be between $11.2 billion and $11.7 billion. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. And finally, we expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $6.85 and $7.25 for the full year, and GAAP diluted EPS to be between $5.15 and $5.55. As a reminder, for the first quarter of 2024, we expect HIV to decline sequentially in the 10-12% range from Q4 2023, similar to what we saw in the first quarter of 2023, and Cell Therapy to be flat to slightly up from Q4 of 2023. Moving to capital allocation on Slide 31, our priorities have not changed. In 2023, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders. This included $3.8 billion in dividend payments and $1 billion in share repurchases. Fourth quarter share repurchases were $150 million. For 2024, we announced today a 2.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.77 per share and we remain committed to growing our dividend over time, in-line with earnings growth. You can also expect to see continued investments in our business both internally and externally through select partnerships and business development transactions. Finally, we will continue to utilize share repurchases to offset equity dilution, as well as additional repurchases on an opportunistic basis. With that, I'll invite the Operator to begin the Q&A. Hey, Tyler. It's Andy. Thanks for the question. You're absolutely right. Our product sales guidance for products excluding Veklury implies 4% to 6% growth year-over-year, again continuing the trend of strong growth that you've seen over the last two years. I'd also highlight that it implies a substantial moderation of our operating expense growth, which is an important piece of the puzzle that we spent a lot of time talking about. To your question specifically on product growth, the growth drivers for 2024 are the same as the growth drivers last year. You continue to see strong growth in our HIV business. As you see in the quarter, you really need to focus on the full year for the HIV to see the growth trend. And we saw another year of very strong growth across our HIV business for the full year in \u201823. We expect the same thing in \u201824. And you heard on the call that we're expecting at least 4% growth for the HIV business next year. And then of course, the Cell Therapy business and Trodelvy are expected to continue to grow as well. So those are the key growth drivers. We look forward to updating you throughout the year, but we're excited about the set up as we move into 2024. Hi, Umer. Yeah, thanks for the question. Yes, of course, I mean, in front of the Supreme Court, just like the appellate court, we'll be able to present the facts and our arguments as you'd expect. If you look at some of the briefing documents in the appellate court, I think they spell that out very clearly in terms of what happened over time with the development of TAF and what we knew at different points in time. And that would be available, as you'd expect, not only to the appellate court, but to the Supreme Court. And of course, those same facts would be presented at any trial if we ever get to that point. One other update on the TAF litigation, again, Umer, nothing's changed from our perspective. We continue to have a lot of confidence. The one update I can provide is that the -- one of the very first trial in the federal court has been dismissed as of yesterday, I believe. So it now looks like, and again, this is consistent, as you know, with thousands of other cases. I think it's now over 5,300 cases that have been dismissed by the courts, over 4,300 in the California state courts and over 1,000 in the federal courts before they get to trial. So the first bellwether trial in the federal courts, Umar, would now be in November instead of April. So we'll keep you up to date and thanks for your question. Hey, Geoff, it's Andy. Thanks for the question. It's a great question. You're absolutely right. The Cell Therapy business has made tremendous progress over the last five or six years and evidenced most recently by the faster turnaround time in manufacturing that we talked about on our prepared remarks, going from 16 days to 14 days. And again, it's just the beginning from our perspective of what we can continue to do with this business. So while we don't provide specific guidance, we have said when we announced the Kite transaction that we expected to be profitable, breakeven or profitable and accretive by the end of year four. We got there shortly after that. All of the metrics that we look at on the business have improved over time. We've continued to make significant progress on our manufacturing efficiency, manufacturing costs, despite the fact that we've opened three global manufacturing centers. And each time you do that, when you move to commercial manufacturing, it impacts your gross margin. So I'm really proud of what the team has done. And same thing on the operating costs. You see in the fourth quarter, we announced some restructuring charges, Geoff, that hit our GAAP results. Part of that was a restructuring at Kite. Cindy and her team looked at the structure and made changes to the structure that we think will continue to drive growth and efficiency in the business over the long run. So maybe the last thing I'd say is that when we look at the business, this is a business that we have line of sight to biologics margins and profitability. We're really growing the business, Geoff, as you know, for long-term sustainability and growth and less near-term profitability, but it's certainly exciting that the business is doing as well as it is. Hey, Chris, it's Andy. Maybe I'll start on the TIGIT program and the revised agreement with Arcus that we announced last week, and then Merdad can answer the second part of your question. It's relatively simple. If you step back, you've heard us say this before, but I'd reiterate that we value the partnership that we have with Arcus and the programs that their team has developed. And the recent updates to your question to the partnership really allow both companies to more efficiently deploy our teams and capital. We also focused on streamlining decision-making and the additional capital allows us to expand the overall clinical study footprint. So there are a number of things that both companies accomplish through the amendment. It does reinforce our support and belief in their programs broadly, not just TIGIT. There's a lot to be excited about there that you'll see play out over the coming years."

            "name": "Cindy Perettie",
            "content": "Thank you. Thank you for the question. I think with the anito-cel data, we expect to complete the enrollment of our IMAGINE-1 study this year, where we would have then 100 patients worth of data. And obviously, we're going to continue to look for safety signals, neurotox as you suggested but to date, we have not observed any. Your second part of that question was do we see that as a differentiator and I would definitely see that as a differentiator in the marketplace if we were to come forward with a differentiated safety profile. I think the other component to remind you of is we also believe it's possible to have a differentiated efficacy profile. And today, based on the D-domain and our transduction efficiency, we're able to use half the dose that we're seeing with our competitors, and that could play both with safety and efficacy. Thank you. Thanks a lot, Olivia, for the question. This is Cindy. We continue to be the leaders in Cell Therapy. And I think the piece that Johanna mentioned is that we are looking at how do we expand beyond the existing ATCs. So the dynamics that we observed this quarter were capacity constraints within the existing ATCs that we have. We saw a little bit of in-class and out-of-class competition. And in parallel, we have been continuing to work on expanding our ATCs. So today we have over 400 ATCs globally. We are moving out of urban centers and those academic centers into the community to meet patients where they are. As Andy suggested, that -- bringing up those ATCs in the community is going to be really important part of our future strategy, but it does take a little bit longer than bringing an academic center up. So we expect to be flat to slightly up in quarter one, and you'll start to see that return to growth in the second half of the year. I think the only thing I would add to Andy's comment is beyond the three manufacturing facilities, we also have our own viral vector facility. So given the fact that viral vector has had some supply challenges, That's something that we are not suffering from. So we own these sort of end-to-end cost of goods for our products."

            "name": "Johanna Mercier",
            "content": "Thanks Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Beginning on Slide 8, total product sales for the full year were at the high-end of our guidance range at $26.9 billion, reflecting solid base business growth, with total product sales, excluding Veklury, up 7% year-over-year to $24.7 billion. This was almost entirely offset by the expected decline in Veklury sales. For the full-year, Veklury sales were $2.2 billion, reflecting the uptick in hospitalizations at the end of 2023, though still below levels seen in 2022. Turning to the fourth quarter on Slide 9, total product sales were $7.1 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Our base business sales were roughly flat year-over-year at $6.3 billion, primarily driven by higher Oncology sales, offset by lower HIV sales due to changes in channel mix that resulted in lower average realized price, in addition to the expected decline of our portfolio of non-promoted products. Moving to Slide 10, our HIV business delivered very strong results for the full-year, up 6% year-over-year to $18.2 billion and contributing almost $1 billion in base business growth, primarily driven by demand, as well as higher average realized price due to channel mix and inventory dynamics. More specifically, almost half of the full-year HIV growth was driven by higher demand, most notably by Biktarvy which delivered solid double-digit year-over-year growth of 14%, with annualized revenues now more than $12 billion. Already the clear market leader, Biktarvy continues to demonstrate impressive share gains, growing almost 3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2023, to approximately 48% share in the US. This growth once again outpaced all other branded regimens for HIV treatment, and represented the 22nd quarter of consecutive year-over-year share gains. For the fourth quarter, as highlighted on Slide 11, HIV sales of $4.7 billion reflected strong demand in line with our expectations. On a year-over-year basis, this was offset by lower average realized price due to channel mix that was notably favorable in the fourth quarter of 2022, and resulted in a decline of 2%. Sequentially, sales were up 1%, similarly driven by strong demand as well as favorable inventory dynamics, partially offset by lower average realized price due to channel mix. As we have noted previously, the pricing tailwinds we saw in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023 are not expected to repeat, and will make year-over-year comparisons more challenging in the immediate term, as we saw in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, quarterly HIV growth is, in general, significantly more variable and less indicative of overall trends than the full year, particularly as certain quarterly pricing and inventory dynamics tend to normalize over the course of the year. Factors include, first, gross-to-net adjustments which can be difficult to forecast due to the lag between product sales and claim payments that frequently occur in different quarters. Second, the timing of bulk government purchases which contribute to overall demand but can have a significant, negative impact on pricing in the quarter in which they occur. For example, certain discounted government segments are unpredictable in terms of bulk order timing, and this impacts overall average realized price. And then finally, the inventory build by subchannel wholesalers and customers that typically occurs towards the end of the year. Historically, this happens in the fourth quarter. In 2023, we saw the build start in the third quarter and continue, albeit to a lesser extent relative to prior years, into the fourth quarter. Overall, despite these quarterly variables, we remain confident that overall demand trends are strong and unchanged. With our HIV treatment market share above 70% in US and above 40% in PrEP, Gilead remains well-positioned to continue delivering demand-driven growth. For 2024, we expect HIV sales to grow approximately 4%, reflecting, annual treatment demand growth of 2% to 3%, Biktarvy market share gains and continued double-digit growth in demand for HIV prevention. In terms of quarterly HIV revenue, keep in mind that the first quarter is always impacted by the reset of patient copays and deductibles. Additionally, we've historically seen inventory build-up in the fourth quarter that has led to notable draw-downs by wholesalers in the first quarter. In the first quarter of 2023, this contributed to HIV sales declining 12% sequentially, and we expect a similar decline in the 10% to 12% range for the first quarter of 2024. The continued strong performance of both Biktarvy and Descovy for PrEP are shown on Slide 12. Overall, Gilead's leadership in HIV is unmatched, with a solid commercial portfolio and robust pipeline of potentially best-in-class regimens to serve the daily oral, long-acting oral, and long-acting injectable markets. And I can share that we are off to a strong start in terms of HIV demand, which gives us confidence in our full year expectations for 2024. Moving to Liver Disease portfolio on Slide 13. Sales of $2.8 billion for the full year highlight the consistently strong and stable contribution from our Liver Disease portfolio. In the fourth quarter, sales were $691 million, flat year-over-year and down 2% sequentially, primarily driven by unfavorable pricing dynamics, offset by higher HCV market share and our efforts to increase linkage to care, in addition to growing HDV demand in new and existing European geographies. In HCV, we continue to reinforce Gilead's leadership with market share of over 60% in the US and over 50% in Europe. While we continue to expect the rate of HCV new starts to trend downwards over time, given the curative nature of our medicines, demand growth in both HDV and HBV is largely offsetting that headwind. Onto Slide 14. Veklury sales continue to be highly variable with the fourth quarter down 28% year-over- year, though up 13% sequentially due to higher COVID-related hospitalizations in the fourth quarter. For the full-year, Veklury sales of $2.2 billion exceeded the expectations we set out at the beginning of 2023. Turning to Slide 15, our Oncology business has achieved an annualized run-rate that now exceeds $3 billion with strong fourth quarter sales of $765 million, up 24% year-over-year. In just three years, Trodelvy revenue has grown to more than $1 billion, and we continue to see strong growth across our approved indications. And in Cell Therapy, sales approached $2 billion in 2023 and Kite remains firmly established as the leading provider of CAR T-cell therapies globally. Looking more closely at Trodelvy on Slide 16, sales for the full year were $1.1 billion, up 56% year-over-year. For the fourth quarter, sales were $299 million, up 53% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. With over 30,000 patients treated to date, Trodelvy's solid demand trends continue to reinforce its robust clinical profile as the only TROP2-directed antibody-drug conjugate approved and available in multiple tumor types. Awareness and utilization continue to increase, driving notable share gains. In second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, approximately one-third of patients are receiving Trodelvy, reinforcing its position as the leading regimen across the US and other major markets. In pre-treated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, we're encouraged to see share growth overall, driven by increasing adoption in the IHC0 setting as well as continued use in HER2-low. Additionally, we look forward to potentially making Trodelvy more broadly available in metastatic bladder cancer. Data from the confirmatory Phase 3 TROPiCS-04 study in the first half of the year could enable global filings and subsequent launches, as well as potentially drive adoption in the US, altogether expanding Trodelvy's potential reach to nearly 25,000 second-line plus patients with metastatic bladder cancer. Turning to Slide 17, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, Cell Therapy sales of $1.9 billion in 2023 grew 28% from 2022, driven by impressive growth, particularly outside the US as we expanded our network of authorized treatment centers, and secured reimbursement following recent approvals. In the fourth quarter, Cell Therapy product sales were $466 million, up 11% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially, with strong growth in both Yescarta and Tecartus in Europe and other international markets, offset in part by near-term headwinds for Yescarta in the US, from both in-class and out-of-class competition. As previously discussed, CAR T class share of eligible second-line plus large B-cell lymphoma patients remains at roughly 15% in the US as growth continues to be slower-than-anticipated despite the compelling clinical data that suggests these therapies are potentially transformative for many patients. In Europe and other markets, CAR T class share in this same second-line plus setting continues to be stronger, at approximately 30%. Following a restructuring in November, the Kite team has been focused on extending the reach of cell therapies from primarily academic medical centers to community practices, especially in the US. In late 2023, we established partnerships with leading community networks, which include over 1,750 physicians nationally. We are certifying affiliated practices to become authorized treatment centers to provide Kite cell therapies. So far, we've made notable headway across centers in the southeast United States, for example, that operate over 40 locations to serve cancer patients. We expect to see the initial impact of these initiatives in mid-2024. In the meantime, we expect our Cell Therapy business to be flat to slightly up in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Importantly, alongside our 96% reliability rate, we're also thrilled to share that we have shortened our manufacturing time in the US by two days for Yescarta, bringing our anticipated median turnaround time to 14 days. This further extends our industry leadership in terms of manufacturing, and the Kite team continues to innovate in this critical element of the cell therapy business. We look forward to inviting you to visit one of our manufacturing facilities later this quarter during an analyst and investor event. In conclusion, I would like to thank our teams for a strong 2023 performance and setting up such great momentum for continued growth in 2024. The team is excited to continue to make our medicines accessible to all those who can benefit from them. With that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad. Sure, Michael. Hi, it's Johanna. Let me take that one. So what you're referring to is actually we saw some pricing favorability in Q4 of \u201822 and the first half of 2023. That pricing favorability was namely driven by actually just the inflation being so high and therefore some of our rebates are actually based on that inflation rate. And so therefore there was actually upside during those quarters. We knew that that was not going to repeat itself. So we had kind of shared with you, I think, from Q3 on that this was going to normalize. And so that was kind of what happened in the first half of 2023. As we think about the second half of 2023, and mainly the fourth quarter, what we did see there is very strong demand, and that continued throughout the whole year, but we had some fluctuations, some quarterly variabilities, mainly due to channel mix and more government channels resulting in lower average realized price because of higher rebates. And so you really have to look at it on a full year basis. And so that's why it's so important to know that HIV performance on it will always have some quarterly variabilities. And we always need to look at the full year to really get the full picture of what's going on. HIV for the full year of 2023 grew 6% with nearly $1 billion in revenue growth driven by Biktarvy obviously growing at 14% and at 48% share with 3% share growth in that year outpacing all competitors. And so we're really proud of the demand driven results that we've seen in 2023. And as we think about 2024 and our predictions for \u201824, we believe that our expectations is going to be in line with HIV treatment, which is still about 2 to 3 points. Layer on top of that, the demand growth from Biktarvy and Descovy for PrEP, and that's why we're expecting about a 4% growth in HIV. So that gives you the full picture of what's going on and what happened in the past. So we don't expect that on a yearly basis, but on a quarterly basis we do expect that variability and I would expect that that will continue as we move forward."

With that I'll turn the call over to Dan.\nDaniel O'Day: Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to share that Gilead teams have delivered another strong quarter that rounds out two years of continuous growth for our base business. Our track record of commercial execution continued in the third quarter with our base business up 5% compared to the third quarter of 2022 and up 10% year-over-year for the first nine months of 2023. In the third quarter, our growth was driven by our leading therapies across virology and oncology. Biktarvy had another very strong quarter, up 12% from the same quarter in 2022 and contributing to 9% growth overall in HIV in the first nine months of 2023. Oncology is also driving growth and was up 33% in the third quarter compared to last year. Revenue is now annualizing at more than $3 billion with growing adoption of Trodelvy, the only approved Trop-2 directed ADC and our industry leading cell therapies.\nHER2-: Our Phase 2 EVOKE-02 trial showed a strong objective response rate in the PD-L1 high cohort which supports proof of concept for our ongoing Phase 3 EVOKE-03 trial. Important new data at ESMO for Trodelvy's Phase 2 TROPiCS-03 basket trial in our small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cohorts. All of these milestones reinforced our conviction in Trodelvy as our cornerstone oncology asset with pan tumor potential.\nEDGE:\nGastric trial:\nCART:\nddBCMA:\nArcellx:\nGS-1720: In HIV prevention, we completed enrollment ahead of schedule in our Phase 3 PURPOSE-1 trial investigating once every six months lenacapavir subcutaneous injection and announced plans to initiate the Phase 2 PURPOSE-5 trial in 2024 to support access in Europe.\nARTISTRY: In HIV prevention, we completed enrollment ahead of schedule in our Phase 3 PURPOSE-1 trial investigating once every six months lenacapavir subcutaneous injection and announced plans to initiate the Phase 2 PURPOSE-5 trial in 2024 to support access in Europe.\n1: In HIV prevention, we completed enrollment ahead of schedule in our Phase 3 PURPOSE-1 trial investigating once every six months lenacapavir subcutaneous injection and announced plans to initiate the Phase 2 PURPOSE-5 trial in 2024 to support access in Europe.\nOAKTREE: Veklury remains an important therapeutic options for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We recently received approvals from both the FDA and the European Commission to extend use of Veklury in patients with mild- to-severe hepatic impairment. Looking at our pipeline overall, our aggregate progress in 2023 is such that we have already completed most of the milestone events as shown on Slide 6. Our clinical pipeline now includes 27 programs in Phase 2 and 19 in Phase 3. We are looking forward to a busy period of updates from many of these studies in 2024, including those evaluating lenacapavir, Trodelvy and obeldesivir. In summary, it's been another strong quarter of commercial and clinical execution, resulting in important progress for Gilead and the people and communities we aim to serve. With that, I'll hand the call over to Johanna to cover our commercial results. Johanna?\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to share the details of another strong quarter for Gilead and would like to thank the teams that have delivered 10% growth in our base business in the first nine months of 2023. Our third quarter results represent the eight consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in our base business, illustrated strong commercial execution and revenue growth as our virology and oncology products impact more patient lives. In the third quarter of 2023, total product sales excluding Veklury were up 5% to $6.4 billion as shown on Slide 8, with notable growth in our oncology and HIV businesses partially offset our lower HCV sales. Total product sales including Veklury were $7 billion with a solid base business performance contributing $305 million of growth, offset as we expected by lower Veklury sales compared to the same quarter last year. Moving to HIV on Slide 9, the treatment market continued to grow in line with our expectations of 2% to 3% annually. And as we've discussed previously, a favorable pricing dynamics in recent quarters have begun to normalize with HIV sales growth more closely mirroring market and demand growth. This was evident in the third quarter where HIV sales were up 4% year-over-year to $4.7 billion, driven by higher treatment and prevention demand and higher channel inventory, partially offset by lower average realized price due to a shift in channel mix. Sequentially, sales were up 1%. Looking to the full year, we continue to expect HIV product sales to grow slightly more than the 5% reported in 2022. Turning to Slide 10, third quarter Biktarvy sales were $3.1 billion, up 12% year-over-year, driven by higher demand as well as higher channel inventory. Sequentially, sales were up 4%. Once again, Biktarvy gained market share up over 2% year-over-year in the U.S. to over 47% share in the third quarter. Thanks to its robust clinical profile, Biktarvy remains the number one prescribed regimen for new starts and number one in treatment switches across most major markets, including the U.S. Descovy sales in the third quarter were $511 million, up 2% year-over-year with strong year-over-year growth in demand for Descovy for PrEP offset by less favorable pricing dynamics to ensure broad access ahead of the potential launch of lenacapavir as early as late 2025. The U.S. PrEP market grew about 15% year-over-year and Descovy for PrEP continued to maintain more than 40% market share due to its strong clinical profile and despite the availability of other regimens including generics. Moving to the liver disease portfolio on Slide 11, sales were down 10% year-over-year to $706 million, primarily due to the resolution of a rebate claim in HCV recognized in the third quarter of 2022, as well as other pricing dynamics. From a demand perspective, HCV new starts increased compared to the third quarter of 2022 in both the U.S. and Europe, driven by our continued efforts to link HCV patients to care. Given the curative nature of our treatment, we expect HCV new starts to trend down overtime, but are pleased that we are maintaining 50% to 60% market shares in the U.S. and Europe and that our labor portfolio more broadly has stabilized from a revenue perspective. On to Slide 12, Veklury sales continued to be highly variable and declined 31% year-over-year in the third quarter to $636 million. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, sales were up 149%, driven by an uptick in hospitalizations during the third quarter. And over the last few weeks, we have seen a slowdown in COVID related hospitalization. Veklury's strong clinical profile continues to be recognized most recently by the FDA and the European Commission for use in patients with mild-to-severe hepatic impairment. While the COVID environment remains ever changing, Veklury's performance in the third quarter further reinforces its established role as a key part of the standard of care for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Moving to Slide 13, our oncology business achieved another strong quarter with sales up 33% year-over-year to $769 million, representing an annual run rate that now exceeds $3 billion. With clear momentum and a solid infrastructure in place, in addition to our compelling clinical pipeline, we look forward to providing more patients with potentially new and effective options. Looking at Trodelvy on Slide 14, sales were up 58% year-over-year and 9% sequentially to $283 million. As a reminder, Trodelvy is the only approved TROP2-directed antibody drug conjugate and to date, we have delivered this therapy to more than 20,000 patients, reinforcing the clinically meaningful benefit Trodelvy can provide across multiple tumor types.\nIHC 0: Turning to Slide 15 and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, cell therapy sales in the third quarter were $486 million, up 22% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting strong demand with particular strength outside the U.S. in the third quarter. Yescarta sales grew 23% year-over-year to $391 million primarily driven by strong growth ex-U.S. in second and third line relapsed or refractory large B cell lymphoma. Tecartus sales were $96 million, up 18% year-over-year, reflecting increased demand in both the U.S. and Europe for relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma as well as adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Given the strong clinical data, it's surprising that only about 10% of eligible second line large B cell lymphoma patients in the U.S. are treated with cell therapy and it is clear that there is still a significant opportunity to drive adoption. As cell therapies are offered and delivered to more and more patients, we are confident that Kite remains well positioned to benefit from this expansion with its differentiated overall survival data for Yescarta and industry-leading manufacturing capabilities. We understand the importance of delivering these potentially curative medicines as quickly as possible to patients with severe and challenging diseases. And to that end, we continue to identify opportunities to bring our therapies to patients faster and are actively working on initiatives to shorten even further our industry-leading 16-day medium turnaround time in the US. Wrapping up the third quarter, I'd like to recognize the strong execution of commercial teams and our cross functional partners across Gilead and Kite. Thanks to their efforts, our therapies are positively impacting more and more people, driven by growing market share and expanding reach, as we bring our therapies to new geographies around the world. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline.\nMerdad Parsey: Thank you, Johanna. The clinical highlight of our third quarter was the release of our promising Phase 2 data for Trodelvy in combination with pembrolizumab in first line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, highlighting Trodelvy's potential to bring a much needed treatment alternative for patients. More broadly, we continue to progress our increasingly diverse pipeline of 60 ongoing clinical programs spanning virology, oncology and inflammation. Starting with our virology programs on Slide 17, we have 10 clinical programs with our long-acting capsid inhibitor lenacapavir including two Phase 3 studies underway in PrEP. I'm pleased to share that we have completed enrollment earlier than anticipated for our Phase 3 PURPOSE-1 trial evaluating lenacapavir for prevention in adolescent girls and young women. Our Phase 3 PURPOSE-2 trial insists [ph] men and trans women and men and non-binary people continues to enroll well and we could have an opportunity to share data from one or both PURPOSE trials in late 2024 ahead of schedule. We are targeting our first approval for lenacapavir in production in late 2025, potentially making lenacapavir the first six-monthly dosing regimen available for PrEP. Turning to treatment, we continue to make strong progress on evaluating nine candidate partners for lenacapavir. Of the remaining candidates, six are already in Phase 1 or 2. We expect to share updates on at least four of these in 2024, including data from our Phase 1 trial of GS-1720, our once weekly long-acting oral integration inhibitor to be combined with lenacapavir and from our Phase 2 ARTISTRY-1 trial evaluating once daily oral combination of lenacapavir and bictegravir for virologically suppressed treatment experienced people living with HIV. We plan to share results from both trials at a conference in early 2024 and we look forward to advancing these programs into the next phase of development. We're also pleased to share that enrollment for our Phase 2 program evaluating our lenacapavir plus bNAbs combination dosed every six months is progressing very well and is another program we expect to update you on next year. Putting this all together, our data continues to support our confidence that lenacapavir has the potential to transform HIV treatment and prevention globally. Turning to oncology on Slide 18. To date, Trodelvy has been delivered to more than 20,000 patients across three approved indications since our launch three years ago. Trodelvy remains the first and only marketed TROP2-directed antibody drug conjugate to achieve meaningful overall survival benefit in two of its indications. With that said, we're seeing both growing real world evidence and clinical trial data supporting not only the approach we're taking for Trodelvy's clinical development across tumor types, but also Trodelvy's unique ADC construct. In particular, trodelvy is the only ADC to have a high 7 to 8 drug to antibody ratio that's able to deliver a highly potent SN-38 payload directly into the tumor microenvironment through its hydrolyzable linker. As a result, in our studies to date, Trodelvy has shown a potentially differentiated safety profile with regards to ILD and stomatitis. We look forward to sharing more emerging Trodelvy data in 2024 as we continue to expand Trodelvy across tumor types and lines of therapy.\nTROPiCS:\n03:\nTROPiCS:\n03:\nKEYNOTE: As a reminder, we are currently enrolling patients with first line PD-L1 high metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in our registrational Phase 3 EVOKE-03 study. Preliminary data from the PD-L1 TPS less than 50% cohort has also been encouraging, demonstrating an ORR of 44% similar to previous trials that evaluated pembro plus chemotherapy. These results inform our plans to expand into broader first line non-small cell lung cancer patient populations across all PD-L1 expression levels. We're looking forward to sharing further analysis from EVOKE-02 that will highlight the efficacy of Trodelvy and pembro across both squamous and non-squamous histologies in first line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients.\n024: As a reminder, we are currently enrolling patients with first line PD-L1 high metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in our registrational Phase 3 EVOKE-03 study.

Turning to cell therapy on Slide 21, we are continuing to work to expand the benefits of cell therapy to even more patients with eight ongoing trials in earlier lines, new indications or new settings. We also have an extensive early stage pipeline where we are exploring allergenic CAR-Ts including healthy donor and IPSC derived cell therapies as well as natural killer and invariant natural killer T cell therapies.\nCART:\nddBCMA:\nCART:\nddBCMA:\nCART: Finally, and before I hand over to Andy, the teams progress on key 2023 clinical milestones is shown on Slide 22. As is expected with the diverse and large clinical portfolio, not all our programs will benefit patients the way we hope they will and the ENHANCE and ENHANCE-2 programs evaluating magrolimab have both been discontinued based on futility analyses. The ENHANCE-3 study remains under partial clinical hold in frontline unfit AML and we continue to evaluate the progress of this and other Phase 2 solid tumor trials for magrolimab. With regards to some of the remaining milestones for 2023 as referenced previously, we look forward to sharing data from ARTISTRY-1 at a medical conference in 2024. For our HIV prevention studies, we continue to expect to have our first patient in for the PURPOSE-3 and PURPOSE-4 clinical trials by the end of this year. Additionally, we remain on track to initiate our Phase 2 PALEKONA trial evaluating our potential first in class 222 inhibitor for ulcerative colitis later this year. Our 222 inhibitor represents one of our many oral agents for inflammation. Looking beyond 2023, we will share our target 2024 milestones in due course, but it's already clear that it will be a rich year for data updates for Gilead, including potential updates or regulatory filings for Obeldesivir, lenacapavir, Trodelvy and CAR-T ddBCMA. With that, I'll hand the call over to Andy. Andy?\nddBCMA's: Finally, and before I hand over to Andy, the teams progress on key 2023 clinical milestones is shown on Slide 22.

With that, I'll hand the call over to Andy. Andy?\nAndrew Dickinson: Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another solid quarter as shown on Slide 24, with total product sales excluding Veklury up 5% year-over-year, driven by growth across oncology and HIV, partially offset by lower HCV sales. Total product sales were $7 billion, flat year-over-year, with lower Veklury sales offsetting more than $300 million of growth in our base business. Our non-GAAP results are shown on Slide 25. Product gross margin was 86%, down 85 basis points from last year. R&D was $1.5 billion, up 24% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing clinical trial activities. Third quarter R&D expenses also reflected some sizable wind down costs related to the discontinuation of two Phase 3 magrolimab ENHANCE studies and faster than anticipated enrollment in our Phase 3 PURPOSE-1 and OAKTREE studies, both of which have recently completed enrollment and could accelerate timelines for data readouts in due course. Acquired IPR&D was $91 million, reflecting the Tentarix collaboration announced in August, in addition to other payments associated with ongoing partnerships. SG&A was $1.3 billion, up 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by increased commercial investments, namely in oncology. Moving to tax, our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 7% primarily reflecting a decrease in tax reserves as a result of reaching an agreement with a tax authority on certain tax position. Excluding the settlement, our non-GAAP effective tax rate would have been approximately 16%. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.29 compared to $1.90 for the same period last year. This was primarily driven by growth in our base business, lower tax and lower acquired IP R&D expenses compared to the third quarter of 2022 partially offset by lower Veklury sales and higher R&D and commercial investments. Moving to Slide 26, year-to-date base business revenue has grown 10% year-over-year, highlighting strong performance across virology and oncology. From an OpEx perspective, the investment we have made this year in R&D is notable with a robust and diverse clinical pipeline and with our commercial sales and marketing organization scaled to meet growing demand for our on market oncology portfolio, we continue to expect a moderation of expense growth in 2024 and beyond. Moving to Slide 27, we are updating many of our guidance ranges to reflect our year-to-date performance and our expectations for the rest of the year. Total product sales is now expected to be in the range of $26.7 billion to $26.9 billion, up from $26.3 billion to $26.7 billion previously. We are increasing total product sales excluding Veklury at the midpoint. We now expect the range to be between $24.8 billion to $25 billion, up from $24.6 billion to $25 billion previously. This range represents growth of 7% to 8% for our base business year-over-year and an increase of $650 million at the midpoint from the initial guidance we issued in February. On Veklury, based on our results year-to-date, we now expect full year Veklury sales of approximately $1.9 billion. As always, this remains highly variable and correlated with COVID related hospitalizations. Moving to the rest of the P&L, we continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 86%. On R&D, reflecting the accelerated enrollments and magrolimab discontinuation expenses, our full year non-GAAP R&D expense is now expected to grow approximately 15% in 2023 compared to 2022. Excluding these items, our full year R&D expense is consistent with our prior guidance in the low double digits. Reflecting the Tentarix collaboration closed in the third quarter as well as previously committed acquired IPR&D amounts and known milestone payments from existing collaborations, we now expect non-GAAP acquired IPR&D of approximately $1 billion in 2023. Similar to prior quarters, we will update expected acquired IPR&D expenses if they are incurred during the fourth quarter. We continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses to increase by a high single digit percentage compared to 2022. As a reminder, this includes the one-time legal settlement accrual of $525 million in the second quarter. Excluding this, we continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A expense for 2023 to be down a low single digit percentage compared to 2022. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be $10.5 billion to $10.8 billion as compared to $10.4 billion to $10.9 billion previously, driven by higher R&D expenses offset by higher product sales. Given certain one- time tax benefits in 2023, we now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 16% for the full year. Altogether, we now expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $6.65 and $6.85 per share as compared to $6.45 and $6.80 per share previously. As shown on Slide 28, the chart highlights the continued strength of our business with higher total product sales guidance flowing into the bottom line, which together with the lower expected tax rate more than offsets the higher R&D expenses in the third quarter. On a GAAP basis, our diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.55 and $4.75 per share. Moving to Slide 29, our capital allocation priorities remain focused and unchanged. In the third quarter, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through our dividend and repurchase of shares totaling $3.7 billion year-to-date. In the third quarter, we repaid $2.25 billion of senior notes and issued $2 billion in senior notes maturing in 2033 and 2053. Overall, the third quarter was another solid quarter of commercial and clinical execution in an extremely strong 2023 for Gilead so far. Our planning for 2024 is well underway and we've taken steps in the third quarter to continue to evolve our business model and expense structure to set us up for strong execution next year. 2023 has been a year of considerable investment, notably in R&D and we are excited to finally be at the point where many of our key programs will start reading out data. With that in mind, we are preparing for a catalyst rich 2024 and we look forward to sharing more early next year. With that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today goes to Geoff Meacham of Bank of America. Geoff, please go ahead, your line is open.\nGeoff Meacham: Okay, great. Hi everyone. Thanks for the question. I guess this is for maybe Johanna or for Merdad. Just on lenacapavir, your competitor has highlighted some of the [derm path] (ph) and I wanted to get your perspective on what you've seen in clinical studies, really as well as the early commercial experience. I wasn't sure if you guys view that as a non-issue or something to navigate as you develop lenacapavir for PrEP or various doublets and HIV treatment. Thank you.\nMerdad Parsey: Sure. Hey, Geoff, this is Merdad. Thanks for the question. I would say that our DDI profile has been pretty well characterized and is in our label and laid out. As you noted lenacapavir is metabolized by CYP3A and like many other drugs in the class and we -- that's been available and labeled for quite some time. We don't anticipate any changes to our programs based on that. There are no adaptations that we are making in our clinical development program based on that. As you know, we're well on our way in our PURPOSE 1/2 lenacapavir for PrEP studies and have the approval and highly treatment experienced people and have not made any modifications based on any DDI concerns in those trials. And I'd encourage folks to take a look at the label. You can see what's laid out fairly clearly there.\nJohanna Mercier: Yes. And maybe just to add to what Merdad said, so we launched Sunlenca, lenacapavir for heavily treatment experience earlier this year. As per Merdad's comments, the label has no contraindication specific to what you were referring to, to opioids or ED drugs and the launch thus far is well underway and access is increasing every day across the U.S., but also other markets including Japan and Europe and we're excited to have an option for these patients that unfortunately have really no other option at this point in time. So very small market opportunity today with the potential for lenacapavir for PrEP as early as late 2025, so very excited as we continue our plans for that.\nJacquie Ross: Nadia, may we have our next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question goes to Michael Yee of Jefferies. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Yee: Thanks, great. And appreciate the question. Maybe from Merdad coming away from ESMO and some of the recent conferences, obviously a ton of Trop-2 data, and there's a lot of talk around the benefit, particularly in lung, for non-squamous versus squamous. And some of your competitors have modified their studies to be more focused on non-squamous. Can you maybe just talk about how you see the benefits here in the different populations and whether you would consider emphasizing or modifying to be a non-squamous as well to improve probability success? Thank you.\nMerdad Parsey: Thanks, Michael, for the question. Yes, look, we had a really interesting ESMO, I think, for all concerned, and I think something that we've been saying for quite some time, is that not all Trop-2 ADCs are equivalent. Right? It's really important to note that there are differences between Trodelvy and the other Trop-2 ADCs in all three components. The affinity of the antibody is two orders of magnitude better. We have a different linker and we have a different payload. That has played out in many ways along the safety spectrum, where we have different adverse event profiles of the two drugs that have clearly emerged. And it's possible now that we're starting to see divergence on the efficacy side as well. Recall that we have shared our EVOKE-02 data, which comprise both squam and non-squamous patients. We have enrolled both squamous and non-squamous patients in our trials, and as one would expect, we do stratify those patients in the studies and we\u2019ll continue to do so. But we're very confident in our approach and with what we've seen so far, and really look forward to being able to share more data from EVOKE-01 next year.\nJacquie Ross: Nadia, next question please?\nOperator: Our next question goes to Daina Graybosch of Leerink Partners. Diana, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDaina Graybosch: Thank you. A question about Kite. I wonder if you can talk through the specific barriers that are limiting uptake of CAR-T and the second-line large B cell lymphoma indication. And what do you think will be required to upshift the earlier line demand for cell therapy in a large B cell lymphoma, and maybe even a multiple myeloma as well?\nJohanna Mercier: Thank you very much for the question, Diana. I think some of the specific barriers that we're observing are more in the U.S. So I might first talk about what we're observing in Europe where we have socialized medicine. We're seeing uptake as soon as we are granted access and reimbursement. And it goes very quickly into the system, because it's a non-fragmented healthcare system. In the U.S., things look a little bit different given the fragmentation of the healthcare system. So the barriers that we're observing in the U.S. are really our ability to treat patients where they are so moving into community oncology. Today, 80% of oncology patients are seen in the community. Most of our authorized treatment centers exist in large academic hospitals. And so what we're doing for the future, and what we think is going to be very important, is that we're able to have authorized treatment centers in the community closer to patients. So that's one important piece. And we continue to open up new treatment centers in the United States. And in fact, this year we should end with somewhere around 140 treatment centers in the U.S., and that will continue to grow in 2024. I think the second piece for barriers is converting stem cell transplants. So physicians who are transplanting patients, they will have a better outcome via the data if they have CAR-T. And so we're working with transplanters on education and really making sure those patients have access to CAR-T in the earlier lines. I think those are two of the larger barriers that we're observing today. And the last piece, I would say, is the excitement with multiple myeloma therapies coming forward. You can imagine the ATCs now we're seeing both lymphoma patients as well as multiple myeloma patients, and that's causing a crunch within those authorized treatment centers. And that's why it's important in the academic medical centers that we're able to expand the number of beds, and secondly, open new authorized treatment centers that can serve both lymphoma and multiple myeloma.\nJacquie Ross: Nadia, may we have our next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question goes to Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Chris, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the question. Can you elaborate a little bit more on HIV channel mix dynamics this quarter and how you're thinking about that for 4Q and beyond? I know channel has been a bit of a tailwind over the past year or two. Seems like we're now may be starting to see some headwinds, at least sequentially. And I just was wondering how you think about that progressing from here? Thanks so much.\nJohanna Mercier: Sure, Chris, thanks for the question. So you're right, as expected. We've seen some of those favorable pricing dynamics that we'd seen in the last couple of quarters, including in 2022, due to the channel mix, kind of begin to normalize, and you should expect to see kind of the same play from Q3 into Q4. One of the reasons for that had to do with some of the channel \u2013 specifically around the channel mix to what you referenced, having to do with some of our government channels being less utilized, where we have higher rebates, and therefore we had pricing [favorability] (ph). We believe a lot of that had to do just stabilization post-COVID around employment rates, inflation, et cetera. So we had benefits that we saw over that probably, I would say four quarters to six quarters or so. And as we kind of shared with you in Q2, we are seeing that normalize out for the second half of this year. And I think you should expect that not only for the next quarter, but then as we go into 2024. And therefore, because of all that, we believe that our HIV sales growth is closely mirroring now more of the market and the demand growth, where we're seeing real strength, both from a market standpoint in treatment and prevention, we're seeing about two points to three points growth in the market when you look at retail and non-retail market, and then, of course, 15% growth in the PrEP market. And then from a demand standpoint, I think obviously with BIKTARVY growing at 12 points year-on-year and DESCOVY continuing to hold on to a very strong share over 40% or so in a competitive market with generics and, of course, new formulations. So more to come as we go into Q4, but hopefully that gives you a better picture of some of the mix of channels.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you. Maybe I have our next caller, please.\nOperator: Our next question goes to Tim Anderson of Wolfe Research. Tim, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks for taking our question. This is Adam on for Tim Anderson at Wolfe Research. Also on TROP2, just in light of competitor data, can you provide some more color on just latest thoughts on the competitive dynamics within the class? For example, if AstraZeneca gets a label for HR+ breast cancer in the second-line, and Trodelvy only has a label for the third-line, won't that displace Trodelvy? Thanks.\nJohanna Mercier: Yes, good question, Adam. So I'm assuming you're referring to some of the data we saw at ESMO with data DXD. We don't believe there is material impact for now anyway, or even in the future for Trodelvy. And the reason for that really has to do with the data itself and the lines of therapy, to your point, I think we've proven very clearly with Trodelvy in second-line TNBC and beyond around the overall survival data that we've shown. And then, of course, showing OS again in HR+/HER2-, although in later lines. I think what we're seeing today in the marketplace is not only are we the leaders in TNBC, we're also leading from an IHC 0 population. And then, of course, looking at sequencing of ADCs posts in HER2, as expected in the HR+/HER2- populations, so quite pleased with our positioning and we don't believe the data that we've seen thus far is going to have a direct impact there.\nDaniel O'Day: Yes, I would just add that we continue to expand our programs and continue to want to generate additional data for Trodelvy. So we are very comfortable with where we are. I think our ability to interact with our caregivers and patients now having been on the market for quite some time, is really helping us make sure that we get Trodelvy to as many patients who could benefit from it as possible.\nJacquie Ross: Nadia, may we have our next question, please?\nOperator: Of course, our next question goes to Salveen Richter of Goldman Sachs. Salveen, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSalveen Richter: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question here on the pipeline, just given two data releases that came out. So on the TIGIT gastric data that was presented today, how do we think \u2013 or how do you think about the terms, the opportunity, the competitiveness versus standard of care combos and next steps? And then with regard to the multiple myeloma for Arcellx that was presented, it looks to be tracking a Carvykti like profile in relapse refractory multiple myeloma. Could you just walk us through next steps path to market competitive positioning here? Thank you.\nDaniel O'Day: Sure. Maybe I'll start with TIGIT and I'll hand it off to Cindy for the multiple myeloma discussion. Yes, I think, look, we find the data that we presented today at the ASCO plenary to really be promising for continued momentum for TIGIT. The data from an ORR standpoint, and I think importantly, the landmark PFS analysis are very promising. It's early data, it's single-arm data, and I think those are all caveats that are appropriate when looking at these. But when you think about the context around what the standard of care PFS and OS are, we think there's certainly promising signals that we could do better than that. So, obviously, what we need to do next is allow these data to mature in ARC-21. And then, of course, we have the 221 study. That is our Phase 3 study, where we will be comparing to standard of care in a randomized Phase 3 trial. We think the data shown today really will help us with momentum in accruing that trial and hopefully demonstrating the promise of TIGIT added onto standard of care, a standard of care like regimen with zim and FOLFOX. We're excited about that Phase 3 outcome, and it really gives us the opportunity to be, we think ahead on that indication compared to the competition in TIGIT. And Cindy, do you want to.\nCindy Perettie: Yes. Happy to. Thank you. So, this is early days, obviously, for the ddBCMA molecule. We have 38 patients worth of data. If I compare it to Carvykti, the population looks more like the LEGEND-2 population. We have 34% extramedillary disease, which is a high risk prognosis patient. And if you look at the LEGEND-2 data, they had 30%. Our overall response rate to date in those 38 patients at 22 months is 100%, and in the LEGEND-2 data is 88% at 25 months. So I do think there is a potential to differentiate on efficacy. We're seeing a differentiation as it relates to the safety profile around the Parkinson syndrome. We are not observing that in any of our patients to date. Obviously, we're going to continue to watch that as we enroll the IMAGINE 1 study and move into our next studies as well. Multiple myeloma is a large market. There is enough room in multiple myeloma to have multiple competitors. But we also feel like we will have a differentiated molecule with Arcellx. So we're looking forward to generating more data and talking to folks about it at ASH.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you, Nadia. We're ready for our next question.\nOperator: Our next question goes to Tyler Van Buren of TD Cowen. Tyler, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTyler Van Buren: Hey, guys, thanks for the presentation. I have another question, actually on the myeloma program. So assuming that Arcellx's CAR-T ddBCMA data continue to look great at ASH, and the IMAGINE-1 trial does later next year and leads to approval, how prepared have you guys gotten on the manufacturing front in the past year? And do you expect the launch to have a similar trajectory to Yescarta in terms of supply or be significantly better.\nJohanna Mercier: Hey there's a number of things that we have learned over the course of the years with Yescarta and around manufacturing, all of which we're applying that knowledge to the manufacturing of the ddBCMA CAR-T. So we plan to launch that out of our facilities at Kite and expect to have a strong launch again. We will be applying Yescarta learnings. So our goal is to be significantly better than we were at the launch of Yescarta.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you, Nadia. We're ready for our next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question goes to Brian Abrahams of RBC Capital Markets. Brian, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrian Abrahams: Hi there. Thanks for taking my question. It seems like the long acting HIV combos are moving ahead really well. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the strategic role that the Lenacapavir, Bictegravir daily oral or the weekly 17/20 based combo could play in the HIV competitive landscape. Do you think these could move beyond treatment experienced patients on complex regimens into the earlier lines? Thanks.\nDaniel O'Day: Sure, maybe. Johanna, do you want to talk about weekly oral? And I'll do the weekly?\nJohanna Mercier: Sure. Thanks for the question, Brian. I think the way we're looking at lenacapavir, bictegravir in the virologically suppressed really has to do with. We've set the standard of care with Biktarvy, and the opportunity now is to ensure that if for some reason there was a reason to switch Biktarvy from a tolerability profile or anything else that they have an option to go to that has a really interesting combination. Right. When you think about a capsid inhibitor as well as an integrase inhibitor. So for us, it's really about the optionality for patients and making sure that this could offer something a little bit different in the daily oral market. And I do think that this will also be a longer term strategy for us as we think about beyond Biktarvy's LOE in 2033. So I would go there and on the weekly just to start, and then I'll kick it over to Merdad to share with you our plans there. On the weekly oral, it's clear from the patient research that we've done in treatment that we really do see benefit not only the daily oral market, but also in the oral weekly, or even potentially even a little bit longer, as we think about what patients are asking for today. So as much as we're very interested in the long actings that are every three months or every six months. We are also making sure that we meet the needs of patients and their requests as they're looking at for some really don't like any injectables or sub Q, and really looking at that weekly oral as potentially expending a little bit the time they don't think about the fact that they have HIV.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes, just minor things to add, I would say. We have been focusing our development on what people living with HIV and people who are looking for PrEP options have told us that they're interested in, and that's longer acting oral options and injectable options that are every three months, every six months. And that's what we've been focusing our development program on. And we want to make sure that we provide that optionality to different folks. The other thing about the [indiscernible] to Remember is remember that Lena is a new class of antiretroviral, and that provides caregivers the option to leverage that new class for the appropriate people living with HIV. So our goal as the leader in HIV is to continue to provide as many of the relevant options to people living with HIV and people looking for prevention options as we think are going to be reasonable and valuable. And remember that we think the weekly oral is important enough that we have two programs. So you mentioned 1720. Remember, we also have the program with his islatravir, lenacapavir. So we're very happy with the progress we've made, as you noted, and really on track to provide better options.\nJacquie Ross: Nadia, may we have our next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question goes to Terrence Flynn of Morgan Stanley. Terrence, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTerrence Flynn: Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you can provide any preliminary thoughts on 2024 spend or margins. Andy, thanks so much.\nAndrew Dickinson: Hey, Terrence, thanks for the question. Happy to take that. Obviously, in late January or early February, as we customarily do, we'll provide very specific guidance in 2024. What we've said, and I would continue to reiterate, is that as you've seen, our expenses increase over the last couple of years as our portfolio has increased, and again, from our perspective, a very necessary and appropriate increase as we developed what we feel is one of the best and broadest pipelines in the industry, both in virology, oncology, across cell therapy, and at Gilead. We're finally at the level where we're spending on par with our peers, especially on the R&D side. You saw that in the third quarter. So as you think about expenses, going forward, we expect that you will see more moderate growth in expenses over time. We're doing a lot to manage our expenses, as you heard on the last couple of quarters. Maybe the best evidence of that, Terrence, is if you look at our first quarter R&D expenses, our third quarter R&D expenses are essentially flat. So you saw a little bit of a step down from the first quarter. In the second quarter, in the third quarter, we're flat. So you already see that we're kind of, as we said, we're approaching kind of the peak spend, recognizing that we have 60 different clinical programs. If I remember correctly, we have 27 programs in phase, 219 programs in Phase 3. That is very different than the Gilead of prior years that you remember. And it's part of what makes it so excited about where we're going as a company. And the final thing I'd say is you're already seeing the benefits of those investments and the commercial performance that we've talked about for the last two years. So we expect that you will continue to see those benefits in our commercial performance across the entire business, and you're going to see a moderation of expense growth. And again, we'll provide much more specific detail early next year and look forward to talking about this further. Thank you.\nJacquie Ross: Nadia. Our next caller, please?\nOperator: Our next question goes to Evan Seigerman of BMO Capital Markets. Evan, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I want one on kind of capital allocation as a function of competitiveness in your respective markets. For example, you have a great moat in virology. How do you think about investment there, say versus oncology, where it's a more competitive marketplace and where we're seeing incremental kind of benefit over time? Maybe some thoughts there. Thank you so much.\nAndrew Dickinson: Hey, Evan, it's Andy. I'll start. And others may want to jump in as. Look I mean, what we've said historically, and I'd reiterate, is we're always going to follow the science. So we are completely committed to virology, not just HIV, but virology broadly. You see that, for instance, with our progress with oral DESCOVY [ph] as well as other programs, we've also said in virology that a lot of what happens in virology happens in our internal research and that there are less opportunities externally to invest in. That doesn't mean that we won't continue to look for them. And we're going to continue to invest in oncology. We have a much larger oncology organization today, we've increased our internal research and development, and we're still very focused as the third pillar on inflammation. So I would remind people that we have a number of early inflammation programs, including a number in Phase 2 that we're excited about. Merdad highlighted the TROP2 program in his remarks earlier, but that's just one of the programs that we expect to build out over time. So we'll follow the science. We're going to apply capital to each of those areas. If you look back, our capital investment has risen and fallen over time in each of those areas as we've looked at different opportunities. And of course, we're going to continue to invest in cell therapy as part of oncology and more broadly. I should have highlighted that earlier. So the short summary is, we'll follow the science, but all of the areas will receive additional capital over time. Merdad, you want to add anything?\nMerdad Parsey: I would just add that our goal has been to diversify the portfolio. We remain committed and think one of our key competitive advantages is our track record and strength in virology. And I would agree with you, Evan, that's critical to our continued success and growth. And we also believe that having more diversity in our portfolio, whether its oncology or inflammation, is going to be really important to our long term future. So our capital allocation will happen on where the best data are, and we make those tradeoffs virtually every day.\nJacquie Ross: Nadia, I think we have time for one last question, please.\nOperator: Our final question goes to Joe Catanzaro of Piper Sandler. Joe, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJoe Catanzaro: Hi everybody. Appreciate you taking my question. I actually had one on Trodelvy within bladder cancer, and appreciate this is a smaller proportion of Trodelvy sales, but just wanted to ask about the potential impact of Padcev's EV-302 data and it moving into the front line and what you could potentially see there with Trodelvy, both maybe in the near term and longer term. Thanks.\nJohanna Mercier: So maybe I'll start and then throw it over to Merdad first from a clinical standpoint, what we're thinking from a commercial standpoint, with the data that we saw, I think the standard of care is going to change in first line, clearly, with that data, and we see that as a potential opportunity to actually move up Trodelvy lines of therapy. So right now in the U.S., we do have accelerated approval in the U.S., and we're seeing about 15%, 16% share in bladder cancer, but later lines of therapy. So third line plus, I think with the opportunity to have Padcev kind of move up in the first line setting with Pembro. I think it'll be interesting to see how Trodelvy kind of moves up as we've seen a lot of sequencing from ADCs here as well. So that's in the here and now and maybe Merdad, you want to comment on the clinical development?\nMerdad Parsey: Yes, I think it's great news for patients with the data that's come out and we think it does change the paradigm for bladder cancer. I think the other thing I would add to what Johanna said is that we were looking with interest. We don't have data on sequencing, but we're certainly hearing about sequencing and there were data that were shown at ESMO around combining Padcev and Trodelvy where the tolerability profile looked good and the responses looked good. Small study, but we think there continues to be opportunity there for us and having this clarity will help us design where we're going to go from here after our confirmatory trial in second line completes.\nOperator: Thank you. That's all the questions that we have time for today. I'll now hand back to Dan for any closing comments.\nDaniel O'Day: Well, just want to thank the team here and all of you for joining and just maybe end with this reflection, which is Gilead. I don't think we could be more excited about as we wrap up 2023 and head into 2024, about the evolution of our commercial and clinical execution. In particular, 2024 will be a year that's full of key clinical catalysts across our portfolio, and that's really been a culmination over the past several years of investing in a robust and diversified portfolio, many of which were Phase 2 studies that led to Phase 3 studies that we'll be reading out over the course of not only next year, but the years to come. We'll provide more details on all of our 2024 clinical milestones early next year, but in the meantime, maybe just a couple to highlight in a busy year. Obviously on Trodelvy, where the clinical data increasingly highlight that all TROP2 ADCs are not alike. We'll be rolling out data across a variety of disease states in oncology, and we're excited to share data on lung cancer in the first half of 2024 and then maybe to highlight one other one. Lenacapavir will have a rich year of data on the treatment combination candidates, and we continue to target being first to market with our six month long acting PrEPs, starting with readouts next year on our Phase 3 trials and a commercial launch as early as late 2025. With that, as always, feel free to reach out to the IR team here at Gilead, if you have any questions or feedback for the team and we\u2019ll look forward to updating you again early in the New Year. Thank you for joining.\nOperator: Thank you. This now concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thank you, Johanna. The clinical highlight of our third quarter was the release of our promising Phase 2 data for Trodelvy in combination with pembrolizumab in first line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, highlighting Trodelvy's potential to bring a much needed treatment alternative for patients. More broadly, we continue to progress our increasingly diverse pipeline of 60 ongoing clinical programs spanning virology, oncology and inflammation. Starting with our virology programs on Slide 17, we have 10 clinical programs with our long-acting capsid inhibitor lenacapavir including two Phase 3 studies underway in PrEP. I'm pleased to share that we have completed enrollment earlier than anticipated for our Phase 3 PURPOSE-1 trial evaluating lenacapavir for prevention in adolescent girls and young women. Our Phase 3 PURPOSE-2 trial insists [ph] men and trans women and men and non-binary people continues to enroll well and we could have an opportunity to share data from one or both PURPOSE trials in late 2024 ahead of schedule. We are targeting our first approval for lenacapavir in production in late 2025, potentially making lenacapavir the first six-monthly dosing regimen available for PrEP. Turning to treatment, we continue to make strong progress on evaluating nine candidate partners for lenacapavir. Of the remaining candidates, six are already in Phase 1 or 2. We expect to share updates on at least four of these in 2024, including data from our Phase 1 trial of GS-1720, our once weekly long-acting oral integration inhibitor to be combined with lenacapavir and from our Phase 2 ARTISTRY-1 trial evaluating once daily oral combination of lenacapavir and bictegravir for virologically suppressed treatment experienced people living with HIV. We plan to share results from both trials at a conference in early 2024 and we look forward to advancing these programs into the next phase of development. We're also pleased to share that enrollment for our Phase 2 program evaluating our lenacapavir plus bNAbs combination dosed every six months is progressing very well and is another program we expect to update you on next year. Putting this all together, our data continues to support our confidence that lenacapavir has the potential to transform HIV treatment and prevention globally. Turning to oncology on Slide 18. To date, Trodelvy has been delivered to more than 20,000 patients across three approved indications since our launch three years ago. Trodelvy remains the first and only marketed TROP2-directed antibody drug conjugate to achieve meaningful overall survival benefit in two of its indications. With that said, we're seeing both growing real world evidence and clinical trial data supporting not only the approach we're taking for Trodelvy's clinical development across tumor types, but also Trodelvy's unique ADC construct. In particular, trodelvy is the only ADC to have a high 7 to 8 drug to antibody ratio that's able to deliver a highly potent SN-38 payload directly into the tumor microenvironment through its hydrolyzable linker. As a result, in our studies to date, Trodelvy has shown a potentially differentiated safety profile with regards to ILD and stomatitis. We look forward to sharing more emerging Trodelvy data in 2024 as we continue to expand Trodelvy across tumor types and lines of therapy. Sure. Hey, Geoff, this is Merdad. Thanks for the question. I would say that our DDI profile has been pretty well characterized and is in our label and laid out. As you noted lenacapavir is metabolized by CYP3A and like many other drugs in the class and we -- that's been available and labeled for quite some time. We don't anticipate any changes to our programs based on that. There are no adaptations that we are making in our clinical development program based on that. As you know, we're well on our way in our PURPOSE 1/2 lenacapavir for PrEP studies and have the approval and highly treatment experienced people and have not made any modifications based on any DDI concerns in those trials. And I'd encourage folks to take a look at the label. You can see what's laid out fairly clearly there. Thanks, Michael, for the question. Yes, look, we had a really interesting ESMO, I think, for all concerned, and I think something that we've been saying for quite some time, is that not all Trop-2 ADCs are equivalent. Right? It's really important to note that there are differences between Trodelvy and the other Trop-2 ADCs in all three components. The affinity of the antibody is two orders of magnitude better. We have a different linker and we have a different payload. That has played out in many ways along the safety spectrum, where we have different adverse event profiles of the two drugs that have clearly emerged. And it's possible now that we're starting to see divergence on the efficacy side as well. Recall that we have shared our EVOKE-02 data, which comprise both squam and non-squamous patients. We have enrolled both squamous and non-squamous patients in our trials, and as one would expect, we do stratify those patients in the studies and we'll continue to do so. But we're very confident in our approach and with what we've seen so far, and really look forward to being able to share more data from EVOKE-01 next year. Yes, just minor things to add, I would say. We have been focusing our development on what people living with HIV and people who are looking for PrEP options have told us that they're interested in, and that's longer acting oral options and injectable options that are every three months, every six months. And that's what we've been focusing our development program on. And we want to make sure that we provide that optionality to different folks. The other thing about the [indiscernible] to Remember is remember that Lena is a new class of antiretroviral, and that provides caregivers the option to leverage that new class for the appropriate people living with HIV. So our goal as the leader in HIV is to continue to provide as many of the relevant options to people living with HIV and people looking for prevention options as we think are going to be reasonable and valuable. And remember that we think the weekly oral is important enough that we have two programs. So you mentioned 1720. Remember, we also have the program with his islatravir, lenacapavir. So we're very happy with the progress we've made, as you noted, and really on track to provide better options. I would just add that our goal has been to diversify the portfolio. We remain committed and think one of our key competitive advantages is our track record and strength in virology. And I would agree with you, Evan, that's critical to our continued success and growth. And we also believe that having more diversity in our portfolio, whether its oncology or inflammation, is going to be really important to our long term future. So our capital allocation will happen on where the best data are, and we make those tradeoffs virtually every day. Yes, I think it's great news for patients with the data that's come out and we think it does change the paradigm for bladder cancer.

            "content": "Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to share that Gilead teams have delivered another strong quarter that rounds out two years of continuous growth for our base business. Our track record of commercial execution continued in the third quarter with our base business up 5% compared to the third quarter of 2022 and up 10% year-over-year for the first nine months of 2023. In the third quarter, our growth was driven by our leading therapies across virology and oncology. Biktarvy had another very strong quarter, up 12% from the same quarter in 2022 and contributing to 9% growth overall in HIV in the first nine months of 2023. Oncology is also driving growth and was up 33% in the third quarter compared to last year. Revenue is now annualizing at more than $3 billion with growing adoption of Trodelvy, the only approved Trop-2 directed ADC and our industry leading cell therapies. Yes, I would just add that we continue to expand our programs and continue to want to generate additional data for Trodelvy. So we are very comfortable with where we are. I think our ability to interact with our caregivers and patients now having been on the market for quite some time, is really helping us make sure that we get Trodelvy to as many patients who could benefit from it as possible. Sure. Maybe I'll start with TIGIT and I'll hand it off to Cindy for the multiple myeloma discussion. Yes, I think, look, we find the data that we presented today at the ASCO plenary to really be promising for continued momentum for TIGIT. The data from an ORR standpoint, and I think importantly, the landmark PFS analysis are very promising. It's early data, it's single-arm data, and I think those are all caveats that are appropriate when looking at these. But when you think about the context around what the standard of care PFS and OS are, we think there's certainly promising signals that we could do better than that. So, obviously, what we need to do next is allow these data to mature in ARC-21. And then, of course, we have the 221 study. That is our Phase 3 study, where we will be comparing to standard of care in a randomized Phase 3 trial. We think the data shown today really will help us with momentum in accruing that trial and hopefully demonstrating the promise of TIGIT added onto standard of care, a standard of care like regimen with zim and FOLFOX. We're excited about that Phase 3 outcome, and it really gives us the opportunity to be, we think ahead on that indication compared to the competition in TIGIT. And Cindy, do you want to. Sure, maybe. Johanna, do you want to talk about weekly oral? And I'll do the weekly? Well, just want to thank the team here and all of you for joining and just maybe end with this reflection, which is Gilead.

            "name": "Andrew Dickinson",
            "content": "Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another solid quarter as shown on Slide 24, with total product sales excluding Veklury up 5% year-over-year, driven by growth across oncology and HIV, partially offset by lower HCV sales. Total product sales were $7 billion, flat year-over-year, with lower Veklury sales offsetting more than $300 million of growth in our base business. Our non-GAAP results are shown on Slide 25. Product gross margin was 86%, down 85 basis points from last year. R&D was $1.5 billion, up 24% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing clinical trial activities. Third quarter R&D expenses also reflected some sizable wind down costs related to the discontinuation of two Phase 3 magrolimab ENHANCE studies and faster than anticipated enrollment in our Phase 3 PURPOSE-1 and OAKTREE studies, both of which have recently completed enrollment and could accelerate timelines for data readouts in due course. Acquired IPR&D was $91 million, reflecting the Tentarix collaboration announced in August, in addition to other payments associated with ongoing partnerships. SG&A was $1.3 billion, up 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by increased commercial investments, namely in oncology. Moving to tax, our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 7% primarily reflecting a decrease in tax reserves as a result of reaching an agreement with a tax authority on certain tax position. Excluding the settlement, our non-GAAP effective tax rate would have been approximately 16%. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.29 compared to $1.90 for the same period last year. This was primarily driven by growth in our base business, lower tax and lower acquired IP R&D expenses compared to the third quarter of 2022 partially offset by lower Veklury sales and higher R&D and commercial investments. Moving to Slide 26, year-to-date base business revenue has grown 10% year-over-year, highlighting strong performance across virology and oncology. From an OpEx perspective, the investment we have made this year in R&D is notable with a robust and diverse clinical pipeline and with our commercial sales and marketing organization scaled to meet growing demand for our on market oncology portfolio, we continue to expect a moderation of expense growth in 2024 and beyond. Moving to Slide 27, we are updating many of our guidance ranges to reflect our year-to-date performance and our expectations for the rest of the year. Total product sales is now expected to be in the range of $26.7 billion to $26.9 billion, up from $26.3 billion to $26.7 billion previously. We are increasing total product sales excluding Veklury at the midpoint. We now expect the range to be between $24.8 billion to $25 billion, up from $24.6 billion to $25 billion previously. This range represents growth of 7% to 8% for our base business year-over-year and an increase of $650 million at the midpoint from the initial guidance we issued in February. On Veklury, based on our results year-to-date, we now expect full year Veklury sales of approximately $1.9 billion. As always, this remains highly variable and correlated with COVID related hospitalizations. Moving to the rest of the P&L, we continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 86%. On R&D, reflecting the accelerated enrollments and magrolimab discontinuation expenses, our full year non-GAAP R&D expense is now expected to grow approximately 15% in 2023 compared to 2022. Excluding these items, our full year R&D expense is consistent with our prior guidance in the low double digits. Reflecting the Tentarix collaboration closed in the third quarter as well as previously committed acquired IPR&D amounts and known milestone payments from existing collaborations, we now expect non-GAAP acquired IPR&D of approximately $1 billion in 2023. Similar to prior quarters, we will update expected acquired IPR&D expenses if they are incurred during the fourth quarter. We continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses to increase by a high single digit percentage compared to 2022. As a reminder, this includes the one-time legal settlement accrual of $525 million in the second quarter. Excluding this, we continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A expense for 2023 to be down a low single digit percentage compared to 2022. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be $10.5 billion to $10.8 billion as compared to $10.4 billion to $10.9 billion previously, driven by higher R&D expenses offset by higher product sales. Given certain one- time tax benefits in 2023, we now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 16% for the full year. Altogether, we now expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $6.65 and $6.85 per share as compared to $6.45 and $6.80 per share previously. As shown on Slide 28, the chart highlights the continued strength of our business with higher total product sales guidance flowing into the bottom line, which together with the lower expected tax rate more than offsets the higher R&D expenses in the third quarter. On a GAAP basis, our diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.55 and $4.75 per share. Moving to Slide 29, our capital allocation priorities remain focused and unchanged. In the third quarter, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through our dividend and repurchase of shares totaling $3.7 billion year-to-date. In the third quarter, we repaid $2.25 billion of senior notes and issued $2 billion in senior notes maturing in 2033 and 2053. Overall, the third quarter was another solid quarter of commercial and clinical execution in an extremely strong 2023 for Gilead so far. Our planning for 2024 is well underway and we've taken steps in the third quarter to continue to evolve our business model and expense structure to set us up for strong execution next year. 2023 has been a year of considerable investment, notably in R&D and we are excited to finally be at the point where many of our key programs will start reading out data. With that in mind, we are preparing for a catalyst rich 2024 and we look forward to sharing more early next year. With that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A. Hey, Terrence, thanks for the question. Happy to take that. Obviously, in late January or early February, as we customarily do, we'll provide very specific guidance in 2024. What we've said, and I would continue to reiterate, is that as you've seen, our expenses increase over the last couple of years as our portfolio has increased, and again, from our perspective, a very necessary and appropriate increase as we developed what we feel is one of the best and broadest pipelines in the industry, both in virology, oncology, across cell therapy, and at Gilead. We're finally at the level where we're spending on par with our peers, especially on the R&D side. You saw that in the third quarter. So as you think about expenses, going forward, we expect that you will see more moderate growth in expenses over time. We're doing a lot to manage our expenses, as you heard on the last couple of quarters. Maybe the best evidence of that, Terrence, is if you look at our first quarter R&D expenses, our third quarter R&D expenses are essentially flat. So you saw a little bit of a step down from the first quarter. In the second quarter, in the third quarter, we're flat. So you already see that we're kind of, as we said, we're approaching kind of the peak spend, recognizing that we have 60 different clinical programs. If I remember correctly, we have 27 programs in phase, 219 programs in Phase 3. That is very different than the Gilead of prior years that you remember. And it's part of what makes it so excited about where we're going as a company. And the final thing I'd say is you're already seeing the benefits of those investments and the commercial performance that we've talked about for the last two years. So we expect that you will continue to see those benefits in our commercial performance across the entire business, and you're going to see a moderation of expense growth. And again, we'll provide much more specific detail early next year and look forward to talking about this further. Thank you. Hey, Evan, it's Andy. I'll start. And others may want to jump in as. Look I mean, what we've said historically, and I'd reiterate, is we're always going to follow the science. So we are completely committed to virology, not just HIV, but virology broadly. You see that, for instance, with our progress with oral DESCOVY [ph] as well as other programs, we've also said in virology that a lot of what happens in virology happens in our internal research and that there are less opportunities externally to invest in.

We have a much larger oncology organization today, we've increased our internal research and development, and we're still very focused as the third pillar on inflammation. So I would remind people that we have a number of early inflammation programs, including a number in Phase 2 that we're excited about. Merdad highlighted the TROP2 program in his remarks earlier, but that's just one of the programs that we expect to build out over time. So we'll follow the science. We're going to apply capital to each of those areas. If you look back, our capital investment has risen and fallen over time in each of those areas as we've looked at different opportunities. And of course, we're going to continue to invest in cell therapy as part of oncology and more broadly. I should have highlighted that earlier. So the short summary is, we'll follow the science, but all of the areas will receive additional capital over time. Merdad, you want to add anything?"

            "content": "Yes. Happy to. Thank you. So, this is early days, obviously, for the ddBCMA molecule. We have 38 patients worth of data. If I compare it to Carvykti, the population looks more like the LEGEND-2 population. We have 34% extramedillary disease, which is a high risk prognosis patient. And if you look at the LEGEND-2 data, they had 30%. Our overall response rate to date in those 38 patients at 22 months is 100%, and in the LEGEND-2 data is 88% at 25 months. So I do think there is a potential to differentiate on efficacy. We're seeing a differentiation as it relates to the safety profile around the Parkinson syndrome. We are not observing that in any of our patients to date. Obviously, we're going to continue to watch that as we enroll the IMAGINE 1 study and move into our next studies as well. Multiple myeloma is a large market. There is enough room in multiple myeloma to have multiple competitors. But we also feel like we will have a differentiated molecule with Arcellx. So we're looking forward to generating more data and talking to folks about it at ASH."

I'm pleased to share the details of another strong quarter for Gilead and would like to thank the teams that have delivered 10% growth in our base business in the first nine months of 2023. Our third quarter results represent the eight consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in our base business, illustrated strong commercial execution and revenue growth as our virology and oncology products impact more patient lives. In the third quarter of 2023, total product sales excluding Veklury were up 5% to $6.4 billion as shown on Slide 8, with notable growth in our oncology and HIV businesses partially offset our lower HCV sales. Total product sales including Veklury were $7 billion with a solid base business performance contributing $305 million of growth, offset as we expected by lower Veklury sales compared to the same quarter last year. Moving to HIV on Slide 9, the treatment market continued to grow in line with our expectations of 2% to 3% annually. And as we've discussed previously, a favorable pricing dynamics in recent quarters have begun to normalize with HIV sales growth more closely mirroring market and demand growth. This was evident in the third quarter where HIV sales were up 4% year-over-year to $4.7 billion, driven by higher treatment and prevention demand and higher channel inventory, partially offset by lower average realized price due to a shift in channel mix. Sequentially, sales were up 1%. Looking to the full year, we continue to expect HIV product sales to grow slightly more than the 5% reported in 2022. Turning to Slide 10, third quarter Biktarvy sales were $3.1 billion, up 12% year-over-year, driven by higher demand as well as higher channel inventory. Sequentially, sales were up 4%. Once again, Biktarvy gained market share up over 2% year-over-year in the U.S. to over 47% share in the third quarter. Thanks to its robust clinical profile, Biktarvy remains the number one prescribed regimen for new starts and number one in treatment switches across most major markets, including the U.S. Descovy sales in the third quarter were $511 million, up 2% year-over-year with strong year-over-year growth in demand for Descovy for PrEP offset by less favorable pricing dynamics to ensure broad access ahead of the potential launch of lenacapavir as early as late 2025. The U.S. PrEP market grew about 15% year-over-year and Descovy for PrEP continued to maintain more than 40% market share due to its strong clinical profile and despite the availability of other regimens including generics. Moving to the liver disease portfolio on Slide 11, sales were down 10% year-over-year to $706 million, primarily due to the resolution of a rebate claim in HCV recognized in the third quarter of 2022, as well as other pricing dynamics. From a demand perspective, HCV new starts increased compared to the third quarter of 2022 in both the U.S. and Europe, driven by our continued efforts to link HCV patients to care. Given the curative nature of our treatment, we expect HCV new starts to trend down overtime, but are pleased that we are maintaining 50% to 60% market shares in the U.S. and Europe and that our labor portfolio more broadly has stabilized from a revenue perspective. On to Slide 12, Veklury sales continued to be highly variable and declined 31% year-over-year in the third quarter to $636 million. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, sales were up 149%, driven by an uptick in hospitalizations during the third quarter. And over the last few weeks, we have seen a slowdown in COVID related hospitalization. Veklury's strong clinical profile continues to be recognized most recently by the FDA and the European Commission for use in patients with mild-to-severe hepatic impairment. While the COVID environment remains ever changing, Veklury's performance in the third quarter further reinforces its established role as a key part of the standard of care for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Moving to Slide 13, our oncology business achieved another strong quarter with sales up 33% year-over-year to $769 million, representing an annual run rate that now exceeds $3 billion. With clear momentum and a solid infrastructure in place, in addition to our compelling clinical pipeline, we look forward to providing more patients with potentially new and effective options. Looking at Trodelvy on Slide 14, sales were up 58% year-over-year and 9% sequentially to $283 million. As a reminder, Trodelvy is the only approved TROP2-directed antibody drug conjugate and to date, we have delivered this therapy to more than 20,000 patients, reinforcing the clinically meaningful benefit Trodelvy can provide across multiple tumor types. Yes. And maybe just to add to what Merdad said, so we launched Sunlenca, lenacapavir for heavily treatment experience earlier this year. As per Merdad's comments, the label has no contraindication specific to what you were referring to, to opioids or ED drugs and the launch thus far is well underway and access is increasing every day across the U.S., but also other markets including Japan and Europe and we're excited to have an option for these patients that unfortunately have really no other option at this point in time. So very small market opportunity today with the potential for lenacapavir for PrEP as early as late 2025, so very excited as we continue our plans for that. Thank you very much for the question, Diana. I think some of the specific barriers that we're observing are more in the U.S. So I might first talk about what we're observing in Europe where we have socialized medicine. We're seeing uptake as soon as we are granted access and reimbursement. And it goes very quickly into the system, because it's a non-fragmented healthcare system. In the U.S., things look a little bit different given the fragmentation of the healthcare system. So the barriers that we're observing in the U.S. are really our ability to treat patients where they are so moving into community oncology. Today, 80% of oncology patients are seen in the community. Most of our authorized treatment centers exist in large academic hospitals. And so what we're doing for the future, and what we think is going to be very important, is that we're able to have authorized treatment centers in the community closer to patients. So that's one important piece. And we continue to open up new treatment centers in the United States. And in fact, this year we should end with somewhere around 140 treatment centers in the U.S., and that will continue to grow in 2024. I think the second piece for barriers is converting stem cell transplants. So physicians who are transplanting patients, they will have a better outcome via the data if they have CAR-T. And so we're working with transplanters on education and really making sure those patients have access to CAR-T in the earlier lines. I think those are two of the larger barriers that we're observing today. And the last piece, I would say, is the excitement with multiple myeloma therapies coming forward. You can imagine the ATCs now we're seeing both lymphoma patients as well as multiple myeloma patients, and that's causing a crunch within those authorized treatment centers. And that's why it's important in the academic medical centers that we're able to expand the number of beds, and secondly, open new authorized treatment centers that can serve both lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Sure, Chris, thanks for the question. So you're right, as expected. We've seen some of those favorable pricing dynamics that we'd seen in the last couple of quarters, including in 2022, due to the channel mix, kind of begin to normalize, and you should expect to see kind of the same play from Q3 into Q4. One of the reasons for that had to do with some of the channel \u2013 specifically around the channel mix to what you referenced, having to do with some of our government channels being less utilized, where we have higher rebates, and therefore we had pricing [favorability] (ph). We believe a lot of that had to do just stabilization post-COVID around employment rates, inflation, et cetera. So we had benefits that we saw over that probably, I would say four quarters to six quarters or so. And as we kind of shared with you in Q2, we are seeing that normalize out for the second half of this year. And I think you should expect that not only for the next quarter, but then as we go into 2024. And therefore, because of all that, we believe that our HIV sales growth is closely mirroring now more of the market and the demand growth, where we're seeing real strength, both from a market standpoint in treatment and prevention, we're seeing about two points to three points growth in the market when you look at retail and non-retail market, and then, of course, 15% growth in the PrEP market. And then from a demand standpoint, I think obviously with BIKTARVY growing at 12 points year-on-year and DESCOVY continuing to hold on to a very strong share over 40% or so in a competitive market with generics and, of course, new formulations. So more to come as we go into Q4, but hopefully that gives you a better picture of some of the mix of channels. Yes, good question, Adam. So I'm assuming you're referring to some of the data we saw at ESMO with data DXD. We don't believe there is material impact for now anyway, or even in the future for Trodelvy. And the reason for that really has to do with the data itself and the lines of therapy, to your point, I think we've proven very clearly with Trodelvy in second-line TNBC and beyond around the overall survival data that we've shown. And then, of course, showing OS again in HR+/HER2-, although in later lines. I think what we're seeing today in the marketplace is not only are we the leaders in TNBC, we're also leading from an IHC 0 population. And then, of course, looking at sequencing of ADCs posts in HER2, as expected in the HR+/HER2- populations, so quite pleased with our positioning and we don't believe the data that we've seen thus far is going to have a direct impact there. Hey there's a number of things that we have learned over the course of the years with Yescarta and around manufacturing, all of which we're applying that knowledge to the manufacturing of the ddBCMA CAR-T. So we plan to launch that out of our facilities at Kite and expect to have a strong launch again. We will be applying Yescarta learnings. So our goal is to be significantly better than we were at the launch of Yescarta. Sure. Thanks for the question, Brian. I think the way we're looking at lenacapavir, bictegravir in the virologically suppressed really has to do with. We've set the standard of care with Biktarvy, and the opportunity now is to ensure that if for some reason there was a reason to switch Biktarvy from a tolerability profile or anything else that they have an option to go to that has a really interesting combination. Right. When you think about a capsid inhibitor as well as an integrase inhibitor. So for us, it's really about the optionality for patients and making sure that this could offer something a little bit different in the daily oral market. And I do think that this will also be a longer term strategy for us as we think about beyond Biktarvy's LOE in 2033. So I would go there and on the weekly just to start, and then I'll kick it over to Merdad to share with you our plans there. On the weekly oral, it's clear from the patient research that we've done in treatment that we really do see benefit not only the daily oral market, but also in the oral weekly, or even potentially even a little bit longer, as we think about what patients are asking for today. So as much as we're very interested in the long actings that are every three months or every six months. We are also making sure that we meet the needs of patients and their requests as they're looking at for some really don't like any injectables or sub Q, and really looking at that weekly oral as potentially expending a little bit the time they don't think about the fact that they have HIV. So maybe I'll start and then throw it over to Merdad first from a clinical standpoint, what we're thinking from a commercial standpoint, with the data that we saw, I think the standard of care is going to change in first line, clearly, with that data, and we see that as a potential opportunity to actually move up Trodelvy lines of therapy. So right now in the U.S., we do have accelerated approval in the U.S., and we're seeing about 15%, 16% share in bladder cancer, but later lines of therapy. So third line plus, I think with the opportunity to have Padcev kind of move up in the first line setting with Pembro. I think it'll be interesting to see how Trodelvy kind of moves up as we've seen a lot of sequencing from ADCs here as well. So that's in the here and now and maybe Merdad, you want to comment on the clinical development?"

        "content": "Operator: Hello, everyone. Thank you for attending Gilead Sciences' Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sarah and I'll be your moderator today. All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Jacquie Ross, VP of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the second quarter of 2023. The press release, slides, and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Cindy Perettie, the Executive Vice President of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including those related to Gilead's business, financial condition, and results of operations, plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections and the use of capital, and 2023 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the Company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplemental data sheet, as well as on the Gilead website. With that I'll turn the call over to Dan.\nDaniel O'Day: Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. As always, we appreciate you taking the time to catch up with Gilead in the midst of a busy earnings period. This was another very strong quarter for Gilead in terms of both business performance and clinical execution. Thank you to the Gilead teams that drove this progress with their dedication to improving the health of individuals and communities worldwide. Total product sales excluding Veklury grew 11% year-over-year and closed a very strong first half performance in the base business. As we look to the full year, we are increasing guidance for total product sales. We now expect even stronger growth in our base business of 6.5% to 8%, which is expected to more than offset our revised expectations for Veklury. As a result, our guidance for base business product sales has increased $550 million at the mid-point. In the second quarter, HIV contributed about two-thirds of the $615 million growth in our core business, growing 9% year-over-year. Oncology grew 38% year-over-year, and with product sales of $728 million in the second quarter, now has an annual run rate of approximately $3 billion. Moving to clinical progress, the second quarter was very active on the regulatory front, with approvals, positive opinions or recommendations for six of our therapies Trodelvy, Yescarta, Tecartus, Sunlenca, Hepcludex, and Veklury. This regulatory progress highlights the strength of our increasingly diverse portfolio. It also reflects the ability of our teams to successfully navigate regulatory processes across the therapeutic areas and key geographies with speed and efficiency. In addition to this progress, we shared positive pipeline updates at ASCO, which included overall survival data for Yescarta, the only large B-cell lymphoma cell therapy to demonstrate significant overall survival benefit versus standard of care in the second-line setting, promising Trodelvy data in endometrial cancer, reinforcing our belief in Trodelvy as a cornerstone asset with pan-tumor potential, an updated TIGIT data from the full study population of ARC-7, establishing domvanalimab's proof-of-concept in lung cancer. We have also shared long-term data for Hepcludex for hepatitis delta virus showing improved response rates at Week-96 compared to Week-48. These data support new guidelines recommending Hepcludex for people living with chronic HDV in the EU. With a broad portfolio of novel mechanisms and a commitment to pursuing areas of high unmet need, we know that some pipeline setbacks are to be expected. As we announced last month, we have discontinued the Phase 3 ENHANCE study in Higher-Risk MDS due to futility and a second interim analysis. As you know, MDS is one of the most intractable forms of blood cancer and we are disappointed that the study was not able to deliver new hope for patients with the disease. We will take a thorough data-driven approach regarding next steps as we carry out the ongoing analysis of magrolimab. Overall, we were executing well on our clinical commitments and our current performance speaks to the strength of our combined oncology portfolio. We have a rich pipeline of activity in the second half, including an initial look at a subset of EVOKE-02 data on Trodelvy plus pembro in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Before, I hand over to Johanna, I'd like to welcome Cindy Perettie, our Head of Cell Therapy to her first Gilead earnings conference call. Cindy has now been with Gilead for two months and brings a wealth of oncology and leadership experience from Roche, Foundation Medicine, and the Sarah Cannon Research Institute. We're delighted to have Cindy join our Gilead leadership team and it's great to have her with us on the call today. With that, I'll hand the call over to Johanna for a discussion of our commercial results. Johanna?\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter was another strong quarter for Gilead with solid performance across our commercial portfolio, leading to an increase in our full year expectations for both the base and overall business. For the second quarter of 2023, as shown on slide seven, total product sales excluding Veklury grew 11% year-over-year to $6.3 billion with year-over-year growth in each of our core franchises. This represents the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for our base business, reinforcing the strength of our Virology and Oncology portfolios. The strong growth more than offset the decline in Veklury sales, which were as expected given the lower hospitalizations. Altogether, total product sales including Veklury was $6.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Starting with HIV on slide eight. Second quarter sales of $4.6 billion were up 9% year-over-year, driven by higher average realized price in part due to channel mix and higher demand, partially offset by lower channel inventory. Quarter-over-quarter, sales were up 10%, driven by favorable pricing and inventory build following the typical first quarter dynamics. Overall, the global HIV treatment market continues to grow in line with our expectations of 2% to 3% annually. Specifically in the US, the market overall grew more than 2% in the first half of the year compared to the first half of 2022, reflecting growth in the non-retail channels more than offsetting a roughly flat retail market. HIV product sales grew 11% in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022, helped by favorable pricing dynamics, including the phasing of certain government purchases and channel mix. Looking forward, we expect HIV product sales growth to more closely mirror market growth in the second half. Therefore, we are increasing our full year expectations for HIV and now expect full year HIV product growth for 2023 to be modestly higher than the 5% we reported in 2022. Turning to slide nine. Biktarvy sales of $3 billion were up 17% year-over-year, driven by higher demand and favorable pricing dynamics, partially offset by lower channel inventory. With a market share up almost 3% year-over-year in the US, Biktarvy remains the treatment of choice for HIV with more than 46% market share. This represents the 20th consecutive quarter of share gains in the US, with the year-over-year growth rate that has once again outpaced new and existing regimens. Similarly, we continue to see solid share gains across other major markets as Biktarvy maintains its leading position for new starts as well as for those switching therapies. Descovy sales were $516 million, up 12% year-over-year. With awareness and utilization of HIV prevention higher than ever, the US market grew once again. And amidst this growth, we're pleased to see strong demand for Descovy for PrEP, up 14% year-over-year in the US, with a strong market share that has remained over 40%. With this strong foundation, we look forward to potentially adding lenacapavir as a six-monthly subcutaneous option for prevention as early as 2025. Moving to the liver disease portfolio on Slide 10, sales were up 4% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter to $711 million. We remain committed to eliminating HCV globally with our market-leading portfolio of medicines and our efforts to increase awareness contributed to higher patient starts in the US, Europe, and Asia in the second quarter. HBV and HDV also contributed to growth in the liver disease portfolio, driven by higher demand. Liver disease remains an important part of our portfolio, benefiting hundreds of thousands of patients. We're pleased to have received full marketing authorization for Hepcludex in HDV in Europe, a further recognition of the benefit this medicine brings to patients who have very limited therapeutic options. Across our portfolio of HCV, HBV, and HDV products, the liver disease contribution to our commercial performance continues to stabilize overall to a run rate of more than $2.5 billion in sales a year. On to slide 11. Veklury sales declined in the second quarter as expected, reflecting lower hospitalization rates, with sales of $256 million, down 43% year-over-year. For those patients hospitalized and treated for COVID-19, a majority continued to receive Veklury, a testament to Veklury's robust clinical profile. Most recently, this has included decisions by the US-FDA and the European Commission to expand Veklury's indication to reach patients with renal impairment including those on dialysis. Moving to Oncology on slide 12, it is remarkable to observe that in less than five years, our oncology business has grown from less than $300 million and is now approaching an annualized run rate of $3 billion, with tens of thousands of patients treated with Gilead and Kite oncology therapies to date. Beyond our well-established leadership in cell therapy, we have the only TROP2-directed ADC on the market with Trodelvy, and combined, our oncology portfolio extends the options for patients in eight indications. Looking in more detail at Trodelvy on slide 13, sales were up 63% year-over-year and 17% sequentially to $260 million, representing an annual run rate that exceeds $1 billion. We continue to be very pleased with the launch in pre-treated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, with strong awareness of our approval in US. We look forward to reaching even more patients in Europe following last week's marketing authorization from the European Commission. Additionally, we're beginning discussions with health authorities in Japan, with plans to file for approval in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer later this year. With a strong field force in place and robust datasets across multiple tumor types, Trodelvy remains well-positioned to maintain and expand its reach, and Gilead continues to build on our experience in breast and bladder cancers with a view to other indications over time, as the development program evolves. Turning to Cell Therapy on slide 14, sales in the second quarter were $469 million, up 27% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter. Yescarta showed continued growth with sales up 29% year-over-year to $380 million, primarily driven by strong underlying demand in the second and third-line settings for relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, both in existing, as well as new markets. Tecartus sales were $88 million, up 21% year-over-year, reflecting increased demand for relapsed or refractory adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as well as mantle cell lymphoma, primarily outside the US. We are excited about the opportunity ahead as the body of evidence supporting broader adoption of cell therapies continues to grow. The work that Kite has been leading to raise awareness in the adoption of cell therapy will be accelerated by other providers as they ramp up their manufacturing capabilities. This overall expansion in supply will predictably impact our market share in the near term, but overall class share is the most important driver of our business over time. As cell therapy is offered and delivered to more patients, we are confident that Kite cell therapies will remain differentiated in terms of our manufacturing reliability and efficacy. Wrapping up the second quarter, I'd like to acknowledge the commercial teams and our partners across Gilead and Kite that once again delivered an extremely strong performance, reflecting both solid execution and a compelling portfolio of Gilead products that positively impacts millions of people around the world. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline. Merdad?\nMerdad Parsey: Thank you, Joanna. I'm pleased to highlight the ongoing progress our teams have made with 64 ongoing clinical programs and 21 Phase 3 trails. Notably, we presented multiple positive data readouts at medical conferences in the second quarter, such as updated overall survival data for Trodelvy in pre-treated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, OS data for Yescarta in second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, and long-term data from blabber tied in HDV. As we move into the second half of 2023, we remain focused on execution, investing in capabilities to increase our productivity and portfolio prioritization. We also look-forward to sharing an update on Trodelvy in non-small cell lung cancer, including EVOKE-02 data at World Conference on Lung Cancer in September. Turning first to Virology on slide 16, we are proud of the role Gilead has played in transforming HIV care. We continue to innovate based on our commitment to both the HIV community and to those who could benefit from prevention regimen with our ongoing work to do over new effective and convenient options. The unique profile of lenacapavir, our first-in class capsid inhibitor enables the eight prevention and treatment clinical programs, we're focused on. In HIV treatment the ARTISTRY-1 trial evaluating oral once daily bictegravir and lenacapavir your combination regimen. It's progressing well. We expect to provide an update on the Phase 2 portion of the study later this year. This novel regimen aims to provide an effective and simpler regimen for the 6% to 8% a biologically suppressed individuals who are currently on complex multi tablet regimens to manage their HIV. We continue to advance in our goal of providing longer-acting HIV treatment options through the development of lenacapavir combination regimens with integrase inhibitors, NRTIs and NNRTI as well as the Phase 2 study of our two broadly neutralizing antibodies. In HIV prevention, recruitment for our Phase 3 PURPOSE-1/-2 clinical trials evaluating every six months single-agent subcutaneous lenacapavir continues to exceed our expectations in the second quarter. We look-forward to potentially providing a data update in late 2024, to early 2025 timeframe as we target approval in late 2025. Moving on to slide 17, I'm pleased to note that the European Association for the Study of the Liver or EASL has updated its HDV guidelines to recommend that all patients in the EU with chronic HDV infection, should be considered for antiviral treatments. Recently Hepcludex was granted full approval by the European commission remains the only approved therapy for chronic HCV infection in the EU. The updated guidelines were supported by Hepcludex 's 48-week data which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in June. Gilead also presented data demonstrating the 96-week treatment with bulevirtide improved biologic and biochemical responses with no evidence of treatment-emergent resistance, including those who were previously non or partial responders. These data reinforce our confidence in bulevirtide and its potentially longer-term benefit for patients with HDV. As a reminder, bulevirtide is not yet approved in the US. Turning to Oncology on slide 18. Trodelvy remains the first and only approved TROP2-directed ADC with indications across three tumor types. It's also the only TROP2-directed ADC to show overall survival benefit versus chemotherapy in two tumor types. We've now treated over 20,000 patients and evaluate more than 2300 patients in our clinical trials. Trodelvy's robust dataset informs a well-characterized safety profile with low discontinuation rates observed across multiple indications and no required increasing monitoring for severe interstitial lung disease. At ASCO, we presented additional data demonstrating Trodelvy's potential, including in pre-treated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. We presented the final analysis from our Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 trial supporting the marketing authorization we just received from the European Commission last week. In bladder cancer, we shared an analysis of TROPHY-U-01 supporting Trodelvy's efficacy in post-platinum post-IO metastatic urothelial cancer across a range of TROP-2 expression. With our accelerated approval in bladder cancer, we hope to provide a data update from the ongoing confirmatory Phase 3 TROPiCS-04 trail and initiate global filings for Trodelvy in metastatic urothelial cancer by the end of next year. In heavily pre-treated endometrial cancer, we presented promising efficacy data from our Phase 2 TROPiCS-03 Basket trial, demonstrating the expanding pan-tumor potential of Trodelvy. Moving to slide 19, our comprehensive clinical development program in non-small cell lung cancer includes several signal-seeking and ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials. We know non-small cell lung cancer is not only an area of significant unmet need, as the number-one cause of cancer-related death, but also an area we believe Trodelvy has the potential to transform standard-of-care as a combination partner to an IO backbone in the first-line setting, as well as a single-agent in the post-IO setting. On slide 20, we highlight the growing number of lung-related catalysts. I'm particularly excited to highlight that we've added a new milestone with a preliminary readout from our Phase 2 EVOKE-02 trial at the World Conference on Lung Cancer. This study is evaluating Trodelvy plus pembrolizumab, with or without chemo in first-line non-small cell lung cancer. We will be sharing data from the first two cohorts evaluating Trodelvy in combination with pembro in PD-L1 high and PD-L1 low patients. The abstract, expected to be released later in August, will be an initial subset of a small number of patients. Our presentation scheduled for Sunday, September 10th at World Lung will include data at a later cut-off date with more patients. Turning to domvanalimab, or dom, on slide 21, we presented data from the last interim analysis of the full 150 patients enrolled in the Phase 2 ARC-7 study at ASCO in June. The data continued to show consistent and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival in first-line PD-L1 high non-small cell lung cancer, when dom, our Fc-silent anti-TIGIT is combined with an investigational anti-PD1 agent as compared to the PD1 inhibitor alone. These data form the basis for our dom program encompassing Phase 3 trials in first-line non-small cell lung cancer and upper GI cancers. Moving to cell therapy on slide 22. Yescarta continues to strengthen its position as a cell therapy of choice for large B-cell lymphoma. At ASCO in June, we presented overall survival data from the landmark Phase 3 ZUMA-7 trial of Yescarta in second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. At a median follow-up of four years, a one-time treatment with Yescarta demonstrated a statistically significant longer overall survival compared to standard-of-care with a 27% reduction in risk of death, representing a 38% relative improvement. Moreover, the majority of the patients in the standard-of-care arm eventually received a cell therapy off protocol. And of those, 77% received Yescarta. Overall, Yescarta is the first treatment in nearly 30 years to demonstrate a significant improvement in survival for this patient population, and these data add to the growing body of evidence that position cell therapy as potentially curative in some populations. With a strong pipeline of six ongoing Phase 2 and 3 trials across lines of therapy, new tumor types, and earlier-stage assets, Kite continues to innovate and execute on expanding the potential benefit of cell therapies to new patients, both through internal or acquired innovation and through collaborations. We are working closely with one of these partners, Arcellx, to support their efforts regarding the IMAGINE-1 clinical hold. We remain confident in the therapeutic profile for CAR-T ddBCMA and IMAGINE-1 trial based on the data demonstrated to date, and sharing Arcellx's commitment to delivering this novel therapy to multiple myeloma patients. Turning to slide 23, we highlight our progress against key clinical milestones for 2023 so far. We are of course disappointed by the outcome of the interim analysis of the ENHANCE trial evaluating magrolimab in higher-risk MDS, given the need for treatment options. We will continue to monitor and report on the other magrolimab trials. Importantly, while not every trial will be positive, our efforts at building a well-diversified portfolio gives us multiple opportunities to improve the lives of patients. We're excited about our momentum in making oncology and inflammation important contributors to our future and continue to make strong progress on delivering our key clinical catalysts for this year. Beyond our near-term milestones, I'd also like to highlight our growing pipeline of early-stage inflammation assets, including our oral alpha 4 beta 7 and the progression of our IRAK4 inhibitor that had asserted into Phase 2, as well as the advancement of the BTLA agonist program from the MiroBio acquisition into Phase 1. We are excited by this differentiated inflammation pipeline and the potential to impact important gaps in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Overall, we believe we have a very ambitious clinical portfolio that is well-diversified across indications and stage. We look forward to updating you as we progress through 2023. With that I'll hand the call over to Andy. Andy?\nAndrew Dickinson: Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to slide 25 and as you heard from Dan and Joanna, our base business continued to perform very well in the second quarter, with total product sales excluding Veklury up 11% year-over-year, driven by growth across all of our product families. FX was still a headwind, albeit more modest, impacting growth by approximately one percentage point. Total product sales were $6.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year, as strong execution in our base business more than offset the lower Veklury sales, as well as FX impact of $82 million. Moving to the rest of the P&L, on a non-GAAP basis, on slide 26. Product gross margin was 86.9%, up 131 basis points from last year. R&D was $1.4 billion, up 25% year-over-year, due to higher expenses associated with our broad clinical pipeline, including the acceleration of certain late-stage clinical studies. As a reminder, we have 21 ongoing Phase 3 trials, highlighting the investments we continue to make in Gilead's near and long-term growth profile. As mentioned earlier this year, we will continue to manage expenses carefully. And in R&D, with a number of significant mid to late-stage trials ongoing, we'll continue to follow the science, pivoting investment if and when the data warrants. Acquired IPR&D was $236 million, reflecting the XinThera acquisition and expansion of the Arcus collaboration into inflammation, in addition to milestone payments associated with ongoing partnerships. SG&A was $1.8 billion, up 45% year-over-year, including a $525 million legal accrual for settlements with certain plaintiffs in the HIV antitrust litigation as well as increased commercial activities in oncology and HIV. Excluding the legal settlement accrual, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $1.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Moving to tax. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 21%. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.34 in the second quarter of 2023, including approximately $0.32 of expense associated with the legal settlement accrual, partially offset by higher product sales. This compared to $1.58 of earnings for the same period last year. Overall, we had a very strong first half. And as highlighted on slide 27, with solid performance in each of our core franchises across virology and oncology, driving 13% year-over-year growth excluding Veklury. Given these strong first half results, we have updated our full year sales guidance. Moving to slide 28, we now expect total product sales in the range of $26.3 billion to $26.7 billion, up from $26 billion to $26.5 billion previously. We expect total product sales excluding Veklury in the range of $24.6 billion to $25 billion, up from $24 billion to $24.5 billion previously. This new range represents growth of 6.5% to 8% for our base business year-over-year, compared to 4% to 6% previously. On Veklury, the second quarter and first half were below our internal expectations. Based on COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations to date, we have lowered our guidance for the full year to approximately $1.7 billion to bring second half expectations more in line with our first half experience. As a reminder, Veklury is highly correlated with COVID-related hospitalizations and as such, it's utilization remains variable. We will share another update with you on our third quarter call. Moving to the rest of the P&L. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 86%. There is also no change to our non-GAAP R&D guidance, where we expect expenses to increase by a low-double-digit percent compared to 2022. Reflecting the one-time legal settlement accrual of $525 million in the second quarter, we now expect non-GAAP SG&A expense to increase a high-single-digit percent compared to 2022. Excluding this legal settlement accrual, non-GAAP SG&A expense for 2023 is expected to be down low-single-digit percentage compared to 2022, consistent with our prior guidance. Non-GAAP acquired IPR&D has been updated to reflect the XinThera acquisition and expanded Arcus collaboration, adding about $200 million or $0.17 per share. For 2023, we now expect acquired IPR&D to be approximately $900 million, reflecting previously committed acquired IPR&D amounts, as well as known milestone payments from existing collaborations. Similar to prior quarters, we will continue to include expected acquired IPR&D expenses if we announce additional transactions over the course of the year. We now expect non-GAAP operating income in the range of $10.4 billion to $10.9 billion, or roughly $650 million lower at the mid-point, due to the $525 million one-time legal settlement accrual and $200 million in additional acquired IPR&D expense, neither of which were reflected in our previous full year guidance. Moving to tax. We now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 17%, reflecting an expected decrease in our tax reserves for the second half of the year. Altogether, we now expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $6.45 and $6.80 per share, down from $6.60 and $7 previously as shown on slide 29. The chart illustrates the underlying strength of our business with the higher product sales guidance flowing through to the bottom-line, in addition to lower expected tax rate. This is however offset by both acquired IPR&D at $0.17 per share and the legal settlement accrual of $0.32 per share in nonrecurring cost. On a GAAP basis, we expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.50 and $4.85. Moving to slide 30, you can see that there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through our dividend and repurchase of shares. We believe we have built a strong pipeline that will enable Gilead to deliver near and long-term growth. And of course, we'll continue to remain opportunistic as we look to access high-quality assets through partnerships or make smaller acquisitions in the normal course of business. We remain committed to growing our dividend and to using share repurchases, primarily to offset equity dilution. Although, we will also be opportunistic from time to time. With that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nGeoff Meacham: Guys thanks so much for the question. Just maybe a quick one for Dan or for Andy, you guys have had an aspiration to have about a third of total revenue from hematology, oncology. I wasn't sure how big of a role magrolimab played in those assumptions. And if it was a small amount, where do you see opportunities in the pipeline that you think the street perhaps is underappreciating? Thank you very much.\nDaniel O'Day: Hey Geoff, I'll start and then turn it over to Andy, but thank you very much for the question. I want to be clear that we continue to be on track to meet our goal of oncology representing one-third of our 2030 revenues and that's on top of a growing HIV business overall. I'll just remind the team here that our portfolio is very broad. It's more than doubled since a few years ago in quantity and many-fold on a quality risk-adjusted basis as well. We have novel mechanisms and technologies and approaches across many indications precisely to allow for the fact that not every clinical card is going to turn over favorably. And Andy why don't -- I'll let you add on to that, in terms of what we -- what our initial assumptions were around a third.\nAndrew Dickinson: Sir, Hi Geoff, good to hear from you, and thank you for the question. You may recall that historically we've talked about this, we've highlighted that, that assumption is really tied to the cell therapy business and to Trodelvy and that we have a complete belief that we're going to get there based on those two franchises alone. Magrolimab and TIGIT and the rest of the oncology pipeline provide additional upside. So just reiterating what Dan said, we continue to be on track to meet the goal of our oncology business representing a third of our total revenue by 2030 and we remain excited about the breadth of our oncology portfolio and the exceptional progress that you see in cell therapy, and Trodelvy, which combined, as you heard in the prepared remarks, are on track to produce $3 billion of revenue roughly this year.\nJacquie Ross: Yes. May we have our next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nChris Schott: On Trodelvy and the EVOKE-02 data, can you just help set some expectations for the profile that we'll see from that at World Lung? I guess specifically, would just be interested in your thoughts on what we should anticipate in terms of the ILD profile in this setting, as well as your thoughts on a potential TROP-2 expression biomarker-driven approach that your competitor has alluded to post their data. Thanks so much.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Chris. Over to Merdad, please.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes. We are looking forward to sharing those data. And as you can imagine, we're under embargo, so I can't share too many details until the presentation comes out and the abstract itself will come out I think in mid-August, so very shortly and that initial abstract will represent a relatively small dataset from EVOKE-02 and then there'll be more data at the time of the presentation in mid-September, so in terms of what's coming. In terms of ILD, across our programs, including all the clinical trials, we have not seen ILD to-date. We don't screen for ILD in our clinical trials, nor in the clinical practice. So, at this time, we have not seen anything from -- in an ILD standpoint. And then in terms of TROP-2 expression, as a matter of course, we are measuring TROP-2 expression in -- in all of our trials as we go forward and looking to see if we see correlations between TROP-2 expression and efficacy, and to date, we've not seen a correlation. We've seen great efficacy across TROP-2 expression levels in the tumors that we've studied today. Now that may change with different tumor types. But to date, we have not seen a correlation with TROP-2 expression on those. So, we're optimistic for that and keep to continue. I would not expect to see TROP-2 data in this upcoming dataset. It's -- this is an early dataset and those data usually trail -- the Trop-02 expression data usually trail the clinical trials.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you. May we have our next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\nTyler Van Buren: Hey guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Another one on Trodelvy, it looks like we're seeing a bit of a quarter-over-quarter inflection. So, would you say this is attributed primarily to the HR+/HER2- launch? And do you believe this is the beginning of a new sustainable trend?\nDaniel O'Day: Great, Tyler. Yes, over to Johanna, please.\nJohanna Mercier: Hi, Tyler. Yes, we are very pleased with the results and the early signs that we've seen from the recent launch of HR+/HER2- in the US. We've definitely seen as you say, an inflection point, so we've seen a really strong uptake in this setting. We're also kind of building on the foundation of triple-negative breast cancer where we are the standard-of-care here as well, and we're excited about the fact that Europe and the EC just gave approval for HR+/HER2- in Europe. So, building on the success of TNBC and we've seen strong uptake in Europe for TNBC. So, there's also a piece of that for the Trodelvy business performance. And we're excited to see what we can do with HR+/HER2- in Europe as well. So, we do think this is definitely on the right path from a growth standpoint and very exciting times for Trodelvy and breast cancer patients.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you, Tyler. May we have our next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Terrence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nTerrence Flynn: Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. This one's for Johanna. I read that there is -- CMS could propose to have Medicare cover prep. Just wondering if you have any insight on the likelihood here and timing and then could you help us think about the size of that population? Thank you.\nJohanna Mercier: Yes, so thanks for the question. I think you're referring to the National Coverage Determination, the NCD, right, preparation for prep?\nJacquie Ross: Yes.\nJohanna Mercier: I'm assuming. And that's really just because the -- right now it currently only supports oral drugs and there is an opportunity for us to add injectable drugs and I think that was a we request to CMS and so we're very supportive of course and we believe the path is actually quite central to ending HIV epidemic and fully put -- fully support the CMS proposal. As from a timing standpoint, that probably hopefully in the coming quarters that we should see something come out, but I don't have details on that, but I do think it can only help what we're trying to do in HIV prevention, let alone support as we think of launching the potential launch for lenacapavir here in 2025.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you. May we have our next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist. Please proceed.\nBill Jahangiri: Hi, this is Bill Jahangiri on for Robyn. Thanks for taking our question, and congrats on all the progress. I had a question about TIGIT, and since you began the ARC studies, have you learned anything by way of expression of TIGIT CD155 or any other potential prognostic biomarkers in the tumor microenvironment, that would warrant further development of dom in the upper GI indications, even if SKY1 would fail?\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks for the question. As I understand it, I think the question is around predictors of response as it relates to the upper GI setting. What I would say is, we of course are following biomarkers. As I mentioned, with TROP2, we are looking for biomarkers of responsiveness to various markers that could predict TIGIT responsiveness. Our interest in the upper GI is of course based on TIGIT expression levels in tumor samples and things like that outside of the clinical trials, but more based on clinical data that we -- that we've seen and others have seen for the efficacy of TIGIT in upper GI tumors. And so we'll of course across the programs be looking for any potential markers for predictive response.\nJacquie Ross: And may we have our next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nBrian Abrahams: Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. Maybe a question on magrolimab. Do you have any preliminary thoughts on why the trial in high-risk MDS was not successful, just given the encouraging early data and I guess what indications are you most optimistic, the drug could still be successful in going forward? Thanks.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Brian. Well, I mean I think you can imagine, we are looking thoroughly at the data and the trigger for this was a futility analysis centered on overall survival. We will of course update as we generate data and look at all those, we'll make those -- that information publicly available. To your point, the -- we're fairly far along in our AML trials. And as you know, we have some studies going on in solid tumors, and we believe that there are a number of factors that could determine success or failure in these various settings and each of these settings is represented slightly in different biological experiments. So we are going to continue to look broadly at what -- what we've learned from the initial data. We're going to continue to talk with the regulators and the IRBs in the near term and then we'll update you as we proceed down that path with where we're going to go, but we continue our efforts right now, hoping that magrolimab could have an effect in other diseases outside of MDS. MDS is a uniquely challenging indication and we feel -- we were hoping we could bring a benefit to those patients and we're disappointed that we can't do that.\nJacquie Ross: May we have our next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Please proceed.\nCarter Gould: Great. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. As you talked about sort of the hematology portfolio, one thing you guys didn't talk on much today is sort of the ddBCMA and it being a clinical hold, your partner has talked about investigator conduct and bridging therapy being issues, are you sort of in agreement with that characterization and to what extent your sort of timely addressing of the clinical hold, critical to your underlying thesis behind the product? Thank you.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Carter. This gives us a chance for all a chance to hear from Cindy for the first time with Gilead. Cindy, over to you, please.\nCindy Perettie: Thanks a lot, Carter, for the question. I think, first, it might be helpful if I can provide a little context associated with the clinical hold. On June 16th, the FDA did notify Arcellx that it was placing the CAR-T ddBCMA IND on clinical hold. That was following a patient death. The patient was treated with the ddBCMA our CAR-T and despite becoming ineligible for treatment under the trial protocol, due to the fact that they developed a secondary malignancy before the time of infusion, so they would have not been allowed technically to be on protocol. After infusing that patient, they subsequently mismanaged I would say the manner in which the protocol specified treatment of adverse events. And so we are continuing to partner with Arcellx on this. We are very confident in the molecule. We're confident in the IMAGINE-1 study design and we're looking at ways in which we can partner with Arcellx to enhance protocol adherence. All of the clinical sites to date have been retrained, so that we can again ensure that protocol adherence. And additionally, the FDA has allowed Arcellx to dose patients who had gone through lymphodepletion while on clinical hold. So again, we remain confident that the therapeutic profile of ddBCMA CAR-T and the IMAGINE-1 trial is going to be successful I think based on the data demonstrated to date. So, our commitment in delivering that therapy to patients globally is still there for multiple myeloma.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you. Tia, may we have our next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. [Technical difficulty]\nJacquie Ross: Salveen, we're not -- we're not hearing you very well. Maybe just try one more time. Salveen, maybe you can try and dial in on a different line. Salveen, you still there?\nMatthew Dellatorre: Hey guys, can you hear me? This is Matt on for Salveen.\nJacquie Ross: Yes, we can hear you perfectly.\nMatthew Dellatorre: Okay, great. So Daiichi is expected to share full data from the Phase 3 TROPION-Lung01 study later this year. Could you guys just share what you're focused on from a competitive standpoint? And then in terms of read-through to Trodelvy? Thank you.\nMerdad Parsey: Sure. This is Merdad. Thanks for the question. So, as you know, our program is relatively broad and pushing forward in lung cancer as well. As I mentioned earlier, we'll be presenting our frontline data in EVOKE-02 -- preliminary frontline data from the EVOKE-02 study. And I think that will help provide everyone sort of benchmarking in terms of how Trodelvy is doing in that setting. And then what we'll be looking for I think is consistent with what our belief is for Trodelvy in the second line, which is that patients in second-line are sicker, they tend to have -- they are more difficult to manage and they are more challenging in terms of outcomes, so we are hopeful that we will see a benefit in those patients in terms of outcomes, particularly PFS and OS. So we will keep ourselves -- keep you updated on the progress of the EVOKE-01 study in the second-line as well. And we're pretty confident that we'll be in where we want to be. Our underlying hypothesis remains that we will have comparable efficacy and that we will have a better tolerability profile with Trodelvy. So, we're very confident with where we're headed.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you, Tia, may we have our next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from Colin Bristow with UBS. Please proceed.\nColin Bristow: Hey, good afternoon, and congrats on the quarter. So the [indiscernible] trial is expected to read out in the near-term. I'm just curious on to get your thoughts really on how you view this from a sort of competitive threat standpoint? Thank you.\nJacquie Ross: I think you may just have answered that question.\nJohanna Mercier: So, maybe I'll pick it up. So thanks for the question, Colin. We are -- we have been expecting that data. We're off to -- very pleased with what we've seen thus far with Trodelvy and I think that's the piece that's important here. I think Trodelvy's positioning in the marketplace both in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and second-line as the standard-of-care in that setting is very well established with an opportunity to continue to make sure people move up the lines of therapy because they still use it in the third and fourth line setting when there is still an opportunity to displace chemotherapies. I think as we've seen with other ADCs in the breast cancer market, I think it does -- it's really healthy awareness of the benefits of ADCs. And with Trodelvy, is overall survival, both in triple-negative breast cancer as well as in HR+/HER2-, I do think it sets up Trodelvy incredibly well and we've seen also ADC sequencing either from in HER2 to Trodelvy or Trodelvy to in HER2. I think as a third ADC comes to market, I think it might be a little bit more challenging in light of some of the positioning that's already there, but I do think for patients, this is a great thing. I also think the safety profile that Merdad mentioned just a little bit earlier, is also something to consider when you think about a safety profile with Trodelvy where you're looking at neutropenia and diarrhea, which are very much in line with other chemotherapies already on the market marketplace, so the physicians are very confident in how to treat versus bringing in something like ILD is going to be a little bit more concerning. So, more to come and I guess we'll wait to see the data, but today, in the field today, I think Trodelvy is definitely making a difference for the patients. Merdad, did you want to add anything?\nMerdad Parsey: No. You hit it all.\nColin Bristow: Thank you, Johanna.\nJacquie Ross: Tia, may we have our next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, all. Thank you so much for taking my question. With I believe it's the third anniversary of the Immunomedics deal nearing us, can you walk us through how you look look-forward to BD, you've digested at that, but are you looking at oncology, inflammation elsewhere? Thank you.\nDaniel O'Day: Yes, Andy, do you want to start with it?\nAndrew Dickinson: Sure. Hi, Evan, thank you for the question. Look, I'd say, we continue to be very active in BD as you'd expect, across both Gilead and Kite. And that's across all of our areas of focus. So, again, oncology, inflammation, and virology. As we've said before, there are fewer virology opportunities externally. We have an incredibly robust pipeline and extraordinary research group. We're building out our research groups at Kite and at Gilead in oncology and inflammation. We're excited about the progress that we're making there. We're still going to be active in the outside. That being said, what you should expect over the next five years is different than what you saw over the last five years. So, using Immunomedics as an example, that's a deal that we continue to be very excited about. You've heard all the excitement about Trodelvy and where we are today with the franchise, where we see it going. But that was a unique point in time where we really needed an anchor molecule to build our oncology business around. We will continue to look at commercial assets, but you should expect consistent with what you saw last year, that our focus is predominantly on ordinary course partnerships and smaller acquisitions. Again, we will be opportunistic, we will look for ways to build our franchise and to create value for shareholders, but that's the base-case expectation.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you. May we have our next question, Tia?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Catanzaro with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\nJoseph Catanzaro: Hi, everybody. Thanks so much for taking my question. I actually had a question on the XinThera acquisition and just wondering if you could share your thoughts around the plans and timelines for their PARP-1 selective inhibitor and whether in the future, there is opportunity to potentially combine it with Trodelvy given some preclinical data that supports that approach? Thanks.\nDaniel O'Day: Yes, that's -- I think you hit the nail on the head. We are moving forward aggressively, not sure we've disclosed the timelines yet, but we're moving forward aggressively with our efforts to move that program into the clinic and as you say, I think a key potential for the -- that PARP inhibitor is in combination with Trodelvy and -- and combining those two agents to hopefully bring better outcomes to patients. So, we will update as we go along. I think things are things are progressing very nicely there.\nJacquie Ross: Tia, next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question and welcome and congrats, Cindy on your new role. Maybe if I can ask a question to Andy, regarding -- so you have clinical trials going on in oncology especially, how should we think about the operating margin evolution from here? If I take-out the one-time items as well as IPR&D, it seems like about 45% in the first half of the year, is that a good -- good number, good proxy to go with or how should we think about it in the next few years?\nAndrew Dickinson: Hi, Mohit, thanks. Thanks for the question. This is an important -- an important point. What we said and we continue to believe is, we have an exceptionally strong business with a lot of leverage, a highly efficient structure, a lot of leverage in our model. We've historically had industry-leading operating margins and we certainly expect to have that in the future. We also have said and acknowledged that we're in a unique point in time as we've built-out both our R&D portfolio and our sales and marketing team with the move into oncology, where our expenses have increased in the short-run and we expect over the coming year for the expense -- the expense increases to moderate and we expect that you'll continue to see the strong growth that you've seen in our base business the last couple of years. So again, this is kind of our strategy playing out, where you see the extraordinary progress in the base business growth last year, certainly through this year, you see that with the raised guidance for the base business, we expect to carry that momentum going forward. Of course, we don't provide long-term guidance. And we as we've highlighted, have 21 late-stage Phase 3 clinical studies underway. We will get to a point over the coming quarters and years where our expense growth moderates and you should see a lot of that carry to the bottom line so. And I think the way that you've characterized the operating margin in the second quarter is it is entirely consistent with the way that I see it and we don't provide long-term guidance beyond saying that we expect to have a top-tier operating margin going forward and we think we're in a great place to achieve that goal. Thank you.\nJohanna Mercier: Thank you. I think we have time for one last question, Tia.\nOperator: Our last question today comes from Simon Baker with Redburn. Please proceed.\nSimon Baker: Thanks for taking my question. With respect to recent developments within the CAR-T space in non-oncology indications such as lupus. I was just interested to know what your perspectives are on the strategic clinical and commercial opportunities for cell therapy outside oncology. Thanks so much.\nJohanna Mercier: Thank you very much for the question, Simon. Similar to you, we are very intrigued also by the data that we're seeing in places like autoimmune disease, the lupus, and it's something of great interest to us. We have established ourselves in oncology certainly and expanded into multiple myeloma with the Arcellx collaboration and we are also looking at autoimmune disease going forward.\nDaniel O'Day: Terrific. So, this is Dan. I just want to close this call by thanking you all for joining. And maybe just related to some of the enthusiasm of both, the team here in the room and the colleagues throughout Gilead and Kite, we're really seeing continued positive momentum and this is just another quarter of that, related to our strategy that we set out several years ago. I mean the first thing is, the business is performing well and on a consistent basis. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth for our business excluding Veklury. Secondly, we're much further ahead than we expected to be with our pipeline delivery. Now, we are now 64 ongoing clinical programs, 21 in Phase 3 and you saw that in the news flow for the second quarter. And then finally, we have a lot to look forward to in the second half of the year and beyond. We're particularly excited about the potential to transform beyond the diseases that we're helping patients with today in lung cancer and continuing to help the epidemic for HID and the epidemic for HIV. So, I just wanted to take this opportunity on behalf of all of us to thank you for joining. As usual, if you have questions that we haven't been able to handle here today, please get in touch with Jacquie and the IR team and we're more than happy to support you. Thank you, everybody, and thanks for joining today.\nOperator: That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Merdad Parsey",
            "content": "Thank you, Joanna. I'm pleased to highlight the ongoing progress our teams have made with 64 ongoing clinical programs and 21 Phase 3 trails. Notably, we presented multiple positive data readouts at medical conferences in the second quarter, such as updated overall survival data for Trodelvy in pre-treated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, OS data for Yescarta in second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, and long-term data from blabber tied in HDV. As we move into the second half of 2023, we remain focused on execution, investing in capabilities to increase our productivity and portfolio prioritization. We also look-forward to sharing an update on Trodelvy in non-small cell lung cancer, including EVOKE-02 data at World Conference on Lung Cancer in September. Turning first to Virology on slide 16, we are proud of the role Gilead has played in transforming HIV care. We continue to innovate based on our commitment to both the HIV community and to those who could benefit from prevention regimen with our ongoing work to do over new effective and convenient options. The unique profile of lenacapavir, our first-in class capsid inhibitor enables the eight prevention and treatment clinical programs, we're focused on. In HIV treatment the ARTISTRY-1 trial evaluating oral once daily bictegravir and lenacapavir your combination regimen. It's progressing well. We expect to provide an update on the Phase 2 portion of the study later this year. This novel regimen aims to provide an effective and simpler regimen for the 6% to 8% a biologically suppressed individuals who are currently on complex multi tablet regimens to manage their HIV. We continue to advance in our goal of providing longer-acting HIV treatment options through the development of lenacapavir combination regimens with integrase inhibitors, NRTIs and NNRTI as well as the Phase 2 study of our two broadly neutralizing antibodies. In HIV prevention, recruitment for our Phase 3 PURPOSE-1/-2 clinical trials evaluating every six months single-agent subcutaneous lenacapavir continues to exceed our expectations in the second quarter. We look-forward to potentially providing a data update in late 2024, to early 2025 timeframe as we target approval in late 2025. Moving on to slide 17, I'm pleased to note that the European Association for the Study of the Liver or EASL has updated its HDV guidelines to recommend that all patients in the EU with chronic HDV infection, should be considered for antiviral treatments. Recently Hepcludex was granted full approval by the European commission remains the only approved therapy for chronic HCV infection in the EU. The updated guidelines were supported by Hepcludex 's 48-week data which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in June. Gilead also presented data demonstrating the 96-week treatment with bulevirtide improved biologic and biochemical responses with no evidence of treatment-emergent resistance, including those who were previously non or partial responders. These data reinforce our confidence in bulevirtide and its potentially longer-term benefit for patients with HDV. As a reminder, bulevirtide is not yet approved in the US. Turning to Oncology on slide 18. Trodelvy remains the first and only approved TROP2-directed ADC with indications across three tumor types. It's also the only TROP2-directed ADC to show overall survival benefit versus chemotherapy in two tumor types. We've now treated over 20,000 patients and evaluate more than 2300 patients in our clinical trials. Trodelvy's robust dataset informs a well-characterized safety profile with low discontinuation rates observed across multiple indications and no required increasing monitoring for severe interstitial lung disease. At ASCO, we presented additional data demonstrating Trodelvy's potential, including in pre-treated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. We presented the final analysis from our Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 trial supporting the marketing authorization we just received from the European Commission last week. In bladder cancer, we shared an analysis of TROPHY-U-01 supporting Trodelvy's efficacy in post-platinum post-IO metastatic urothelial cancer across a range of TROP-2 expression. With our accelerated approval in bladder cancer, we hope to provide a data update from the ongoing confirmatory Phase 3 TROPiCS-04 trail and initiate global filings for Trodelvy in metastatic urothelial cancer by the end of next year. In heavily pre-treated endometrial cancer, we presented promising efficacy data from our Phase 2 TROPiCS-03 Basket trial, demonstrating the expanding pan-tumor potential of Trodelvy. Moving to slide 19, our comprehensive clinical development program in non-small cell lung cancer includes several signal-seeking and ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials. We know non-small cell lung cancer is not only an area of significant unmet need, as the number-one cause of cancer-related death, but also an area we believe Trodelvy has the potential to transform standard-of-care as a combination partner to an IO backbone in the first-line setting, as well as a single-agent in the post-IO setting. On slide 20, we highlight the growing number of lung-related catalysts. I'm particularly excited to highlight that we've added a new milestone with a preliminary readout from our Phase 2 EVOKE-02 trial at the World Conference on Lung Cancer. This study is evaluating Trodelvy plus pembrolizumab, with or without chemo in first-line non-small cell lung cancer. We will be sharing data from the first two cohorts evaluating Trodelvy in combination with pembro in PD-L1 high and PD-L1 low patients. The abstract, expected to be released later in August, will be an initial subset of a small number of patients. Our presentation scheduled for Sunday, September 10th at World Lung will include data at a later cut-off date with more patients. Turning to domvanalimab, or dom, on slide 21, we presented data from the last interim analysis of the full 150 patients enrolled in the Phase 2 ARC-7 study at ASCO in June. The data continued to show consistent and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival in first-line PD-L1 high non-small cell lung cancer, when dom, our Fc-silent anti-TIGIT is combined with an investigational anti-PD1 agent as compared to the PD1 inhibitor alone. These data form the basis for our dom program encompassing Phase 3 trials in first-line non-small cell lung cancer and upper GI cancers. Moving to cell therapy on slide 22. Yescarta continues to strengthen its position as a cell therapy of choice for large B-cell lymphoma. At ASCO in June, we presented overall survival data from the landmark Phase 3 ZUMA-7 trial of Yescarta in second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. At a median follow-up of four years, a one-time treatment with Yescarta demonstrated a statistically significant longer overall survival compared to standard-of-care with a 27% reduction in risk of death, representing a 38% relative improvement. Moreover, the majority of the patients in the standard-of-care arm eventually received a cell therapy off protocol. And of those, 77% received Yescarta. Overall, Yescarta is the first treatment in nearly 30 years to demonstrate a significant improvement in survival for this patient population, and these data add to the growing body of evidence that position cell therapy as potentially curative in some populations. With a strong pipeline of six ongoing Phase 2 and 3 trials across lines of therapy, new tumor types, and earlier-stage assets, Kite continues to innovate and execute on expanding the potential benefit of cell therapies to new patients, both through internal or acquired innovation and through collaborations. We are working closely with one of these partners, Arcellx, to support their efforts regarding the IMAGINE-1 clinical hold. We remain confident in the therapeutic profile for CAR-T ddBCMA and IMAGINE-1 trial based on the data demonstrated to date, and sharing Arcellx's commitment to delivering this novel therapy to multiple myeloma patients. Turning to slide 23, we highlight our progress against key clinical milestones for 2023 so far. We are of course disappointed by the outcome of the interim analysis of the ENHANCE trial evaluating magrolimab in higher-risk MDS, given the need for treatment options. We will continue to monitor and report on the other magrolimab trials. Importantly, while not every trial will be positive, our efforts at building a well-diversified portfolio gives us multiple opportunities to improve the lives of patients. We're excited about our momentum in making oncology and inflammation important contributors to our future and continue to make strong progress on delivering our key clinical catalysts for this year. Beyond our near-term milestones, I'd also like to highlight our growing pipeline of early-stage inflammation assets, including our oral alpha 4 beta 7 and the progression of our IRAK4 inhibitor that had asserted into Phase 2, as well as the advancement of the BTLA agonist program from the MiroBio acquisition into Phase 1. We are excited by this differentiated inflammation pipeline and the potential to impact important gaps in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Overall, we believe we have a very ambitious clinical portfolio that is well-diversified across indications and stage. We look forward to updating you as we progress through 2023. With that I'll hand the call over to Andy. Andy? Yes. We are looking forward to sharing those data. And as you can imagine, we're under embargo, so I can't share too many details until the presentation comes out and the abstract itself will come out I think in mid-August, so very shortly and that initial abstract will represent a relatively small dataset from EVOKE-02 and then there'll be more data at the time of the presentation in mid-September, so in terms of what's coming. In terms of ILD, across our programs, including all the clinical trials, we have not seen ILD to-date. We don't screen for ILD in our clinical trials, nor in the clinical practice. So, at this time, we have not seen anything from -- in an ILD standpoint. And then in terms of TROP-2 expression, as a matter of course, we are measuring TROP-2 expression in -- in all of our trials as we go forward and looking to see if we see correlations between TROP-2 expression and efficacy, and to date, we've not seen a correlation. We've seen great efficacy across TROP-2 expression levels in the tumors that we've studied today. Now that may change with different tumor types. But to date, we have not seen a correlation with TROP-2 expression on those. So, we're optimistic for that and keep to continue. I would not expect to see TROP-2 data in this upcoming dataset. It's -- this is an early dataset and those data usually trail -- the Trop-02 expression data usually trail the clinical trials. Sure. This is Merdad. Thanks for the question. So, as you know, our program is relatively broad and pushing forward in lung cancer as well. As I mentioned earlier, we'll be presenting our frontline data in EVOKE-02 -- preliminary frontline data from the EVOKE-02 study. And I think that will help provide everyone sort of benchmarking in terms of how Trodelvy is doing in that setting. And then what we'll be looking for I think is consistent with what our belief is for Trodelvy in the second line, which is that patients in second-line are sicker, they tend to have -- they are more difficult to manage and they are more challenging in terms of outcomes, so we are hopeful that we will see a benefit in those patients in terms of outcomes, particularly PFS and OS. So we will keep ourselves -- keep you updated on the progress of the EVOKE-01 study in the second-line as well. And we're pretty confident that we'll be in where we want to be. Our underlying hypothesis remains that we will have comparable efficacy and that we will have a better tolerability profile with Trodelvy. So, we're very confident with where we're headed. No. You hit it all."

            "name": "Daniel O'Day",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. As always, we appreciate you taking the time to catch up with Gilead in the midst of a busy earnings period. This was another very strong quarter for Gilead in terms of both business performance and clinical execution. Thank you to the Gilead teams that drove this progress with their dedication to improving the health of individuals and communities worldwide. Total product sales excluding Veklury grew 11% year-over-year and closed a very strong first half performance in the base business. As we look to the full year, we are increasing guidance for total product sales. We now expect even stronger growth in our base business of 6.5% to 8%, which is expected to more than offset our revised expectations for Veklury. As a result, our guidance for base business product sales has increased $550 million at the mid-point. In the second quarter, HIV contributed about two-thirds of the $615 million growth in our core business, growing 9% year-over-year. Oncology grew 38% year-over-year, and with product sales of $728 million in the second quarter, now has an annual run rate of approximately $3 billion. Moving to clinical progress, the second quarter was very active on the regulatory front, with approvals, positive opinions or recommendations for six of our therapies Trodelvy, Yescarta, Tecartus, Sunlenca, Hepcludex, and Veklury. This regulatory progress highlights the strength of our increasingly diverse portfolio. It also reflects the ability of our teams to successfully navigate regulatory processes across the therapeutic areas and key geographies with speed and efficiency. In addition to this progress, we shared positive pipeline updates at ASCO, which included overall survival data for Yescarta, the only large B-cell lymphoma cell therapy to demonstrate significant overall survival benefit versus standard of care in the second-line setting, promising Trodelvy data in endometrial cancer, reinforcing our belief in Trodelvy as a cornerstone asset with pan-tumor potential, an updated TIGIT data from the full study population of ARC-7, establishing domvanalimab's proof-of-concept in lung cancer. We have also shared long-term data for Hepcludex for hepatitis delta virus showing improved response rates at Week-96 compared to Week-48. These data support new guidelines recommending Hepcludex for people living with chronic HDV in the EU. With a broad portfolio of novel mechanisms and a commitment to pursuing areas of high unmet need, we know that some pipeline setbacks are to be expected. As we announced last month, we have discontinued the Phase 3 ENHANCE study in Higher-Risk MDS due to futility and a second interim analysis. As you know, MDS is one of the most intractable forms of blood cancer and we are disappointed that the study was not able to deliver new hope for patients with the disease. We will take a thorough data-driven approach regarding next steps as we carry out the ongoing analysis of magrolimab. Overall, we were executing well on our clinical commitments and our current performance speaks to the strength of our combined oncology portfolio. We have a rich pipeline of activity in the second half, including an initial look at a subset of EVOKE-02 data on Trodelvy plus pembro in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Before, I hand over to Johanna, I'd like to welcome Cindy Perettie, our Head of Cell Therapy to her first Gilead earnings conference call. Cindy has now been with Gilead for two months and brings a wealth of oncology and leadership experience from Roche, Foundation Medicine, and the Sarah Cannon Research Institute. We're delighted to have Cindy join our Gilead leadership team and it's great to have her with us on the call today. With that, I'll hand the call over to Johanna for a discussion of our commercial results. Johanna? Hey Geoff, I'll start and then turn it over to Andy, but thank you very much for the question. I want to be clear that we continue to be on track to meet our goal of oncology representing one-third of our 2030 revenues and that's on top of a growing HIV business overall. I'll just remind the team here that our portfolio is very broad. It's more than doubled since a few years ago in quantity and many-fold on a quality risk-adjusted basis as well. We have novel mechanisms and technologies and approaches across many indications precisely to allow for the fact that not every clinical card is going to turn over favorably. And Andy why don't -- I'll let you add on to that, in terms of what we -- what our initial assumptions were around a third. Thanks, Chris. Over to Merdad, please. Great, Tyler. Yes, over to Johanna, please. Thanks for the question. As I understand it, I think the question is around predictors of response as it relates to the upper GI setting. What I would say is, we of course are following biomarkers. As I mentioned, with TROP2, we are looking for biomarkers of responsiveness to various markers that could predict TIGIT responsiveness. Our interest in the upper GI is of course based on TIGIT expression levels in tumor samples and things like that outside of the clinical trials, but more based on clinical data that we -- that we've seen and others have seen for the efficacy of TIGIT in upper GI tumors. And so we'll of course across the programs be looking for any potential markers for predictive response. Thanks, Brian. Well, I mean I think you can imagine, we are looking thoroughly at the data and the trigger for this was a futility analysis centered on overall survival. We will of course update as we generate data and look at all those, we'll make those -- that information publicly available. To your point, the -- we're fairly far along in our AML trials. And as you know, we have some studies going on in solid tumors, and we believe that there are a number of factors that could determine success or failure in these various settings and each of these settings is represented slightly in different biological experiments. So we are going to continue to look broadly at what -- what we've learned from the initial data. We're going to continue to talk with the regulators and the IRBs in the near term and then we'll update you as we proceed down that path with where we're going to go, but we continue our efforts right now, hoping that magrolimab could have an effect in other diseases outside of MDS. MDS is a uniquely challenging indication and we feel -- we were hoping we could bring a benefit to those patients and we're disappointed that we can't do that. Thanks, Carter. This gives us a chance for all a chance to hear from Cindy for the first time with Gilead. Cindy, over to you, please. Yes, Andy, do you want to start with it? Yes, that's -- I think you hit the nail on the head. We are moving forward aggressively, not sure we've disclosed the timelines yet, but we're moving forward aggressively with our efforts to move that program into the clinic and as you say, I think a key potential for the -- that PARP inhibitor is in combination with Trodelvy and -- and combining those two agents to hopefully bring better outcomes to patients. So, we will update as we go along. I think things are things are progressing very nicely there. Terrific. So, this is Dan. I just want to close this call by thanking you all for joining. And maybe just related to some of the enthusiasm of both, the team here in the room and the colleagues throughout Gilead and Kite, we're really seeing continued positive momentum and this is just another quarter of that, related to our strategy that we set out several years ago. I mean the first thing is, the business is performing well and on a consistent basis. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth for our business excluding Veklury. Secondly, we're much further ahead than we expected to be with our pipeline delivery. Now, we are now 64 ongoing clinical programs, 21 in Phase 3 and you saw that in the news flow for the second quarter. And then finally, we have a lot to look forward to in the second half of the year and beyond. We're particularly excited about the potential to transform beyond the diseases that we're helping patients with today in lung cancer and continuing to help the epidemic for HID and the epidemic for HIV. So, I just wanted to take this opportunity on behalf of all of us to thank you for joining. As usual, if you have questions that we haven't been able to handle here today, please get in touch with Jacquie and the IR team and we're more than happy to support you. Thank you, everybody, and thanks for joining today."

            "name": "Andrew Dickinson",
            "content": "Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to slide 25 and as you heard from Dan and Joanna, our base business continued to perform very well in the second quarter, with total product sales excluding Veklury up 11% year-over-year, driven by growth across all of our product families. FX was still a headwind, albeit more modest, impacting growth by approximately one percentage point. Total product sales were $6.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year, as strong execution in our base business more than offset the lower Veklury sales, as well as FX impact of $82 million. Moving to the rest of the P&L, on a non-GAAP basis, on slide 26. Product gross margin was 86.9%, up 131 basis points from last year. R&D was $1.4 billion, up 25% year-over-year, due to higher expenses associated with our broad clinical pipeline, including the acceleration of certain late-stage clinical studies. As a reminder, we have 21 ongoing Phase 3 trials, highlighting the investments we continue to make in Gilead's near and long-term growth profile. As mentioned earlier this year, we will continue to manage expenses carefully. And in R&D, with a number of significant mid to late-stage trials ongoing, we'll continue to follow the science, pivoting investment if and when the data warrants. Acquired IPR&D was $236 million, reflecting the XinThera acquisition and expansion of the Arcus collaboration into inflammation, in addition to milestone payments associated with ongoing partnerships. SG&A was $1.8 billion, up 45% year-over-year, including a $525 million legal accrual for settlements with certain plaintiffs in the HIV antitrust litigation as well as increased commercial activities in oncology and HIV. Excluding the legal settlement accrual, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $1.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Moving to tax. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 21%. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.34 in the second quarter of 2023, including approximately $0.32 of expense associated with the legal settlement accrual, partially offset by higher product sales. This compared to $1.58 of earnings for the same period last year. Overall, we had a very strong first half. And as highlighted on slide 27, with solid performance in each of our core franchises across virology and oncology, driving 13% year-over-year growth excluding Veklury. Given these strong first half results, we have updated our full year sales guidance. Moving to slide 28, we now expect total product sales in the range of $26.3 billion to $26.7 billion, up from $26 billion to $26.5 billion previously. We expect total product sales excluding Veklury in the range of $24.6 billion to $25 billion, up from $24 billion to $24.5 billion previously. This new range represents growth of 6.5% to 8% for our base business year-over-year, compared to 4% to 6% previously. On Veklury, the second quarter and first half were below our internal expectations. Based on COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations to date, we have lowered our guidance for the full year to approximately $1.7 billion to bring second half expectations more in line with our first half experience. As a reminder, Veklury is highly correlated with COVID-related hospitalizations and as such, it's utilization remains variable. We will share another update with you on our third quarter call. Moving to the rest of the P&L. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 86%. There is also no change to our non-GAAP R&D guidance, where we expect expenses to increase by a low-double-digit percent compared to 2022. Reflecting the one-time legal settlement accrual of $525 million in the second quarter, we now expect non-GAAP SG&A expense to increase a high-single-digit percent compared to 2022. Excluding this legal settlement accrual, non-GAAP SG&A expense for 2023 is expected to be down low-single-digit percentage compared to 2022, consistent with our prior guidance. Non-GAAP acquired IPR&D has been updated to reflect the XinThera acquisition and expanded Arcus collaboration, adding about $200 million or $0.17 per share. For 2023, we now expect acquired IPR&D to be approximately $900 million, reflecting previously committed acquired IPR&D amounts, as well as known milestone payments from existing collaborations. Similar to prior quarters, we will continue to include expected acquired IPR&D expenses if we announce additional transactions over the course of the year. We now expect non-GAAP operating income in the range of $10.4 billion to $10.9 billion, or roughly $650 million lower at the mid-point, due to the $525 million one-time legal settlement accrual and $200 million in additional acquired IPR&D expense, neither of which were reflected in our previous full year guidance. Moving to tax. We now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 17%, reflecting an expected decrease in our tax reserves for the second half of the year. Altogether, we now expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $6.45 and $6.80 per share, down from $6.60 and $7 previously as shown on slide 29. The chart illustrates the underlying strength of our business with the higher product sales guidance flowing through to the bottom-line, in addition to lower expected tax rate. This is however offset by both acquired IPR&D at $0.17 per share and the legal settlement accrual of $0.32 per share in nonrecurring cost. On a GAAP basis, we expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.50 and $4.85. Moving to slide 30, you can see that there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through our dividend and repurchase of shares. We believe we have built a strong pipeline that will enable Gilead to deliver near and long-term growth. And of course, we'll continue to remain opportunistic as we look to access high-quality assets through partnerships or make smaller acquisitions in the normal course of business. We remain committed to growing our dividend and to using share repurchases, primarily to offset equity dilution. Although, we will also be opportunistic from time to time. With that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A. Sir, Hi Geoff, good to hear from you, and thank you for the question. You may recall that historically we've talked about this, we've highlighted that, that assumption is really tied to the cell therapy business and to Trodelvy and that we have a complete belief that we're going to get there based on those two franchises alone. Magrolimab and TIGIT and the rest of the oncology pipeline provide additional upside. So just reiterating what Dan said, we continue to be on track to meet the goal of our oncology business representing a third of our total revenue by 2030 and we remain excited about the breadth of our oncology portfolio and the exceptional progress that you see in cell therapy, and Trodelvy, which combined, as you heard in the prepared remarks, are on track to produce $3 billion of revenue roughly this year. Sure. Hi, Evan, thank you for the question. Look, I'd say, we continue to be very active in BD as you'd expect, across both Gilead and Kite. And that's across all of our areas of focus. So, again, oncology, inflammation, and virology. As we've said before, there are fewer virology opportunities externally. We have an incredibly robust pipeline and extraordinary research group. We're building out our research groups at Kite and at Gilead in oncology and inflammation. We're excited about the progress that we're making there. We're still going to be active in the outside. That being said, what you should expect over the next five years is different than what you saw over the last five years. So, using Immunomedics as an example, that's a deal that we continue to be very excited about. You've heard all the excitement about Trodelvy and where we are today with the franchise, where we see it going. But that was a unique point in time where we really needed an anchor molecule to build our oncology business around. We will continue to look at commercial assets, but you should expect consistent with what you saw last year, that our focus is predominantly on ordinary course partnerships and smaller acquisitions. Again, we will be opportunistic, we will look for ways to build our franchise and to create value for shareholders, but that's the base-case expectation. Hi, Mohit, thanks. Thanks for the question. This is an important -- an important point. What we said and we continue to believe is, we have an exceptionally strong business with a lot of leverage, a highly efficient structure, a lot of leverage in our model. We've historically had industry-leading operating margins and we certainly expect to have that in the future. We also have said and acknowledged that we're in a unique point in time as we've built-out both our R&D portfolio and our sales and marketing team with the move into oncology, where our expenses have increased in the short-run and we expect over the coming year for the expense -- the expense increases to moderate and we expect that you'll continue to see the strong growth that you've seen in our base business the last couple of years. So again, this is kind of our strategy playing out, where you see the extraordinary progress in the base business growth last year, certainly through this year, you see that with the raised guidance for the base business, we expect to carry that momentum going forward. Of course, we don't provide long-term guidance. And we as we've highlighted, have 21 late-stage Phase 3 clinical studies underway. We will get to a point over the coming quarters and years where our expense growth moderates and you should see a lot of that carry to the bottom line so. And I think the way that you've characterized the operating margin in the second quarter is it is entirely consistent with the way that I see it and we don't provide long-term guidance beyond saying that we expect to have a top-tier operating margin going forward and we think we're in a great place to achieve that goal. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks a lot, Carter, for the question. I think, first, it might be helpful if I can provide a little context associated with the clinical hold. On June 16th, the FDA did notify Arcellx that it was placing the CAR-T ddBCMA IND on clinical hold. That was following a patient death. The patient was treated with the ddBCMA our CAR-T and despite becoming ineligible for treatment under the trial protocol, due to the fact that they developed a secondary malignancy before the time of infusion, so they would have not been allowed technically to be on protocol. After infusing that patient, they subsequently mismanaged I would say the manner in which the protocol specified treatment of adverse events. And so we are continuing to partner with Arcellx on this. We are very confident in the molecule. We're confident in the IMAGINE-1 study design and we're looking at ways in which we can partner with Arcellx to enhance protocol adherence. All of the clinical sites to date have been retrained, so that we can again ensure that protocol adherence. And additionally, the FDA has allowed Arcellx to dose patients who had gone through lymphodepletion while on clinical hold. So again, we remain confident that the therapeutic profile of ddBCMA CAR-T and the IMAGINE-1 trial is going to be successful I think based on the data demonstrated to date. So, our commitment in delivering that therapy to patients globally is still there for multiple myeloma."

            "name": "Johanna Mercier",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter was another strong quarter for Gilead with solid performance across our commercial portfolio, leading to an increase in our full year expectations for both the base and overall business. For the second quarter of 2023, as shown on slide seven, total product sales excluding Veklury grew 11% year-over-year to $6.3 billion with year-over-year growth in each of our core franchises. This represents the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for our base business, reinforcing the strength of our Virology and Oncology portfolios. The strong growth more than offset the decline in Veklury sales, which were as expected given the lower hospitalizations. Altogether, total product sales including Veklury was $6.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Starting with HIV on slide eight. Second quarter sales of $4.6 billion were up 9% year-over-year, driven by higher average realized price in part due to channel mix and higher demand, partially offset by lower channel inventory. Quarter-over-quarter, sales were up 10%, driven by favorable pricing and inventory build following the typical first quarter dynamics. Overall, the global HIV treatment market continues to grow in line with our expectations of 2% to 3% annually. Specifically in the US, the market overall grew more than 2% in the first half of the year compared to the first half of 2022, reflecting growth in the non-retail channels more than offsetting a roughly flat retail market. HIV product sales grew 11% in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022, helped by favorable pricing dynamics, including the phasing of certain government purchases and channel mix. Looking forward, we expect HIV product sales growth to more closely mirror market growth in the second half. Therefore, we are increasing our full year expectations for HIV and now expect full year HIV product growth for 2023 to be modestly higher than the 5% we reported in 2022. Turning to slide nine. Biktarvy sales of $3 billion were up 17% year-over-year, driven by higher demand and favorable pricing dynamics, partially offset by lower channel inventory. With a market share up almost 3% year-over-year in the US, Biktarvy remains the treatment of choice for HIV with more than 46% market share. This represents the 20th consecutive quarter of share gains in the US, with the year-over-year growth rate that has once again outpaced new and existing regimens. Similarly, we continue to see solid share gains across other major markets as Biktarvy maintains its leading position for new starts as well as for those switching therapies. Descovy sales were $516 million, up 12% year-over-year. With awareness and utilization of HIV prevention higher than ever, the US market grew once again. And amidst this growth, we're pleased to see strong demand for Descovy for PrEP, up 14% year-over-year in the US, with a strong market share that has remained over 40%. With this strong foundation, we look forward to potentially adding lenacapavir as a six-monthly subcutaneous option for prevention as early as 2025. Moving to the liver disease portfolio on Slide 10, sales were up 4% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter to $711 million. We remain committed to eliminating HCV globally with our market-leading portfolio of medicines and our efforts to increase awareness contributed to higher patient starts in the US, Europe, and Asia in the second quarter. HBV and HDV also contributed to growth in the liver disease portfolio, driven by higher demand. Liver disease remains an important part of our portfolio, benefiting hundreds of thousands of patients. We're pleased to have received full marketing authorization for Hepcludex in HDV in Europe, a further recognition of the benefit this medicine brings to patients who have very limited therapeutic options. Across our portfolio of HCV, HBV, and HDV products, the liver disease contribution to our commercial performance continues to stabilize overall to a run rate of more than $2.5 billion in sales a year. On to slide 11. Veklury sales declined in the second quarter as expected, reflecting lower hospitalization rates, with sales of $256 million, down 43% year-over-year. For those patients hospitalized and treated for COVID-19, a majority continued to receive Veklury, a testament to Veklury's robust clinical profile. Most recently, this has included decisions by the US-FDA and the European Commission to expand Veklury's indication to reach patients with renal impairment including those on dialysis. Moving to Oncology on slide 12, it is remarkable to observe that in less than five years, our oncology business has grown from less than $300 million and is now approaching an annualized run rate of $3 billion, with tens of thousands of patients treated with Gilead and Kite oncology therapies to date. Beyond our well-established leadership in cell therapy, we have the only TROP2-directed ADC on the market with Trodelvy, and combined, our oncology portfolio extends the options for patients in eight indications. Looking in more detail at Trodelvy on slide 13, sales were up 63% year-over-year and 17% sequentially to $260 million, representing an annual run rate that exceeds $1 billion. We continue to be very pleased with the launch in pre-treated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, with strong awareness of our approval in US. We look forward to reaching even more patients in Europe following last week's marketing authorization from the European Commission. Additionally, we're beginning discussions with health authorities in Japan, with plans to file for approval in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer later this year. With a strong field force in place and robust datasets across multiple tumor types, Trodelvy remains well-positioned to maintain and expand its reach, and Gilead continues to build on our experience in breast and bladder cancers with a view to other indications over time, as the development program evolves. Turning to Cell Therapy on slide 14, sales in the second quarter were $469 million, up 27% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter. Yescarta showed continued growth with sales up 29% year-over-year to $380 million, primarily driven by strong underlying demand in the second and third-line settings for relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, both in existing, as well as new markets. Tecartus sales were $88 million, up 21% year-over-year, reflecting increased demand for relapsed or refractory adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as well as mantle cell lymphoma, primarily outside the US. We are excited about the opportunity ahead as the body of evidence supporting broader adoption of cell therapies continues to grow. The work that Kite has been leading to raise awareness in the adoption of cell therapy will be accelerated by other providers as they ramp up their manufacturing capabilities. This overall expansion in supply will predictably impact our market share in the near term, but overall class share is the most important driver of our business over time. As cell therapy is offered and delivered to more patients, we are confident that Kite cell therapies will remain differentiated in terms of our manufacturing reliability and efficacy. Wrapping up the second quarter, I'd like to acknowledge the commercial teams and our partners across Gilead and Kite that once again delivered an extremely strong performance, reflecting both solid execution and a compelling portfolio of Gilead products that positively impacts millions of people around the world. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline. Merdad? Hi, Tyler. Yes, we are very pleased with the results and the early signs that we've seen from the recent launch of HR+/HER2- in the US. We've definitely seen as you say, an inflection point, so we've seen a really strong uptake in this setting. We're also kind of building on the foundation of triple-negative breast cancer where we are the standard-of-care here as well, and we're excited about the fact that Europe and the EC just gave approval for HR+/HER2- in Europe. So, building on the success of TNBC and we've seen strong uptake in Europe for TNBC. So, there's also a piece of that for the Trodelvy business performance. And we're excited to see what we can do with HR+/HER2- in Europe as well. So, we do think this is definitely on the right path from a growth standpoint and very exciting times for Trodelvy and breast cancer patients. Yes, so thanks for the question. I think you're referring to the National Coverage Determination, the NCD, right, preparation for prep? I'm assuming. And that's really just because the -- right now it currently only supports oral drugs and there is an opportunity for us to add injectable drugs and I think that was a we request to CMS and so we're very supportive of course and we believe the path is actually quite central to ending HIV epidemic and fully put -- fully support the CMS proposal. As from a timing standpoint, that probably hopefully in the coming quarters that we should see something come out, but I don't have details on that, but I do think it can only help what we're trying to do in HIV prevention, let alone support as we think of launching the potential launch for lenacapavir here in 2025. So, maybe I'll pick it up. So thanks for the question, Colin. We are -- we have been expecting that data. We're off to -- very pleased with what we've seen thus far with Trodelvy and I think that's the piece that's important here. I think Trodelvy's positioning in the marketplace both in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and second-line as the standard-of-care in that setting is very well established with an opportunity to continue to make sure people move up the lines of therapy because they still use it in the third and fourth line setting when there is still an opportunity to displace chemotherapies. I think as we've seen with other ADCs in the breast cancer market, I think it does -- it's really healthy awareness of the benefits of ADCs. And with Trodelvy, is overall survival, both in triple-negative breast cancer as well as in HR+/HER2-, I do think it sets up Trodelvy incredibly well and we've seen also ADC sequencing either from in HER2 to Trodelvy or Trodelvy to in HER2. I think as a third ADC comes to market, I think it might be a little bit more challenging in light of some of the positioning that's already there, but I do think for patients, this is a great thing. I also think the safety profile that Merdad mentioned just a little bit earlier, is also something to consider when you think about a safety profile with Trodelvy where you're looking at neutropenia and diarrhea, which are very much in line with other chemotherapies already on the market marketplace, so the physicians are very confident in how to treat versus bringing in something like ILD is going to be a little bit more concerning. So, more to come and I guess we'll wait to see the data, but today, in the field today, I think Trodelvy is definitely making a difference for the patients. Merdad, did you want to add anything? Thank you. I think we have time for one last question, Tia. Thank you very much for the question, Simon. Similar to you, we are very intrigued also by the data that we're seeing in places like autoimmune disease, the lupus, and it's something of great interest to us. We have established ourselves in oncology certainly and expanded into multiple myeloma with the Arcellx collaboration and we are also looking at autoimmune disease going forward."

[Operator Instruction] I will now hand over to your host, Jacquie Ross, Vice President, Investor Relations to begin. Jacquie, please go ahead.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the first quarter of 2023. The press release, slides and supplemental data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including those related to Gilead's business, financial condition, and results of operations, plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections, and the use of capital, and 2023 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation is provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet, as well as on the Gilead website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.\nDaniel O'Day: Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. The Gilead team continued its track-record of strong commercial and clinical execution in the first quarter of 2023. Our base business grew at 15% excluding Veklury, with total product sales of $6.3 billion, reflecting outperformance across the portfolio. On a year-over-year basis, roughly two-thirds of the $735 million increase in our base business sales were driven by HIV and the other third was driven by oncology. Once again, we're seeing the tangible impact of our transformation, and the successful diversification of our business. We saw a year-over-year growth in HIV up 13%, liver disease, which includes therapies for HCV, HBV and HDV up 6%, cell therapy up 64% and Trodelvy up 52%. As expected, Veklury revenues continued to track lower rates of COVID-19 hospitalizations. As a result, revenue of $573 million was down 63% from the first quarter of last year. On the clinical side, we received another FDA approval for Trodelvy in early February. This latest approval was for a third indication, pretreated HR positive HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer. Its early days, but this has been a very strong commercial launch for Trodelvy in the U.S. so far. This further highlights the critical patient need that Trodelvy is addressing in this late-stage population, as well as the effectiveness of our commercial oncology team. We continue to prepare for Trodelvy's approval in pretreated HR positive HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer in Europe in the second half of this year. Another key milestone for the quarter was the announcement of the primary overall survival data from the landmark Phase 3 ZUMA-7 study. Yescarta is now the first and only treatment in nearly 30 years to show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival for initial treatment of relapsed or refractory Large B-cell lymphoma patients versus historical standard-of-care in a curative setting. Full results will be presented at this year's ASCO. Turning to clinical progress in virology, we continue to add to the body of evidence for lenacapavir's effectiveness as part of a six-month subcutaneous therapy. At this year's CROI, the team shared positive Phase 1b data on the investigational lenacapavir and bNAb combination. The bNAb combination is, of course, just one of the eight long-acting combination options that we're exploring for lenacapavir and we are pleased with our progress so far. In the meantime, following our first approval of lenacapavir as Sunlenca for heavily treatment experienced people living with HIV, we are seeing strong engagement from KOLs and physicians who are interested in the full potential of lenacapavir for prevention and treatment. As you know, this first approval addresses a significant unmet need for a small number of people living with HIV, who have very limited options available to them. And we look forward to making lenacapavir available to many more people, beginning with the potential approval and prevention in the 2025 timeframe. We see lenacapavir as having the most promising potential yet in the ongoing efforts to end the HIV epidemic, and we're looking forward to working with others to make it broadly available as soon as possible. With that, I'll hand over to Johanna for a review of our first quarter commercial performance. Johanna?\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. The commercial organization delivered a very strong start to the year and continued to build on the momentum we saw in 2022, to set a firm foundation for continued execution and growth in 2023. As our results show on Slide 7, each of our core franchises delivered year-over-year growth led by HIV and oncology, and total product sales excluding Veklury totaled $5.7 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Including Veklury, total product sales were $6.3 billion, down 3% driven by lower Veklury sales associated with fewer COVID-19 hospitalizations. On Slide 8, HIV sales were up 13% year-over-year to $4.2 billion, driven by favorable pricing dynamics, higher demand and lower inventory drawdowns. Quarter-over-quarter, sales were down 12%, associated with the normal seasonality we typically experience in first quarter. As a reminder, at the start of the year, patient co-pays and deductibles reset, which had an impact on average realized prices and market growth. We expect these pricing impacts to normalize through the remainder of the year. And we also see typically a buildup in inventory in the fourth quarter, followed by meaningful inventory drawdowns in the first quarter. Following a focused effort to better manage this dynamic, we're pleased to see less of an impact than we have historically on both a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, highlighting our goal of better matching product delivery with end user demand. We expect these efforts to contribute to a more stable quarter-over-quarter growth in our HIV business, as compared to prior years. Turning to Sunlenca. First quarter sales of $4 million was very much in-line with our expectations. Sunlenca is an important option for the small number of people living with HIV who have developed resistance and have few, if any, other options. We are leveraging the launch to engage with providers and the community ahead of lenacapavir's potential launches in prevention and treatment. Overall, the HIV treatment market grew approximately 2% year-over-year in the U.S., and almost 4% in Europe, tracking in-line with our expectations for annual growth of 2% to 3%. And in prevention, awareness continues to grow with the US PrEP market up over 19% year-over-year. Moving to Slide 9. Biktarvy sales of $2.7 billion were up 24% year-over-year, driven by higher demand, as well as favorable pricing and inventory dynamics. Biktarvy continues to cement itself as the therapy of choice for people living with HIV, now capturing a treatment market-share of 46% in the U.S., up 3% year-over-year, and representing a growth rate that has impressively outpaced new and existing regimens. Moreover, Biktarvy has maintained its leading position for new starts across the U.S., Europe and other major markets, as well as in treatment switches across most major markets, including the US. On Descovy, sales were $449 million in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year. Demand for Descovy for PrEP remained strong at 14% year-over-year. Descovy for PrEP once again maintained its greater than 40% market share. The continued resilience of our PrEP business despite availability of other prevention options, including generics, provides a solid foundation as we make progress towards the potential approval and launch of lenacapavir for PrEP. Moving to slide 10. The Liver disease portfolio was up 6% year-over-year to $675 million, highlighting the continuing contribution of our viral hepatitis medicines to patients and the Gilead portfolio. In HCV, sales were $445 million, up 12% year-over-year, driven by favorable pricing dynamics and timing of purchases by the Department of Corrections. HBV and HDV sales we're $230 million, down 2% year-over-year, primarily due to pricing dynamics outside of the U.S. We continue to expect HCV start to trend down over time, given the curative nature of therapy, with some offset from HBV and HDV. In the meantime, we are pleased to observe solid and stable market shares across all of our Liver portfolio. On to Slide 11, and as we expected, Veklury sales of $573 million were down year-over-year, and sequentially, as COVID-related infections became less severe and hospitalizations remain below peak levels. As a reminder, the winter surge occurred earlier than we had expected, beginning in the fourth quarter and lasting only through the beginning of Q1. As Veklury's use tracks hospitalization, it's sales are volatile and highly subject to surges and the overall path of the pandemic. Veklury is backed by clinical data and real-world evidence that reinforces its clinical profile and despite the lower hospitalization rates in the quarter, Veklury's share of hospitalized patients treated for COVID-19 grew modestly, maintaining well over 50% share in the United States. Moving to oncology and beginning with Trodelvy on Slide 12. Sales of $222 million were up 52% year-over-year and 14% sequentially, driven by strong growth both in the U.S. and Europe. Following U.S. approval in early-February, we're off to a strong start with Trodelvy in pretreated HR positive HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer, as some clinicians moved quickly to make this new option available for patients in this setting. We look forward to extending Trodelvy's reach to these patients in Europe, where a decision is expected later this year. Of course, our efforts here are underpinned by the successes and learnings in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer with TNBC. From our expansion of the field force last year and a strong body of data across a number of tumor types, more physicians are recognizing Trodelvy's clinically meaningful overall survival benefit. This recognition is not just in metastatic TNBC, but also in HR positive HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer regardless of HER-2 negative status. Now on to slide 13. Cell therapy sales in the first quarter were $448 million, up 64% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter. We're pleased with the continued growth of Yescarta, with sales up 70% Year-over-year to $359 million, primarily driven by growth in the second and third-line setting for relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. Sequentially, sales were up 6%, driven in-part by strong demand and favorable pricing dynamics, both primarily in Europe. Turning to Tecartus. Sales were $89 million, up 40% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, driven by growing demand for both relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Looking ahead, we continue to work to raise awareness of cell therapies and increase cost share. We believe that compelling data including ZUMA-7's recent positive overall survival results, in addition to peer dataset in the cell therapy space will support broader adoption over time. In summary, it's been a positive start to the year with our current product portfolio of virology and oncology medicines, delivering strong performance. We look forward to maintaining this momentum through the rest of the year and beyond. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline. Merdad?\nMerdad Parsey: Thank you, Johanna. We are off to a strong start in 2023 with our first regulatory approval of the year for Trodelvy for certain HR positive HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer patients in the U.S. and an additional 10 trials initiated so far this year, including four Phase 3 studies. This brings our clinical pipeline to 61 ongoing clinical programs. Starting with virology on Slide 15, we presented late-breaking data among 83 abstracts at CROI in Seattle in February, highlighting Gilead's continued expertise and leadership across HIV, Viral Hepatitis and COVID-19. In HIV, we shared several data readouts from our lenacapavir based development programs in prevention and treatment. In prevention, we presented preclinical in-vivo data providing further validation that a subcutaneous injection of lenacapavir can confer long-acting protection in an animal model. We believe lenacapavir as a single-agent has the potential to be the first once every six month option for HIV prevention. We are currently testing this in our pivotal Phase 3 PURPOSE trials. In treatment, we shared Phase 1b proof-of-concept data on twice yearly lenacapavir in combination with two investigational broadly neutralizing antibodies. At week-26, 90% of trial participants receiving this combination maintained virologic suppression. Further, treatment with the investigational regimen was generally well tolerated. Moving to COVID-19 on Slide 16, we also shared positive data from three retrospective real-world analysis of Veklury at CROI. These analysis showed that initiation of Veklury within the first two days of hospital admission, reduced death and hospital readmission rates among all patients with COVID-19. The right hand side of the slide highlights that both of our oral Phase 3 trials evaluating GS-5245 or obeldesivir, our investigational oral COVID nucleoside in standard risk patients and in high risk patients are now enrolling. Given uncertainties in the global epidemiology of COVID-19, we continue to be cautious with regards to the length of time it could take to fully enroll these trials. Moving on to Slide 17. Trodelvy continues to build momentum as the cornerstone of our solid tumor portfolio. As expected, the FDA approved Trodelvy for its third indication. Trodelvy is now approved in adults with HR positive HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer, who previously received endocrine-based therapy and at least two additional systemic therapies for metastatic disease. This FDA approval is based on the overall survival benefit seen in the Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 trial. We've already received acceptance of our European filing, and continue to expect a regulatory decision from the European Commission in the second half of this year. The Phase 3 EVOKE-01 trial evaluating the potential for Trodelvy in second line non-small cell lung cancer is ongoing. Additionally, we recently had FPI for the Phase 3 EVOKE-03 study also known as KEYNOTE-D46. This trial is being led by Merck to evaluate Trodelvy in combination with pembrolizumab in first line PD-L1 high non-small cell lung cancer. Additionally, we're excited to announce that over 30 abstracts, including an oral presentation of the updated ARC7 trial data have been accepted at ASCO this year. Not only do these data highlight elements of our investigational Trodelvy and dombinilumab programs in breast, bladder and lung cancers, the abstracts include new insights on many of our promising targets, including our cell therapy portfolio. Speaking of which, on Slide 18, I'm pleased to discuss the clinical progress we've made within cell therapy. Recently, we highlighted new overall survival data from the Phase 3 ZUMA-7 trial evaluating Yescarta for the initial treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. These data will be presented as an oral late-breaker at ASCO. Yescarta is the first and only therapy of any kind to show statistically significant overall survival benefit versus standard-of-care in almost 30 years. As we work to extend our leadership in cell therapy within our current portfolio, we're also building out our earlier stage programs. As mentioned in our last earnings call, we closed our agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize Arcellx's CART-ddBCMA for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Also, we closed our acquisition of Community Therapeutics in February, extending our preclinical and clinical pipeline in blood cancers and solid tumors. We are currently working to integrate the Community team with their asset into our broader innovation pipeline. Wrapping up on Slide 19, we are sharing the updated key pipeline milestones that we expect in 2023, which as you can see spans FPI's, data readouts, updates and regulatory approvals across oncology, virology and inflammation. Overall, this highlights the progress that Gilead has made on its transformation journey. The 61 clinical programs that are well-diversified across indications and stage. We have an ambitious clinical program, and I'd like to thank the Gilead team that has worked tirelessly to execute and accelerate the progress of our portfolio. We look forward to updating you as we progress through 2023. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Andy. Andy?\nAndrew Dickinson: Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on Slide 21, the first quarter was a strong commercial start to the year, with total product sales, excluding Veklury, up 15% year-over-year despite continued FX headwinds. Overall, our base business demonstrated growth in each of our product families, including almost 60% growth in oncology, and 13% growth in HIV. Total product sales were $6.3 billion, down 3% due to lower Veklury sales, partially offset by growth in our base business. FX negatively impacted first quarter total product sales by $106 million, representing approximately 150 basis points of growth. Turning to Slide 22. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 86.2%, down 1.2 percentage points from last year, due to, among other things, the timing of the Biktarvy royalty initiation in the first quarter of 2022 and product mix, partially offset by inventory benefits. Moving to OpEx, expenses were higher than we anticipated in the first quarter due to R&D investments and inflationary pressures. Non-GAAP R&D was $1.4 billion, up 25% year-over-year, due to higher expenses, including the acceleration of certain late-stage clinical studies, as well as about $50 million in one-time items. As Merdad mentioned, we have started 10 new trials so far this year, including four Phase 3 programs. This brings the total number of ongoing Phase 3 studies to 22, highlighting the investment we are making in Gilead's future growth. Clinical trial enrollment for a number of new and ongoing Trodelvy and lenacapavir trials was faster than we expected, with a notable acceleration, for example, in certain lenacapavir trials in March. Our clinical team has been working hard to rapidly advance our studies and bring new therapeutic options to patients as fast as we can. This includes working to close the gap that some peers have in certain programs and we believe we are starting to see the impact of these acceleration efforts in our trials, although this did contribute to higher R&D expenses in the first quarter. Consistent with past practice, we will continue to manage expenses carefully, including the ongoing process of prioritizing programs based on potential impact and data. We have taken the last several years to build the most diverse and robust clinical pipeline in Gilead's history, now with well over 100 trials across our three targeted therapeutic areas. We are excited to see so many of these programs in later-stage trials with a number of data readouts building momentum over the next several years. Non-GAAP acquired IP R&D was $481 million, primarily driven by expenses related to our acquisition of Community, as well as upfront and milestone payments associated with the Arcellx and Nurix collaborations. Non-GAAP SG&A was $1.3 billion, up 22% year-over-year, primarily due to the commercial expansion and investments in our oncology business, in addition to higher branded prescription drug fee expenses and higher corporate expense that continue to be impacted by inflation. Moving to tax, our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the first quarter was 18.9%, lower than expected driven by discrete tax benefits recorded in the first quarter. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.37 in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $2.12 for the same period last year, reflecting higher operating expenses and lower product gross margin. I'll move now to guidance for the full year 2023 on Slide 23. There is no change to our revenue guidance. We continue to expect total product sales in the range of $26 billion to $26.5 billion and we continue to expect total product sales excluding Veklury in the range of $24 billion to $24.5 billion, representing growth of 4% to 6% for our base business year-over-year. On Veklury, the first quarter was modestly below our internal expectations and our $2 billion full year guidance assumes an increase in infections at some point later this year, not dissimilar from what we saw in 2022. We know from experience that COVID-19 related sales are extremely volatile and are leaving our guidance unchanged pending additional data points as we move through the year. Moving to the rest of the P&L. We continue to target non-GAAP product gross margin of approximately 86%, as discussed, we now expect full year 2023 non-GAAP R&D expenses to increase a low double-digit percentage compared to 2022. This resulted in an overall R&D investment for the full year in the low 20's as a percentage of total revenue. We believe this is a more appropriate level of investment for a company with a broad late-stage clinical portfolio that is targeting attractive opportunities and sustainable revenue growth. We continue to expect non-GAAP acquired IP R&D to be approximately $700 million, reflecting previously committed acquired IP R&D amounts. Similar to prior quarters, we will continue to include expected acquired IP R&D expenses as we announced additional transactions over the course of the year. Moving to non-GAAP SG&A, there is no change to our prior guidance, where we expect a full year declined by a low-single digit percentage compared to 2022. Although we will continue to look for opportunities to partially offset the higher R&D investments, we now plan for this year. Overall, there is no change to our expectations for non-GAAP operating income in the range of $11 billion to $11.6 billion. Additionally, there is no change to our tax guidance, and we continue to target a non-GAAP effective tax-rate of approximately 20%. And finally, we continue to expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $6.60 and $7 per share, reflecting, first, that the initial guidance model we shared with you in early-February allowed for a broad range of potential revenue and expense scenarios. And second, that we're committed to finding room in our overall P&L to absorb the higher R&D investments that we are choosing to prioritize in 2023. On a GAAP basis, we expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.75 to $5.15. Moving to Slide 24, you can see there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. We returned $1.4 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through our dividend and repurchase of shares. Finally, on business development, there is no change to our philosophy, we are very comfortable with the breadth and the quality of the pipeline that we've built, acquired or partnered and the growth it will enable in the coming years. With that in mind, you can expect us to continue to opportunistically access high quality assets through partnerships or to make smaller acquisitions in the normal course of business. And now, I'll hand it over to Dan for some closing remarks.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Andy. Before we open for Q&A I'll just summarize our prepared remarks by noting that this is another quarter where we demonstrated the continued impact of our transformation. Going-forward, we are committed to building on the track record of strong commercial and clinical execution that we've shown in recent quarters, thanks to the dedication to Gilead and Kite teams, around the world. With this positive momentum, we look-forward to delivering on our portfolio, while maintaining financial discipline. With that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today goes to Michael Yee of Jefferies. Michael, please go ahead, your line is open.\nDennis Ding: Hi, this is Dennis Ding on for Mike. Thanks for taking the questions. Two from us, maybe number one. What are your expectations for the competitor Trop-2 data that's coming imminently? And what would you like to see and how would you differentiate? And could you perhaps look at PFS like your competitor? And then number two, can you just talk about the progress of your long-acting oral integrase inhibitors for HIV. Are they in the clinic yet? Thank you.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks for the questions. So in terms of the competitor Trop-2 data, I think it's a little early for us to be doing comparisons across data we haven't seen yet. We're really comfortable with the data we've already shown and have certainly led to approvals in breast cancer with OS benefit. So, you can see from the uptake of Trodelvy in the breast cancer market that being approved and having those OS data has had an impact for patients and we're very comfortable with where we are. Of course, we'll keep an eye on those emerging data as they become available, and every indication. And then in terms of the long-acting orals, as you know, we have a number of programs in the clinic for our long-acting portfolio, both oral and injectable, and we've moved several of them, including an oral program into the clinic and we'll be sharing those data as they become available. Very excited about that. That portfolio we remain committed to and, really excited about our long-acting portfolio to do -- to leverage [lenacapavir] (ph) profile to go into both oral long-acting as well as parenteral long-acting formulation. So stay-tuned as those data develop, we'll gladly share.\nJacquie Ross: Nadia, may we have our next question, please. And can I remind all our callers to please limit themselves to one question so that we get to as many folks in the queue as possible. Thanks, Nadia.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question goes to Brian Abrahams of RBC. Brian, please go ahead, your line is open.\nBrian Abrahams: Hey, good afternoon and thanks so much for taking my question. Regarding Trodelvy, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing with regards to its use across the different lines of therapy post HR positive HER-2 negative approval? And I guess along those lines as you think about moving this to earlier lines in this indication, what's your latest thoughts on the potential trial design for ASCENT-07 to optimize -- in terms of optimizing the right patient population to expedite trial enrollment and support meaningful commercial expansion? Thanks.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks so much. Brian, Dan O'Day here. I'm going to have Johanna answer the first part of your question and then Merdad the second Thank you.\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Dan. So basically, we really pleased with the early launch results that we've seen so far in HR positive HER-2 negative. And what we've been seeing is strong initial uptake, basically in fourth line plus with some share even in third line. And I think that's really important for us as we think about even earlier trials moving up lines of therapy. But I think the data with the overall survival that we've shown, in addition to the work that we've done in metastatic TNBC also showing overall survival has really helped, because we\u2019ve had strong awareness, obviously, of Trodelvy in the community as well as in academic centers, and the extended field team work that we did last year has really helped us make sure that we solidified the launch of HR positive HER-2 negative. So still early, we only have a couple of months in. But definitely on the right track and we're really seeing physicians understand the benefits of Trodelvy and what they can bring for their patients in this setting. Merdad?\nMerdad Parsey: Yeah. And then in terms of the ASCENT-07. Look, as we design and move into earlier lines of therapy in that study, as you know, we're going to be looking at chemo-naive population. And we do anticipate that study getting started in the second half of this year. So things are moving along very nicely, and we are really excited about that program. The final details in terms of design will be rolled out. I think we're crossing the [indiscernible] right now in terms of that final protocol. So you'll see that posted and available in short order.\nJacquie Ross: Nadia, may we have our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question goes to Chris Schott of JP Morgan. Chris, please go ahead, your line is open.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the question. I just had one on OpEx, can you just talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about Gilead's operating costs going forward? It sounds like you are obviously accelerating some R&D programs and we've got this double-digit step-up in R&D this year. As we think about operating margin dynamics kind of going forward. I guess off of the 2023 levels, can we start to think about margin expansion going forward, or do we need to maybe think about another year or two of investment before we can think about margin expansion for the company? Thank you.\nAndrew Dickinson: Hey, Chris, it's Andy Dickinson. Thanks for the question. That's a great question. Maybe just stepping back, again, highlight and reinforce that we've built a large and diverse portfolio that really positions us for significant growth, both in the short-term as well as in the long-run. As you heard in our prepared remarks, we're really investing and kind of leading into that, we had an accelerated -- significant focused efforts to accelerate some of our clinical development, which is starting to pay dividends. You're also seeing the validation of this approach in our commercial results that Johanna highlighted and the strength across our base business. So to your point, we are now this year, I think we already have 22 Phase 3 trials underway, which is significantly more than we have as a company, historically. It's actually frankly a healthy level, I highlighted in my comments that this year we're targeting kind of low 20's percentage point of revenue for our R&D investment. And that's a reasonably good place to be. We believe it's on line with peers over the long-run, there will be years when we have expenses that are greater than that, and years lower. But over the cycle, I think that's kind of what we're targeting. So -- and then maybe to your question on operating margin, we still have a very healthy operating margin, as you know. Again, there's apples and oranges comparisons with the new IP R&D rules. But we do expect to see our operating margin strengthened again over time, as we get through this bolus of Phase 3 trials that we have underway and that drives growth above and beyond what you've already seen in the last 18 months, which we think is off to a great start. So more to come, it's going to take a little more time to get through it, to your point, but we're in a very good spot from our perspective.\nJacquie Ross: Nadia, may we have our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question goes you Salveen Richter of Goldman Sachs. Salveen please go ahead, your line is open.\nUnidentified Participant: Good afternoon, this is [indiscernible] on for Salveen. Thanks for taking our question just on the TIGIT combo data at ASCO. How do you view this update? Is it more incremental? And then just on the Roche OS data, which is now expected in 3Q. How much read through do you anticipate on that front? Thank you.\nDaniel O'Day: Yeah, thanks. What we have said and I think what we're planning is, we will have an updated dataset from a more recent cut. So there'll be additional data compared with what was presented, what we talked about last year at the ASCO plenary. And so, there should be more mature data with a larger patient population. And so that should help reinforce our confidence. In terms of the Roche data, I think it's a great question. Look, I think, we believe in our own data, as well as, all the other public data that are out there in terms of TIGIT bringing benefit certainly in terms of response rates and other parameters. Certainly, in our dataset we've seen those PFS benefit. And our expectation is that the Roche data will continue to demonstrate benefit TIGIT -- adding TIGIT to PD-1 inhibitors, so -- PD-L1 inhibitors in their case. So we will be looking forward to seeing those OS data and I think that should help to provide additional confidence to all the TIGIT antibodies out there.\nJacquie Ross: Nadia, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question goes to Geoff Meacham of Bank of America. Geoff, please go ahead, your line is open.\nGeoff Meacham: Great. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Merdad, you guys have been very successful commercially with Kite and it looks like the pipeline has some logical next steps in terms of liquid tumors. I guess, what I wanted to ask you is, what's your appetite for leveraging the expertise to look at non-oncology indications like rare diseases or maybe towards solid tumors? And why do you think the field is mostly evaluated at the same targets and myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia, et cetera? Thank you.\nMerdad Parsey: Thanks, Geoff. Very complicated question. I'll try to give a very brief answer. Look, I think that leveraging the engineered T-Cells so far in hematology has demonstrated really great efficacy and a reasonable tolerability profile for that patient population. I think it's all about therapeutic index. As you start to go into broader indications where treatment options are different and the disease state is different. I think they are different considerations for therapeutic index. So, as we look into different populations, we're going to keep a very close eye on the appropriate therapeutic index for a given patient, whether you're talking about lupus or anything else outside of oncology related to your question. From our perspective, maybe the broader perspective that I would offer is that, we do believe that modulating the immune system will lead to better outcomes in-patients, whether you're talking about agonizing or antagonizing and in hematologic disorders, we do believe that getting to better and more targeted immune blockade is going to be better for patients. And so, from our perspective there is not only to cell therapy in play and I think that's what we like about our portfolio is that, we have -- we're not modality restricted, and you've seen the deals we've done, we have our BTLA antibody and the rest of our portfolio in inflammation. So we are going to be pursuing the best outcome for patients regardless of modality and certainly, cell therapy will be one of those.\nJacquie Ross: Nadia, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question goes to Terrence Flynn of Morgan Stanley. Terrence, please go ahead, your line is open.\nTerence Flynn: Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. Just one from me on Yescarta. I was wondering if you can give us any more color in terms of the breakdown between second-line versus third-line right now. Obviously, you're seeing some nice momentum. And then, on the manufacturing footprint, maybe just any color there in terms of total number of patients you can supply in a year. Obviously, that's been an issue for some of the other CAR-T therapies out there, but just want to understand kind of longer-term supply dynamics. Thank you.\nJohanna Mercier: Sure. So let me start and then maybe Andy can touch on the manufacturing piece of the puzzle. So thanks for the question, Terrence. I think what we've seen is really strong growth across second-line and third-line, and obviously, a little slower coming into second-line, but we are seeing nice momentum in the second-line as well and I think the OS data from ZUMA-7 coming through, that will be presented at ASCO that will only help continue that and really differentiated versus current standard-of-care. And -- but what we have seen is growth that has really picked-up quite nicely and you're seeing it both in U.S., as well as, Europe and really happy to say actually although we just got recent approval for second-line in Europe late last year, we're getting a lot of markets coming in from reimbursement, accelerating reimbursement because of the importance of the data for patients, and actually one example of that is actually just today with the NICE approval for a second-line therapy with Yescarta. And so we're very excited about where this is going. There's still a lot of growth opportunity in second-line. And obviously, the team is really working diligently to make sure that physicians are well-educated to make sure that they understand the benefits and the overall survival over long-term for these patients. So more to come on that. And with that, I'll turn it over to Andy for manufacturing.\nAndrew Dickinson: Yeah. Thanks Johanna. And hey Terrence, nice to talk to you again. On manufacturing, what I would say is, that\u2019s a real area of competitive strength for Kite for us. As you know, we have three approved manufacturing centers globally, two in the United States, one on each coast, and then the one in the Netherlands. All of them are fully operational, we're already moving in our Maryland facility to partial automation of our manufacturing process, which is off to a great start and we just have an outstanding team. So we have not had capacity constraints, either on the manufacturing of the cells or on the viral vectors. So remember, we have both an outsourced and an internal viral vector supply, we made a vector -- our own viral vector on our Oceanside, California biologics facility. So I don't think, Terence, we've shared specifically the capacity of our manufacturing footprint, but rest assured, we have adequate capacity to serve the market today. Our team does a great job of forecasting where the market is going. We're always one or two steps ahead and we don't expect that to change. So from a manufacturing standpoint, the Kite team has just really done an outstanding job.\nJacquie Ross: Nadia, may we have our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question goes to Tim Anderson of Wolfe Research. Tim, please go ahead, your line is open.\nUnidentified Participant: Hi, thanks for taking my question. This is Adam on behalf of Tim. No on Biktarvy, it doesn't need exclusivity over the next decade, but it's possible, gets targeted by the IRA before done. We know that [indiscernible] accounts are limited portion of Biktarvy\u2019s volume and is it possible that the pricing impact extends to commercial patients? Also the other aspect to the IRA that you think investors are discounting beyond the negotiation. Thanks.\nJohanna Mercier: I'll take that one, Adam. So yes, we do believe that the IRA will have an impact on Biktarvy. Although we do believe it will be later this decade. And probably the earliest could be 2028 or so. The -- again, what you said is absolutely true. It is only on our Medicare business and, obviously, there is a lot of things that can happen between now and then. It's still early in understanding exactly how it's going to play-out, including the pricing negotiations that will happen. As to the spillover effect that you mentioned. We believe that we've had situations, obviously, in other channels today, where we have higher discounts in our commercial channels, and we've been able to manage that specific to the patient populations within those channels. And so, we believe we be able to do that again and mitigate the risk of spillover. And -- so yes, so I think that that kind of what we're managing in addition to the fact that our portfolio as much as Biktarvy is out to 2033 and that will I think really continue to be the standard-of-care for daily orals. We're also expanding our portfolio as you think about where we're going with lenacapavir here, we have different combinations in treatment and obviously with our convention work. So more to come on that, but I think we're more than prepared to manage the situation and have a couple of more years to figure out some of the different dynamics within the IRA.\nJacquie Ross: May we have our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question goes to Umer Raffat of Evercore. Umer, please go-ahead, your line is open.\nUmer Raffat: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I want to touch up on Trodelvy real quick in terms of how the prescription trends are tracking in TNBC in particular, especially in light of your competitor, Daiichi, saying they now have number one patient share in HER2-low and growing. So I'm just curious how that's shaking out, because I know you've got a new indication this quarter. And secondly also, there's a lot of renewed interest in CAR-T, especially as it relates to immunology. But as I think of immunology and the price points, maybe 3 times HUMIRA, so that will be $150,000. But conversely, I would imagine each cell therapy dose would be at least $100,000. So how do you think about economics as you head into potentially immunology indications? Thank you very much.\nJohanna Mercier: Umer, I'll take the first part of that specific to Trodelvy and what we're seeing in TNBC and metastatic MDC. So what we've seen is actually continued growth in TNBC for Trodelvy, and really that has a lot to do with the expansion of our field stores, but also the continued data that comes through, right? The OS data in TNBC is one piece of the puzzle. The other piece is obviously the OS that we've shown also in HR-positive. So, really the breast cancer community understanding Trodelvy better in that space. We haven't split the market and neither have physicians at this point really split the market between HER2-low kind of population. So what we look at is each indication, TNBC and HR-positive/HER2-negative. And what we're seeing in metastatic TNBC in the lines of therapy that is second line plus is really Trodelvy established itself as the standard of care in this setting, and it continues to do that. So I do think, just remembering in TNBC, the split between IHC 0 and IHC 1 and 2 is 65-35. So much more represented -- so less represented by maybe some of our competitors. Having said that, we work across a spectrum, which I think is really important to remember. So that's the Trodelvy dynamics right now in metastatic TNBC.\nDaniel O'Day: Great, Umer. This is Dan O'Day too. I think -- I appreciate your question on the second one. I'll dovetail on to what Merdad said before about the importance of therapeutic index. But before I do that, let me just articulate the tremendous benefit that CAR-T is providing a large B-cell lymphoma from a pharmaeconomic standpoint. The fact that we now have patients in very late-stage disease, 50% of them surviving up to five years and essentially a flat line survival curve, you can imagine the benefit from both a mortality perspective and cost of the system of the current price point in large B-cell lymphoma. I think any price point in other therapeutic areas would be based upon the clinical benefit that, that brings to those particular patients. Of course, we understand that this wouldn't necessarily be a broad-scale use across all different types of patients. There will be patient segments where the therapeutic index is more important. And for those patients, we would look at the level of benefit that brings, both to the patient and to the health care system and then price it accordingly, of course. So I think it's hypothetical at this stage. But given the benefit that we're seeing in cancer, we would take the same approach to other disease states.\nJacquie Ross: As we move to our next question just another reminder, please limit yourself to one question. We do have 10 folks still hoping to ask a question on the call, and we'd like to get to as many as possible. So with that Nadia, may we have our next question, please.\nOperator: Of course, the next question goes to Tyler Van Buren of Cowen, Tyler. Please go-ahead, your line is open.\nTyler Van Buren: Great, thank you very much for taking the question. I guess given Legend's tremendous top line data leak in the second line, I figured I would ask for your latest thoughts on that opportunity and how you plan to differentiate in that setting with the Arcellx program.\nAndrew Dickinson: Hey, Tyler, it's Andy Dickinson. I'll take the question on behalf of the Kite team. Obviously, we and others want to see the full data set. We read the same releases that you've read. And we continue to believe that Arcellx and now Kite have a very interesting program that has the potential to be very competitive in that area to get on par or better potentially than the J&J Legend product. And as Dan said earlier, it doesn't come as a surprise to us that cell therapy is delivering that magnitude of benefit to patients across different disease areas. And it's exciting to see where cell therapy may go in terms of becoming the standard of care in second-line BCMA potentially over time, which, of course, increases the size of the potential opportunity for the Arcellx and Kite team. So look forward to seeing more on the data, look forward to carrying our program forward together with Arcellx team and to updating you over time. But certainly, it looks like a fantastic data set and great for patients.\nJacquie Ross: Thanks, Nadia. Our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question goes to Hartaj Singh of Oppenheimer & Co. Hartaj. Please go-ahead, your line is open.\nHartaj Singh: Great, thank you. Thanks for the question. I just had a quick question on Trodelvy in non-small cell lung cancer. I know those trials are still about a year or two years from reading out. But guys, can you just remind us of the scientific rationale behind Trodelvy in non-small cell lung cancer and just to opine a little bit on just the EVOKE-01 and 03 trials? Thank you.\nMerdad Parsey: Sure. Hartaj. Yes, I think there are several things that we -- give us a lot of confidence in terms of moving forward in non-small cell lung cancer. Certainly, the distribution of Trop-2 has demonstrated broad expression in non-small cell lung cancer, not too dissimilar from breast cancer. And so I think that gives us a lot of incentive to believe that the expression of Trop-2 in those tumors is going to give us efficacy by delivering the payload to those cells. Secondly, we've seen both internal and external data for Trop-2 targeted ADCs that support the value of bringing Trop-2 directed antibody drug conjugate to non-small cell lung cancer. So our approach, which has been broad and we're very excited about it. I think, is going really well is we are, as you know, in EVOKE-01 going into second line non-small cell lung cancer, and that study is going very well. We are then as well looking in front-line lung cancer in our other trials and looking at combinations of PD-1s with Trodelvy in those tumors in non-small cell. And we think that the potential for Trodelvy in those tumors is very high. We believe that we'll start to see those data start to roll out from our second-line studies first, as you would imagine. And then we'll continue to build on that as we go.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you. May we have our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question goes you Brian Skorney of RW Baird. Brian, please go ahead, your line is open.\nCharlie More: All right, thanks for taking my question. This is Charlie More on for Brian. I had a question about lenacapavir. So with regards to the recent data with the BmAb, it seemed like one case out of 20 experienced a viral rebound. So I was wondering how that might inform which combinations you are thinking about moving forward with regarding overcoming resistance. And kind of along that same line, what kind of expectations do you have for the size of the long-acting market in HIV? Thank you.\nMerdad Parsey: Yes. Very important that, that breakthrough was not associated with lenacapavir resistance, right? And I think that's really important to keep in mind. Look, BmAbs are relatively new clinical tools to look for, options for people in terms of treating HIV. And it's one of the many approaches we're taking. Our approach has been to move a broader portfolio of small molecules to complement that early foray into long-acting with BmAbs, where we believe that the tried and true mechanisms that we have used, again, both orally or parenterally, should provide us with an opportunity to bring treatment options to people living with HIV that will be associated with low resistance rates and high efficacy. So that's what we're testing out. As we find the ideal partners, and I use the plural intentionally, we will be moving that forward. And so, I would look at those -- the BmAb data as early -- an early first approach to a long-acting treatment for people living with HIV. A - Johanna Mercier And maybe just to cover, Charlie, the second part of your question around the size of the market. So I'm going to split it out. When you think about the market from a treatment standpoint, we do believe that the long-acting market, probably by the end of this decade, will look about 50-50 or so. We think that there are definitely patients out there that are looking for us not to be reminded that they have HIV and an opportunity to think about the next-generation long-acting to really bring to patients what they're looking for. I think that's the kind of the last unmet medical need in this space at this point in time. I also think Biktarvy will continue to be the standard of care in the daily oral market, where there's still a lot of patients that actually do want to take their medicine every single day to make sure that they know that they're taking something to put at bay their HIV. Just to touch on the expansion from a PrEP standpoint, I just wanted -- the prevention market, very different in our view. And some discussions we've had with community partners and people that are at risk of HIV, what we're seeing here is probably the split is different, but the market expansion is also very different. So the split is probably going to go towards 70-30 by the end of this decade is what we assume. That has a lot to do with the fact that these are not patients, these are people at risk, and they don't necessarily want to take a pill a day for something they don't have. And so that makes a lot of sense. So something every six months aligned with physician visits could be an ideal scenario in this setting. And then from an expansion standpoint, as you all know, we've talked about this a lot. If you look at the CDC assumptions around the number of people that are at risk in the U.S., we've only kind of captured about 25% of those folks that are currently under medication. And unfortunately, there's still 75% that are not and that are at risk. And so there's an incredible opportunity, especially with something every six months, to really expand in this marketplace and make sure that we truly work together to end this epidemic. So, very exciting times to come. And within the next two years, hopefully, we'll have lenacapavir as the data reads out and approvals in prevention and then just a bit after that in treatment with different partners that Merdad was mentioning. So very exciting time.\nJacquie Ross: Super. We\u2019ll move to our next question please, Nadia.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question goes to Steve Seedhouse of Raymond James. Steve, please go ahead, your line is open.\nRyan Deschner: Hi there, this is Ryan Deschner on for Steve Seedhouse. Thanks for the question. Just curious with the current nonhospitalized versus hospitalized usage split for the Veklury. And do you anticipate a large amount of potential cannibalization in the nonhospitalized usage coming from remdesivir if its clinical development is successful? Thanks.\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks. So Ryan, I'll take that question. So what we have seen in the last year or so is somewhat of a lessening of the severity of infections, and therefore, from a hospitalization standpoint, obviously, less hospitalizations as well. So we've seen a couple of different things. So obviously, much more non hospitalizations of late, and we've seen that obviously in the numbers because as you well know, that Veklury tracks very closely to hospitalization. And what we've seen is, despite the fact that hospitalizations have come down versus our expectations in Q1, the actual usage of Veklury has gone up. And that's super interesting. And a lot of that has to do with the strength of the data that keeps delivering for Veklury around the updates of guidelines, the strength of our data, real-world data that's come out continuously showing reduction in mortality and reduction in readmissions to hospitalization. So very powerful data, but definitely a bit of a play there. This is -- our outpatient use with Veklury is still quite small, in the single digit or so. Having said that, it is growing. But it's really the only antiviral that is approved in hospitalized setting for COVID-19. And so that continues to drive. I think as we think about our oral COVID program, I think we are thinking more the nonhospitalized setting, which I think would then complement what we have in our portfolio that works really nicely both in the nonhospitalized setting and the hospitalized setting to make sure that patients at risk have what they need if they do get infected.\nJacquie Ross: Nadia, may we have our next caller, please.\nOperator: Yes. The next question goes to Olivia Brayer of Cantor Fitzgerald. Olivia please go ahead, your line is open.\nOlivia Brayer: Hey, good afternoon and thank you for the question. Have you guys started to think through a commercial rollout strategy for magrolimab, especially when you look beyond the initial academic centers? And is there anything you can do to help drive initial adoption for -- of transfusion guidelines in that community setting specifically?\nJohanna Mercier: So I'll take that one, Olivia. As we think about magro, we are excited, obviously. We're waiting for the data to read out. But we are excited, and we have started thinking about our commercial model for sure. I think a couple of pieces to that one. One is the strength of the community and making sure we understand kind of what that looks like, but also the strength that Kite brings in this play as well. So we're not starting from scratch, right? We are going to -- we partner very closely with our Kite colleagues to make sure that there's a lot of learnings there that I think we can apply and a lot of overlap from a physician standpoint that also that we've been working through. So a lot of those pieces are in play. And the last piece I would say, just to add to the commercial model and our thinking, also has to do with the fact that we're also trying to get ahead of the game and better understanding, right? These are diseases that sometimes community physicians will not see on a regular basis and how do we make sure that we understand the when and where and making sure that the commercial model support that timing as well and being a little bit smarter in our approach from an execution standpoint. So, all those pieces are coming into play. But obviously, we're excited and anxious for the data. But we will be sure that we are ready for not only the data, but the approvals as well.\nJacquie Ross: Naida, will try and squeeze in just a few more here.\nOperator: Of course, the next question goes to Colin Bristow of UBS. Colin, please go ahead, your line is open.\nUnidentified Participant: Hi, this is [Ting] (ph) on for Colin. Thanks for taking our question. So on magrolimab, can you specify how many interims were planned in total for the ENHANCE trial? And for the interim update in the back half of the year, will there be actual data disclosure or just a high-level update? And for -- and what's your expectation -- also, what's your expectation of the CR and overall survival for the azacitidine control arm? There were some chatters around other side of the arm outperformed Tekada's Phase III trial, where they used a more intensive dosing regimen. So what's your thought over this? Thank you.\nMerdad Parsey: Sure. Thanks for the question. So the -- in terms of the interim analysis, it's a good reminder that the study is powered for the final analysis. And so our expectation for any study that has interim analysis is that we run to the final analysis, which I think we've guided to occurring next year. When an interim analysis occurs, we generally will not see the data. Generally, what happens is that the DSMB will tell us to either continue or potentially discontinue. If -- obviously, we discontinue, we'd share that. But if it's just continue, we would continue the trial, and there will be nothing other than that to share because we don't have any data to share since we won't have seen it. So our expectation is that, we run to the end of the trial. It would certainly be upside if we saw something earlier than that. And then I think in terms of the expectations, you're absolutely right. I think everyone has looked at the Takeda data and are wary as to the efficacy of azacitidine in performing in that patient population. And so we're going to have to wait and see what that looks like at the end of the trial. I'm -- I guess, buttressed by the fact that we have -- the DSMB has told us to continue the trial, it gives me a little bit of more confidence that we are going to see a treatment effect. But that's a very indirect assessment. So we're going to have to see. But we are powered for -- we've made some assumptions in terms of how we power the trial. So hopefully, we'll be able to detect the difference between the two.\nJacquie Ross: Nadia, may be just time for one last question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question guys Mohit Bansal of Wells Fargo. Mohit. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nMohit Bansal : Great. Thank you for taking my question. And maybe a question on BD at this point. I mean, how are you thinking about BD? I know in the past, you talked about there's no urgency there, and you could be thinking about tuck-in. But has anything changed at this point now that you're in a good position with the growth coming back? Is there an updated thought there?\nAndrew Dickinson: Mohit, it's Andy. Thank you for the question. Nothing's changed from our recent updates. I mean we think that BD is an important part of the puzzle for us going forward. It's important to continue to bring new and exciting innovation and products into our portfolio over time. We don't expect that to stop. That said, and to your point, we have made extraordinary progress over the last four years that we're really proud of. And so the breadth -- given the breadth and depth of our pipeline, you should expect that we will do less over the coming years than we did over the last three or four years. But we will still be active. And what we've said recently and I'd reinforce is that we will do ordinary course licensing deals. Obviously, you saw the Community and Arcellx deals last year. We've talked about the Merrell Bio deal, all of which we're very excited about. And then we expect from time to time to do small acquisitions. But our portfolio, to your point, is in a great spot. We're very excited about what that's going to do to drive growth, and we will always look for opportunities to add to it, if we can, in a thoughtful way that we think will benefit patients and our shareholders. But that's the way I would think about it at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. That's all the questions we have time for today. I'll now hand back to Dan for any closing comments.\nDaniel O'Day: Thank you so much. I just want to thank you all for joining today for your continued interest in Gilead. Look, bottom line is we've had a very strong start to the year building on the momentum from 2022. And we collectively at Gilead and Kite believe we have a very strong and firm foundation for continued growth in 2023.

            "content": "Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. The Gilead team continued its track-record of strong commercial and clinical execution in the first quarter of 2023. Our base business grew at 15% excluding Veklury, with total product sales of $6.3 billion, reflecting outperformance across the portfolio. On a year-over-year basis, roughly two-thirds of the $735 million increase in our base business sales were driven by HIV and the other third was driven by oncology. Once again, we're seeing the tangible impact of our transformation, and the successful diversification of our business. We saw a year-over-year growth in HIV up 13%, liver disease, which includes therapies for HCV, HBV and HDV up 6%, cell therapy up 64% and Trodelvy up 52%. As expected, Veklury revenues continued to track lower rates of COVID-19 hospitalizations. As a result, revenue of $573 million was down 63% from the first quarter of last year. On the clinical side, we received another FDA approval for Trodelvy in early February. This latest approval was for a third indication, pretreated HR positive HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer. Its early days, but this has been a very strong commercial launch for Trodelvy in the U.S. so far. This further highlights the critical patient need that Trodelvy is addressing in this late-stage population, as well as the effectiveness of our commercial oncology team. We continue to prepare for Trodelvy's approval in pretreated HR positive HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer in Europe in the second half of this year. Another key milestone for the quarter was the announcement of the primary overall survival data from the landmark Phase 3 ZUMA-7 study. Yescarta is now the first and only treatment in nearly 30 years to show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival for initial treatment of relapsed or refractory Large B-cell lymphoma patients versus historical standard-of-care in a curative setting. Full results will be presented at this year's ASCO. Turning to clinical progress in virology, we continue to add to the body of evidence for lenacapavir's effectiveness as part of a six-month subcutaneous therapy. At this year's CROI, the team shared positive Phase 1b data on the investigational lenacapavir and bNAb combination. The bNAb combination is, of course, just one of the eight long-acting combination options that we're exploring for lenacapavir and we are pleased with our progress so far. In the meantime, following our first approval of lenacapavir as Sunlenca for heavily treatment experienced people living with HIV, we are seeing strong engagement from KOLs and physicians who are interested in the full potential of lenacapavir for prevention and treatment. As you know, this first approval addresses a significant unmet need for a small number of people living with HIV, who have very limited options available to them. And we look forward to making lenacapavir available to many more people, beginning with the potential approval and prevention in the 2025 timeframe. We see lenacapavir as having the most promising potential yet in the ongoing efforts to end the HIV epidemic, and we're looking forward to working with others to make it broadly available as soon as possible. With that, I'll hand over to Johanna for a review of our first quarter commercial performance. Johanna? Thanks, Andy. Before we open for Q&A I'll just summarize our prepared remarks by noting that this is another quarter where we demonstrated the continued impact of our transformation. Going-forward, we are committed to building on the track record of strong commercial and clinical execution that we've shown in recent quarters, thanks to the dedication to Gilead and Kite teams, around the world. With this positive momentum, we look-forward to delivering on our portfolio, while maintaining financial discipline. With that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A. Thanks for the questions. So in terms of the competitor Trop-2 data, I think it's a little early for us to be doing comparisons across data we haven't seen yet. We're really comfortable with the data we've already shown and have certainly led to approvals in breast cancer with OS benefit. So, you can see from the uptake of Trodelvy in the breast cancer market that being approved and having those OS data has had an impact for patients and we're very comfortable with where we are. Of course, we'll keep an eye on those emerging data as they become available, and every indication. And then in terms of the long-acting orals, as you know, we have a number of programs in the clinic for our long-acting portfolio, both oral and injectable, and we've moved several of them, including an oral program into the clinic and we'll be sharing those data as they become available. Very excited about that. That portfolio we remain committed to and, really excited about our long-acting portfolio to do -- to leverage [lenacapavir] (ph) profile to go into both oral long-acting as well as parenteral long-acting formulation. So stay-tuned as those data develop, we'll gladly share. Thanks so much. Brian, Dan O'Day here. I'm going to have Johanna answer the first part of your question and then Merdad the second Thank you. Yeah, thanks. What we have said and I think what we're planning is, we will have an updated dataset from a more recent cut. So there'll be additional data compared with what was presented, what we talked about last year at the ASCO plenary. And so, there should be more mature data with a larger patient population. And so that should help reinforce our confidence. In terms of the Roche data, I think it's a great question. Look, I think, we believe in our own data, as well as, all the other public data that are out there in terms of TIGIT bringing benefit certainly in terms of response rates and other parameters. Certainly, in our dataset we've seen those PFS benefit. And our expectation is that the Roche data will continue to demonstrate benefit TIGIT -- adding TIGIT to PD-1 inhibitors, so -- PD-L1 inhibitors in their case. So we will be looking forward to seeing those OS data and I think that should help to provide additional confidence to all the TIGIT antibodies out there. Great, Umer. This is Dan O'Day too. I think -- I appreciate your question on the second one. I'll dovetail on to what Merdad said before about the importance of therapeutic index. But before I do that, let me just articulate the tremendous benefit that CAR-T is providing a large B-cell lymphoma from a pharmaeconomic standpoint. The fact that we now have patients in very late-stage disease, 50% of them surviving up to five years and essentially a flat line survival curve, you can imagine the benefit from both a mortality perspective and cost of the system of the current price point in large B-cell lymphoma. I think any price point in other therapeutic areas would be based upon the clinical benefit that, that brings to those particular patients. Of course, we understand that this wouldn't necessarily be a broad-scale use across all different types of patients. There will be patient segments where the therapeutic index is more important. And for those patients, we would look at the level of benefit that brings, both to the patient and to the health care system and then price it accordingly, of course. So I think it's hypothetical at this stage. But given the benefit that we're seeing in cancer, we would take the same approach to other disease states. Thank you so much. I just want to thank you all for joining today for your continued interest in Gilead. Look, bottom line is we've had a very strong start to the year building on the momentum from 2022. And we collectively at Gilead and Kite believe we have a very strong and firm foundation for continued growth in 2023. As usual, if we didn't get to your questions or you have additional follow-up questions, please reach out to Jacquie and the IR team, and we'd be more than happy to support you. Thank you very much for joining."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Johanna Mercier",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. The commercial organization delivered a very strong start to the year and continued to build on the momentum we saw in 2022, to set a firm foundation for continued execution and growth in 2023. As our results show on Slide 7, each of our core franchises delivered year-over-year growth led by HIV and oncology, and total product sales excluding Veklury totaled $5.7 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Including Veklury, total product sales were $6.3 billion, down 3% driven by lower Veklury sales associated with fewer COVID-19 hospitalizations. On Slide 8, HIV sales were up 13% year-over-year to $4.2 billion, driven by favorable pricing dynamics, higher demand and lower inventory drawdowns. Quarter-over-quarter, sales were down 12%, associated with the normal seasonality we typically experience in first quarter. As a reminder, at the start of the year, patient co-pays and deductibles reset, which had an impact on average realized prices and market growth. We expect these pricing impacts to normalize through the remainder of the year. And we also see typically a buildup in inventory in the fourth quarter, followed by meaningful inventory drawdowns in the first quarter. Following a focused effort to better manage this dynamic, we're pleased to see less of an impact than we have historically on both a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, highlighting our goal of better matching product delivery with end user demand. We expect these efforts to contribute to a more stable quarter-over-quarter growth in our HIV business, as compared to prior years. Turning to Sunlenca. First quarter sales of $4 million was very much in-line with our expectations. Sunlenca is an important option for the small number of people living with HIV who have developed resistance and have few, if any, other options. We are leveraging the launch to engage with providers and the community ahead of lenacapavir's potential launches in prevention and treatment. Overall, the HIV treatment market grew approximately 2% year-over-year in the U.S., and almost 4% in Europe, tracking in-line with our expectations for annual growth of 2% to 3%. And in prevention, awareness continues to grow with the US PrEP market up over 19% year-over-year. Moving to Slide 9. Biktarvy sales of $2.7 billion were up 24% year-over-year, driven by higher demand, as well as favorable pricing and inventory dynamics. Biktarvy continues to cement itself as the therapy of choice for people living with HIV, now capturing a treatment market-share of 46% in the U.S., up 3% year-over-year, and representing a growth rate that has impressively outpaced new and existing regimens. Moreover, Biktarvy has maintained its leading position for new starts across the U.S., Europe and other major markets, as well as in treatment switches across most major markets, including the US. On Descovy, sales were $449 million in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year. Demand for Descovy for PrEP remained strong at 14% year-over-year. Descovy for PrEP once again maintained its greater than 40% market share. The continued resilience of our PrEP business despite availability of other prevention options, including generics, provides a solid foundation as we make progress towards the potential approval and launch of lenacapavir for PrEP. Moving to slide 10. The Liver disease portfolio was up 6% year-over-year to $675 million, highlighting the continuing contribution of our viral hepatitis medicines to patients and the Gilead portfolio. In HCV, sales were $445 million, up 12% year-over-year, driven by favorable pricing dynamics and timing of purchases by the Department of Corrections. HBV and HDV sales we're $230 million, down 2% year-over-year, primarily due to pricing dynamics outside of the U.S. We continue to expect HCV start to trend down over time, given the curative nature of therapy, with some offset from HBV and HDV. In the meantime, we are pleased to observe solid and stable market shares across all of our Liver portfolio. On to Slide 11, and as we expected, Veklury sales of $573 million were down year-over-year, and sequentially, as COVID-related infections became less severe and hospitalizations remain below peak levels. As a reminder, the winter surge occurred earlier than we had expected, beginning in the fourth quarter and lasting only through the beginning of Q1. As Veklury's use tracks hospitalization, it's sales are volatile and highly subject to surges and the overall path of the pandemic. Veklury is backed by clinical data and real-world evidence that reinforces its clinical profile and despite the lower hospitalization rates in the quarter, Veklury's share of hospitalized patients treated for COVID-19 grew modestly, maintaining well over 50% share in the United States. Moving to oncology and beginning with Trodelvy on Slide 12. Sales of $222 million were up 52% year-over-year and 14% sequentially, driven by strong growth both in the U.S. and Europe. Following U.S. approval in early-February, we're off to a strong start with Trodelvy in pretreated HR positive HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer, as some clinicians moved quickly to make this new option available for patients in this setting. We look forward to extending Trodelvy's reach to these patients in Europe, where a decision is expected later this year. Of course, our efforts here are underpinned by the successes and learnings in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer with TNBC. From our expansion of the field force last year and a strong body of data across a number of tumor types, more physicians are recognizing Trodelvy's clinically meaningful overall survival benefit. This recognition is not just in metastatic TNBC, but also in HR positive HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer regardless of HER-2 negative status. Now on to slide 13. Cell therapy sales in the first quarter were $448 million, up 64% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter. We're pleased with the continued growth of Yescarta, with sales up 70% Year-over-year to $359 million, primarily driven by growth in the second and third-line setting for relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. Sequentially, sales were up 6%, driven in-part by strong demand and favorable pricing dynamics, both primarily in Europe. Turning to Tecartus. Sales were $89 million, up 40% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, driven by growing demand for both relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Looking ahead, we continue to work to raise awareness of cell therapies and increase cost share. We believe that compelling data including ZUMA-7's recent positive overall survival results, in addition to peer dataset in the cell therapy space will support broader adoption over time. In summary, it's been a positive start to the year with our current product portfolio of virology and oncology medicines, delivering strong performance. We look forward to maintaining this momentum through the rest of the year and beyond. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline. Merdad? Thanks, Dan. So basically, we really pleased with the early launch results that we've seen so far in HR positive HER-2 negative. And what we've been seeing is strong initial uptake, basically in fourth line plus with some share even in third line. And I think that's really important for us as we think about even earlier trials moving up lines of therapy. But I think the data with the overall survival that we've shown, in addition to the work that we've done in metastatic TNBC also showing overall survival has really helped, because we've had strong awareness, obviously, of Trodelvy in the community as well as in academic centers, and the extended field team work that we did last year has really helped us make sure that we solidified the launch of HR positive HER-2 negative. So still early, we only have a couple of months in. But definitely on the right track and we're really seeing physicians understand the benefits of Trodelvy and what they can bring for their patients in this setting. Merdad? Sure. So let me start and then maybe Andy can touch on the manufacturing piece of the puzzle. So thanks for the question, Terrence. I think what we've seen is really strong growth across second-line and third-line, and obviously, a little slower coming into second-line, but we are seeing nice momentum in the second-line as well and I think the OS data from ZUMA-7 coming through, that will be presented at ASCO that will only help continue that and really differentiated versus current standard-of-care. And -- but what we have seen is growth that has really picked-up quite nicely and you're seeing it both in U.S., as well as, Europe and really happy to say actually although we just got recent approval for second-line in Europe late last year, we're getting a lot of markets coming in from reimbursement, accelerating reimbursement because of the importance of the data for patients, and actually one example of that is actually just today with the NICE approval for a second-line therapy with Yescarta. And so we're very excited about where this is going. There's still a lot of growth opportunity in second-line. And obviously, the team is really working diligently to make sure that physicians are well-educated to make sure that they understand the benefits and the overall survival over long-term for these patients. So more to come on that. And with that, I'll turn it over to Andy for manufacturing. I'll take that one, Adam. So yes, we do believe that the IRA will have an impact on Biktarvy. Although we do believe it will be later this decade. And probably the earliest could be 2028 or so. The -- again, what you said is absolutely true. It is only on our Medicare business and, obviously, there is a lot of things that can happen between now and then. It's still early in understanding exactly how it's going to play-out, including the pricing negotiations that will happen. As to the spillover effect that you mentioned. We believe that we've had situations, obviously, in other channels today, where we have higher discounts in our commercial channels, and we've been able to manage that specific to the patient populations within those channels. And so, we believe we be able to do that again and mitigate the risk of spillover. And -- so yes, so I think that that kind of what we're managing in addition to the fact that our portfolio as much as Biktarvy is out to 2033 and that will I think really continue to be the standard-of-care for daily orals. We're also expanding our portfolio as you think about where we're going with lenacapavir here, we have different combinations in treatment and obviously with our convention work. So more to come on that, but I think we're more than prepared to manage the situation and have a couple of more years to figure out some of the different dynamics within the IRA. Umer, I'll take the first part of that specific to Trodelvy and what we're seeing in TNBC and metastatic MDC. So what we've seen is actually continued growth in TNBC for Trodelvy, and really that has a lot to do with the expansion of our field stores, but also the continued data that comes through, right? The OS data in TNBC is one piece of the puzzle. The other piece is obviously the OS that we've shown also in HR-positive. So, really the breast cancer community understanding Trodelvy better in that space. We haven't split the market and neither have physicians at this point really split the market between HER2-low kind of population. So what we look at is each indication, TNBC and HR-positive/HER2-negative. And what we're seeing in metastatic TNBC in the lines of therapy that is second line plus is really Trodelvy established itself as the standard of care in this setting, and it continues to do that. So I do think, just remembering in TNBC, the split between IHC 0 and IHC 1 and 2 is 65-35. So much more represented -- so less represented by maybe some of our competitors. Having said that, we work across a spectrum, which I think is really important to remember. So that's the Trodelvy dynamics right now in metastatic TNBC. Thanks. So Ryan, I'll take that question. So what we have seen in the last year or so is somewhat of a lessening of the severity of infections, and therefore, from a hospitalization standpoint, obviously, less hospitalizations as well. So we've seen a couple of different things. So obviously, much more non hospitalizations of late, and we've seen that obviously in the numbers because as you well know, that Veklury tracks very closely to hospitalization. And what we've seen is, despite the fact that hospitalizations have come down versus our expectations in Q1, the actual usage of Veklury has gone up. And that's super interesting. And a lot of that has to do with the strength of the data that keeps delivering for Veklury around the updates of guidelines, the strength of our data, real-world data that's come out continuously showing reduction in mortality and reduction in readmissions to hospitalization. So very powerful data, but definitely a bit of a play there. This is -- our outpatient use with Veklury is still quite small, in the single digit or so. Having said that, it is growing. But it's really the only antiviral that is approved in hospitalized setting for COVID-19. And so that continues to drive. I think as we think about our oral COVID program, I think we are thinking more the nonhospitalized setting, which I think would then complement what we have in our portfolio that works really nicely both in the nonhospitalized setting and the hospitalized setting to make sure that patients at risk have what they need if they do get infected. So I'll take that one, Olivia. As we think about magro, we are excited, obviously. We're waiting for the data to read out. But we are excited, and we have started thinking about our commercial model for sure. I think a couple of pieces to that one. One is the strength of the community and making sure we understand kind of what that looks like, but also the strength that Kite brings in this play as well. So we're not starting from scratch, right? We are going to -- we partner very closely with our Kite colleagues to make sure that there's a lot of learnings there that I think we can apply and a lot of overlap from a physician standpoint that also that we've been working through. So a lot of those pieces are in play. And the last piece I would say, just to add to the commercial model and our thinking, also has to do with the fact that we're also trying to get ahead of the game and better understanding, right? These are diseases that sometimes community physicians will not see on a regular basis and how do we make sure that we understand the when and where and making sure that the commercial model support that timing as well and being a little bit smarter in our approach from an execution standpoint. So, all those pieces are coming into play. But obviously, we're excited and anxious for the data. But we will be sure that we are ready for not only the data, but the approvals as well."

            "name": "Andrew Dickinson",
            "content": "Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on Slide 21, the first quarter was a strong commercial start to the year, with total product sales, excluding Veklury, up 15% year-over-year despite continued FX headwinds. Overall, our base business demonstrated growth in each of our product families, including almost 60% growth in oncology, and 13% growth in HIV. Total product sales were $6.3 billion, down 3% due to lower Veklury sales, partially offset by growth in our base business. FX negatively impacted first quarter total product sales by $106 million, representing approximately 150 basis points of growth. Turning to Slide 22. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 86.2%, down 1.2 percentage points from last year, due to, among other things, the timing of the Biktarvy royalty initiation in the first quarter of 2022 and product mix, partially offset by inventory benefits. Moving to OpEx, expenses were higher than we anticipated in the first quarter due to R&D investments and inflationary pressures. Non-GAAP R&D was $1.4 billion, up 25% year-over-year, due to higher expenses, including the acceleration of certain late-stage clinical studies, as well as about $50 million in one-time items. As Merdad mentioned, we have started 10 new trials so far this year, including four Phase 3 programs. This brings the total number of ongoing Phase 3 studies to 22, highlighting the investment we are making in Gilead's future growth. Clinical trial enrollment for a number of new and ongoing Trodelvy and lenacapavir trials was faster than we expected, with a notable acceleration, for example, in certain lenacapavir trials in March. Our clinical team has been working hard to rapidly advance our studies and bring new therapeutic options to patients as fast as we can. This includes working to close the gap that some peers have in certain programs and we believe we are starting to see the impact of these acceleration efforts in our trials, although this did contribute to higher R&D expenses in the first quarter. Consistent with past practice, we will continue to manage expenses carefully, including the ongoing process of prioritizing programs based on potential impact and data. We have taken the last several years to build the most diverse and robust clinical pipeline in Gilead's history, now with well over 100 trials across our three targeted therapeutic areas. We are excited to see so many of these programs in later-stage trials with a number of data readouts building momentum over the next several years. Non-GAAP acquired IP R&D was $481 million, primarily driven by expenses related to our acquisition of Community, as well as upfront and milestone payments associated with the Arcellx and Nurix collaborations. Non-GAAP SG&A was $1.3 billion, up 22% year-over-year, primarily due to the commercial expansion and investments in our oncology business, in addition to higher branded prescription drug fee expenses and higher corporate expense that continue to be impacted by inflation. Moving to tax, our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the first quarter was 18.9%, lower than expected driven by discrete tax benefits recorded in the first quarter. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.37 in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $2.12 for the same period last year, reflecting higher operating expenses and lower product gross margin. I'll move now to guidance for the full year 2023 on Slide 23. There is no change to our revenue guidance. We continue to expect total product sales in the range of $26 billion to $26.5 billion and we continue to expect total product sales excluding Veklury in the range of $24 billion to $24.5 billion, representing growth of 4% to 6% for our base business year-over-year. On Veklury, the first quarter was modestly below our internal expectations and our $2 billion full year guidance assumes an increase in infections at some point later this year, not dissimilar from what we saw in 2022. We know from experience that COVID-19 related sales are extremely volatile and are leaving our guidance unchanged pending additional data points as we move through the year. Moving to the rest of the P&L. We continue to target non-GAAP product gross margin of approximately 86%, as discussed, we now expect full year 2023 non-GAAP R&D expenses to increase a low double-digit percentage compared to 2022. This resulted in an overall R&D investment for the full year in the low 20's as a percentage of total revenue. We believe this is a more appropriate level of investment for a company with a broad late-stage clinical portfolio that is targeting attractive opportunities and sustainable revenue growth. We continue to expect non-GAAP acquired IP R&D to be approximately $700 million, reflecting previously committed acquired IP R&D amounts. Similar to prior quarters, we will continue to include expected acquired IP R&D expenses as we announced additional transactions over the course of the year. Moving to non-GAAP SG&A, there is no change to our prior guidance, where we expect a full year declined by a low-single digit percentage compared to 2022. Although we will continue to look for opportunities to partially offset the higher R&D investments, we now plan for this year. Overall, there is no change to our expectations for non-GAAP operating income in the range of $11 billion to $11.6 billion. Additionally, there is no change to our tax guidance, and we continue to target a non-GAAP effective tax-rate of approximately 20%. And finally, we continue to expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $6.60 and $7 per share, reflecting, first, that the initial guidance model we shared with you in early-February allowed for a broad range of potential revenue and expense scenarios. And second, that we're committed to finding room in our overall P&L to absorb the higher R&D investments that we are choosing to prioritize in 2023. On a GAAP basis, we expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.75 to $5.15. Moving to Slide 24, you can see there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. We returned $1.4 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through our dividend and repurchase of shares. Finally, on business development, there is no change to our philosophy, we are very comfortable with the breadth and the quality of the pipeline that we've built, acquired or partnered and the growth it will enable in the coming years. With that in mind, you can expect us to continue to opportunistically access high quality assets through partnerships or to make smaller acquisitions in the normal course of business. And now, I'll hand it over to Dan for some closing remarks. Hey, Chris, it's Andy Dickinson. Thanks for the question. That's a great question. Maybe just stepping back, again, highlight and reinforce that we've built a large and diverse portfolio that really positions us for significant growth, both in the short-term as well as in the long-run. As you heard in our prepared remarks, we're really investing and kind of leading into that, we had an accelerated -- significant focused efforts to accelerate some of our clinical development, which is starting to pay dividends. You're also seeing the validation of this approach in our commercial results that Johanna highlighted and the strength across our base business. So to your point, we are now this year, I think we already have 22 Phase 3 trials underway, which is significantly more than we have as a company, historically. It's actually frankly a healthy level, I highlighted in my comments that this year we're targeting kind of low 20's percentage point of revenue for our R&D investment. And that's a reasonably good place to be. We believe it's on line with peers over the long-run, there will be years when we have expenses that are greater than that, and years lower. But over the cycle, I think that's kind of what we're targeting. So -- and then maybe to your question on operating margin, we still have a very healthy operating margin, as you know. Again, there's apples and oranges comparisons with the new IP R&D rules. But we do expect to see our operating margin strengthened again over time, as we get through this bolus of Phase 3 trials that we have underway and that drives growth above and beyond what you've already seen in the last 18 months, which we think is off to a great start. So more to come, it's going to take a little more time to get through it, to your point, but we're in a very good spot from our perspective. Yeah. Thanks Johanna. And hey Terrence, nice to talk to you again. On manufacturing, what I would say is, that's a real area of competitive strength for Kite for us. As you know, we have three approved manufacturing centers globally, two in the United States, one on each coast, and then the one in the Netherlands. All of them are fully operational, we're already moving in our Maryland facility to partial automation of our manufacturing process, which is off to a great start and we just have an outstanding team. So we have not had capacity constraints, either on the manufacturing of the cells or on the viral vectors. So remember, we have both an outsourced and an internal viral vector supply, we made a vector -- our own viral vector on our Oceanside, California biologics facility. So I don't think, Terence, we've shared specifically the capacity of our manufacturing footprint, but rest assured, we have adequate capacity to serve the market today. Our team does a great job of forecasting where the market is going. We're always one or two steps ahead and we don't expect that to change. So from a manufacturing standpoint, the Kite team has just really done an outstanding job. Hey, Tyler, it's Andy Dickinson. I'll take the question on behalf of the Kite team. Obviously, we and others want to see the full data set. We read the same releases that you've read. And we continue to believe that Arcellx and now Kite have a very interesting program that has the potential to be very competitive in that area to get on par or better potentially than the J&J Legend product. And as Dan said earlier, it doesn't come as a surprise to us that cell therapy is delivering that magnitude of benefit to patients across different disease areas. And it's exciting to see where cell therapy may go in terms of becoming the standard of care in second-line BCMA potentially over time, which, of course, increases the size of the potential opportunity for the Arcellx and Kite team. So look forward to seeing more on the data, look forward to carrying our program forward together with Arcellx team and to updating you over time. But certainly, it looks like a fantastic data set and great for patients. Mohit, it's Andy. Thank you for the question. Nothing's changed from our recent updates. I mean we think that BD is an important part of the puzzle for us going forward. It's important to continue to bring new and exciting innovation and products into our portfolio over time. We don't expect that to stop. That said, and to your point, we have made extraordinary progress over the last four years that we're really proud of. And so the breadth -- given the breadth and depth of our pipeline, you should expect that we will do less over the coming years than we did over the last three or four years. But we will still be active. And what we've said recently and I'd reinforce is that we will do ordinary course licensing deals. Obviously, you saw the Community and Arcellx deals last year. We've talked about the Merrell Bio deal, all of which we're very excited about. And then we expect from time to time to do small acquisitions. But our portfolio, to your point, is in a great spot. We're very excited about what that's going to do to drive growth, and we will always look for opportunities to add to it, if we can, in a thoughtful way that we think will benefit patients and our shareholders. But that's the way I would think about it at this point."

            "content": "Thank you, Johanna. We are off to a strong start in 2023 with our first regulatory approval of the year for Trodelvy for certain HR positive HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer patients in the U.S. and an additional 10 trials initiated so far this year, including four Phase 3 studies. This brings our clinical pipeline to 61 ongoing clinical programs. Starting with virology on Slide 15, we presented late-breaking data among 83 abstracts at CROI in Seattle in February, highlighting Gilead's continued expertise and leadership across HIV, Viral Hepatitis and COVID-19. In HIV, we shared several data readouts from our lenacapavir based development programs in prevention and treatment. In prevention, we presented preclinical in-vivo data providing further validation that a subcutaneous injection of lenacapavir can confer long-acting protection in an animal model. We believe lenacapavir as a single-agent has the potential to be the first once every six month option for HIV prevention. We are currently testing this in our pivotal Phase 3 PURPOSE trials. In treatment, we shared Phase 1b proof-of-concept data on twice yearly lenacapavir in combination with two investigational broadly neutralizing antibodies. At week-26, 90% of trial participants receiving this combination maintained virologic suppression. Further, treatment with the investigational regimen was generally well tolerated. Moving to COVID-19 on Slide 16, we also shared positive data from three retrospective real-world analysis of Veklury at CROI. These analysis showed that initiation of Veklury within the first two days of hospital admission, reduced death and hospital readmission rates among all patients with COVID-19. The right hand side of the slide highlights that both of our oral Phase 3 trials evaluating GS-5245 or obeldesivir, our investigational oral COVID nucleoside in standard risk patients and in high risk patients are now enrolling. Given uncertainties in the global epidemiology of COVID-19, we continue to be cautious with regards to the length of time it could take to fully enroll these trials. Moving on to Slide 17. Trodelvy continues to build momentum as the cornerstone of our solid tumor portfolio. As expected, the FDA approved Trodelvy for its third indication. Trodelvy is now approved in adults with HR positive HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer, who previously received endocrine-based therapy and at least two additional systemic therapies for metastatic disease. This FDA approval is based on the overall survival benefit seen in the Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 trial. We've already received acceptance of our European filing, and continue to expect a regulatory decision from the European Commission in the second half of this year. The Phase 3 EVOKE-01 trial evaluating the potential for Trodelvy in second line non-small cell lung cancer is ongoing. Additionally, we recently had FPI for the Phase 3 EVOKE-03 study also known as KEYNOTE-D46. This trial is being led by Merck to evaluate Trodelvy in combination with pembrolizumab in first line PD-L1 high non-small cell lung cancer. Additionally, we're excited to announce that over 30 abstracts, including an oral presentation of the updated ARC7 trial data have been accepted at ASCO this year. Not only do these data highlight elements of our investigational Trodelvy and dombinilumab programs in breast, bladder and lung cancers, the abstracts include new insights on many of our promising targets, including our cell therapy portfolio. Speaking of which, on Slide 18, I'm pleased to discuss the clinical progress we've made within cell therapy. Recently, we highlighted new overall survival data from the Phase 3 ZUMA-7 trial evaluating Yescarta for the initial treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. These data will be presented as an oral late-breaker at ASCO. Yescarta is the first and only therapy of any kind to show statistically significant overall survival benefit versus standard-of-care in almost 30 years. As we work to extend our leadership in cell therapy within our current portfolio, we're also building out our earlier stage programs. As mentioned in our last earnings call, we closed our agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize Arcellx's CART-ddBCMA for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Also, we closed our acquisition of Community Therapeutics in February, extending our preclinical and clinical pipeline in blood cancers and solid tumors. We are currently working to integrate the Community team with their asset into our broader innovation pipeline. Wrapping up on Slide 19, we are sharing the updated key pipeline milestones that we expect in 2023, which as you can see spans FPI's, data readouts, updates and regulatory approvals across oncology, virology and inflammation. Overall, this highlights the progress that Gilead has made on its transformation journey. The 61 clinical programs that are well-diversified across indications and stage. We have an ambitious clinical program, and I'd like to thank the Gilead team that has worked tirelessly to execute and accelerate the progress of our portfolio. We look forward to updating you as we progress through 2023. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Andy. Andy? Yeah. And then in terms of the ASCENT-07. Look, as we design and move into earlier lines of therapy in that study, as you know, we're going to be looking at chemo-naive population. And we do anticipate that study getting started in the second half of this year. So things are moving along very nicely, and we are really excited about that program. The final details in terms of design will be rolled out. I think we're crossing the [indiscernible] right now in terms of that final protocol. So you'll see that posted and available in short order. Thanks, Geoff. Very complicated question. I'll try to give a very brief answer. Look, I think that leveraging the engineered T-Cells so far in hematology has demonstrated really great efficacy and a reasonable tolerability profile for that patient population. I think it's all about therapeutic index. As you start to go into broader indications where treatment options are different and the disease state is different. I think they are different considerations for therapeutic index. So, as we look into different populations, we're going to keep a very close eye on the appropriate therapeutic index for a given patient, whether you're talking about lupus or anything else outside of oncology related to your question. From our perspective, maybe the broader perspective that I would offer is that, we do believe that modulating the immune system will lead to better outcomes in-patients, whether you're talking about agonizing or antagonizing and in hematologic disorders, we do believe that getting to better and more targeted immune blockade is going to be better for patients. And so, from our perspective there is not only to cell therapy in play and I think that's what we like about our portfolio is that, we have -- we're not modality restricted, and you've seen the deals we've done, we have our BTLA antibody and the rest of our portfolio in inflammation. So we are going to be pursuing the best outcome for patients regardless of modality and certainly, cell therapy will be one of those. Sure. Hartaj. Yes, I think there are several things that we -- give us a lot of confidence in terms of moving forward in non-small cell lung cancer. Certainly, the distribution of Trop-2 has demonstrated broad expression in non-small cell lung cancer, not too dissimilar from breast cancer. And so I think that gives us a lot of incentive to believe that the expression of Trop-2 in those tumors is going to give us efficacy by delivering the payload to those cells. Secondly, we've seen both internal and external data for Trop-2 targeted ADCs that support the value of bringing Trop-2 directed antibody drug conjugate to non-small cell lung cancer. So our approach, which has been broad and we're very excited about it. I think, is going really well is we are, as you know, in EVOKE-01 going into second line non-small cell lung cancer, and that study is going very well. We are then as well looking in front-line lung cancer in our other trials and looking at combinations of PD-1s with Trodelvy in those tumors in non-small cell. And we think that the potential for Trodelvy in those tumors is very high. We believe that we'll start to see those data start to roll out from our second-line studies first, as you would imagine. And then we'll continue to build on that as we go. Yes. Very important that, that breakthrough was not associated with lenacapavir resistance, right? And I think that's really important to keep in mind. Look, BmAbs are relatively new clinical tools to look for, options for people in terms of treating HIV. And it's one of the many approaches we're taking. Our approach has been to move a broader portfolio of small molecules to complement that early foray into long-acting with BmAbs, where we believe that the tried and true mechanisms that we have used, again, both orally or parenterally, should provide us with an opportunity to bring treatment options to people living with HIV that will be associated with low resistance rates and high efficacy. So that's what we're testing out. As we find the ideal partners, and I use the plural intentionally, we will be moving that forward. And so, I would look at those -- the BmAb data as early -- an early first approach to a long-acting treatment for people living with HIV. A - Johanna Mercier And maybe just to cover, Charlie, the second part of your question around the size of the market. So I'm going to split it out. When you think about the market from a treatment standpoint, we do believe that the long-acting market, probably by the end of this decade, will look about 50-50 or so. We think that there are definitely patients out there that are looking for us not to be reminded that they have HIV and an opportunity to think about the next-generation long-acting to really bring to patients what they're looking for. I think that's the kind of the last unmet medical need in this space at this point in time. I also think Biktarvy will continue to be the standard of care in the daily oral market, where there's still a lot of patients that actually do want to take their medicine every single day to make sure that they know that they're taking something to put at bay their HIV. Just to touch on the expansion from a PrEP standpoint, I just wanted -- the prevention market, very different in our view. And some discussions we've had with community partners and people that are at risk of HIV, what we're seeing here is probably the split is different, but the market expansion is also very different. So the split is probably going to go towards 70-30 by the end of this decade is what we assume. That has a lot to do with the fact that these are not patients, these are people at risk, and they don't necessarily want to take a pill a day for something they don't have. And so that makes a lot of sense. So something every six months aligned with physician visits could be an ideal scenario in this setting. And then from an expansion standpoint, as you all know, we've talked about this a lot. If you look at the CDC assumptions around the number of people that are at risk in the U.S., we've only kind of captured about 25% of those folks that are currently under medication. And unfortunately, there's still 75% that are not and that are at risk. And so there's an incredible opportunity, especially with something every six months, to really expand in this marketplace and make sure that we truly work together to end this epidemic. So, very exciting times to come. And within the next two years, hopefully, we'll have lenacapavir as the data reads out and approvals in prevention and then just a bit after that in treatment with different partners that Merdad was mentioning. So very exciting time. Sure. Thanks for the question. So the -- in terms of the interim analysis, it's a good reminder that the study is powered for the final analysis. And so our expectation for any study that has interim analysis is that we run to the final analysis, which I think we've guided to occurring next year. When an interim analysis occurs, we generally will not see the data. Generally, what happens is that the DSMB will tell us to either continue or potentially discontinue. If -- obviously, we discontinue, we'd share that. But if it's just continue, we would continue the trial, and there will be nothing other than that to share because we don't have any data to share since we won't have seen it. So our expectation is that, we run to the end of the trial. It would certainly be upside if we saw something earlier than that. And then I think in terms of the expectations, you're absolutely right. I think everyone has looked at the Takeda data and are wary as to the efficacy of azacitidine in performing in that patient population. And so we're going to have to wait and see what that looks like at the end of the trial. I'm -- I guess, buttressed by the fact that we have -- the DSMB has told us to continue the trial, it gives me a little bit of more confidence that we are going to see a treatment effect. But that's a very indirect assessment. So we're going to have to see. But we are powered for -- we've made some assumptions in terms of how we power the trial. So hopefully, we'll be able to detect the difference between the two."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Gilead's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rebecca, and I'll be your host for today. In a moment we'll begin with our prepared remarks, followed by our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now hand the call over to Jackie Ross, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategic Finance.\nJackie Ross : Thank you, Rebecca. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the third quarter of 2024. The press release, slides and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey, and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Cindy Perettie, the Executive Vice President of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. Please refer to Slide 2 regarding the risks and uncertainties relating to forward-looking statements that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.\nDaniel O'Day : Thank you, Jackie. And good afternoon, everyone. The team and I are pleased to share Gilead's third quarter results, highlighting another very strong quarter of commercial and operational execution with robust year-over-year revenue performance across HIV, Oncology, and Liver Disease, including 9% growth in HIV. We also delivered strong bottom-line results that highlight the leverage in our business model and reflect our ongoing commitment to disciplined expense management. Based on our financial results year-to-date, we are increasing our 2024 guidance across almost every metric, including revenue and non-GAAP gross margin, operating income, and EPS. We continue to make excellent progress in our Virology and Inflammation programs in the third quarter. The results from the PURPOSE 2 study, which build on the 100% efficacy shown in PURPOSE 1, demonstrate lenacapavir's unmatched clinical profile observed for HIV prevention. If approved, lenacapavir, as the first twice-yearly subcutaneous injection for HIV prevention, could make a major impact on global public health and significantly catalyze the prevention market. I'm pleased to share that the FDA recently granted breakthrough therapy designation to Lenacapavir, and we are on track to file before the end of this year. We look forward to sharing information on our plans for lenacapavir and the rest of our leading HIV portfolio at our HIV Analyst Event on December 10th. We are very encouraged by the launch of Livdelzi for primary biliary cholangitis or PBC, which was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in August. Livdelzi is a highly differentiated option for people with PBC who do not respond well to first-line therapy. Demand in the third quarter was ahead of our internal expectations, and we expect to see growing momentum into 2025 and beyond. Livdelzi brings the number of innovative therapies launched by Gilead since 2019 to six, representing another step towards our goal of delivering at least 10 transformative therapies by 2030. Moving to Oncology, we are excited to share preliminary data from the registrational Phase 2, iMMagine-1 study of Anito-Cel for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma at ASH next month, in addition to updated data from the Phase 1 study, together with our partner Arcellx. We're also pleased to have begun the Phase 3, iMMagine-3 study in earlier-line patients. The combination of Anito-Cel\u2019s potential best-in-class clinical profile with Kite's leading cell therapy manufacturing has the ability to transform care for a large number of multiple myeloma patients. We continue to evolve our Oncology program in response to clinical data, regulatory feedback, and the competitive environment. We are carefully prioritizing our resources for the most promising programs. For example, we are advancing Trodelvy in first-line PD-L1 high metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, where we have seen supportive data in combination with pembro, while discontinuing development in second-line plus. We are also starting a new program for small cell lung cancer based on promising efficacy data from the Phase 2 TROPiCS-0 basket trial. Touching briefly on Slide 6, we have completed all of the clinical milestones and updates we targeted for 2024 and look forward to a strong end to the year, with key presentations coming up at ASH and our HIV Analyst Events in December. Those are the main points I wanted to share for now in what has been a very strong third quarter, thanks to the tremendous efforts of the Gilead teams. I look forward to our Q&A session at the end. And now I will pass it on to Johanna.\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. It was another strong quarter of commercial execution across the business, and I'm proud of the work the teams continue to do to expand the reach of our medicines to many more people and patients around the world. As shown on Slide 8, total product sales, excluding Veklury, were $6.8 billion in the third quarter, up 7% year-over-year, reflecting strong growth across HIV, Oncology, and Liver Disease. Including Veklury, total product sales were $7.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Starting with HIV on Slide 9, sales of $5.1 billion were up 9% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, primarily driven by higher average realized price due to shifts in channel mix and higher demand across treatment and PrEP. The third quarter once again demonstrated the quarterly pricing variability we see in HIV. Specifically, we saw adjustments to government channels where there's a multi-quarter lag for certain claims data. As a result, the quarter reflected more favorable average realized pricing. Year-to-date, HIV sales have grown 5%, well above our prior full-year growth target of 4%. With that outperformance in mind, we're increasing our full-year HIV growth expectation to 5%, and we remind you to focus on full-year versus quarterly trends. To that end, for the fourth quarter in particular, we expect HIV sales to be roughly flat, quarter-over-quarter, with continued demand growth and modest seasonal inventory builds, offset by the third quarter pricing dynamics discussed earlier that are not expected to repeat. Turning to Slide 10, Biktarvy third quarter sales of $3.5 billion increased 13% year-over-year, driven by higher demand as well as higher average realized price due to shifts in channel mix, partially offset by inventory dynamics. Sequentially, sales were up 7%, primarily driven by channel mix and higher demand. In the U.S. and across major markets, Biktarvy continues to be the regimen of choice for those starting treatment and switching therapies, and has grown for 25 consecutive quarters. In the U.S., Biktarvy's share grew to over 49%, up more than 2% year-over-year, and remains the leading regimen for HIV treatment. Gilead is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in the HIV treatment market with four new regimens by the end of 2030. Overall, the HIV treatment market continues to grow in line with our expectations of 2% to 3% annually. Moving to Descovy, third quarter sales were $586 million, up 15% year-over-year, reflecting higher demand and average realized price due to channel mix, partially offset by inventory dynamics. Sequentially, sales were up 21%, primarily driven by channel mix and higher demand. The U.S. PrEP market continues to demonstrate robust growth, up 13% year-over-year, and Descovy for PrEP remains the leading branded option, capturing over 40% market share despite the availability of generics and other regimens. Overall, Descovy for PrEP sales make up an increasing portion of total Descovy sales, representing roughly 80% in the third quarter. This is a strong foundation as we prepare for the first anticipated commercial launch of lenacapavir for PrEP next year. Lenacapavir's remarkable clinical profile and unmatched twice-yearly administration offer the potential to redefine the HIV prevention market, and we look forward to sharing more details on our commercialization plans and treatment programs at our HIV analyst event in December. In the meantime, we look to file for approval in the U.S. before the end of the year and are well underway with our preparations for the first commercial launch in 2025. In addition to our commercial plans, we're particularly proud of our commitment to make lenacapavir available in 120 high-incidence, resource-limited countries as quickly as possible, ensuring access for lenacapavir for PrEP is made as broadly available upon approval. Moving to the Liver Disease portfolio on Slide 11, sales of $733 million in the third quarter were up 4% year-over-year, driven by increased demand across our viral hepatitis portfolio, partially offset by pricing dynamics, including shifts in channel mix in the U.S. Sequentially, after an incredibly strong second quarter, sales declined 12%, primarily driven by inventory dynamics and fewer patients starts in HCV. Turning to Slide 12, in mid-August, we launched Livdelzi in the U.S. for PBC, with the first prescription written within a few hours of the accelerated approval. Furthermore, with 100% of our U.S. commercial organization trained by the time of launch, we quickly reached more than 1,000 of our target prescribers within the first several weeks. Overall, we're very encouraged with the patient demand we're seeing so far, which is ahead of our internal expectations. We believe this reflects the differentiated profile of Livdelzi as the only approved therapy, with statistically significant improvements in both ALP and pruritus, as well as an established safety profile. Sales in the third quarter were modest, as we expected, in the low single-digit million, and reflective of the ramp-up time required to onboard patients and providers, and to work through step-edits and prior authorizations that are normal for a rare disease launch. We expect to start building momentum as we enter 2025, when we look to a more meaningful sales contribution. Outside the U.S., launch preparations are ongoing, and we look forward to the European Regulatory decision in early 2025. Moving to Slide 13, Veklury has continued to remain the antiviral standard of care for hospitalized patients treated for COVID-19, including in the U.S., with more than 60% share in this setting. Altogether, with higher than expected hospitalizations in the summer months, sales in the third quarter were up 9% year-over-year to $692 million. Year-to-date sales of $1.5 billion are now well ahead of our initial full-year guidance of $1.3 billion. As a result, we're raising our full-year guidance for Veklury to approximately $1.8 billion. Now, turning to Oncology on Slide 14, Gilead or Kite therapies have treated more than 65,000 patients globally, highlighting our continued growing reach. Sales for the quarter were $860 million, up 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by Trodelvy growth. Sequentially, Oncology sales were down 3%, with growth in Trodelvy offset by a decline in cell therapy. Beginning with Trodelvy on Slide 15, sales of $332 million were up 17% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting higher demand in all regions. In breast cancer, Trodelvy remains well-positioned as the only approved and commercially available TROP2-directed ADC to demonstrate clinically meaningful survival benefits across two types of metastatic breast cancers. Notably, Trodelvy is the standard of care for second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, with ongoing adoption in the pretreated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer setting. We're pleased to see both indications contribute to Trodelvy's growth year-over-year, despite an evolving competitive landscape. Turning to Slide 16, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, cell therapy sales of $485 million in the third quarter were flat year-over-year, with strong 23% growth outside the U.S., offset by the U.S. Sequentially, total cell therapy sales were down 7% due to competitive headwinds both in and out of class in the U.S., which we expect to continue into 2025. As a pioneer in cell therapy, Kite\u2019s focus is to expand overall utilization and increase class share. As part of this work, we're partnering with government agencies and healthcare associations to amplify education of the benefits of CAR-T and remove barriers to access. To date, only two of every 10 eligible patients receive CAR-T in second-line plus large B-cell lymphoma in the U.S., and we are committed to removing these barriers so we can deliver potentially curative therapies like Yescarta to more patients. In the community setting, Kite is leading the way in identifying and lowering barriers and building the right ecosystem to enable more people to receive CAR-T beyond the reach of an academic medical institution. Today, CAR-T sites often need to be accredited, typically by the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy, or FACT, and this requirement has been highlighted as a hurdle for our community partners to achieve national pay reimbursement. In the meantime, we're pleased to share that we have treated our first few patients as part of our community strategy, demonstrating that we can deliver Yescarta in this setting. Outside the U.S., we saw year-over-year demand growth as we continue to expand into the second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma setting in Europe and launch a new market. In particular, we're encouraged by our progress in Japan, where we have on-boarded more than 50 authorized treatment centers in little over a year, with more to come in the near future. Overall, I would like to thank the commercialization teams for their hard work to deliver another strong quarter and first nine months of the year. With launch activities underway in PBC and for HIV prevention launch next year, our teams are excited to bring our transformative medicines to many more people and patients globally. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad.\nMerdad Parsey: Thank you, Johanna. We're very pleased to wrap up the third quarter with another exciting update from our PURPOSE program, evaluating Lenacapavir for HIV prevention. As shown on Slide 18, we shared two oral presentations on our PURPOSE 2 HIV prevention trial at the HIV Research for Prevention Conference in October. Following the remarkable 100% efficacy reported from an interim analysis of the PURPOSE 1 trial in cisgender women in June, PURPOSE 2 was also stopped at the interim in September. Notably, twice yearly subcutaneous Lenacapavir significantly reduced incidence of HIV infections compared to both background HIV incidence and Truvada in the exceptionally diverse population of cisgender men and gender diverse people in a Phase 3 prevention trial. These PURPOSE 1 and 2 results demonstrated Lenacapavir's unprecedented results for HIV prevention. We look forward to sharing additional insights at the HIV Glasgow meeting next week, including persistence data from PURPOSE 1 and a deeper look into the efficacy data from PURPOSE 2. Based on these data, FDA has now granted breakthrough therapy designation for Lenacapavir for HIV prevention. We continue to target regulatory submission before the end of the year in the U.S., while at the same time preparing for filings with other global regulatory authorities. Beyond our registrational PURPOSE 1 and 2 programs, we continue to generate additional data from the Phase 2, PURPOSE 3, 4, and 5 trials in key populations across the U.S., U.K., and France. These studies are intended to contribute additional data in communities where the use of or access to prevention options have historically been challenging. Turning to our HIV treatment pipeline on Slide 19, we continue to make strong progress in developing novel regimens, including a once-daily oral regimen with two backbone therapies, Lenacapavir and Bictegravir. This novel combination has the potential to provide another effective daily oral option for people living with HIV, including the 6% to 8% of people currently on complex regimens. Recently, we completed enrollment of the Phase 3, ARTISTRY-1 trial within nine months of FPI and are on track to complete enrollment in ARTISTRY-2 by early 2025. Further, we've made strong progress for our two once-weekly oral programs. The Phase 2 study of our wholly owned combination of GS-4182, a pro-drug of Lenacapavir with enhanced oral bioavailability, and GS-1720, a long-acting integrase inhibitor, has now completed enrollment within two months of FPI, and we've enrolled our first participants into the Phase 3 ISLEND-1 and ISLEND-2 trials, evaluating the oral combination of Lenacapavir with Merck's NRTTI, Islatravir, for biologically suppressed people with HIV. We presented Week 48 data from the Phase 2 trial evaluating this once-weekly combination in a similar population at IDWeek. Participants in both, the Lenacapavir plus Islatravir and Biktarvy treatment arms maintained high rates of virologic suppression and no participants discontinued due to lymphocyte count decreases. Moving to our Liver Disease portfolio on Slide 20, FDA granted Livdelz an accelerated approval for the treatment of PBC in combination with UDCA in certain adults who have an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in certain patients unable to tolerate UDCA. We have already filed with EMA and expect a decision early next year. As part of the accelerated approval process, we continue to recruit for our confirmatory Phase 3 AFFIRM trial evaluating Seladelpar for improvement in event-free survival. Further, our Phase 3 IDELA trial is ongoing and offers us an opportunity to understand the effect of Seladelpar in normalizing alkaline phosphatase in a broader set of PBC patients who had an incomplete response to UDCA. Switching now to Oncology, on Slide 21, we continue to evolve our late-stage clinical programs in lung cancer in response to clinical data and the changing landscape. Reflective of our commitment to prioritizing the most significant opportunities across all our therapeutic areas, we've decided to discontinue further evaluation of Trodelvy in second line plus metastatic non-small cell lung cancer based on discussions with regulators following the EVOKE-01 readout earlier this year. In the front line, based on the totality of the data from the Phase 2 EVOKE-02 trial, we believe Trodelvy in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor without the addition of chemotherapy may have the greatest potential in this setting. To that end, our Phase 3 EVOKE-03 study of Trodelvy plus Pembro is ongoing in first-line patients with PD-L1 high metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Separately, we shared promising data for Trodelvy in extensive stage small cell lung cancer from our Phase 2 TROPiCS-03 basket trial and plan to advance development of Trodelvy in this population to a Phase 3 trial. We also look forward to sharing the results from Part I of the Phase 2 ARC-10 trial at the SITC meeting later this week, further adding to the body of data on Domvanalimab, our Fc-silent anti-TIGIT. As a reminder, we discontinued enrollment of ARC-10 earlier this year to prioritize the ongoing first-line Phase 3 DOM studies, STAR-121 in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and STAR-221 in upper GI cancers. Moving to Slide 22, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, we are excited to share updates at the upcoming ASH Conference, including our Phase 2 iMMagine 1 results for Anito-cel in fourth-line or later relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The ASH abstract shared yesterday reflects 58 patients who received Anito-cel with a median follow-up of 10.3 months as of the June 2024 cutoff. Treatment with Anito-cel demonstrated deep and durable efficacy with an objective response rate of 95% and a complete response rate of 62%. Of those available for MRD testing, 92% achieved MRD negativity. The median progression-free survival and overall survival had not yet been reached. Additionally, Arcellx announced yesterday that updated data from the Phase 1 study will be presented at ASH. In the meantime, Arcellx has already shared that an even later data cut from Phase 1 has shown that Anito-cel achieved a 30.2 month median progression-free survival, and median overall survival was not yet reached. In summary, we are encouraged by the compelling results so far, and with over 140 patients dosed across both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 iMMagine 1 studies, we have not yet seen any cases of delayed neurotoxicities. This includes no Parkinsonism, no cranial nerve palsies, and no Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. We'll be sharing updated data at the ASH conference and look forward to potentially offering Anito-cel\u2019s best-in-class profile to these late-stage multiple myeloma patients. Separately, we're pleased FDA has granted Kite the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation, or RMAT, for the evaluation of Yescarta for newly diagnosed high-risk large B-cell lymphoma who have a positive PET scan after two cycles of first-line chemotherapy. Under the RMAT designation, the Yescarta development program for first-line treatment of high-risk large B-cell lymphoma will be able to access the benefits of the FDA's accelerated pathways, including fast-track and breakthrough designations. Our Phase 3 ZUMA-23 study in this setting is ongoing, and we look forward to sharing updates in due course. Moving to our milestones on Slide 23, a brief update on ASCENT-03. As a reminder, this is an event-driven trial, and I can share that we are continuing to accrue events at this time. With that in mind, it is possible we will not reach data cutoff this year, and we look forward to updating you in due course. Other updates this quarter included the readout of PURPOSE 2 data ahead of schedule, the review of our Phase 2 data for Lenacapavir plus our broadly neutralizing antibodies with plans to share the data at an upcoming scientific conference in 2025. The initiation of several key HIV, Trodelvy, and cell therapy trials, including enrollment for ISLEND-1, ISLEND-2, ASCENT-GYN-01, and iMMagine-3. In closing, I'd like to thank the Kite and Gilead Research and Development teams for a stellar quarter of execution. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Andy.\nAndrew Dickinson : Thank you, Merdad. And good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results represent a strong quarter for Gilead. As shown on Slide 25, with our base business up 7% year-over-year to $6.8 billion, driven by growth in each of our core businesses. Veklury also delivered substantial growth, resulting in total product sales up 7% year-over-year to $7.5 billion. Before moving to non-GAAP, I'll highlight the impairment charge that impacted our third quarter financial results on a GAAP basis, as noted on Slide 26. As a reminder, this relates to the carrying value of the IPR&D indefinite live intangible assets acquired from Immunomedics in 2020. During the third quarter, we decreased the fair value by $1.8 billion, or $1.04 per share net of tax impact, reflecting the removal of the second-line non-small-cell lung cancer indication. The remaining $1.8 billion carrying value reflects Trodelvy's opportunity in the first-line setting. Note that the potential indications that we've begun to explore since the acquisition are not reflected in the carrying value, such as endometrial or small-cell lung cancer. Moving to our non-GAAP results for the third quarter on Slide 27. Product gross margin was 87%, up 84 basis points from last year, primarily due to product mix. R&D expenses were down 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by timing of clinical activities, such as the wind-down of the magrolimab program and the obeldesivir oral COVID studies, and supported by our broader expense management initiatives. Acquired IPR&D was $505 million, which reflects the $320 million buyout of global Livdelzi royalties from Janssen announced in August, and the $35 million upfront expense to initiate a new AI partnership with Genesis, in addition to ongoing collaboration expenses. SG&A was up 8% year-over-year, primarily due to timing of commercial and corporate activities, including the launch of Livdelzi in the United States, and other initiatives, including prelaunch preparations for Lenacapavir for PrEP. Operating margin for the third quarter was 43%. Excluding the impact of the royalty buyout charge from Janssen, operating margin would have been 47%. While there will always be some quarterly variability, recent results demonstrate a consistent trend of our operating margin firmly in the 40% plus range, and we remain focused on being an industry leader in terms of operating margin. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%, as compared to 7% in the same period last year. As a reminder, the tax rate in the third quarter of 2023 benefited from decreased tax reserves as a result of reaching an agreement with a tax authority on certain tax positions. In total, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.02 per share, as compared to $2.29 per share in the same period last year, primarily reflecting higher acquired IPR&D and tax expense, partially offset by higher product sales. As mentioned earlier, the $320 million expense related to buyout of global Livdelzi royalties from Janssen impacted our EPS by $0.20 per share. As highlighted on Slide 28, we had a strong first nine months of the year, with solid performance in each of our core franchises across HIV, Oncology, and Liver Disease, driving base business growth of 7% year-over-year, with Veklury already exceeding our initial full-year guidance of $1.3 billion. Altogether, total product sales for the nine months of 2024 were up 6% year-over-year. Moving to guidance on Slide 29. We are updating much of our guidance to reflect the very strong performance in our business so far this year. We are increasing our guidance for product sales, excluding Veklury, by $150 million at the midpoint from the prior range to a new range of $26 billion to $26.3 billion. In addition to our strong year-to-day performance, this guidance accounts for evolving competition in our cell therapy business. The increased revenue guidance also reflects higher full-year expectations for HIV, now expected to grow approximately 5% from 2023, compared to our prior expectations of 4%. This guidance implies that fourth-quarter HIV could be roughly flat, which we believe is prudent given the strength in the third quarter and the normal variability we can see with HIV pricing. We expect full-year Veklury revenue to be approximately $1.8 billion. We therefore expect full-year 2024 total product sales in the range of $27.8 billion to $28.1 billion, an increase of $650 million at the midpoint compared to the prior range. Turning to the rest of the P&L on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product gross margin to be approximately 86%, narrowed from our prior 85% to 86% range, and reflecting year-to-date results as well as our expectations for a more favorable product mix in the fourth quarter. We now expect R&D expense to decline a low single-digit percentage as compared to our prior outlook of low-to-mid single-digit growth, reflecting the discontinuation of certain programs and careful expense management. And there is no change to our prior expectations for both acquired IPR&D and SG&A. Reflecting these updates, we now expect operating income in the range of $8 billion to $8.3 billion, up from $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion previously. Full-year tax is expected to be approximately 27%, slightly lower than our prior 30% guidance, and reflecting the higher operating income for the full year as well as the negative impact from the one-time charge for the acquisition of CymaBay in the first quarter. As a reminder, this compares to our initial guidance in February of approximately 19% prior to the CymaBay impact. Altogether, we've raised our earnings per share guidance to a range of $4.25 and $4.45. This compares to our prior guidance of $3.60 to $3.90, and reflects both revenue outperformance and continued operating expense discipline. At the midpoints, our updated guidance represents an increase of $750 million in non-GAAP operating income and an increase of $0.60 in non-GAAP earnings per share. On a GAAP basis, EPS is expected to be $0.05 to $0.25. Moving to Slide 30, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the third quarter and a total of $3.7 billion in the first nine months of the year. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with significant balance sheet flexibility. Overall, Gilead is on track to deliver an extremely strong 2024, and we're particularly pleased with our progress on operating expense management, which we believe sets us up well as we enter 2025. And now, I'll invite Rebecca to begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, Andy. At this time, we'll invite your questions. We ask you to be courteous and limit yourself to one question so that we can get to as many analysts as possible during today's call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Courtney Breen at Bernstein. Go ahead. Your line is open.\nCourtney Breen: Hi, there! Thank you so much for taking my question today. I'm interested in talking a little bit about the CAR T space. Specifically, can you help to dimensionalize the in-class versus out-of-class impacts on Yescarta this quarter, particularly as we think about Breyanzi and whether these results establish any need to kind of pivot the focus of the commercial strategy that you outlined in the presentation today?\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Thanks Courtney. So, we have Cindy Perettie here. I'll turn it over to her to respond.\nCindy Perettie: Thanks Courtney for your question. So, if I look at the in-class competition that we face this quarter, it boils down to two things. One is two new indications, both in follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma. And the second is an increase in capacity within manufacturing. So, that's the in-class space that we're facing. Out-of-class, we continue to face competition through bi-specifics. And I would put them probably at about 50-50 on what we're seeing today. From our strategy standpoint, we do not believe we have to pivot it. I think in the Oncology space, when new therapies get approved and new indications, it's very common for physicians to try out the new therapies, and we expect to see that, and we've seen that both with in-class and out-of-class competitors. We're continuing to focus on driving both, our class share and our brand share, and feel very confident in the plans that we have to-date to continue our expansion into the community and elsewhere. And I feel confident that we're going to build on our leadership, both for YESCARTA and TECARTUS, but also recognizing as we look ahead, anito-cel will be coming in 2026.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Yee at Jeffries. Mike, go ahead. Your line is open.\nMike Yee : Great. Thanks. Congrats on a great quarter. Thinking about lenacapavir for PrEP, based on feedback from docs, we're hearing that there could be a good market and good adoption for swapping from current Descovy. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the launch of lenacapavir for PrEP next year? Could that be a fast launch? And think about the dynamics there, and is it buy-and-build? So, can you talk a little bit about how well you think that could launch and where the opportunity is? Thanks.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Thanks Mike. We've got Joanna here, so let her take that question.\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks for the question. Yeah, I think we're very excited about the potential launch for lenacapavir for PrEP. The growth opportunities are clear for us, right. It's around market-size growth, when you think about more consumers using PrEP, and more prescribers prescribing it, so more physician-based, and then of course more countries, because thus far it's really been very U.S. focused. We do think there's a real expansion just in the consumers, when you think about right now the market is primarily white MSMs. We think there's a real opportunity to expand that to include Black, Latino individuals, young adults, cisgender women, transgender. So, there's a lot there, let alone prescribers. Right now, the prescribers we have are currently the ones that prescribe, generally speaking, for HIV treatment, and we think the market can be expanded much more broadly than that. And then of course countries, and as I was mentioning, I do think there's real opportunities when you think about a Lenacapavir for PrEP and the profile that it offers, quite differentiated. From a market-share growth, I think it'll be mixed. I think you are right. I think Lenacapavir, twice yearly SUBQ profile offers a lot, for people looking for HIV prevention who may want or need it, and I do think it will have some impact on both, Descovy from a daily oral standpoint, but also 55% of the market is actually generic oral. And I do think it's going to have a big impact across the whole daily oral market to see Lenacapavir come in. As to your question about how quickly we can do that, I mean, the plans for commercialization are well underway. We are thinking through, how do we make sure we make this a seamless experience for all of our customers? So that includes providers when they prescribe Lenacapavir, but also for consumers to make sure they have access to Lenacapavir, and that's looking at our distribution system, our reimbursement, and making sure that we just provide that seamless experience for all. So, more to come on that. We have the HIV analyst event coming up in December, and we'll be able to share a little bit more data there, but definitely an opportunity for us to grow overall Gilead's share in the prevention market, both with Descovy for those who prefer daily oral, but obviously the growth is really going to come from Lenacapavir for prevention.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Umer Raffat at Evercore. Go ahead. Your line is open.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on anito-cel and delayed neurotox for a quick second, and it's a two-part question. First, I'm just curious, do you think is it the construct or the trial design or any other reason which explains the lack of delayed neurotox, GBS, etcetera? And secondly, do you think we now have sufficient data from the existing data sets in Phase 1, to rule out any delayed neurotox when the sample size expands to 500 to 1,000 patients in Phase 3 trials? Thank you very much.\nCindy Perettie: Thank you, Umer. So, your question about our perspective on whether it's the construct or the trial design that relates to the delayed neurotoxicity that we haven't observed, we believe it's the construct. As a reminder, we have a very compact DD domain, and we think that that is a big piece of why we aren't seeing the delayed neurotoxin or continuing to look with our translational medicine group to uncover sort of pieces of that, but we're having increasing confidence that it's the construct. I think the second piece that you asked is, do we have sufficient data. Look, we're at 100 patients' worth of data between the Phase 1 of 38 patients and what we just shared in the ASH abstract. Coming forward to ASH, we're going to have a larger data set. We've done another data cut that we're cleaning now that we'll be presenting at ASH. So having that confidence of over 100 patients to-date and not observing the neurotoxicity, makes us recognize that we have a best-in-class construct, and we're really looking forward to sharing that data at ASH.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren at TD Cowen. Go ahead, your line is open.\nTyler Van Buren: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Congratulations on the results. I just had another one on Anito-cel since the data reported yesterday were very exciting. So, with the expectation to be on the market in 2026, can you talk about the ability to scale the product upon launch? And to be more specific, is the manufacturing process similar enough to Yescarta and Tecartus, where the FDA will allow you to scale manufacturing at a faster pace, or will Anito-cel have to scale at the same initial pace that Yescarta and Tecartus did?\nCindy Perettie: Yeah, so we have taken all of our learnings from Yescarta and Tecartus and applied that to the Anito-cel production. And as we shared last quarter, we have done the full tech transfer into our Maryland facility, and we're producing Anito-cel for iMMagine-3 study, where we have successfully dosed two patients now. And our turnaround times are looking very similar to our commercial product that we have today, again, having applied all those learnings. So, we don't have any concerns about our ability to scale. We've also not had feedback from the FDA that we would have to use the same approach as other competitors in this space.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal at Wells Fargo. Mohit, go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Saadi on for Mohit. Thanks for taking our question. Maybe one on seladelpar. Could you share any early insights, especially regarding payer coverage into this launch, given that the other PPAR agonist is priced at a slight discount to seladelpar? Do you see this impacting payer preferences between these two options? Thank you.\nJohanna Mercier: Sure. I'll take that one. It\u2019s Joanna. So, we're really quite pleased with our initial launch. So, it's only been a few months. We launched mid-August, but so far we've exceeded our internal expectations for patient demand. And I just want to take a moment, and then I'll address your payer coverage question specifically. I'm just really pleased and proud of the cross-functional team that's come together so quickly. They were fully trained and mobilized within 24 hours of our approval, and we had our first script within hours of the approval from the FDA. We've reached over 1,000 of our key targets in the first two and a half weeks post-launch. And obviously, you can appreciate that our history in Liver Disease and our credibility here really opens the doors for the access to these key stakeholders for PBC, which really obviously is critical as you think about early launch dynamics, and so we're very excited about that. We also took a very clear strategy when it came to what we were looking for, for reimbursement, but also distribution. And so from day one, we enabled direct purchasing with a specialty distributor, which was actually quite pivotal when you think about key academic centers. And if you think about the business, it's probably a mix about 50-50 or so between the academic centers and in the community. The coverage so far with payers is very much in line with our expectations for rare disease, and we're really quite encouraged to see that no major barriers are happening to actually get access to Livdelzi outside of the typical ones that happen. But really, for appropriate patients, it takes a little bit more time, because we have to get through the step edits and the prior auth. But we are getting through and patients are having access to seladelpar and Livdelzi. So, we're excited and more to come as we think about 2024, but more importantly, as we ramp up into 2025, right. We've always said it would be a modest contribution in \u201824 with a more meaningful contribution to sales in 2025, so stay tuned.\nOperator: Next, we have Daina Graybosch from Leerink Partners. Go ahead. Your line is open.\nDaina Graybosch: Hi. Another one on anito-cel for me. I wonder what's gating the regulatory filing and also what will be required to build the market for anito-cel and myeloma beyond the stubborn sort of 20% penetration you are hitting your heads against in NHL second-line setting.\nCindy Perettie: Thanks a lot, Dana, for the question. So, I think the components around the regulatory filing as you're aware, what we've seen with others in the space is that the FDA would be looking at 12 months' worth of data, where this will be a filing discussion that we have with FDA. We do believe we have a very differentiated safety profile, and we'll be talking to the agency about that review cycle based on that. The second question that you asked was around that today, only two out of 10 patients receiving CAR T. We know in multiple myeloma it's one out of 10, so we have our work to do. The work that we're putting towards the community practices and ungating some of the reimbursement access challenges, are the same challenges we will face, whether it's lymphoma or multiple myeloma. So all the applications we're putting forward in our plan today will apply to Anito-cel, and that's why it's really critical as we execute over the next 12 to 18 months, because we're really excited to bring Anito-cel to more patients.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carter Gould at Barclays. Carter, go ahead. Your line is open.\nCarter Gould: Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Love all the Anito-cel questions, but I'm going to bring it back to HIV. I'm not sure who wants to take the question, but how should investors maybe gauge expectations of what we're going to hear at the analyst event? Should we expect an explicit peak sales target for Lenacapavir and PrEP, or how do you think about the long, maybe a long-term treatment market objective, or should we expect more of the qualitative market color that maybe Joanna referenced earlier? Thank you.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Thanks Carter. This is Dan. So, first of all, we really look forward to hosting as many of you as possible at our HIV analyst event in December. And our intention is to start sharing some more of our plans on the commercialization for Lenacapavir with PrEP. Joanna has started to outline that on our quarterly calls, but we really need some more time to dimensionalize that market, to begin to discuss how we will approach different aspects of the Lenacapavir for PrEP market. I think you can expect them to be qualitative, but also quantitative from the opportunity. I think to your point about peak sales and things, that would come more into our guidance that would come more at the beginning of next year in terms of how we might see 2025 and beyond. But in addition to the commercialization, we're going to spend a lot of time on highlighting the progress of our long-acting treatment combinations. Merdad covered this in some of the prepared remarks, but we intend to bring you into even more detail about the progress of our long-acting treatment combinations in addition to what we've already disclosed. So we will have some new disclosures there. We'll also be able to share our perspective on how we see the treatment market evolving in the coming years, and I think that's an area of tremendous strength in terms of our overall program. As you know, we're processing a variety of long-acting treatment programs in parallel, to make sure that we have multiple options for patients from longer-acting orals to longer-acting injectables, and you can expect to get an update on the R&D progress of those, and some further update on timelines as we move forward. Again, just to remind you of course, the totality of our HIV business is such that we really don't have any significant patent expiries until Biktarvy in 2033. And really by that time, we will not only have the lend for PrEP unfolding over that period of time, but significant progress with potentially four new modalities for long-acting treatment even before 2033. So the intention is to really pull through and to show you the durability of our HIV business, well into the late 2030\u2019s.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn at Morgan Stanley. Terrence, go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good evening. Thanks for taking our questions. This is Chris on for Terrence. Just one question for Andy. Are you confident that you can drive operating margin expansion in 2025 on an ex-IPR&D basis? Thank you.\nAndrew Dickinson: Hey Chris. It's Andy. Thanks for the question. We'll provide more specific guidance on 2025, of course, on our year-end call. What we've said though consistently and you see in the last two quarters is real progress in terms of letting the operating margin expand again as we now kind of enter a new phase of having now built the portfolio, executing both clinically and commercially, and really focusing on expense management. You see the strong operating margin both in the second quarter and the third quarter. Again, you heard my prepared remarks that the operating margin would have been 47% this quarter if you backed out the impact of the royalty purchase from Janssen on seladelpar. So we're off to a great start. Our ambition and expectation is that we will have an industry-leading operating margin over time. So again, it's too early to give any specific guidance on 2025. More to come, but we're really pleased with where we are and the progress that you've seen in the last couple quarters, and we're already in a very strong spot, and we'll continue to work to improve it over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott at JP Morgan. Chris, go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Just another HIV question on combos. I think you said you\u2019ve got a number of one of the capavir combos in development. I guess I'm just trying to get my hands around, when you think about the portfolio, where do you see SUBQ injectables playing in the treatment market relative to some of your weekly oral options? I looked at that chart and it seemed a lot of the programs by 2030 in the bNAbs were on the oral side. So I was trying to get a sense of like how important is SUBQ injectable there, or do you see this mostly as a longer-acting oral opportunity for the company? Thank you.\nDaniel O\u2019Day: Merdad is here Chris. We'll let him answer that. Thanks.\nMerdad Parsey : Hi, Chris. The way we're approaching this is really to take a very broad approach. With the success with lenacapavir so far in what we've seen. We think that really forms a great foundation for us. And we believe that there is enough demand in both the oral and the injectable areas for us to be developing in both. So to your point, we really do see an opportunity for PrEP on the oral side for us to provide either weekly or monthly options, potentially also then going into the treatment market farther down the road, and in subcutaneous, and the key differentiator being the durability of the treatment. So, on the oral side, weekly to monthly. On the injectable side we think we can get to every three months and hopefully even up to every six months and beyond. So I think that's the key differentiator for us in terms of how we think about the opportunity. And of course, different people will be looking for different approaches, and our goal, our aim is to provide those options for them.\nJohanna Mercier: Yeah, maybe just to add to Merdad's comments, our approach is truly patient-centric. The opportunity is just to make sure that we answer and address the needs, and the needs have been mixed. I think there are some that really do prefer to be reminded and can take an oral pill only and don't want an injectable. And others don't really want to think about HIV if they don't have to, and if they can take four injections a year, that could do it as well or two even, as to Merdad's comments as well. So more to come on that as to what we're doing, but the intent is truly, as we're leaders today in HIV, both across treatment and prevention, the intent is to continue to remain leaders for the future, and that's really with the pipeline that we have in our portfolio and the combinations that we have. So we're excited about the future and what it holds.\nAndrew Dickinson: And Chris, it's Andy. Maybe I'll just add one thing. The slide references the products that we expect to have approved by 2030. You should not read into that, that we don't expect these long-acting subcutaneous products to come to market even shortly after that. So we'll provide more guidance over time. Again, we'll talk more about the portfolio at our HIV day as Dan mentioned, but we were just focusing purely on that slide to the end of the decade. It doesn't mean that we don't see a series of potential product launches beyond that as well, so more to come. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Next, Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Salveen, go ahead. Your line is open.\nSalveen Richter: Hi. Can you hear me?\nOperator: Salveen?\nSalveen Richter: Yes. Thank you. Sorry about that. Good afternoon. So you've noted that prior, with regard to your long-acting HIV PrEP market, that about 400,000 people are on PrEP today, and that could increase to 600,000 by 2030. Is that still a fair assumption? And if so, where does this growth likely come from? And what do you view as a fair estimate for the portion of that 600,000 that'll prefer an oral option? Thank you.\nJohanna Mercier: Yes. So Salveen, I'll try to address that one and you'll hear more about that actually as we go into the HIV analyst event as well in early December. So we do believe that it's at least 600,000 by 2030. Now, this is a market in the past that we've really worked at through social media, direct-to-consumer, etc., to really make sure we activate it and that's how it's grown thus far to about 350,000 to 400,000 consumers today. We think there's a real opportunity and most of the growth is going to come from different consumers to be honest. So thus far, the vast majority of consumers of HIV PrEP are white MSMs. And so we think with PURPOSE 1, PURPOSE 2, and actually other PURPOSE studies to follow, this is the broadest clinical trial program that we've ever done in prevention or that's ever been done in prevention. And it includes many other consumers that I think really may need or even want prevention, and that includes Latino, black individuals, women, cisgender women, transgender, and then even young adults right. And so a lot of that growth is going to come from there. So could it be beyond the 600,000? Absolutely, 600,000. And we do think that most of that is going to be driven by a new option on the market, and that is Lenacapivir for prevention. To have something that you don't need to think about when you are not ill to take every single day versus twice a year is a big differentiation, let alone with the data and efficacy that we've shown in both PURPOSE 1 and PURPOSE 2. So, more to come on that. I do think we have a lot of opportunities here. And the intent is to truly work on expanding this market for the future. I think it's not about thinking about what's currently in play today, but actually what it could be by 2030 with a little bit of investment and education and awareness.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Biegler at Oppenheimer. Matt, go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatt Biegler: Great. Thanks so much for the question. I had a question on ASCENT-03 with that coming up. Can you just comment on how much larger you think that frontline opportunity is in triple negative breast cancer? Thanks.\nJohanna Mercier: Yeah. So as you move up earlier lines of therapy, obviously, as TNBC progresses unfortunately quite rapidly, the market is actually quite larger. It's probably just about double more. And then of course, the split between PD-L1 negative and PD-L1 positive, and that's ASCENT-03, ASCENT-04, that's a bit of a split as well. A little bit more on the negative than the positive in TNBC. And so we do think with ASCENT-03, and then the future with ASCENT-04 moving up in earlier lines of therapy, it can really make a difference for these women. If we can show overall survival in this setting as well, I think that can be incredibly powerful for us. As we've really established our place in second-line plus as the standard of care, really the opportunity would be to move up with those women to really make a difference earlier on in their metastatic disease.\nOperator: Next, we have Asthika Goonewardene from Truist. Go ahead. Your line is open.\nKarina Rabayeva : Hi, this is Karina for Asthika. I had a couple of questions. You mentioned that you had three patients, those on iMMagine-3 study. Just wondering how many of the 130 clinical trial sites are including patients? And another one is also, you expect anito-cel to be used in outpatient settings since the time to onset of CRS was only two days. And Legend had previously mentioned that 45% of their patients are being used in outpatient settings, so your thoughts on that as well. Thank you.\nCindy Perettie: Yeah, we don't usually share the number of clinical sites that we have recruiting, but trust that the team is working hard to get all 130 up and going. You were asking a little bit about the outpatient profile. We believe that this therapy has an outpatient profile. You can tell by just looking at the ICANNs and CRS rates that we're seeing, and we've actually designed that into our phase, iMMagine-3 Phase 3 programs. So we'll have data generated in that outpatient setting. As you talked about the onset, I think that's the component that we've designed into the trial.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Brian Abrahams at RBC Capital Markets. Brian, go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrian Abrahams: Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. Given the potential for Medicaid cutbacks under a new administration, can you remind us around the degree of Medicaid exposure across your HIV franchise and the mechanics of how access and reimbursement work for these patients with respect to a federal budget, and also how such cuts might impact your outlook if at all? Thanks.\nJohanna Mercier: Sure. So let me try to address that one, although I think there's still more to come right, so we need a little bit more to see how this plays out for Medicaid specifically. At this point in time, patients that are in HIV always have a fallback position. So if Medicaid is where we go, that's probably about mid to high 20% of our total HIV business, and that is a percentage of our business that we watch very closely. There's also A-DAPT [ph] that supports through the same system. So there are different ways to get access for patients in this setting. And honestly, what we're tracking more closely in the overall channel mix that we think about HIV is more the growth that we've seen in 340B settings, which also can impact the Medicaid patient population. So from an access standpoint, it's never an issue to get HIV. There's different parachutes that are available for all of these patients, and we're going to watch very closely any Medicaid cutbacks at this point in time, but nothing's yet been announced.\nOperator: That completes the time that we have for questions. I'll invite Dan to share any closing remarks.\nDaniel O'Day : First of all, thank you all for joining. This has really been the strongest quarter for us of the year. The key highlights you've heard over the course of the discussion, both commercially but also clinically, the promise of our portfolio, the remarkable Phase 2 PURPOSE \u2013 sorry, excuse me, the PURPOSE 2 data on Lenacapivir, the very encouraging initial launch of seladelpar, and the data on anito-cel. I just want you to know we're firmly focused as a team on strong commercial and clinical execution. We'll continue to prioritize resources, and we have a commitment to ongoing OpEx management. I'll just flag two things between now and the end of the year. That's obviously what we've spoken about, the HIV analyst event in December, and also the upcoming presentation of anito-cel at ASH. And with that, I thank you for joining. I'll turn it over to Jackie to close the call.\nJackie Ross : Thank you, Dan, and thank you all for joining us today. One final housekeeping item. I can share that we are tentatively planning to release our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings results on February 11, 2025. Please note that this date is provisional and could be changed to accommodate scheduling conflicts that arise between now and then. As always, we will announce our confirmed date following the close of the quarter. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the quarter.",

            "content": "Thank you, Johanna. We're very pleased to wrap up the third quarter with another exciting update from our PURPOSE program, evaluating Lenacapavir for HIV prevention. As shown on Slide 18, we shared two oral presentations on our PURPOSE 2 HIV prevention trial at the HIV Research for Prevention Conference in October. Following the remarkable 100% efficacy reported from an interim analysis of the PURPOSE 1 trial in cisgender women in June, PURPOSE 2 was also stopped at the interim in September. Notably, twice yearly subcutaneous Lenacapavir significantly reduced incidence of HIV infections compared to both background HIV incidence and Truvada in the exceptionally diverse population of cisgender men and gender diverse people in a Phase 3 prevention trial. These PURPOSE 1 and 2 results demonstrated Lenacapavir's unprecedented results for HIV prevention. We look forward to sharing additional insights at the HIV Glasgow meeting next week, including persistence data from PURPOSE 1 and a deeper look into the efficacy data from PURPOSE 2. Based on these data, FDA has now granted breakthrough therapy designation for Lenacapavir for HIV prevention. We continue to target regulatory submission before the end of the year in the U.S., while at the same time preparing for filings with other global regulatory authorities. Beyond our registrational PURPOSE 1 and 2 programs, we continue to generate additional data from the Phase 2, PURPOSE 3, 4, and 5 trials in key populations across the U.S., U.K., and France. These studies are intended to contribute additional data in communities where the use of or access to prevention options have historically been challenging. Turning to our HIV treatment pipeline on Slide 19, we continue to make strong progress in developing novel regimens, including a once-daily oral regimen with two backbone therapies, Lenacapavir and Bictegravir. This novel combination has the potential to provide another effective daily oral option for people living with HIV, including the 6% to 8% of people currently on complex regimens. Recently, we completed enrollment of the Phase 3, ARTISTRY-1 trial within nine months of FPI and are on track to complete enrollment in ARTISTRY-2 by early 2025. Further, we've made strong progress for our two once-weekly oral programs. The Phase 2 study of our wholly owned combination of GS-4182, a pro-drug of Lenacapavir with enhanced oral bioavailability, and GS-1720, a long-acting integrase inhibitor, has now completed enrollment within two months of FPI, and we've enrolled our first participants into the Phase 3 ISLEND-1 and ISLEND-2 trials, evaluating the oral combination of Lenacapavir with Merck's NRTTI, Islatravir, for biologically suppressed people with HIV. We presented Week 48 data from the Phase 2 trial evaluating this once-weekly combination in a similar population at IDWeek. Participants in both, the Lenacapavir plus Islatravir and Biktarvy treatment arms maintained high rates of virologic suppression and no participants discontinued due to lymphocyte count decreases. Moving to our Liver Disease portfolio on Slide 20, FDA granted Livdelz an accelerated approval for the treatment of PBC in combination with UDCA in certain adults who have an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in certain patients unable to tolerate UDCA. We have already filed with EMA and expect a decision early next year. As part of the accelerated approval process, we continue to recruit for our confirmatory Phase 3 AFFIRM trial evaluating Seladelpar for improvement in event-free survival. Further, our Phase 3 IDELA trial is ongoing and offers us an opportunity to understand the effect of Seladelpar in normalizing alkaline phosphatase in a broader set of PBC patients who had an incomplete response to UDCA. Switching now to Oncology, on Slide 21, we continue to evolve our late-stage clinical programs in lung cancer in response to clinical data and the changing landscape. Reflective of our commitment to prioritizing the most significant opportunities across all our therapeutic areas, we've decided to discontinue further evaluation of Trodelvy in second line plus metastatic non-small cell lung cancer based on discussions with regulators following the EVOKE-01 readout earlier this year. In the front line, based on the totality of the data from the Phase 2 EVOKE-02 trial, we believe Trodelvy in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor without the addition of chemotherapy may have the greatest potential in this setting. To that end, our Phase 3 EVOKE-03 study of Trodelvy plus Pembro is ongoing in first-line patients with PD-L1 high metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Separately, we shared promising data for Trodelvy in extensive stage small cell lung cancer from our Phase 2 TROPiCS-03 basket trial and plan to advance development of Trodelvy in this population to a Phase 3 trial. We also look forward to sharing the results from Part I of the Phase 2 ARC-10 trial at the SITC meeting later this week, further adding to the body of data on Domvanalimab, our Fc-silent anti-TIGIT. As a reminder, we discontinued enrollment of ARC-10 earlier this year to prioritize the ongoing first-line Phase 3 DOM studies, STAR-121 in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and STAR-221 in upper GI cancers. Moving to Slide 22, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, we are excited to share updates at the upcoming ASH Conference, including our Phase 2 iMMagine 1 results for Anito-cel in fourth-line or later relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The ASH abstract shared yesterday reflects 58 patients who received Anito-cel with a median follow-up of 10.3 months as of the June 2024 cutoff. Treatment with Anito-cel demonstrated deep and durable efficacy with an objective response rate of 95% and a complete response rate of 62%. Of those available for MRD testing, 92% achieved MRD negativity. The median progression-free survival and overall survival had not yet been reached. Additionally, Arcellx announced yesterday that updated data from the Phase 1 study will be presented at ASH. In the meantime, Arcellx has already shared that an even later data cut from Phase 1 has shown that Anito-cel achieved a 30.2 month median progression-free survival, and median overall survival was not yet reached. In summary, we are encouraged by the compelling results so far, and with over 140 patients dosed across both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 iMMagine 1 studies, we have not yet seen any cases of delayed neurotoxicities. This includes no Parkinsonism, no cranial nerve palsies, and no Guillain-Barre\u0301 syndrome. We'll be sharing updated data at the ASH conference and look forward to potentially offering Anito-cel's best-in-class profile to these late-stage multiple myeloma patients. Separately, we're pleased FDA has granted Kite the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation, or RMAT, for the evaluation of Yescarta for newly diagnosed high-risk large B-cell lymphoma who have a positive PET scan after two cycles of first-line chemotherapy. Under the RMAT designation, the Yescarta development program for first-line treatment of high-risk large B-cell lymphoma will be able to access the benefits of the FDA's accelerated pathways, including fast-track and breakthrough designations. Our Phase 3 ZUMA-23 study in this setting is ongoing, and we look forward to sharing updates in due course. Moving to our milestones on Slide 23, a brief update on ASCENT-03. As a reminder, this is an event-driven trial, and I can share that we are continuing to accrue events at this time. With that in mind, it is possible we will not reach data cutoff this year, and we look forward to updating you in due course. Other updates this quarter included the readout of PURPOSE 2 data ahead of schedule, the review of our Phase 2 data for Lenacapavir plus our broadly neutralizing antibodies with plans to share the data at an upcoming scientific conference in 2025. The initiation of several key HIV, Trodelvy, and cell therapy trials, including enrollment for ISLEND-1, ISLEND-2, ASCENT-GYN-01, and iMMagine-3. In closing, I'd like to thank the Kite and Gilead Research and Development teams for a stellar quarter of execution. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Andy. Hi, Chris. The way we're approaching this is really to take a very broad approach. With the success with lenacapavir so far in what we've seen. We think that really forms a great foundation for us. And we believe that there is enough demand in both the oral and the injectable areas for us to be developing in both. So to your point, we really do see an opportunity for PrEP on the oral side for us to provide either weekly or monthly options, potentially also then going into the treatment market farther down the road, and in subcutaneous, and the key differentiator being the durability of the treatment. So, on the oral side, weekly to monthly. On the injectable side we think we can get to every three months and hopefully even up to every six months and beyond. So I think that's the key differentiator for us in terms of how we think about the opportunity. And of course, different people will be looking for different approaches, and our goal, our aim is to provide those options for them."

            "name": "Daniel O'Day",
            "content": "Thank you, Jackie. And good afternoon, everyone. The team and I are pleased to share Gilead's third quarter results, highlighting another very strong quarter of commercial and operational execution with robust year-over-year revenue performance across HIV, Oncology, and Liver Disease, including 9% growth in HIV. We also delivered strong bottom-line results that highlight the leverage in our business model and reflect our ongoing commitment to disciplined expense management. Based on our financial results year-to-date, we are increasing our 2024 guidance across almost every metric, including revenue and non-GAAP gross margin, operating income, and EPS. We continue to make excellent progress in our Virology and Inflammation programs in the third quarter. The results from the PURPOSE 2 study, which build on the 100% efficacy shown in PURPOSE 1, demonstrate lenacapavir's unmatched clinical profile observed for HIV prevention. If approved, lenacapavir, as the first twice-yearly subcutaneous injection for HIV prevention, could make a major impact on global public health and significantly catalyze the prevention market. I'm pleased to share that the FDA recently granted breakthrough therapy designation to Lenacapavir, and we are on track to file before the end of this year. We look forward to sharing information on our plans for lenacapavir and the rest of our leading HIV portfolio at our HIV Analyst Event on December 10th. We are very encouraged by the launch of Livdelzi for primary biliary cholangitis or PBC, which was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in August. Livdelzi is a highly differentiated option for people with PBC who do not respond well to first-line therapy. Demand in the third quarter was ahead of our internal expectations, and we expect to see growing momentum into 2025 and beyond. Livdelzi brings the number of innovative therapies launched by Gilead since 2019 to six, representing another step towards our goal of delivering at least 10 transformative therapies by 2030. Moving to Oncology, we are excited to share preliminary data from the registrational Phase 2, iMMagine-1 study of Anito-Cel for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma at ASH next month, in addition to updated data from the Phase 1 study, together with our partner Arcellx. We're also pleased to have begun the Phase 3, iMMagine-3 study in earlier-line patients. The combination of Anito-Cel's potential best-in-class clinical profile with Kite's leading cell therapy manufacturing has the ability to transform care for a large number of multiple myeloma patients. We continue to evolve our Oncology program in response to clinical data, regulatory feedback, and the competitive environment. We are carefully prioritizing our resources for the most promising programs. For example, we are advancing Trodelvy in first-line PD-L1 high metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, where we have seen supportive data in combination with pembro, while discontinuing development in second-line plus. We are also starting a new program for small cell lung cancer based on promising efficacy data from the Phase 2 TROPiCS-0 basket trial. Touching briefly on Slide 6, we have completed all of the clinical milestones and updates we targeted for 2024 and look forward to a strong end to the year, with key presentations coming up at ASH and our HIV Analyst Events in December. Those are the main points I wanted to share for now in what has been a very strong third quarter, thanks to the tremendous efforts of the Gilead teams. I look forward to our Q&A session at the end. And now I will pass it on to Johanna. Thanks Courtney. So, we have Cindy Perettie here. I'll turn it over to her to respond. Thanks Mike. We've got Joanna here, so let her take that question. Thanks Carter. This is Dan. So, first of all, we really look forward to hosting as many of you as possible at our HIV analyst event in December. And our intention is to start sharing some more of our plans on the commercialization for Lenacapavir with PrEP. Joanna has started to outline that on our quarterly calls, but we really need some more time to dimensionalize that market, to begin to discuss how we will approach different aspects of the Lenacapavir for PrEP market. I think you can expect them to be qualitative, but also quantitative from the opportunity. I think to your point about peak sales and things, that would come more into our guidance that would come more at the beginning of next year in terms of how we might see 2025 and beyond. But in addition to the commercialization, we're going to spend a lot of time on highlighting the progress of our long-acting treatment combinations. Merdad covered this in some of the prepared remarks, but we intend to bring you into even more detail about the progress of our long-acting treatment combinations in addition to what we've already disclosed. So we will have some new disclosures there. We'll also be able to share our perspective on how we see the treatment market evolving in the coming years, and I think that's an area of tremendous strength in terms of our overall program. As you know, we're processing a variety of long-acting treatment programs in parallel, to make sure that we have multiple options for patients from longer-acting orals to longer-acting injectables, and you can expect to get an update on the R&D progress of those, and some further update on timelines as we move forward. Again, just to remind you of course, the totality of our HIV business is such that we really don't have any significant patent expiries until Biktarvy in 2033. And really by that time, we will not only have the lend for PrEP unfolding over that period of time, but significant progress with potentially four new modalities for long-acting treatment even before 2033. So the intention is to really pull through and to show you the durability of our HIV business, well into the late 2030's. Merdad is here Chris. We'll let him answer that. Thanks. First of all, thank you all for joining. This has really been the strongest quarter for us of the year. The key highlights you've heard over the course of the discussion, both commercially but also clinically, the promise of our portfolio, the remarkable Phase 2 PURPOSE \u2013 sorry, excuse me, the PURPOSE 2 data on Lenacapivir, the very encouraging initial launch of seladelpar, and the data on anito-cel.

            "name": "Andrew Dickinson",
            "content": "Thank you, Merdad. And good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results represent a strong quarter for Gilead. As shown on Slide 25, with our base business up 7% year-over-year to $6.8 billion, driven by growth in each of our core businesses. Veklury also delivered substantial growth, resulting in total product sales up 7% year-over-year to $7.5 billion. Before moving to non-GAAP, I'll highlight the impairment charge that impacted our third quarter financial results on a GAAP basis, as noted on Slide 26. As a reminder, this relates to the carrying value of the IPR&D indefinite live intangible assets acquired from Immunomedics in 2020. During the third quarter, we decreased the fair value by $1.8 billion, or $1.04 per share net of tax impact, reflecting the removal of the second-line non-small-cell lung cancer indication. The remaining $1.8 billion carrying value reflects Trodelvy's opportunity in the first-line setting. Note that the potential indications that we've begun to explore since the acquisition are not reflected in the carrying value, such as endometrial or small-cell lung cancer. Moving to our non-GAAP results for the third quarter on Slide 27. Product gross margin was 87%, up 84 basis points from last year, primarily due to product mix. R&D expenses were down 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by timing of clinical activities, such as the wind-down of the magrolimab program and the obeldesivir oral COVID studies, and supported by our broader expense management initiatives. Acquired IPR&D was $505 million, which reflects the $320 million buyout of global Livdelzi royalties from Janssen announced in August, and the $35 million upfront expense to initiate a new AI partnership with Genesis, in addition to ongoing collaboration expenses. SG&A was up 8% year-over-year, primarily due to timing of commercial and corporate activities, including the launch of Livdelzi in the United States, and other initiatives, including prelaunch preparations for Lenacapavir for PrEP. Operating margin for the third quarter was 43%. Excluding the impact of the royalty buyout charge from Janssen, operating margin would have been 47%. While there will always be some quarterly variability, recent results demonstrate a consistent trend of our operating margin firmly in the 40% plus range, and we remain focused on being an industry leader in terms of operating margin. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%, as compared to 7% in the same period last year. As a reminder, the tax rate in the third quarter of 2023 benefited from decreased tax reserves as a result of reaching an agreement with a tax authority on certain tax positions. In total, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.02 per share, as compared to $2.29 per share in the same period last year, primarily reflecting higher acquired IPR&D and tax expense, partially offset by higher product sales. As mentioned earlier, the $320 million expense related to buyout of global Livdelzi royalties from Janssen impacted our EPS by $0.20 per share. As highlighted on Slide 28, we had a strong first nine months of the year, with solid performance in each of our core franchises across HIV, Oncology, and Liver Disease, driving base business growth of 7% year-over-year, with Veklury already exceeding our initial full-year guidance of $1.3 billion. Altogether, total product sales for the nine months of 2024 were up 6% year-over-year. Moving to guidance on Slide 29. We are updating much of our guidance to reflect the very strong performance in our business so far this year. We are increasing our guidance for product sales, excluding Veklury, by $150 million at the midpoint from the prior range to a new range of $26 billion to $26.3 billion. In addition to our strong year-to-day performance, this guidance accounts for evolving competition in our cell therapy business. The increased revenue guidance also reflects higher full-year expectations for HIV, now expected to grow approximately 5% from 2023, compared to our prior expectations of 4%. This guidance implies that fourth-quarter HIV could be roughly flat, which we believe is prudent given the strength in the third quarter and the normal variability we can see with HIV pricing. We expect full-year Veklury revenue to be approximately $1.8 billion. We therefore expect full-year 2024 total product sales in the range of $27.8 billion to $28.1 billion, an increase of $650 million at the midpoint compared to the prior range. Turning to the rest of the P&L on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product gross margin to be approximately 86%, narrowed from our prior 85% to 86% range, and reflecting year-to-date results as well as our expectations for a more favorable product mix in the fourth quarter. We now expect R&D expense to decline a low single-digit percentage as compared to our prior outlook of low-to-mid single-digit growth, reflecting the discontinuation of certain programs and careful expense management. And there is no change to our prior expectations for both acquired IPR&D and SG&A. Reflecting these updates, we now expect operating income in the range of $8 billion to $8.3 billion, up from $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion previously. Full-year tax is expected to be approximately 27%, slightly lower than our prior 30% guidance, and reflecting the higher operating income for the full year as well as the negative impact from the one-time charge for the acquisition of CymaBay in the first quarter. As a reminder, this compares to our initial guidance in February of approximately 19% prior to the CymaBay impact. Altogether, we've raised our earnings per share guidance to a range of $4.25 and $4.45. This compares to our prior guidance of $3.60 to $3.90, and reflects both revenue outperformance and continued operating expense discipline. At the midpoints, our updated guidance represents an increase of $750 million in non-GAAP operating income and an increase of $0.60 in non-GAAP earnings per share. On a GAAP basis, EPS is expected to be $0.05 to $0.25. Moving to Slide 30, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the third quarter and a total of $3.7 billion in the first nine months of the year. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with significant balance sheet flexibility. Overall, Gilead is on track to deliver an extremely strong 2024, and we're particularly pleased with our progress on operating expense management, which we believe sets us up well as we enter 2025. And now, I'll invite Rebecca to begin the Q&A. Hey Chris. It's Andy. Thanks for the question. We'll provide more specific guidance on 2025, of course, on our year-end call. What we've said though consistently and you see in the last two quarters is real progress in terms of letting the operating margin expand again as we now kind of enter a new phase of having now built the portfolio, executing both clinically and commercially, and really focusing on expense management. You see the strong operating margin both in the second quarter and the third quarter. Again, you heard my prepared remarks that the operating margin would have been 47% this quarter if you backed out the impact of the royalty purchase from Janssen on seladelpar. So we're off to a great start. Our ambition and expectation is that we will have an industry-leading operating margin over time. So again, it's too early to give any specific guidance on 2025. More to come, but we're really pleased with where we are and the progress that you've seen in the last couple quarters, and we're already in a very strong spot, and we'll continue to work to improve it over time. And Chris, it's Andy. Maybe I'll just add one thing. The slide references the products that we expect to have approved by 2030. You should not read into that, that we don't expect these long-acting subcutaneous products to come to market even shortly after that. So we'll provide more guidance over time. Again, we'll talk more about the portfolio at our HIV day as Dan mentioned, but we were just focusing purely on that slide to the end of the decade. It doesn't mean that we don't see a series of potential product launches beyond that as well, so more to come. Thanks for the question."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Cindy Perettie",
            "content": "Thanks Courtney for your question. So, if I look at the in-class competition that we face this quarter, it boils down to two things. One is two new indications, both in follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma. And the second is an increase in capacity within manufacturing. So, that's the in-class space that we're facing. Out-of-class, we continue to face competition through bi-specifics. And I would put them probably at about 50-50 on what we're seeing today. From our strategy standpoint, we do not believe we have to pivot it. I think in the Oncology space, when new therapies get approved and new indications, it's very common for physicians to try out the new therapies, and we expect to see that, and we've seen that both with in-class and out-of-class competitors. We're continuing to focus on driving both, our class share and our brand share, and feel very confident in the plans that we have to-date to continue our expansion into the community and elsewhere. And I feel confident that we're going to build on our leadership, both for YESCARTA and TECARTUS, but also recognizing as we look ahead, anito-cel will be coming in 2026. Thank you, Umer. So, your question about our perspective on whether it's the construct or the trial design that relates to the delayed neurotoxicity that we haven't observed, we believe it's the construct. As a reminder, we have a very compact DD domain, and we think that that is a big piece of why we aren't seeing the delayed neurotoxin or continuing to look with our translational medicine group to uncover sort of pieces of that, but we're having increasing confidence that it's the construct. I think the second piece that you asked is, do we have sufficient data. Look, we're at 100 patients' worth of data between the Phase 1 of 38 patients and what we just shared in the ASH abstract. Coming forward to ASH, we're going to have a larger data set. We've done another data cut that we're cleaning now that we'll be presenting at ASH. So having that confidence of over 100 patients to-date and not observing the neurotoxicity, makes us recognize that we have a best-in-class construct, and we're really looking forward to sharing that data at ASH. Yeah, so we have taken all of our learnings from Yescarta and Tecartus and applied that to the Anito-cel production. And as we shared last quarter, we have done the full tech transfer into our Maryland facility, and we're producing Anito-cel for iMMagine-3 study, where we have successfully dosed two patients now. And our turnaround times are looking very similar to our commercial product that we have today, again, having applied all those learnings. So, we don't have any concerns about our ability to scale. We've also not had feedback from the FDA that we would have to use the same approach as other competitors in this space. Thanks a lot, Dana, for the question. So, I think the components around the regulatory filing as you're aware, what we've seen with others in the space is that the FDA would be looking at 12 months' worth of data, where this will be a filing discussion that we have with FDA. We do believe we have a very differentiated safety profile, and we'll be talking to the agency about that review cycle based on that. The second question that you asked was around that today, only two out of 10 patients receiving CAR T. We know in multiple myeloma it's one out of 10, so we have our work to do. The work that we're putting towards the community practices and ungating some of the reimbursement access challenges, are the same challenges we will face, whether it's lymphoma or multiple myeloma. So all the applications we're putting forward in our plan today will apply to Anito-cel, and that's why it's really critical as we execute over the next 12 to 18 months, because we're really excited to bring Anito-cel to more patients. Yeah, we don't usually share the number of clinical sites that we have recruiting, but trust that the team is working hard to get all 130 up and going. You were asking a little bit about the outpatient profile. We believe that this therapy has an outpatient profile. You can tell by just looking at the ICANNs and CRS rates that we're seeing, and we've actually designed that into our phase, iMMagine-3 Phase 3 programs. So we'll have data generated in that outpatient setting. As you talked about the onset, I think that's the component that we've designed into the trial."

            "content": "Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. It was another strong quarter of commercial execution across the business, and I'm proud of the work the teams continue to do to expand the reach of our medicines to many more people and patients around the world. As shown on Slide 8, total product sales, excluding Veklury, were $6.8 billion in the third quarter, up 7% year-over-year, reflecting strong growth across HIV, Oncology, and Liver Disease. Including Veklury, total product sales were $7.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Starting with HIV on Slide 9, sales of $5.1 billion were up 9% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, primarily driven by higher average realized price due to shifts in channel mix and higher demand across treatment and PrEP. The third quarter once again demonstrated the quarterly pricing variability we see in HIV. Specifically, we saw adjustments to government channels where there's a multi-quarter lag for certain claims data. As a result, the quarter reflected more favorable average realized pricing. Year-to-date, HIV sales have grown 5%, well above our prior full-year growth target of 4%. With that outperformance in mind, we're increasing our full-year HIV growth expectation to 5%, and we remind you to focus on full-year versus quarterly trends. To that end, for the fourth quarter in particular, we expect HIV sales to be roughly flat, quarter-over-quarter, with continued demand growth and modest seasonal inventory builds, offset by the third quarter pricing dynamics discussed earlier that are not expected to repeat. Turning to Slide 10, Biktarvy third quarter sales of $3.5 billion increased 13% year-over-year, driven by higher demand as well as higher average realized price due to shifts in channel mix, partially offset by inventory dynamics. Sequentially, sales were up 7%, primarily driven by channel mix and higher demand. In the U.S. and across major markets, Biktarvy continues to be the regimen of choice for those starting treatment and switching therapies, and has grown for 25 consecutive quarters. In the U.S., Biktarvy's share grew to over 49%, up more than 2% year-over-year, and remains the leading regimen for HIV treatment. Gilead is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in the HIV treatment market with four new regimens by the end of 2030. Overall, the HIV treatment market continues to grow in line with our expectations of 2% to 3% annually. Moving to Descovy, third quarter sales were $586 million, up 15% year-over-year, reflecting higher demand and average realized price due to channel mix, partially offset by inventory dynamics. Sequentially, sales were up 21%, primarily driven by channel mix and higher demand. The U.S. PrEP market continues to demonstrate robust growth, up 13% year-over-year, and Descovy for PrEP remains the leading branded option, capturing over 40% market share despite the availability of generics and other regimens. Overall, Descovy for PrEP sales make up an increasing portion of total Descovy sales, representing roughly 80% in the third quarter. This is a strong foundation as we prepare for the first anticipated commercial launch of lenacapavir for PrEP next year. Lenacapavir's remarkable clinical profile and unmatched twice-yearly administration offer the potential to redefine the HIV prevention market, and we look forward to sharing more details on our commercialization plans and treatment programs at our HIV analyst event in December. In the meantime, we look to file for approval in the U.S. before the end of the year and are well underway with our preparations for the first commercial launch in 2025. In addition to our commercial plans, we're particularly proud of our commitment to make lenacapavir available in 120 high-incidence, resource-limited countries as quickly as possible, ensuring access for lenacapavir for PrEP is made as broadly available upon approval. Moving to the Liver Disease portfolio on Slide 11, sales of $733 million in the third quarter were up 4% year-over-year, driven by increased demand across our viral hepatitis portfolio, partially offset by pricing dynamics, including shifts in channel mix in the U.S. Sequentially, after an incredibly strong second quarter, sales declined 12%, primarily driven by inventory dynamics and fewer patients starts in HCV. Turning to Slide 12, in mid-August, we launched Livdelzi in the U.S. for PBC, with the first prescription written within a few hours of the accelerated approval. Furthermore, with 100% of our U.S. commercial organization trained by the time of launch, we quickly reached more than 1,000 of our target prescribers within the first several weeks. Overall, we're very encouraged with the patient demand we're seeing so far, which is ahead of our internal expectations. We believe this reflects the differentiated profile of Livdelzi as the only approved therapy, with statistically significant improvements in both ALP and pruritus, as well as an established safety profile. Sales in the third quarter were modest, as we expected, in the low single-digit million, and reflective of the ramp-up time required to onboard patients and providers, and to work through step-edits and prior authorizations that are normal for a rare disease launch. We expect to start building momentum as we enter 2025, when we look to a more meaningful sales contribution. Outside the U.S., launch preparations are ongoing, and we look forward to the European Regulatory decision in early 2025. Moving to Slide 13, Veklury has continued to remain the antiviral standard of care for hospitalized patients treated for COVID-19, including in the U.S., with more than 60% share in this setting. Altogether, with higher than expected hospitalizations in the summer months, sales in the third quarter were up 9% year-over-year to $692 million. Year-to-date sales of $1.5 billion are now well ahead of our initial full-year guidance of $1.3 billion. As a result, we're raising our full-year guidance for Veklury to approximately $1.8 billion. Now, turning to Oncology on Slide 14, Gilead or Kite therapies have treated more than 65,000 patients globally, highlighting our continued growing reach. Sales for the quarter were $860 million, up 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by Trodelvy growth. Sequentially, Oncology sales were down 3%, with growth in Trodelvy offset by a decline in cell therapy. Beginning with Trodelvy on Slide 15, sales of $332 million were up 17% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting higher demand in all regions. In breast cancer, Trodelvy remains well-positioned as the only approved and commercially available TROP2-directed ADC to demonstrate clinically meaningful survival benefits across two types of metastatic breast cancers. Notably, Trodelvy is the standard of care for second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, with ongoing adoption in the pretreated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer setting. We're pleased to see both indications contribute to Trodelvy's growth year-over-year, despite an evolving competitive landscape. Turning to Slide 16, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, cell therapy sales of $485 million in the third quarter were flat year-over-year, with strong 23% growth outside the U.S., offset by the U.S. Sequentially, total cell therapy sales were down 7% due to competitive headwinds both in and out of class in the U.S., which we expect to continue into 2025. As a pioneer in cell therapy, Kite's focus is to expand overall utilization and increase class share. As part of this work, we're partnering with government agencies and healthcare associations to amplify education of the benefits of CAR-T and remove barriers to access. To date, only two of every 10 eligible patients receive CAR-T in second-line plus large B-cell lymphoma in the U.S., and we are committed to removing these barriers so we can deliver potentially curative therapies like Yescarta to more patients. In the community setting, Kite is leading the way in identifying and lowering barriers and building the right ecosystem to enable more people to receive CAR-T beyond the reach of an academic medical institution. Today, CAR-T sites often need to be accredited, typically by the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy, or FACT, and this requirement has been highlighted as a hurdle for our community partners to achieve national pay reimbursement. In the meantime, we're pleased to share that we have treated our first few patients as part of our community strategy, demonstrating that we can deliver Yescarta in this setting. Outside the U.S., we saw year-over-year demand growth as we continue to expand into the second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma setting in Europe and launch a new market. In particular, we're encouraged by our progress in Japan, where we have on-boarded more than 50 authorized treatment centers in little over a year, with more to come in the near future. Overall, I would like to thank the commercialization teams for their hard work to deliver another strong quarter and first nine months of the year. With launch activities underway in PBC and for HIV prevention launch next year, our teams are excited to bring our transformative medicines to many more people and patients globally. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I think we're very excited about the potential launch for lenacapavir for PrEP. The growth opportunities are clear for us, right. It's around market-size growth, when you think about more consumers using PrEP, and more prescribers prescribing it, so more physician-based, and then of course more countries, because thus far it's really been very U.S. focused. We do think there's a real expansion just in the consumers, when you think about right now the market is primarily white MSMs. We think there's a real opportunity to expand that to include Black, Latino individuals, young adults, cisgender women, transgender. So, there's a lot there, let alone prescribers. Right now, the prescribers we have are currently the ones that prescribe, generally speaking, for HIV treatment, and we think the market can be expanded much more broadly than that. And then of course countries, and as I was mentioning, I do think there's real opportunities when you think about a Lenacapavir for PrEP and the profile that it offers, quite differentiated. From a market-share growth, I think it'll be mixed. I think you are right. I think Lenacapavir, twice yearly SUBQ profile offers a lot, for people looking for HIV prevention who may want or need it, and I do think it will have some impact on both, Descovy from a daily oral standpoint, but also 55% of the market is actually generic oral. And I do think it's going to have a big impact across the whole daily oral market to see Lenacapavir come in. As to your question about how quickly we can do that, I mean, the plans for commercialization are well underway. We are thinking through, how do we make sure we make this a seamless experience for all of our customers? So that includes providers when they prescribe Lenacapavir, but also for consumers to make sure they have access to Lenacapavir, and that's looking at our distribution system, our reimbursement, and making sure that we just provide that seamless experience for all. So, more to come on that. We have the HIV analyst event coming up in December, and we'll be able to share a little bit more data there, but definitely an opportunity for us to grow overall Gilead's share in the prevention market, both with Descovy for those who prefer daily oral, but obviously the growth is really going to come from Lenacapavir for prevention. Sure. I'll take that one. It's Joanna. So, we're really quite pleased with our initial launch. So, it's only been a few months. We launched mid-August, but so far we've exceeded our internal expectations for patient demand. And I just want to take a moment, and then I'll address your payer coverage question specifically. I'm just really pleased and proud of the cross-functional team that's come together so quickly. They were fully trained and mobilized within 24 hours of our approval, and we had our first script within hours of the approval from the FDA. We've reached over 1,000 of our key targets in the first two and a half weeks post-launch. And obviously, you can appreciate that our history in Liver Disease and our credibility here really opens the doors for the access to these key stakeholders for PBC, which really obviously is critical as you think about early launch dynamics, and so we're very excited about that. We also took a very clear strategy when it came to what we were looking for, for reimbursement, but also distribution. And so from day one, we enabled direct purchasing with a specialty distributor, which was actually quite pivotal when you think about key academic centers. And if you think about the business, it's probably a mix about 50-50 or so between the academic centers and in the community. The coverage so far with payers is very much in line with our expectations for rare disease, and we're really quite encouraged to see that no major barriers are happening to actually get access to Livdelzi outside of the typical ones that happen. But really, for appropriate patients, it takes a little bit more time, because we have to get through the step edits and the prior auth. But we are getting through and patients are having access to seladelpar and Livdelzi. So, we're excited and more to come as we think about 2024, but more importantly, as we ramp up into 2025, right. We've always said it would be a modest contribution in \u201824 with a more meaningful contribution to sales in 2025, so stay tuned. Yeah, maybe just to add to Merdad's comments, our approach is truly patient-centric. The opportunity is just to make sure that we answer and address the needs, and the needs have been mixed. I think there are some that really do prefer to be reminded and can take an oral pill only and don't want an injectable. And others don't really want to think about HIV if they don't have to, and if they can take four injections a year, that could do it as well or two even, as to Merdad's comments as well. So more to come on that as to what we're doing, but the intent is truly, as we're leaders today in HIV, both across treatment and prevention, the intent is to continue to remain leaders for the future, and that's really with the pipeline that we have in our portfolio and the combinations that we have. So we're excited about the future and what it holds. Yes. So Salveen, I'll try to address that one and you'll hear more about that actually as we go into the HIV analyst event as well in early December. So we do believe that it's at least 600,000 by 2030. Now, this is a market in the past that we've really worked at through social media, direct-to-consumer, etc., to really make sure we activate it and that's how it's grown thus far to about 350,000 to 400,000 consumers today. We think there's a real opportunity and most of the growth is going to come from different consumers to be honest. So thus far, the vast majority of consumers of HIV PrEP are white MSMs. And so we think with PURPOSE 1, PURPOSE 2, and actually other PURPOSE studies to follow, this is the broadest clinical trial program that we've ever done in prevention or that's ever been done in prevention. And it includes many other consumers that I think really may need or even want prevention, and that includes Latino, black individuals, women, cisgender women, transgender, and then even young adults right. And so a lot of that growth is going to come from there. So could it be beyond the 600,000? Absolutely, 600,000. And we do think that most of that is going to be driven by a new option on the market, and that is Lenacapivir for prevention. To have something that you don't need to think about when you are not ill to take every single day versus twice a year is a big differentiation, let alone with the data and efficacy that we've shown in both PURPOSE 1 and PURPOSE 2. So, more to come on that. I do think we have a lot of opportunities here. And the intent is to truly work on expanding this market for the future. I think it's not about thinking about what's currently in play today, but actually what it could be by 2030 with a little bit of investment and education and awareness. Yeah. So as you move up earlier lines of therapy, obviously, as TNBC progresses unfortunately quite rapidly, the market is actually quite larger. It's probably just about double more. And then of course, the split between PD-L1 negative and PD-L1 positive, and that's ASCENT-03, ASCENT-04, that's a bit of a split as well. A little bit more on the negative than the positive in TNBC. And so we do think with ASCENT-03, and then the future with ASCENT-04 moving up in earlier lines of therapy, it can really make a difference for these women. If we can show overall survival in this setting as well, I think that can be incredibly powerful for us. As we've really established our place in second-line plus as the standard of care, really the opportunity would be to move up with those women to really make a difference earlier on in their metastatic disease. Sure. So let me try to address that one, although I think there's still more to come right, so we need a little bit more to see how this plays out for Medicaid specifically. At this point in time, patients that are in HIV always have a fallback position. So if Medicaid is where we go, that's probably about mid to high 20% of our total HIV business, and that is a percentage of our business that we watch very closely. There's also A-DAPT [ph] that supports through the same system. So there are different ways to get access for patients in this setting. And honestly, what we're tracking more closely in the overall channel mix that we think about HIV is more the growth that we've seen in 340B settings, which also can impact the Medicaid patient population. So from an access standpoint, it's never an issue to get HIV. There's different parachutes that are available for all of these patients, and we're going to watch very closely any Medicaid cutbacks at this point in time, but nothing's yet been announced."

In a moment, we'll begin with our prepared remarks followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] I'll now hand the call over to Jacquie Ross, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategic Finance.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you, Rebecca. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the second quarter of 2024. The press release, slides and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open Q&A where the team will be joined by Cindy Poretti, the Executive Vice President of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. Please refer to Slide 2 regarding the risks and uncertainties relating to forward-looking statements that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.\nDaniel O'Day: Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to share that this was another strong quarter of commercial execution with growth across HIV, Liver Disease, and Oncology. Biktarvy for HIV treatment was up 8% year-over-year, Trodelvy was up 23%, and Cell Therapy was up 11%. In addition, we continued to demonstrate disciplined operating expense management and delivered exceptional bottom-line growth, highlighting the leverage in our business model. Given the results for the first half of the year, we are raising our non-GAAP operating income and EPS guidance for the full year. Moving to clinical updates, this is an important time for our Virology and Inflammation therapeutic areas. A key highlight of the quarter was the readout of our Phase 3 PURPOSE 1 trial evaluating lenacapavir for HIV prevention. The results showed 100% efficacy with zero HIV infections in cisgender women. The presentation of these results at AIDS 2024 in Munich generated considerable excitement, and we\u2019re delighted to have reached this milestone with such a positive outcome. Lenacapavir, with its twice-yearly dosing, could set a new bar for HIV prevention and allow PrEP to reach a much broader population of people who could benefit from a prevention regimen. The PURPOSE program, which is expected to include more than 9,000 participants in over 10 countries, is designed to highlight the efficacy of HIV prevention in a wide range of groups, including cisgender women, transgender men and women, Black and Latino individuals, and young adults. We expect an update for PURPOSE 2 late this year or early next year, with a commercial launch as early as late 2025. The PURPOSE data were part of several updates at AIDS 2024 that highlight the strength of Gilead\u2019s innovation in HIV, for both prevention and treatment. Our pipeline has the promise to extend our HIV leadership well into the late 2030s and beyond. Updates at AIDS 2024 included data from our daily oral combination of bictegravir and lenacapavir, which is now in pivotal Phase 3 trials for people with HIV, including those on complex regimens. We also shared data from our broad long-acting program, including our once-weekly orals GS-4182 and GS-1720. We plan to start the Phase 2 study evaluating these in combination before the end of the year. This is in addition to the once-weekly oral combination of lenacapavir and islatravir in partnership with Merck that will begin Phase 3, also before the end of the year. On the immediate horizon, our PDUFA date for seladelpar is next week. The body of clinical evidence behind seladelpar for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC, continues to grow, most recently with the Phase 3 ASSURE data shared at EASL. The Gilead team is excited by the opportunity to launch seladelpar and bring a promising new treatment to the patients who could benefit. Moving to Oncology, we are ready to manufacture anito-cel for multiple myeloma at our Maryland Kite facility, and we are preparing to support the Phase 3 iMMagine-3 trial from the site starting later this year. The iMMagine-3 trial is expected to reach a broader set of 2nd- to 4th-line multiple myeloma patients with our potentially best-in-class BCMA CAR T. At ASCO, we shared new data from our Phase 2 EVOKE-02 program evaluating Trodelvy in combination with pembro in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The results showed meaningful efficacy compared to the historical standard-of-care, supporting the Phase 3 EVOKE-03 trial currently underway. We continue to assess the path for Trodelvy in second-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic bladder cancer following the EVOKE-01 and TROPiCS-04 readouts earlier this year. In the meantime, I\u2019d highlight the strong commercial results this quarter in breast cancer where Trodelvy remains the first and only approved TROP2-directed ADC on the market and is the standard of care for second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. To date, we have served over 40,000 cancer patients, and remain confident that Trodelvy will continue to be an important treatment option. We also shared Phase 2 EDGE-Gastric data at ASCO for domvanalimab plus zimberelimab and chemotherapy in first-line upper GI cancers. These results showed compelling efficacy that supports the Phase 3 STAR-221 program, which has completed enrollment. Moving to our 2024 key milestones on slide 6, we look forward to the upcoming updates from the Phase 3 ASCENT-03 trial and Phase 2 iMMagine-1 trial. ASCENT-03 is an event-driven trial evaluating Trodelvy in first-line PD-L1 negative metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients. A positive progression-free survival outcome would support global filings, potentially moving Trodelvy into earlier lines of triplenegative breast cancer. Our iMMagine-1 trial could support regulatory filings for anito-cel in later-line relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Overall, the second quarter was a strong performance for the Gilead team, with the highlights including some remarkable clinical results in HIV, solid revenue growth across therapeutic areas, tangible impact from our disciplined cost management initiatives, and planning for the imminent launch of seladelpar. With that, I will hand it over to Johanna.\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m very pleased to report the continued momentum we saw in the second quarter, and would like to thank the Gilead teams who contributed to another strong quarter of execution. As shown on slide 8, total product sales, excluding Veklury were $6.7 billion in the second quarter, up 6% year-over-year, with growth across HIV, Liver Disease, and Oncology. Including Veklury, total product sales were $6.9 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Starting with HIV on slide 9, sales of $4.7 billion were up 3% year-over-year, driven by strong demand across treatment and prevention, partially offset by lower average realized price due to channel mix. Quarter-over-quarter, sales were up 9%, reflecting favorable pricing and inventory build following the typical first quarter dynamics, as well as higher demand. Looking to the full year, we remain on-track to deliver HIV sales growth of approximately 4%. Turning to slide 10, total second quarter Biktarvy sales of $3.2 billion were up 8% year-over-year, primarily due to higher demand. Sequentially, sales were up 10%, largely reflecting favorable pricing and inventory following the typical first quarter dynamics. Highlighting our leadership position, Biktarvy represents more than 49% share of the treatment market in the U.S. This was up almost 3% year-over-year, our 24th consecutive quarter of year-over-year market share gain. With a meaningful share lead over all other branded regimens for HIV treatment, Biktarvy firmly remains the HIV treatment-of-choice, particularly for those starting or switching regimens in the U.S., as well as across other major markets. Overall, the HIV treatment market continues to grow in-line with our expectations of 2% to 3% annually. Turning to Descovy, we continued to see higher demand with sales of $485 million in the second quarter. Year-over-year, sales were down 6% as demand growth was more than offset by lower average realized price due to channel mix. As a reminder, shifts in channel mix will continue to impact average realized price in addition to our ongoing efforts to ensure people who want or need PrEP have access to the prevention regimen of their choice. Sequentially, sales were up 14%, reflecting favorable inventory and pricing following typical first quarter seasonality, in addition to the higher demand. Descovy for PrEP once again maintained its over 40% PrEP market share in the U.S., despite the availability of other regimens, including generics. We\u2019re particularly excited to note that the HIV PrEP market in the U.S. continues to expand, with total volumes up more than 12% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year. With that in mind, we are thrilled with the unprecedented results seen in our pivotal Phase 3 PURPOSE 1 trial, achieving 100% efficacy with zero cases of HIV infections in a broad population of cisgender women, including those who are pregnant or lactating. This is just the beginning of our larger, landmark PURPOSE program which includes multiple populations and communities where PrEP is underutilized or more difficult to access today, such as cisgender women, transgender men and women, Black and Latino individuals, and young adults. Overall, we expect lenacapavir will emerge as the regimen-of-choice for those who want or need prevention as the first and only long-acting option with twice-yearly subcutaneous dosing. We are preparing for potential launch as early as late 2025. Moving to the Liver Disease portfolio on slide 11, sales were up 17% year-over-year and 13% sequentially, driven by higher demand and higher average realized price due to channel mix in the U.S. Our Liver Disease franchise continues to differentiate itself, with leading share in HCV despite fewer HCV starts year-over-year together with growing demand in HBV and HDV. As you know, our PDUFA date for seladelpar is next week, and we stand ready to launch commercially in the U.S. We are able to leverage our existing commercial footprint in liver diseases, and continue building upon these relationships to quickly bring seladelpar to many of the 130,000 people impacted by PBC in the U.S. who progress after initial treatment. Outside the U.S., commercial preparations are well underway, and we look forward to the European regulatory decision in early 2025. Turning to Slide 12, while severity of COVID infections and hospitalization rates remain variable, Veklury continues to be recognized as an important part of the standard of care for hospitalized patients treated for COVID-19. This includes the U.S. where Veklury has maintained well over 60% share in this setting. For the second quarter, Veklury sales were down 16% year-over-year and down 61% sequentially, as expected. Moving to Oncology on slide 13, sales were up 15% year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-quarter to $841 million. With over 60,000 patients treated with a Gilead or Kite therapy to date, we\u2019re proud of the positive impact our oncology medicines have made across multiple cancer types. Looking in more detail at Trodelvy on slide 14, sales for the second quarter were $320 million, up 23% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially, primarily driven by higher demand in the U.S. and Europe across its metastatic breast cancer indications. Trodelvy is the only approved and available TROP2-directed ADC to demonstrate clinically meaningful survival benefits across two types of metastatic breast cancers. And with increasing awareness amongst physicians, Trodelvy has remained the leading regimen in the U.S. and Europe for second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer with growing adoption in the pre-treated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer setting. We are working to expand Trodelvy\u2019s reach beyond the 40,000-plus patients treated to date across multiple tumor types as we look to new and existing markets, as well as new indications. In bladder cancer, we are planning to further discuss the results of TROPiCS-04 and next steps with FDA. At this time, Trodelvy continues to be available under an accelerated approval in the U.S. for second-line plus metastatic or advanced bladder cancer. Turning to Slide 15, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, Cell Therapy sales in the second quarter were $521 million, up 11% year-over-year and up 9% quarter-over-quarter, with solid growth in all regions. In the U.S., sales were up 11% sequentially as we've begun to see momentum from our focused efforts at the authorized treatment centers, including further educating providers and patients on the curative potential of our cell therapies. Despite these efforts, in-class and out-of-class competition remain a near-term headwind in the U.S. As we extend the reach of cell therapy, we are making important in-roads with key community practices, including working with national payers to unlock broader commercial reimbursement, and as a reminder, expect impact from these initiatives towards the end of 2024. We\u2019ll continue to refine this \u201cblueprint\u201d as we work to onboard new centers and patients over time. Outside the U.S., demand for Yescarta and Tecartus across Europe and other international geographies remains strong, and we\u2019re encouraged by the solid progress in our newly launched markets such as Japan and Saudi Arabia. Overall, it was a strong second quarter for our commercial portfolio, and the teams are energized by the potential to bring two more transformational therapies to market \u2013 first with seladelpar for PBC next week, and then, lenacapavir for HIV prevention as early as late next year. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Merdad.\nMerdad Parsey: Thank you, Johanna. We were very pleased to wrap up the second quarter with two New England Journal of Medicine publications and a number of important readouts across our portfolio. Most exciting was the readout of our Phase 3 PURPOSE 1 trial evaluating twice-yearly, subcutaneous lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV infection in cisgender women. As you can see on slide 17, this was the first Phase 3 HIV prevention trial to ever achieve 100% efficacy. We have since shared data at the International AIDS Society meeting in July, where our presentation was the highlight of the plenary session. The data were simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Our second registrational trial for lenacapavir, PURPOSE 2, has enrolled approximately 3,300 men, transwomen, and non-binary people who have sex with men. This trial completed enrollment globally in December 2023, approximately four months after PURPOSE 1. As a result, we expect to provide an update in late 2024 or early 2025. Assuming positive data from PURPOSE 2, we plan to file based on data from both trials, with the goal of bringing transformative HIV prevention to people at risk of HIV as early as late 2025. Beyond our registrational trials, we are generating Phase 2 data from the PURPOSE 3, 4, and 5 trials in key populations across the U.S., UK, and France, including people who inject drugs. These trials reflect our commitment to evaluate lenacapavir across diverse populations that could benefit. These studies are also intended to drive greater awareness amongst physicians and patients, including geographies where prevention options have not been effective historically. In addition to HIV prevention, we are of course intensely focused on next generation HIV treatment options, and slide 18 highlights our comprehensive HIV treatment pipeline. Our recent updates at the AIDS Society meeting included: Longer-term Phase 2 data from our once-daily oral combination of bictegravir and lenacapavir that showed the regimen was highly effective at maintaining viral suppression. These results further support our ongoing Phase 3 studies in people with HIV, including those on complex regimens. We also reported safety and PK data for both GS-4182, an oral pro-drug of lenacapavir designed to provide 2- to 3-times greater oral bioavailability, and GS-1720, our long-acting oral integrase inhibitor. Initiation of the Phase 2 trial evaluating the combination of these agents as a once-weekly oral regimen is expected later this year. Additionally, we are on-track to initiate our Phase 3 ISLEND-1 and ISLEND-2 trials evaluating once-weekly lenacapavir in combination with Merck's islatravir. This regimen is expected to be the first once-weekly oral treatment option. Looking at our longer-duration treatments, we expect to provide Phase 1 updates from our every 3- month injectable programs and to initiate the Phase 1 studies for our potentially every 6-month integrase inhibitors in the second half of the year. Moving to our Liver Disease portfolio, on slide 19, we presented more than 25 abstracts across both viral and inflammatory liver diseases at the EASL Conference in June, highlighting our continued leadership. Importantly, as shown on the right of the slide, new interim results from the open-label Phase 3 ASSURE study of seladelpar for PBC were consistent with the pivotal RESPONSE study that formed the basis of our global regulatory filings. As you know, we expect an FDA regulatory decision shortly, with a decision from European regulators to follow in early 2025. In viral hepatitis, Gilead shared final, Week 144 results of the Phase 3 MYR301 trial at EASL. These data continue to support monotherapy bulevirtide 2mg as a chronic treatment for HDV. Additionally, we presented promising Phase 2b data evaluating bulevirtide 10mg with interferon alfa-2a as a finite regimen. The post-treatment response rates were the highest ever posted in HDV and were simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. We\u2019re encouraged by the data, and continue to be engaged with KOLs and health authorities - including FDA - as we work to bring bulevirtide to patients as quickly as possible. Switching to Oncology, on slide 20, we\u2019re pleased with the progress across our mid-to-late stage programs. In the front-line setting we shared mature Cohort A data at ASCO from our Phase 2 EVOKE-02 trial with Trodelvy plus pembro, demonstrating a median progression-free survival of 13.1 months. These data exceeded the historical performance of PD-1 monotherapy in first-line PD-L1 high non-small cell lung cancer and support our ongoing Phase 3 EVOKE-03 trial where enrollment is going well. In an all-comer non-small cell lung cancer population, our Phase 3 STAR-121 study evaluating dom plus zim is ongoing. Our Phase 3 STAR-221 study in upper GI cancers evaluating dom with zim and chemo has completed enrollment. The updated Phase 2 EDGE-Gastric data presented at ASCO supported the use of this combination. If successful, dom plus zim and chemo would be the first TIGIT-based regimen for upper GI cancer patients. In addition, we have several Phase 3 programs underway in earlier settings of breast cancer, including ASCENT-03 evaluating Trodelvy in PD-L1 negative metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Turning to our second-line programs, we have discussed the results of EVOKE-01 in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with regulators, and as expected, have confirmed there is no immediate regulatory path based on EVOKE-01 alone. We are currently assessing next steps for Trodelvy in this setting. We will also provide updates on our bladder cancer program, including the full trial results at a future scientific conference, after discussions with FDA and KOLs. Moving to slide 21, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, we shared updates for Yescarta and Tecartus at both ASCO and the European Hematology Association meeting. At ASCO we shared encouraging new efficacy data from a pilot study of Yescarta in 18 patients with relapsed or refractory primary or secondary central nervous system lymphoma in collaboration with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Yescarta demonstrated greater than 26 months median overall survival with no reported treatment-limiting toxicities and no apparent additional risk of adverse events in these patients with high unmet need. Based on these results, we are engaging with regulators to expand the use of Yescarta to include these patients. Additionally, we reported that treatment with Tecartus resulted in a 40% 4-year overall survival rate and median overall survival of almost 26 months in the pivotal ZUMA-3 trial in relapsed or refractory adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. At EHA, we shared preliminary analysis from the Phase 2 ZUMA-24 trial further supporting outpatient use of Yescarta in relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma with the use of prophylactic steroids and other early intervention strategies, real-world manufacturing experience of Yescarta for second- and third-line large B-cell lymphoma, reinforces our strong manufacturing success rate of 96%. Further, on slide 22, I will highlight our promising clinical development program for anito-cel, a potential best-in-class BCMA CAR T that we are developing in partnership with Arcellx. Notably, we shared our study design for our Phase 3 iMMagine-3 trial that will include a broader set of earlier-line, relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients. We expect to have first patient in for this trial in the second half of this year. We are pleased to note that the tech transfer and transfer of the U.S. IND of anito-cel to Kite are now complete. The Kite manufactured product will be used in the iMMagine-3 trial, and we anticipate the turnaround time for anito-cel to be on par with Kite\u2019s commercially available products. Wrapping up with our key 2024 milestones on slide 23, we completed all of our first half milestones, and are pleased with our program execution overall. We\u2019re off to a good start for the second half with the readout of PURPOSE 1 occurring ahead of our committed timeline. We look forward to the FDA decision next week for seladelpar in PBC, as well as an update from the pivotal Phase 2 iMMagine-1 trial in later-line relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, in addition to an update on the pivotal Phase 3 ASCENT-03 study in first-line PD-L1 negative metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Along with these updates, we have a maturing inflammation pipeline that includes several Phase 2 programs, such as a once-daily oral alpha-4-beta-7 integrin inhibitor and an oral TPL2 inhibitor for inflammatory bowel disease. And now, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Andy.\nAndrew Dickinson : Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on slide 25, the team delivered an excellent quarter, with our base business up 6% year-over-year to $6.7 billion. Product sales growth across HIV, Liver Disease and Oncology more than offset the expected decline in Veklury, with total product sales up 5% year-over-year. Moving to our non-GAAP results on slide 26. Product gross margin was 86%, down 84 basis points from last year. R&D expenses were down 3% year-over-year, primarily due to the wind-down of certain magrolimab, obeldesivir and Trodelvy studies following recent data and regulatory updates. Sequentially, R&D was down 5%, primarily due to the timing of clinical and manufacturing activities, partially offset by the initiation of new studies. These savings reflect disciplined management of R&D resources towards the most meaningful opportunities. Acquired IPR&D was $38 million, reflecting new and ongoing collaboration payments in the second quarter. SG&A was down 27% year-over-year, primarily due to the $525 million legal settlement in 2023 that did not repeat in 2024. Excluding this payment, SG&A was up 2% year-over-year, and includes commercial investments ahead of the launch of seladelpar. Operating margin for the second quarter was 47%, our strongest operating margin since the third quarter of 2022, highlighting the leverage we have in our business model. Turning to tax, our effective tax rate was approximately 18%, reflecting settlement with a tax authority in the second quarter. On a reported basis, our non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 50% year-over-year from $1.34 to $2.01 per share. As mentioned earlier, we had a $525 million legal settlement, representing $0.32 per share, in the second quarter of 2023 that did not repeat in the second quarter of 2024. Excluding this settlement, EPS grew 21% year-over-year, reflecting higher product sales and lower expenses including acquired IPR&D expenses. As highlighted on Slide 27, we had a strong first half of the year, with solid performance in each of our core franchises across Virology and Oncology, driving base business growth of 6% year-over-year, which is at the upper-end of our full-year guidance of 4% to 6%. Switching to our expectations for 2024 on Slide 28, we continue to expect total product sales in the range of $27.1 billion to $27.5 billion, and total product sales, excluding Veklury, in the range of $25.8 billion to $26.2 billion. Given the inherent variability experienced historically, and as stated previously - we are not updating our Veklury guidance at this time. As we think about the second half of the year, here are some of the factors that we are continuing to monitor. First, we continue to expect the normal, quarter-to-quarter variability in our HIV business that we have always experienced relative to average realized price associated with channel mix. Second, we expect quarterly variability in cell therapy due to continued in-class and out-of-class competition. Third, there is some uncertainty associated with Trodelvy bladder revenue following TROPiCS-04. As a reminder, bladder represents less than 10% of total Trodelvy sales today; and finally, there is a possibility of incremental FX headwinds in the second half of the year. For the rest of 2024, we continue to expect to deliver strong volume growth across all therapeutic areas, and assuming approval seladelpar as an incremental contributor to revenue growth. Continued HIV volume and revenue growth, consistent with our full year expectation to grow HIV product sales by approximately 4%; and continued focus on disciplined operating expense management. Moving to the non-GAAP guidance, there is no change to our non-GAAP gross margin range of 85% to 86%. For R&D, we now expect total R&D expense to increase by a low to mid-single-digit percentage compared to 2023, reflecting lower than previously expected R&D expenses in 2024, despite absorbing the late-stage seladelpar program. For SG&A, there is no change to our prior guidance pointing to a mid-single digit decline compared to 2023. Consistent with our expectations last quarter, we have been able to absorb the incremental expenses associated with the CymaBay transaction. For acquired IPR&D, we now expect full-year expenses of $4.7 billion, up from $4.4 billion last quarter to reflect a $320 million transaction with Janssen to buy out the global seladelpar royalty. This expense will be included in our third quarter results. Finally, with the strong operational expense control demonstrated in both the first and second quarters, and despite this new $320 million acquired IPR&D expense, we are increasing our operating income guidance to $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion, and increasing our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $3.60 to $3.90. Slide 29 highlights that the increase to our EPS guidance fully absorbs the $320 million, or approximately $0.20 per share, expense associated with the buyout of the seladelpar royalty from Janssen. This transaction removes Gilead\u2019s royalty obligation to pay 8% of seladelpar sales. Excluding this transaction, our EPS guidance increase would have been even more significant today, up $0.30 or 8% at the midpoint, again highlighting the financial discipline that has translated into operating leverage. Moving to slide 30, we continue to have sufficient flexibility in our balance sheet to execute on our capital allocation priorities. In the second quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders, repaid $1.75 billion of senior notes, and paid $1.2 billion as part of the federal transition tax associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The remaining transition tax payment of $1.3 billion is scheduled for April of 2025. Overall, we believe that Gilead is well-positioned for near and long-term growth and we continue to be focused on commercial execution, expense management discipline, and to delivering on our strategic commitments. And now, I\u2019ll invite Rebecca to begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] [Audio Gap] Please go ahead your line is open.\nEvan Seigerman : Hi there, this is Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. I wanted to touch on TIGIT. There's been a lot of updates in the TIGIT space in ASCO. We had the Roche update and most recently Merck discontinued their KeyVibe study in small cell lung cancer. So Merdad, you could walk us through how you think about the opportunity for TIGIT? And what looks good, what good would look like for you in terms of safety and efficacy with the STAR-121 program? Thank you so much.\nMerdad Parsey : Thanks, Evan for the question. Yeah, I think as you know as you noted, there have been a lot of updates on TIGIT over the past six months or so. And I think that gets to our approach which I think is somewhat differentiated from our competition in that. As we've said along, we have a differentiated molecule first off and that is that we have an Fc-silent molecule relative to an Fch-active molecule that the competition has. And I would note that that is demonstrating a difference in terms of the adverse event profile including the data that we've highlighted today. Additionally, I think we've tried to stay focused in areas where we believe that there is the best chance of activity and so for example, we have not initiated any trials with small cell. We look forward to. Capitalizing on the data, we have seen so far both and non-small cell lung cancer and gastric cancer. As you know, we provided an update on the EDGE-gastric study ASCO. And as I noted in the call we have completed enrollment of that of the Phase 3 trial of that. So we've - we continue to be cautiously optimistic about TIGIT and are doing it in a data-driven way based on the data we've generated in our trials so far.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn at Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, your line is open.\nTerence Flynn : Great. Thanks for taking that question. A two part for me. Just Merdad, wondering if you can help frame expectations for the Purpose 2 trial, just given this is a slightly different population relative to Purpose 1. So just as we think about level setting their ahead of that data. And then, the second part is for Johanna, so obviously, you guys noted that you've seen growth in the PrEP market recently, which is encouraging. But what other steps can you as a company take to maybe help alleviate some of the payer roadblocks that are really still in the way of branded PrEP use given the still high level of generic truvada use? Thank you.\nMerdad Parsey: Thanks, Terrence. I'll start and then I'll hand it off the Johanna as you said. It's a great question and a good thing for us to make sure that everyone remembers. Our Purpose 1 was the trial that was in cisgender women and as I noted Purpose 2 is our ongoing study in the cisgender gay men transgender women and men and gender non-binary people. Now that study is ongoing. It is the second trial that's necessary for filing and like Purpose 1, Purpose 2 is designed to evaluate the superiority of lenacapavir against the background HIV rate. That\u2019s the primary endpoint and the secondary endpoint would be similar to Purpose 1 will be superior to truvada as a secondary endpoint. So, once we \u2013 if hopefully we\u2019d demonstrate a positive results in Purpose 2, we will combine this data with Purpose 1 and move as quickly as possible to filing those data to lenacapavir for PrEP.\nJohanna Mercier: So maybe just to complete the second part of that question around the growth in PrEP and like the opportunities lies ahead despite some of the payer roadblocks that you are referring to just a couple of points on that, one is, today the market for PrEP is growing at about 12% or so year-on-year, so nice consistent growth that we have seen over the last couple of years. Descovy coverage is over 90% of all lives are covered from an access standpoint. So today the daily orals do not have any concerns from an access standpoint. I think maybe what you're referring to is potentially as we think about medical benefits versus the pharmacy benefits that might create a little bit more access headwinds from a payer standpoint and we've seen that already with some of our competitors. As we think about lenacapavir, in light of not only the data, just most recently with Purpose 1, but also just the profile that it offers with a twice yearly sub cu I think it really allows us to redefine the PrEP market as a whole. And as much as we're seeing today maybe over 400,000 users in the US. We really see three major growth opportunities. One is around market size growth, the other one's around market share growth and the third one is on endurance. So if I just break those down a little bit, the market size growth is around reaching more users. So we'll beyond just white MSMS thinking about cisgender women, transgender men and women Latino black individuals, as well as young adults, reaching more prescribers in different settings than we are today and over time reaching more countries, right? Because right now PrEP revenues are really coming primarily out of the United States. From a market share growth standpoint Descovy is the number one branded daily oral today with over 40% share. And we believe lenacapavir will be number one from a long-acting standpoint and between the two together, we believe the Gilead presence in HIV prevention will also be leading and greater than where we are today. And then last but not least, it\u2019s hired adherent and not just has to do with a domestic - the frequency of administration when you think about a twice the early subcu has much adherence than a daily oral and obviously, better outcomes. So all of those pieces together is what we are focused on as an opportunity for the future of prevention and with not only Descovy but obviously with lenacapavir around the corner potentially. And from an access standpoint we are thinking ahead as we think about even the work that CMS is doing when they think about making it our Part B drug, for a medical benefit in PrEP to ensure greater access, but we're also thinking through how is this going to impact from both from a prescriber standpoint and how do we support that reimbursement, challenges that I think others have been facing and how we basically do a very high touch approach here to make sure everyone who needs or wants PrEP gets access to their drug of choice.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from [Inaudible] Leerink Partners. Go ahead, your line is open.\nDaina Graybosch : Hi, thanks for the question. I want to ask on Anito-cel, a two-part. One is just the process fact. So I wonder if you can confirm whether you have completed enrollment in Imagine 1 and that\u2019s what kind of follow-up time we can expect from the data should it be accepted at ASH? And then a deeper question on Imagine 3. I wonder what your approach is in Imagine 3 to bridging therapy so as to avoid the higher risk of death that was observed in the competitor trials soon after enrollment? Thank you. Thanks, Daina, so we've got Cindy Perettie here. We'll turn it up and heard answer that thank you for the question.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks Daina. We sort of got Cindy Perettie here. We\u2019ll turn over to her to answer that. Thanks for your question.\nCindy Perettie: Thanks, Daina, we continue to be really excited about the potential with Anito-cel with a best-in-class profile and our enrollment target for Imagine 1 has been met. I think the second question you asked is what type of follow-up would we expect to see at ASH, and I think we're in the process of we did an initial cut obviously for the abstracts we'll do the second cut for the final sharing of the data. So I don't have the exact follow-up time. But we can certainly look to follow-up with you once we have that. Your second question was around Imagine 3 and bridging therapy. Right now, we will be moving - so we were able to complete the tech transfer as you heard from Dan into our Maryland production facility. So we will be supplying therapy out of our Maryland facility and we expect to apply a lot of the learnings that we have with our existing products on the market today and be able to get Anito-cell back to those patients in Imagine 3 as it relates to having time upfront to do bridging therapy. However, with the protocol design today, we do have the option to do bridging therapy if necessary for patients.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Umer Raffat of Evercore. Go ahead, your line is open.\nUmer Raffat: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'm very intrigued about your lenacapavir plus bictegravir trial heading into Phase 3. And I'm just trying to understand could this regimen possibly replace Biktarvy to a meaningful extent? Or would you rather have some sort of a low-dose nuke in that combination as well as a second alternative? I'm just thinking back to some of the [Indiscernible] experience, as well.\nJohanna Mercier: So maybe I'll take that one Umer. So the len-bic combination is a single treatment regimen that really combined a best-in-class integrates inhibitor with the first-in-class capsid. The studies that we are doing both Phase2 and 3 are really first, that we looked at the complex regimen which that was kind of the first step and as we go into Phase 3, we believe we can get a broader label indication to also include all of our allergically suppressed. So as we think about that opportunity, we think it's an opportunity for an FTI that's optimized, simplified for complex regimens but also provides optionality in the viral decree to press the switch segment of the marketplace, So as we think about it as a portfolio perspective, we still believe that today Biktarvy is the standard of care and will remain as the standard of care from a daily oral standpoint. But we also see that's an opportunity in the switch segment. So na\u00efve is a big piece probably the biggest piece for Biktarvy\u2019s growth. And the switch because we have such a large share obviously, right? So from a switch segment that offers us another opportunity for us to play bigger market space in HIV.\nOperator: Our next question is from Carter Gould at Barclays. Go ahead Carter. Your line is open.\nCarter Gould: Great, thank you. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe another one on Purpose 1. So again, the efficacy was very impressive. However we could see that north of 20% of patients that have nodules out to week 52. And I guess for Johanna, as you think about that profile in this setting recognizing they were only grade one, but sort of the long-term nature of those nodules, how do you see that influencing or impacting the profile, its demand and the potential for those patients then go back and you get retreated after six months? Thank you.\nJohanna Mercier : Sure and Carter, just to explain a little bit, the nodules are because it's a drug depot, right? So the nodule actually gets smaller over time. What we've seen is actually very little discontinuation in Purpose 1 due to that. That's number one. Two is the nodules are sometimes palpable not all? But sometimes palpable but not visible and generally speaking. And so we believe that actually we will have some. flexibility as well as to where those injections play out and where because I think, they've been studied in different places not just in the stomach in the site. And so, I think that'll be an opportunity as well for people to be a little bit more flexible as to where they get their injections. So we're not overly concerned there at all. Actually, and really we're taking it from the data that we're getting from Purpose 1 and hopefully, we'll have similar data to learn from Purpose 2.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Yee at Jefferies. Mike, go ahead your line is open.\nMichael Yee : Thank you, guys. We have one question on long-acting HIV, specifically. The potential for a Q6 month which I think could be a game changer. I think you have one or two of them on your slide and they are advancing. Can you tell me your confidence level on what you have there? Because if you follow HIV development you know that if it's generally safe and of all taller than significant barrel over reduction. You're in a pretty good spot in Phase 1, 2. Thank you. Let me know.\nMerdad Parsey: Hi, Michael, it\u2019s Merdad. Thanks, yeah. I think you raise the right question, which is that whenever we're looking at the long-acting, new long-acting agents, we have to be cautious about the transition from preclinical to clinical. We don't - we're not always able to predict the injection site reactions that you might get from the long-actings in particular. We were just talking about the nodules for lenacapavir but other more severe injection site reactions and then the human pharmacokinetics. So, I think we need those to play out to allow us to move forward and that's why you see multiple agents going into Phase 1. We have generated the number of molecules. We move them forward. We've been pretty aggressive in moving them forward in order to maintain our leadership in long-acting HIV treatment and prophylaxis. And so, once we start to see those data in Phase 1, I think that will help us decide both choosing between those molecules and where we want to go forward. Remember we're also moving our bNAb program forward, which will be our - which is our most advanced long-acting program with lenacapavir plus bNAbs and we should - we expect to get Phase 2 data from that that study, as well. So for those early programs, it's the usual risks and that which is why we take multiple shots and hopefully we'll be able to advance one of them quickly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams at RBC Capital Markets. Brian, go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrian Abrahams: Hi, there. Thanks so much for taking my question. You guys have an oral GLP-1 GS 4751 in your preclinical pipeline. Are you planning to move it forward? And as you've continue to diversify that portfolio, how are you guys thinking about the obesity landscape and potentially participating? Or are there other metabolic areas in adjacencies that you may be more interested in pursuing? Thanks.\nMerdad Parsey: Thanks, Brian. Yes, we have shared some preclinical data on 4571. As you know, it is an internally developed oral GLP1 agonist which came out of our initial interest in our NASH program. And based on the data so far both preclinical and the toxicity we are planning a Phase 1 study for that molecule and that'll help us evaluate 4571 for weight management, obesity and other metabolic diseases. Once we generate those data, we will decide in a data-driven way, how best to proceed from there. And we'll just have to see how that plays out. We want to make sure if we dealt something as best-in-class and allows for a best-in-class profile. So we will update more as the data are generated.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott at JPMorgan. Chris, go ahead, your line is open.\nChris Schott : Great. Thanks, so much. My questions or just my other question was just on the US CAR-T franchise. Just want to get your latest view on how we should be thinking about sequential growth from here and maybe as part of that can we just get an update on kind of your community physician engagement with the CAR-T is any leading indicators that you're seeing there that'll help could move the guide some of the efforts or when we could start seeing the impact from some of these efforts in the US? Thank you.\nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Chris. We are really pleased with our strong cell therapy growth this quarter. And this is really part and parcel to our US refresh strategy. So as a reminder we restructured our sales team at the end of last year and we got our new sales team in place and trained and ready to go. And as part of that strategy we also focused for the next couple of quarters on really within the authorized treatment centers making sure those referrals occur between the lymphoma specialist to the CAR-T specialist. And that's what you're seeing as part of the excellent performance that we had this quarter. And we'll continue to deliver and really focus on the referrals within the AGC. We are also in parallel building up that those community practices and spending time educating both the community practices, I'd say regional hospitals and those institutions about the curative potential of CAR-T and why it's important to bring this into the therapy that they're offering to their patients. And we're making really good progress there including a lot of work with national payers. But despite all this, as you heard earlier from both Dan and Johanna, we are facing, it's a dynamic market. We're remaining cautious for the second half of this year as we continue to see some competitive headwinds both in cost competition. So we have new indications that came out in late May, early June time frame which are capturing physician mind share initially and we're also seeing out of cost competition with the bispecifics. But with all of that said, we are focused on execution and working with our physicians and institutions to raise awareness of the curative potential for CAR-T and will continue to do so in the second half of this year. As it relates to community practices, I shared last quarter that it's taking us a little bit longer than we had expected to get them up and fully operating. But we're making great progress as it relates to that and learning a lot along the way. So we're continuing to refine our blueprint as we onboard new centers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Seedhouse at Raymond James. Steve, go ahead. Your line is open.\nSteven Seedhouse: Yes, thank you very much. Just given some of the newer tailwinds out of oncology, so lenacapavir obviously which you indicated could redefine the PrEP market and then seladelpar, of course as well. When you just combine that with the updated view of oncology pipeline, are you still expecting the 2030 revenue mix to be about a third of oncology? Or is that more of a moving target? So when you could comment on the long-term outlook. Thank you.\nMerdad Parsey: Yeah, thanks Steven for the question. So one-third of sales remains our target with the portfolio that we have today and what we believe is achievable without additional BD. I'll just remind you - keep in mind that the indications in that target are probability adjusted and many of them around 50% So, you'd expect to see puts and takes in that pipeline evolution. We certainly expected that when we when we set that target. So it allows for some programs to fail or fall short of initial expectations and others obviously succeed to support achieving that goal. I would just note that our oncology sales today are already more than a third of the way there. In quarter two 2024, they're about 12% of the total product sales growing nicely. So it's highlighting the progress we're making on this on this overall goal. I think you're right to point out also the progress and as you put at the tailwinds with a virology business and lenacapavir data as well as seladelpar, obviously, as that grows that that puts even more stretch to our ambition. It's a good problem to have. But I think the ambition we have is very much along the lines of diversifying our business as well as solidifying our base in virology and we're firmly committed to that strategy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Anderson at Wolf Research. Tim, go ahead. Your line is open.\nTim Anderson: Thank you. I have a question on the tro toothpaste, so sometime before or around your end will get your phase 3 first line triple negative readout with trodelvy from the ASCENT-03 trial and we'll also be getting Astra's TROPION-Breast02 and the design of those trials are quite similar, which will allow try for the best side-by-side comparisons thus far of your drug versus Astra\u2019s. And I'm sure you thought about this a lot. What's your prediction for how those results will likely stack up against each other? I'm guessing you'll show less ILD as one benefit, but how do you think efficacy and other safety metrics will compare?\nMerdad Parsey: Sure, this is Merdad. Maybe, like I think you hit the highlights. We are \u2013 trodelvy has demonstrated great efficacy in the triple negative breast cancer space and we remain I think the only approved Trop-2 ADC and that space in triple negative is definitely where trodelvy is doing very well and has become the standard care for most physicians. So, I think that sets us up nicely and ASCENT-03 as we update the status of that trial as the end of the year rolls around I think will be part of the continuation of that story and our expectation for trodelvy\u2019s success in triple negative breast cancer. We have felt that there are areas where our programs aren't differentiated and for Trodelvy as you mentioned our adverse event profile has remained largely predictable and very manageable on the part of physicians we certainly both the ILD you mentioned as well as stomatitis has been very different in their manifestations and mostly for trodelvy it's been neutropenia and diarrhea, which I think clinicians have gotten very comfortable with managing certainly when we speak to our KOLs. So we'll be looking for those data and we'll look for our data and in particular and I think is a continuation of where we think trodelvy can go and really solidify our position in triple negative breast.\nJohanna Mercier : Yeah, I would just re-emphasize what Merdad said, I think just the fact we are the ones on the market today and so well established as the number one standard of care and triple negative breast cancer second line. I do think that that is a big differentiator here as we think about some of these data points.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Salveen Richter at Goldman Sachs. Salveen, go ahead. Your line is open.\nSalveen Richter : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. With regard to the long-acting program, could you speak more about potential read through from Purpose 1 to Purpose 2 and whether they're typically any differences in responses to HIV drugs in these different patient populations? And regarding the strategy to expand the PrEP market, could you speak to specific strategies here? And why you haven't been able to reach these patients already? Thank you.\nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Salveen it\u2019s kind of a two-part. So I'll have Merdad start and maybe have Johanna add, as well.\nMerdad Parsey: Yeah, Salveen, you're absolutely right that the patient populations are different is why we did the broad Purpose program to really get a diversity of patients early in our program to ensure that we can bring PrEP to a variety of populations early on in our in our development. And the patient populations are different we're talking really cisgender women relative to the Purpose 2 population, which is a different population. And our expectation is that those populations have different levels of awareness, different levels of compliance and there are use of PrEP otherwise for example with the oral PrEP agents. And despite that, I think the strength of the Purpose 1 data and the fact that you have people who are essentially protected for six months with no infections occurring in the cisgender women so far I think give us a lot of confidence that with I would expect some variability in the background infection rate in the population. If we are able to maintain that degree of protection in Purpose 2 we remain really confident that the outcome will be very powerful.\nJohanna Mercier: And maybe to pick up on the second part of that, Salveen. So just to take a step back, I think it\u2019s important to understand how much we have moved the needle actually when you think about the penetration in the prevention market. Just a couple of years ago, you were about 25% penetrating when you if you consider it from a CDC standpoint estimate, we're now over a third of that. So we have really grown this market and expanded it. I think one of the challenges has definitely been this is not a typical market that you it's not HIV treatment. It is a market where these are individuals that are not sick. They have no asymptomatic, obviously they have nothing and so therefore it's very challenging when you think about a daily oral pill, which is today over 95% of the total market where you think about current generics or Descovy share. And taking a pill every single day is incredibly challenging. So many use PrEP on demand. And I do think and in that the biggest population that we see are actually wide MSMs so very much a high commercial market here. And we believe that there is a real opportunity to whip something that has the profile of lenacapavir with a twice yearly subcu that we can truly expand the reach of the people, the individuals that could truly benefit from prevention for the future. And so, so that's kind of the steps. So I think it's an ongoing growth that we've been seeing. I think we have to do a step change here as we think about the future of prevention. I think we have to think completely differently about what lenacapavir could offer all of these people and really make a dent in this HIV epidemic.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Olivia Brayer at Cantor Fitzgerald. Olivia, go ahead. Your line is open. Our next question comes from James Shin at Deutsche Bank. James, go ahead. Your line is open.\nJames Shin : Hey guys, thanks for the question. For PrEP, is the move to PARPI a net positive to access and when Len is eventually proved for PrEP. Do you expect the markets remain mostly by and bill? Thank you.\nJohanna Mercier: Sure. I\u2019ll take that one. So the move the entity for PrEPs that CMS is working on, I do think it's positive. I think it's really around providing greater access and potentially providing also the services that go with it. So the D2B could actually be a nice move despite the fact that today Medicare is a very small piece of the total prevention market. As we think about lenacapavir, I think it'll be both. I think there's probably opportunities for it to be both a pharmacy benefit as well as a medical benefit and be a buy and bill and I think we just need to think very differently because buy and bill in the current users of prevention this is not something that they're familiar with. And so this is something we're really thinking about today for tomorrow is to setting up that system to make sure they understand how to do this, if they want to do it, but that they have an option if they don't want to do it. And I think that's what we're kind of planning for us as we think about the future of lenacapavir.\nOperator: That concludes the time we have for questions. I\u2019ll invite Dan to share any closing remarks.\nDaniel O'Day: Thank you, everybody. In closing, we the team here would like to summarize the quarter as follows: we had a very strong quarter of revenue growth and impressive bottom-line growth that highlights the leverage in our model. Secondly, we made progress that should enable us to build on that growth in the future including really remarkable data from the Purpose 1 one trial and from across the HIV portfolio with the promise to extend our HIV leadership well into the late 2030s and beyond; the imminent launch of seladelpar in the US and continued progress in oncology; and all this leaves us well positioned for the second half of 2024 when we will continue to focus on quarter after quarter of strong clinical commercial and financial execution. My thanks to the Gilead teams and to all of you for joining today. I want to hand it over to Jacquie Ross for some final comments.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you, Dan and thank you all for joining us today. One final housekeeping item. I can share that we are tentatively planning to release our third quarter 2024 earnings results on Thursday, November 7th? Please note that this date is provisional and could be changed to accommodate scheduling conflicts that arise between now and then. As always, we will announce our confirmed date following the close of the third quarter. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and look forward on updating you on our progress throughout the quarter.",

            "name": "Merdad Parsey",
            "content": "Thank you, Johanna. We were very pleased to wrap up the second quarter with two New England Journal of Medicine publications and a number of important readouts across our portfolio. Most exciting was the readout of our Phase 3 PURPOSE 1 trial evaluating twice-yearly, subcutaneous lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV infection in cisgender women. As you can see on slide 17, this was the first Phase 3 HIV prevention trial to ever achieve 100% efficacy. We have since shared data at the International AIDS Society meeting in July, where our presentation was the highlight of the plenary session. The data were simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Our second registrational trial for lenacapavir, PURPOSE 2, has enrolled approximately 3,300 men, transwomen, and non-binary people who have sex with men. This trial completed enrollment globally in December 2023, approximately four months after PURPOSE 1. As a result, we expect to provide an update in late 2024 or early 2025. Assuming positive data from PURPOSE 2, we plan to file based on data from both trials, with the goal of bringing transformative HIV prevention to people at risk of HIV as early as late 2025. Beyond our registrational trials, we are generating Phase 2 data from the PURPOSE 3, 4, and 5 trials in key populations across the U.S., UK, and France, including people who inject drugs. These trials reflect our commitment to evaluate lenacapavir across diverse populations that could benefit. These studies are also intended to drive greater awareness amongst physicians and patients, including geographies where prevention options have not been effective historically. In addition to HIV prevention, we are of course intensely focused on next generation HIV treatment options, and slide 18 highlights our comprehensive HIV treatment pipeline. Our recent updates at the AIDS Society meeting included: Longer-term Phase 2 data from our once-daily oral combination of bictegravir and lenacapavir that showed the regimen was highly effective at maintaining viral suppression. These results further support our ongoing Phase 3 studies in people with HIV, including those on complex regimens. We also reported safety and PK data for both GS-4182, an oral pro-drug of lenacapavir designed to provide 2- to 3-times greater oral bioavailability, and GS-1720, our long-acting oral integrase inhibitor. Initiation of the Phase 2 trial evaluating the combination of these agents as a once-weekly oral regimen is expected later this year. Additionally, we are on-track to initiate our Phase 3 ISLEND-1 and ISLEND-2 trials evaluating once-weekly lenacapavir in combination with Merck's islatravir. This regimen is expected to be the first once-weekly oral treatment option. Looking at our longer-duration treatments, we expect to provide Phase 1 updates from our every 3- month injectable programs and to initiate the Phase 1 studies for our potentially every 6-month integrase inhibitors in the second half of the year. Moving to our Liver Disease portfolio, on slide 19, we presented more than 25 abstracts across both viral and inflammatory liver diseases at the EASL Conference in June, highlighting our continued leadership. Importantly, as shown on the right of the slide, new interim results from the open-label Phase 3 ASSURE study of seladelpar for PBC were consistent with the pivotal RESPONSE study that formed the basis of our global regulatory filings. As you know, we expect an FDA regulatory decision shortly, with a decision from European regulators to follow in early 2025. In viral hepatitis, Gilead shared final, Week 144 results of the Phase 3 MYR301 trial at EASL. These data continue to support monotherapy bulevirtide 2mg as a chronic treatment for HDV. Additionally, we presented promising Phase 2b data evaluating bulevirtide 10mg with interferon alfa-2a as a finite regimen. The post-treatment response rates were the highest ever posted in HDV and were simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. We're encouraged by the data, and continue to be engaged with KOLs and health authorities - including FDA - as we work to bring bulevirtide to patients as quickly as possible. Switching to Oncology, on slide 20, we're pleased with the progress across our mid-to-late stage programs. In the front-line setting we shared mature Cohort A data at ASCO from our Phase 2 EVOKE-02 trial with Trodelvy plus pembro, demonstrating a median progression-free survival of 13.1 months. These data exceeded the historical performance of PD-1 monotherapy in first-line PD-L1 high non-small cell lung cancer and support our ongoing Phase 3 EVOKE-03 trial where enrollment is going well. In an all-comer non-small cell lung cancer population, our Phase 3 STAR-121 study evaluating dom plus zim is ongoing. Our Phase 3 STAR-221 study in upper GI cancers evaluating dom with zim and chemo has completed enrollment. The updated Phase 2 EDGE-Gastric data presented at ASCO supported the use of this combination. If successful, dom plus zim and chemo would be the first TIGIT-based regimen for upper GI cancer patients. In addition, we have several Phase 3 programs underway in earlier settings of breast cancer, including ASCENT-03 evaluating Trodelvy in PD-L1 negative metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Turning to our second-line programs, we have discussed the results of EVOKE-01 in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with regulators, and as expected, have confirmed there is no immediate regulatory path based on EVOKE-01 alone. We are currently assessing next steps for Trodelvy in this setting. We will also provide updates on our bladder cancer program, including the full trial results at a future scientific conference, after discussions with FDA and KOLs. Moving to slide 21, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, we shared updates for Yescarta and Tecartus at both ASCO and the European Hematology Association meeting. At ASCO we shared encouraging new efficacy data from a pilot study of Yescarta in 18 patients with relapsed or refractory primary or secondary central nervous system lymphoma in collaboration with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Yescarta demonstrated greater than 26 months median overall survival with no reported treatment-limiting toxicities and no apparent additional risk of adverse events in these patients with high unmet need. Based on these results, we are engaging with regulators to expand the use of Yescarta to include these patients. Additionally, we reported that treatment with Tecartus resulted in a 40% 4-year overall survival rate and median overall survival of almost 26 months in the pivotal ZUMA-3 trial in relapsed or refractory adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. At EHA, we shared preliminary analysis from the Phase 2 ZUMA-24 trial further supporting outpatient use of Yescarta in relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma with the use of prophylactic steroids and other early intervention strategies, real-world manufacturing experience of Yescarta for second- and third-line large B-cell lymphoma, reinforces our strong manufacturing success rate of 96%. Further, on slide 22, I will highlight our promising clinical development program for anito-cel, a potential best-in-class BCMA CAR T that we are developing in partnership with Arcellx. Notably, we shared our study design for our Phase 3 iMMagine-3 trial that will include a broader set of earlier-line, relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients. We expect to have first patient in for this trial in the second half of this year. We are pleased to note that the tech transfer and transfer of the U.S. IND of anito-cel to Kite are now complete. The Kite manufactured product will be used in the iMMagine-3 trial, and we anticipate the turnaround time for anito-cel to be on par with Kite's commercially available products. Wrapping up with our key 2024 milestones on slide 23, we completed all of our first half milestones, and are pleased with our program execution overall. We're off to a good start for the second half with the readout of PURPOSE 1 occurring ahead of our committed timeline. We look forward to the FDA decision next week for seladelpar in PBC, as well as an update from the pivotal Phase 2 iMMagine-1 trial in later-line relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, in addition to an update on the pivotal Phase 3 ASCENT-03 study in first-line PD-L1 negative metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Along with these updates, we have a maturing inflammation pipeline that includes several Phase 2 programs, such as a once-daily oral alpha-4-beta-7 integrin inhibitor and an oral TPL2 inhibitor for inflammatory bowel disease. And now, I'll hand the call over to Andy. Thanks, Evan for the question. Yeah, I think as you know as you noted, there have been a lot of updates on TIGIT over the past six months or so. And I think that gets to our approach which I think is somewhat differentiated from our competition in that. As we've said along, we have a differentiated molecule first off and that is that we have an Fc-silent molecule relative to an Fch-active molecule that the competition has. And I would note that that is demonstrating a difference in terms of the adverse event profile including the data that we've highlighted today. Additionally, I think we've tried to stay focused in areas where we believe that there is the best chance of activity and so for example, we have not initiated any trials with small cell. We look forward to. Capitalizing on the data, we have seen so far both and non-small cell lung cancer and gastric cancer. As you know, we provided an update on the EDGE-gastric study ASCO. And as I noted in the call we have completed enrollment of that of the Phase 3 trial of that. So we've - we continue to be cautiously optimistic about TIGIT and are doing it in a data-driven way based on the data we've generated in our trials so far. Thanks, Terrence. I'll start and then I'll hand it off the Johanna as you said. It's a great question and a good thing for us to make sure that everyone remembers. Our Purpose 1 was the trial that was in cisgender women and as I noted Purpose 2 is our ongoing study in the cisgender gay men transgender women and men and gender non-binary people. Now that study is ongoing. It is the second trial that's necessary for filing and like Purpose 1, Purpose 2 is designed to evaluate the superiority of lenacapavir against the background HIV rate. That's the primary endpoint and the secondary endpoint would be similar to Purpose 1 will be superior to truvada as a secondary endpoint. So, once we \u2013 if hopefully we'd demonstrate a positive results in Purpose 2, we will combine this data with Purpose 1 and move as quickly as possible to filing those data to lenacapavir for PrEP. Hi, Michael, it's Merdad. Thanks, yeah. I think you raise the right question, which is that whenever we're looking at the long-acting, new long-acting agents, we have to be cautious about the transition from preclinical to clinical. We don't - we're not always able to predict the injection site reactions that you might get from the long-actings in particular. We were just talking about the nodules for lenacapavir but other more severe injection site reactions and then the human pharmacokinetics. So, I think we need those to play out to allow us to move forward and that's why you see multiple agents going into Phase 1. We have generated the number of molecules. We move them forward. We've been pretty aggressive in moving them forward in order to maintain our leadership in long-acting HIV treatment and prophylaxis. And so, once we start to see those data in Phase 1, I think that will help us decide both choosing between those molecules and where we want to go forward. Remember we're also moving our bNAb program forward, which will be our - which is our most advanced long-acting program with lenacapavir plus bNAbs and we should - we expect to get Phase 2 data from that that study, as well. So for those early programs, it's the usual risks and that which is why we take multiple shots and hopefully we'll be able to advance one of them quickly. Thanks, Brian. Yes, we have shared some preclinical data on 4571. As you know, it is an internally developed oral GLP1 agonist which came out of our initial interest in our NASH program. And based on the data so far both preclinical and the toxicity we are planning a Phase 1 study for that molecule and that'll help us evaluate 4571 for weight management, obesity and other metabolic diseases. Once we generate those data, we will decide in a data-driven way, how best to proceed from there. And we'll just have to see how that plays out. We want to make sure if we dealt something as best-in-class and allows for a best-in-class profile. So we will update more as the data are generated. Yeah, thanks Steven for the question. So one-third of sales remains our target with the portfolio that we have today and what we believe is achievable without additional BD. I'll just remind you - keep in mind that the indications in that target are probability adjusted and many of them around 50% So, you'd expect to see puts and takes in that pipeline evolution. We certainly expected that when we when we set that target. So it allows for some programs to fail or fall short of initial expectations and others obviously succeed to support achieving that goal. I would just note that our oncology sales today are already more than a third of the way there. In quarter two 2024, they're about 12% of the total product sales growing nicely. So it's highlighting the progress we're making on this on this overall goal. I think you're right to point out also the progress and as you put at the tailwinds with a virology business and lenacapavir data as well as seladelpar, obviously, as that grows that that puts even more stretch to our ambition. It's a good problem to have. But I think the ambition we have is very much along the lines of diversifying our business as well as solidifying our base in virology and we're firmly committed to that strategy. Sure, this is Merdad. Maybe, like I think you hit the highlights. We are \u2013 trodelvy has demonstrated great efficacy in the triple negative breast cancer space and we remain I think the only approved Trop-2 ADC and that space in triple negative is definitely where trodelvy is doing very well and has become the standard care for most physicians. So, I think that sets us up nicely and ASCENT-03 as we update the status of that trial as the end of the year rolls around I think will be part of the continuation of that story and our expectation for trodelvy's success in triple negative breast cancer. We have felt that there are areas where our programs aren't differentiated and for Trodelvy as you mentioned our adverse event profile has remained largely predictable and very manageable on the part of physicians we certainly both the ILD you mentioned as well as stomatitis has been very different in their manifestations and mostly for trodelvy it's been neutropenia and diarrhea, which I think clinicians have gotten very comfortable with managing certainly when we speak to our KOLs. So we'll be looking for those data and we'll look for our data and in particular and I think is a continuation of where we think trodelvy can go and really solidify our position in triple negative breast. Yeah, Salveen, you're absolutely right that the patient populations are different is why we did the broad Purpose program to really get a diversity of patients early in our program to ensure that we can bring PrEP to a variety of populations early on in our in our development. And the patient populations are different we're talking really cisgender women relative to the Purpose 2 population, which is a different population. And our expectation is that those populations have different levels of awareness, different levels of compliance and there are use of PrEP otherwise for example with the oral PrEP agents. And despite that, I think the strength of the Purpose 1 data and the fact that you have people who are essentially protected for six months with no infections occurring in the cisgender women so far I think give us a lot of confidence that with I would expect some variability in the background infection rate in the population. If we are able to maintain that degree of protection in Purpose 2 we remain really confident that the outcome will be very powerful."

            "name": "Daniel O'Day",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to share that this was another strong quarter of commercial execution with growth across HIV, Liver Disease, and Oncology. Biktarvy for HIV treatment was up 8% year-over-year, Trodelvy was up 23%, and Cell Therapy was up 11%. In addition, we continued to demonstrate disciplined operating expense management and delivered exceptional bottom-line growth, highlighting the leverage in our business model. Given the results for the first half of the year, we are raising our non-GAAP operating income and EPS guidance for the full year. Moving to clinical updates, this is an important time for our Virology and Inflammation therapeutic areas. A key highlight of the quarter was the readout of our Phase 3 PURPOSE 1 trial evaluating lenacapavir for HIV prevention. The results showed 100% efficacy with zero HIV infections in cisgender women. The presentation of these results at AIDS 2024 in Munich generated considerable excitement, and we're delighted to have reached this milestone with such a positive outcome. Lenacapavir, with its twice-yearly dosing, could set a new bar for HIV prevention and allow PrEP to reach a much broader population of people who could benefit from a prevention regimen. The PURPOSE program, which is expected to include more than 9,000 participants in over 10 countries, is designed to highlight the efficacy of HIV prevention in a wide range of groups, including cisgender women, transgender men and women, Black and Latino individuals, and young adults. We expect an update for PURPOSE 2 late this year or early next year, with a commercial launch as early as late 2025. The PURPOSE data were part of several updates at AIDS 2024 that highlight the strength of Gilead's innovation in HIV, for both prevention and treatment. Our pipeline has the promise to extend our HIV leadership well into the late 2030s and beyond. Updates at AIDS 2024 included data from our daily oral combination of bictegravir and lenacapavir, which is now in pivotal Phase 3 trials for people with HIV, including those on complex regimens. We also shared data from our broad long-acting program, including our once-weekly orals GS-4182 and GS-1720. We plan to start the Phase 2 study evaluating these in combination before the end of the year. This is in addition to the once-weekly oral combination of lenacapavir and islatravir in partnership with Merck that will begin Phase 3, also before the end of the year. On the immediate horizon, our PDUFA date for seladelpar is next week. The body of clinical evidence behind seladelpar for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC, continues to grow, most recently with the Phase 3 ASSURE data shared at EASL. The Gilead team is excited by the opportunity to launch seladelpar and bring a promising new treatment to the patients who could benefit. Moving to Oncology, we are ready to manufacture anito-cel for multiple myeloma at our Maryland Kite facility, and we are preparing to support the Phase 3 iMMagine-3 trial from the site starting later this year. The iMMagine-3 trial is expected to reach a broader set of 2nd- to 4th-line multiple myeloma patients with our potentially best-in-class BCMA CAR T. At ASCO, we shared new data from our Phase 2 EVOKE-02 program evaluating Trodelvy in combination with pembro in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The results showed meaningful efficacy compared to the historical standard-of-care, supporting the Phase 3 EVOKE-03 trial currently underway. We continue to assess the path for Trodelvy in second-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic bladder cancer following the EVOKE-01 and TROPiCS-04 readouts earlier this year. In the meantime, I'd highlight the strong commercial results this quarter in breast cancer where Trodelvy remains the first and only approved TROP2-directed ADC on the market and is the standard of care for second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. To date, we have served over 40,000 cancer patients, and remain confident that Trodelvy will continue to be an important treatment option. We also shared Phase 2 EDGE-Gastric data at ASCO for domvanalimab plus zimberelimab and chemotherapy in first-line upper GI cancers. These results showed compelling efficacy that supports the Phase 3 STAR-221 program, which has completed enrollment. Moving to our 2024 key milestones on slide 6, we look forward to the upcoming updates from the Phase 3 ASCENT-03 trial and Phase 2 iMMagine-1 trial. ASCENT-03 is an event-driven trial evaluating Trodelvy in first-line PD-L1 negative metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients. A positive progression-free survival outcome would support global filings, potentially moving Trodelvy into earlier lines of triplenegative breast cancer. Our iMMagine-1 trial could support regulatory filings for anito-cel in later-line relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Overall, the second quarter was a strong performance for the Gilead team, with the highlights including some remarkable clinical results in HIV, solid revenue growth across therapeutic areas, tangible impact from our disciplined cost management initiatives, and planning for the imminent launch of seladelpar. With that, I will hand it over to Johanna. Thanks Daina. We sort of got Cindy Perettie here. We'll turn over to her to answer that. Thanks for your question. Thanks, Salveen it's kind of a two-part. So I'll have Merdad start and maybe have Johanna add, as well. Thank you, everybody. In closing, we the team here would like to summarize the quarter as follows: we had a very strong quarter of revenue growth and impressive bottom-line growth that highlights the leverage in our model. Secondly, we made progress that should enable us to build on that growth in the future including really remarkable data from the Purpose 1 one trial and from across the HIV portfolio with the promise to extend our HIV leadership well into the late 2030s and beyond; the imminent launch of seladelpar in the US and continued progress in oncology; and all this leaves us well positioned for the second half of 2024 when we will continue to focus on quarter after quarter of strong clinical commercial and financial execution. My thanks to the Gilead teams and to all of you for joining today. I want to hand it over to Jacquie Ross for some final comments."

            "name": "Andrew Dickinson",
            "content": "Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on slide 25, the team delivered an excellent quarter, with our base business up 6% year-over-year to $6.7 billion. Product sales growth across HIV, Liver Disease and Oncology more than offset the expected decline in Veklury, with total product sales up 5% year-over-year. Moving to our non-GAAP results on slide 26. Product gross margin was 86%, down 84 basis points from last year. R&D expenses were down 3% year-over-year, primarily due to the wind-down of certain magrolimab, obeldesivir and Trodelvy studies following recent data and regulatory updates. Sequentially, R&D was down 5%, primarily due to the timing of clinical and manufacturing activities, partially offset by the initiation of new studies. These savings reflect disciplined management of R&D resources towards the most meaningful opportunities. Acquired IPR&D was $38 million, reflecting new and ongoing collaboration payments in the second quarter. SG&A was down 27% year-over-year, primarily due to the $525 million legal settlement in 2023 that did not repeat in 2024. Excluding this payment, SG&A was up 2% year-over-year, and includes commercial investments ahead of the launch of seladelpar. Operating margin for the second quarter was 47%, our strongest operating margin since the third quarter of 2022, highlighting the leverage we have in our business model. Turning to tax, our effective tax rate was approximately 18%, reflecting settlement with a tax authority in the second quarter. On a reported basis, our non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 50% year-over-year from $1.34 to $2.01 per share. As mentioned earlier, we had a $525 million legal settlement, representing $0.32 per share, in the second quarter of 2023 that did not repeat in the second quarter of 2024. Excluding this settlement, EPS grew 21% year-over-year, reflecting higher product sales and lower expenses including acquired IPR&D expenses. As highlighted on Slide 27, we had a strong first half of the year, with solid performance in each of our core franchises across Virology and Oncology, driving base business growth of 6% year-over-year, which is at the upper-end of our full-year guidance of 4% to 6%. Switching to our expectations for 2024 on Slide 28, we continue to expect total product sales in the range of $27.1 billion to $27.5 billion, and total product sales, excluding Veklury, in the range of $25.8 billion to $26.2 billion. Given the inherent variability experienced historically, and as stated previously - we are not updating our Veklury guidance at this time. As we think about the second half of the year, here are some of the factors that we are continuing to monitor. First, we continue to expect the normal, quarter-to-quarter variability in our HIV business that we have always experienced relative to average realized price associated with channel mix. Second, we expect quarterly variability in cell therapy due to continued in-class and out-of-class competition. Third, there is some uncertainty associated with Trodelvy bladder revenue following TROPiCS-04. As a reminder, bladder represents less than 10% of total Trodelvy sales today; and finally, there is a possibility of incremental FX headwinds in the second half of the year. For the rest of 2024, we continue to expect to deliver strong volume growth across all therapeutic areas, and assuming approval seladelpar as an incremental contributor to revenue growth. Continued HIV volume and revenue growth, consistent with our full year expectation to grow HIV product sales by approximately 4%; and continued focus on disciplined operating expense management. Moving to the non-GAAP guidance, there is no change to our non-GAAP gross margin range of 85% to 86%. For R&D, we now expect total R&D expense to increase by a low to mid-single-digit percentage compared to 2023, reflecting lower than previously expected R&D expenses in 2024, despite absorbing the late-stage seladelpar program. For SG&A, there is no change to our prior guidance pointing to a mid-single digit decline compared to 2023. Consistent with our expectations last quarter, we have been able to absorb the incremental expenses associated with the CymaBay transaction. For acquired IPR&D, we now expect full-year expenses of $4.7 billion, up from $4.4 billion last quarter to reflect a $320 million transaction with Janssen to buy out the global seladelpar royalty. This expense will be included in our third quarter results. Finally, with the strong operational expense control demonstrated in both the first and second quarters, and despite this new $320 million acquired IPR&D expense, we are increasing our operating income guidance to $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion, and increasing our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $3.60 to $3.90. Slide 29 highlights that the increase to our EPS guidance fully absorbs the $320 million, or approximately $0.20 per share, expense associated with the buyout of the seladelpar royalty from Janssen. This transaction removes Gilead's royalty obligation to pay 8% of seladelpar sales. Excluding this transaction, our EPS guidance increase would have been even more significant today, up $0.30 or 8% at the midpoint, again highlighting the financial discipline that has translated into operating leverage. Moving to slide 30, we continue to have sufficient flexibility in our balance sheet to execute on our capital allocation priorities. In the second quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders, repaid $1.75 billion of senior notes, and paid $1.2 billion as part of the federal transition tax associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The remaining transition tax payment of $1.3 billion is scheduled for April of 2025. Overall, we believe that Gilead is well-positioned for near and long-term growth and we continue to be focused on commercial execution, expense management discipline, and to delivering on our strategic commitments. And now, I'll invite Rebecca to begin the Q&A."

I think the second question you asked is what type of follow-up would we expect to see at ASH, and I think we're in the process of we did an initial cut obviously for the abstracts we'll do the second cut for the final sharing of the data. So I don't have the exact follow-up time. But we can certainly look to follow-up with you once we have that. Your second question was around Imagine 3 and bridging therapy. Right now, we will be moving - so we were able to complete the tech transfer as you heard from Dan into our Maryland production facility. So we will be supplying therapy out of our Maryland facility and we expect to apply a lot of the learnings that we have with our existing products on the market today and be able to get Anito-cell back to those patients in Imagine 3 as it relates to having time upfront to do bridging therapy. However, with the protocol design today, we do have the option to do bridging therapy if necessary for patients."

            "name": "Johanna Mercier",
            "content": "Thanks Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to report the continued momentum we saw in the second quarter, and would like to thank the Gilead teams who contributed to another strong quarter of execution. As shown on slide 8, total product sales, excluding Veklury were $6.7 billion in the second quarter, up 6% year-over-year, with growth across HIV, Liver Disease, and Oncology. Including Veklury, total product sales were $6.9 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Starting with HIV on slide 9, sales of $4.7 billion were up 3% year-over-year, driven by strong demand across treatment and prevention, partially offset by lower average realized price due to channel mix. Quarter-over-quarter, sales were up 9%, reflecting favorable pricing and inventory build following the typical first quarter dynamics, as well as higher demand. Looking to the full year, we remain on-track to deliver HIV sales growth of approximately 4%. Turning to slide 10, total second quarter Biktarvy sales of $3.2 billion were up 8% year-over-year, primarily due to higher demand. Sequentially, sales were up 10%, largely reflecting favorable pricing and inventory following the typical first quarter dynamics. Highlighting our leadership position, Biktarvy represents more than 49% share of the treatment market in the U.S. This was up almost 3% year-over-year, our 24th consecutive quarter of year-over-year market share gain. With a meaningful share lead over all other branded regimens for HIV treatment, Biktarvy firmly remains the HIV treatment-of-choice, particularly for those starting or switching regimens in the U.S., as well as across other major markets. Overall, the HIV treatment market continues to grow in-line with our expectations of 2% to 3% annually. Turning to Descovy, we continued to see higher demand with sales of $485 million in the second quarter. Year-over-year, sales were down 6% as demand growth was more than offset by lower average realized price due to channel mix. As a reminder, shifts in channel mix will continue to impact average realized price in addition to our ongoing efforts to ensure people who want or need PrEP have access to the prevention regimen of their choice. Sequentially, sales were up 14%, reflecting favorable inventory and pricing following typical first quarter seasonality, in addition to the higher demand. Descovy for PrEP once again maintained its over 40% PrEP market share in the U.S., despite the availability of other regimens, including generics. We're particularly excited to note that the HIV PrEP market in the U.S. continues to expand, with total volumes up more than 12% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year. With that in mind, we are thrilled with the unprecedented results seen in our pivotal Phase 3 PURPOSE 1 trial, achieving 100% efficacy with zero cases of HIV infections in a broad population of cisgender women, including those who are pregnant or lactating. This is just the beginning of our larger, landmark PURPOSE program which includes multiple populations and communities where PrEP is underutilized or more difficult to access today, such as cisgender women, transgender men and women, Black and Latino individuals, and young adults. Overall, we expect lenacapavir will emerge as the regimen-of-choice for those who want or need prevention as the first and only long-acting option with twice-yearly subcutaneous dosing. We are preparing for potential launch as early as late 2025. Moving to the Liver Disease portfolio on slide 11, sales were up 17% year-over-year and 13% sequentially, driven by higher demand and higher average realized price due to channel mix in the U.S. Our Liver Disease franchise continues to differentiate itself, with leading share in HCV despite fewer HCV starts year-over-year together with growing demand in HBV and HDV. As you know, our PDUFA date for seladelpar is next week, and we stand ready to launch commercially in the U.S. We are able to leverage our existing commercial footprint in liver diseases, and continue building upon these relationships to quickly bring seladelpar to many of the 130,000 people impacted by PBC in the U.S. who progress after initial treatment. Outside the U.S., commercial preparations are well underway, and we look forward to the European regulatory decision in early 2025. Turning to Slide 12, while severity of COVID infections and hospitalization rates remain variable, Veklury continues to be recognized as an important part of the standard of care for hospitalized patients treated for COVID-19. This includes the U.S. where Veklury has maintained well over 60% share in this setting. For the second quarter, Veklury sales were down 16% year-over-year and down 61% sequentially, as expected. Moving to Oncology on slide 13, sales were up 15% year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-quarter to $841 million. With over 60,000 patients treated with a Gilead or Kite therapy to date, we're proud of the positive impact our oncology medicines have made across multiple cancer types. Looking in more detail at Trodelvy on slide 14, sales for the second quarter were $320 million, up 23% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially, primarily driven by higher demand in the U.S. and Europe across its metastatic breast cancer indications. Trodelvy is the only approved and available TROP2-directed ADC to demonstrate clinically meaningful survival benefits across two types of metastatic breast cancers. And with increasing awareness amongst physicians, Trodelvy has remained the leading regimen in the U.S. and Europe for second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer with growing adoption in the pre-treated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer setting. We are working to expand Trodelvy's reach beyond the 40,000-plus patients treated to date across multiple tumor types as we look to new and existing markets, as well as new indications. In bladder cancer, we are planning to further discuss the results of TROPiCS-04 and next steps with FDA. At this time, Trodelvy continues to be available under an accelerated approval in the U.S. for second-line plus metastatic or advanced bladder cancer. Turning to Slide 15, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, Cell Therapy sales in the second quarter were $521 million, up 11% year-over-year and up 9% quarter-over-quarter, with solid growth in all regions. In the U.S., sales were up 11% sequentially as we've begun to see momentum from our focused efforts at the authorized treatment centers, including further educating providers and patients on the curative potential of our cell therapies. Despite these efforts, in-class and out-of-class competition remain a near-term headwind in the U.S. As we extend the reach of cell therapy, we are making important in-roads with key community practices, including working with national payers to unlock broader commercial reimbursement, and as a reminder, expect impact from these initiatives towards the end of 2024. We'll continue to refine this \u201cblueprint\u201d as we work to onboard new centers and patients over time. Outside the U.S., demand for Yescarta and Tecartus across Europe and other international geographies remains strong, and we're encouraged by the solid progress in our newly launched markets such as Japan and Saudi Arabia. Overall, it was a strong second quarter for our commercial portfolio, and the teams are energized by the potential to bring two more transformational therapies to market \u2013 first with seladelpar for PBC next week, and then, lenacapavir for HIV prevention as early as late next year. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad. So maybe just to complete the second part of that question around the growth in PrEP and like the opportunities lies ahead despite some of the payer roadblocks that you are referring to just a couple of points on that, one is, today the market for PrEP is growing at about 12% or so year-on-year, so nice consistent growth that we have seen over the last couple of years. Descovy coverage is over 90% of all lives are covered from an access standpoint. So today the daily orals do not have any concerns from an access standpoint. I think maybe what you're referring to is potentially as we think about medical benefits versus the pharmacy benefits that might create a little bit more access headwinds from a payer standpoint and we've seen that already with some of our competitors. As we think about lenacapavir, in light of not only the data, just most recently with Purpose 1, but also just the profile that it offers with a twice yearly sub cu I think it really allows us to redefine the PrEP market as a whole. And as much as we're seeing today maybe over 400,000 users in the US. We really see three major growth opportunities. One is around market size growth, the other one's around market share growth and the third one is on endurance. So if I just break those down a little bit, the market size growth is around reaching more users. So we'll beyond just white MSMS thinking about cisgender women, transgender men and women Latino black individuals, as well as young adults, reaching more prescribers in different settings than we are today and over time reaching more countries, right? Because right now PrEP revenues are really coming primarily out of the United States. From a market share growth standpoint Descovy is the number one branded daily oral today with over 40% share. And we believe lenacapavir will be number one from a long-acting standpoint and between the two together, we believe the Gilead presence in HIV prevention will also be leading and greater than where we are today. And then last but not least, it's hired adherent and not just has to do with a domestic - the frequency of administration when you think about a twice the early subcu has much adherence than a daily oral and obviously, better outcomes. So all of those pieces together is what we are focused on as an opportunity for the future of prevention and with not only Descovy but obviously with lenacapavir around the corner potentially. And from an access standpoint we are thinking ahead as we think about even the work that CMS is doing when they think about making it our Part B drug, for a medical benefit in PrEP to ensure greater access, but we're also thinking through how is this going to impact from both from a prescriber standpoint and how do we support that reimbursement, challenges that I think others have been facing and how we basically do a very high touch approach here to make sure everyone who needs or wants PrEP gets access to their drug of choice. So maybe I'll take that one Umer. So the len-bic combination is a single treatment regimen that really combined a best-in-class integrates inhibitor with the first-in-class capsid. The studies that we are doing both Phase2 and 3 are really first, that we looked at the complex regimen which that was kind of the first step and as we go into Phase 3, we believe we can get a broader label indication to also include all of our allergically suppressed. So as we think about that opportunity, we think it's an opportunity for an FTI that's optimized, simplified for complex regimens but also provides optionality in the viral decree to press the switch segment of the marketplace, So as we think about it as a portfolio perspective, we still believe that today Biktarvy is the standard of care and will remain as the standard of care from a daily oral standpoint. But we also see that's an opportunity in the switch segment. So nai\u0308ve is a big piece probably the biggest piece for Biktarvy's growth. And the switch because we have such a large share obviously, right? So from a switch segment that offers us another opportunity for us to play bigger market space in HIV. Sure and Carter, just to explain a little bit, the nodules are because it's a drug depot, right? So the nodule actually gets smaller over time. What we've seen is actually very little discontinuation in Purpose 1 due to that. That's number one. Two is the nodules are sometimes palpable not all? But sometimes palpable but not visible and generally speaking. And so we believe that actually we will have some. flexibility as well as to where those injections play out and where because I think, they've been studied in different places not just in the stomach in the site. And so, I think that'll be an opportunity as well for people to be a little bit more flexible as to where they get their injections. So we're not overly concerned there at all. Actually, and really we're taking it from the data that we're getting from Purpose 1 and hopefully, we'll have similar data to learn from Purpose 2. Thanks, Chris. We are really pleased with our strong cell therapy growth this quarter. And this is really part and parcel to our US refresh strategy. So as a reminder we restructured our sales team at the end of last year and we got our new sales team in place and trained and ready to go. And as part of that strategy we also focused for the next couple of quarters on really within the authorized treatment centers making sure those referrals occur between the lymphoma specialist to the CAR-T specialist. And that's what you're seeing as part of the excellent performance that we had this quarter. And we'll continue to deliver and really focus on the referrals within the AGC. We are also in parallel building up that those community practices and spending time educating both the community practices, I'd say regional hospitals and those institutions about the curative potential of CAR-T and why it's important to bring this into the therapy that they're offering to their patients. And we're making really good progress there including a lot of work with national payers. But despite all this, as you heard earlier from both Dan and Johanna, we are facing, it's a dynamic market. We're remaining cautious for the second half of this year as we continue to see some competitive headwinds both in cost competition. So we have new indications that came out in late May, early June time frame which are capturing physician mind share initially and we're also seeing out of cost competition with the bispecifics. But with all of that said, we are focused on execution and working with our physicians and institutions to raise awareness of the curative potential for CAR-T and will continue to do so in the second half of this year. As it relates to community practices, I shared last quarter that it's taking us a little bit longer than we had expected to get them up and fully operating. But we're making great progress as it relates to that and learning a lot along the way. So we're continuing to refine our blueprint as we onboard new centers. Yeah, I would just re-emphasize what Merdad said, I think just the fact we are the ones on the market today and so well established as the number one standard of care and triple negative breast cancer second line. I do think that that is a big differentiator here as we think about some of these data points. And maybe to pick up on the second part of that, Salveen. So just to take a step back, I think it's important to understand how much we have moved the needle actually when you think about the penetration in the prevention market. Just a couple of years ago, you were about 25% penetrating when you if you consider it from a CDC standpoint estimate, we're now over a third of that. So we have really grown this market and expanded it. I think one of the challenges has definitely been this is not a typical market that you it's not HIV treatment. It is a market where these are individuals that are not sick. They have no asymptomatic, obviously they have nothing and so therefore it's very challenging when you think about a daily oral pill, which is today over 95% of the total market where you think about current generics or Descovy share. And taking a pill every single day is incredibly challenging. So many use PrEP on demand. And I do think and in that the biggest population that we see are actually wide MSMs so very much a high commercial market here. And we believe that there is a real opportunity to whip something that has the profile of lenacapavir with a twice yearly subcu that we can truly expand the reach of the people, the individuals that could truly benefit from prevention for the future. And so, so that's kind of the steps. So I think it's an ongoing growth that we've been seeing. I think we have to do a step change here as we think about the future of prevention. I think we have to think completely differently about what lenacapavir could offer all of these people and really make a dent in this HIV epidemic. Sure. I'll take that one. So the move the entity for PrEPs that CMS is working on, I do think it's positive. I think it's really around providing greater access and potentially providing also the services that go with it. So the D2B could actually be a nice move despite the fact that today Medicare is a very small piece of the total prevention market. As we think about lenacapavir, I think it'll be both. I think there's probably opportunities for it to be both a pharmacy benefit as well as a medical benefit and be a buy and bill and I think we just need to think very differently because buy and bill in the current users of prevention this is not something that they're familiar with. And so this is something we're really thinking about today for tomorrow is to setting up that system to make sure they understand how to do this, if they want to do it, but that they have an option if they don't want to do it. And I think that's what we're kind of planning for us as we think about the future of lenacapavir."

In a moment, we'll begin our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I'll now hand the call over to Jacquie Ross, VP, Investor Relations and Corporate Strategic Finance. \nJacquie Ross: Thank you, Rebecca. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the first quarter of 2024. The press release, slides and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com. \n The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open Q&A where the team will be joined by Cindy Perettie, the Executive Vice President of Kite. \n Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. Please refer to Slide 2 regarding the risks and uncertainties relating to forward-looking statements that could cause actual results to differ materially.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan. \nDaniel O'Day: Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to start by thanking the Gilead teams for delivering a strong first quarter, which you see in our commercial performance and our clinical execution. Total product sales, excluding Veklury, grew 6% year-over-year to $6.1 billion, driven by higher demand across HIV, oncology and liver disease. Veklury sales continue to track with the rates of hospitalization for COVID-19 and reached a total of $555 million.  \n Once again, sales growth for the quarter reflected the diversity of our portfolio. HIV product sales grew 4% year-over-year. Oncology product sales were up 18%, driven by Trodelvy, which is well established as the #1 regimen for second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and by our transformative cell therapies. As we outlined at the recent Kite analyst event in Maryland, we have exciting plans to build on our clear market leadership in cell therapy, such as expand into community networks in the U.S., more than double our manufacturing capacity, and move into new indications and disease areas with next-generation products.  \n From an EPS perspective, first quarter results reflect the close of the CymaBay acquisition with an inquired IP R&D charge of $3.9 billion or an expense of $3.14 per share. Excluding this charge, non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $1.82 for the first quarter, which is above expectations, driven by higher product sales. The CymaBay acquisition brings us an important registrational medicine, seladelpar, which has the potential to address significant unmet need in liver disease. We have filed for regulatory approval of seladelpar as a treatment for primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC, with both FDA and EMA, and we expect an FDA regulatory decision in August.  \n If approved, we will leverage our industry-leading commercial infrastructure and long-standing expertise in liver disease to bring seladelpar a potentially transformative therapy to people with PBC who might benefit. Moving to clinical execution. We're very pleased with momentum in our HIV pipeline, which was reflected in our 80 data abstracts at CROI. Based on the strength of the data, we've initiated Phase III trials for bictegravir and lenacapavir, our novel once-daily oral regimen, and plan to advance once weekly oral programs, including lenacapavir plus islatravir into Phase III.\n Later this year, we will host an HIV analyst event to share details of how we will further shape the HIV landscape with innovative options for prevention and treatment, including the next wave of long-acting therapies. \n Before I pass it to Johanna, I will briefly recap our 2024 milestones on Slide 6. We have already achieved first patient in for the Phase III ARTISTRY-1 and ARTISTRY-2 trials, evaluating once-daily lenacapavir in combination with bictegravir as well as Phase II first patient in for SWIFT evaluating GS-1427, our oral alpha-4-beta-7 inhibitor. We are also on track for our upcoming milestones, including updates from 3 Phase III clinical trials for Trodelvy and lenacapavir.  \n Looking ahead to the rest of 2024, this is a time of focused execution for Gilead. We will see disciplined and agile in our approach, and we will focus the organization on both near-term execution and longer-term plans. With 54 clinical programs in play, no major patent expiration for the decade and many opportunities for growth, we have a lot of potential and a lot to deliver. \n My thanks again to the Gilead teams for their great work this quarter and the ongoing progress across our diverse portfolio of therapies. With that, I'll hand it over to Johanna. \nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Dan, and Good after noon, everyone. With the first quarter marking the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for our base business, our teams delivered a strong start to 2024, notably navigating the seasonal first quarter dynamics and establishing a firm base on which we can continue to build this year. \n Beginning on Slide 8, total product sales, excluding Veklury, were $6.1 billion for the first quarter, up 6% year-one, reflecting solid growth of our HIV, oncology and liver disease businesses. Including Veklury, total product sales were $6.6 billion, up 5% year-over-year.  \n Moving to HIV on Slide 9. Sales were up 4% year-over-year to $4.3 billion, primarily driven by higher demand as well as favorable pricing dynamics in Europe that are not expected to repeat. Quarter-over-quarter sales were down 7%, driven by the typical seasonality we experienced in the first quarter of the year, partially offset by higher demand. As a reminder, quarterly HIV growth is, in general, more variable and less indicative of overall trends than the full year. This is evident in the first quarter of every year where inventory drawdown typically occurs following a build that generally happens towards the end of the prior year and patient co-pays and deductibles start of every year, and together with shifts in channel mix lowers average realized price in the first quarter.  \n As always, we typically see these quarterly pricing and inventory dynamics normalize as we progress throughout the year. We continue to expect approximately 4% HIV sales growth for 2024. Supporting that outlook, the treatment market grew in line with our expectations, as shown on Slide 10. Biktarvy remains the leading regimen for HIV treatment across major markets for new starts as well as for those switching regimens with sales up 10% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, reflecting strong demand.  \n Quarter-over-quarter, sales were down 5% as the higher demand was offset by the typical seasonal factors discussed earlier. It's notable that 6 years after launch, Biktarvy continues to gain market share in the U.S. up 3 percentage points year-over-year to approximately 49% share and once again, outpacing all other branded regimens for HIV treatment. Moreover, we continue to see Biktarvy's benefit extend into broader populations of people with HIV. Most recently, Biktarvy was granted FDA approval for use in virologically suppressed individuals with known or suspected M184 resistance, a common form of treatment resistance.  \n Turning to prevention. Descovy sales were down 5% year-over-year to $426 million, driven by lower average realized price due to channel mix, partially offset by higher demand. Sequentially, sales were down 16%, reflecting the seasonal dynamics discussed earlier, partially offset by higher demand. While market volumes in February were temporarily disrupted by the cyberattack on Change Healthcare, volumes readily recovered in March. Overall, the PrEP market continued to demonstrate robust growth, up over 11% in the first quarter, with Descovy maintaining over 40%  PrEP market share in the U.S. despite the availability of other regimens, including generics. \n This is a solid setup as we look to potentially launch lenacapavir as early as late next year as the first and only twice yearly subcutaneous prevention option. Given Gilead's strong commercial foundation across treatment and prevention, we are well positioned to maintain leadership in HIV as we look to the evolving marketplace of daily orals, long-acting orals and long-acting injectables. \n Moving to liver disease on Slide 11. Sales for the first quarter were $737 million, up 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable inventory dynamics and the timing of purchases by the Department of Corrections for our HCV products as well as higher demand across HCV, HBV and HDV. Sequentially, sales were up 7%, primarily reflecting the timing of HCV purchases.  \n Despite fewer HCV starts globally year-over-year, our viral hepatitis portfolio overall has remained stable and continues to be a meaningful contributor to our commercial performance. This strength is underpinned by our extensive global footprint and expertise in the treatment of liver diseases. To that end, pending approval, Gilead is excited to bring seladelpar to patients for the treatment of certain adults with PBC, impacting approximately 130,000 people in the U.S. and about 125,000 people in Europe. With the sales force that covers almost 80% of the U.S. prescriber base for PBC, we expect to readily make seladelpar available to patients upon approval in the second half of this year.  \n Seladelpar has demonstrated the potential to be best-in-class with a differentiated clinical profile to existing and emerging therapies, particularly on a key symptom of the disease, pruritus. Following its launch in 2024, we expect seladelpar to contribute modestly to sales and more meaningfully in 2025 and beyond.  \n Turning to Slide 12. Veklury continues to be the standard of care antiviral for hospitalized patients treated with COVID-19, with market share well over 60% in the United States. COVID-related hospitalizations were lower in the first quarter with the winter wave peaking earlier than expected in the U.S. and Europe as compared to other regions such as Japan. As a result, Veklury sales overall were down 3% year-over-year and down 23% sequentially to $555 million.  \n Shifting to oncology on Slide 13. Sales were up 18% year-over-year to $789 million and are now firmly above a $3 billion annual run rate. Having treated over 50,000 patients to date, we look forward to bringing our portfolio of medicines and future treatments across lines of therapies and tumor types to many more patients around the world. \n Moving to Slide 14. Trodelvy sales for the first quarter exceeded $300 million, up 39% year-over-year, reflecting continued demand. Sequentially, sales were up 3%, primarily driven by demand outside the U.S. as well as unfavorable fourth quarter pricing dynamics in Europe that did not repeat. This was partially offset by inventory dynamics in the U.S. where we saw a drawdown in the first quarter. \n Overall, Trodelvy\u2019's strong market share reflects its awareness amongst providers and patients. In second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, Trodelvy remains the leading regimen with approximately 1/3 in the U.S. And in the pre-treated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer setting, Trodelvy has demonstrated continued adoption, most notably in the IHC0 setting. \n We are confident Trodelvy continues to differentiate itself with its safety profile and clinically meaningful survival benefits, with over 30,000 patients across tumor types already treated to date. We look forward to potentially extending Trodelvy\u2019s reach to many more patients in the years ahead particularly in bladder cancer, earlier-line breast cancer settings, and lung cancer. \n Turning to Slide 15, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, Cell Therapy sales were $480 million in the first quarter, up 7% year-over-year. Sequentially, sales were up 3%, in-line with our guidance of flat to slightly up. We\u2019're pleased to see continued demand for Yescarta and Tecartus in both existing and new markets across Europe and other geographies, such as in Japan where we have seen good progress in growing brand share and expanding our network of authorized treatment centers to over 20 to date. \n In the U.S., and consistent with our recent updates, we see opportunity for growth through expanding the number of authorized treatment centers and affiliated satellites, while also driving increased referrals from the community setting.\n For example, we're proud to have established our flagship community collaboration with Tennessee Oncology in the first quarter. We\u2019've identified many critical learnings on how we can partner effectively with community oncology practices for cell therapy, and we will continue to refine this \u201cblueprint\u201d so that we become more efficient at onboarding new centers over time. We expect to start seeing the Impact from this initiative towards the end of 2024. \n Wrapping up the first quarter, we had a strong start to the year, primarily driven by higher demand across each of our core businesses year-over-year. \n We look forward to carrying this momentum through 2024 and as we bring seladelpar to market later this year following approval. I\u2019d like to thank the commercial teams and cross-functional partners across Gilead and Kite for their strong execution as we diligently expand our therapies to new populations, positively impacting more people all around the world. \n And with that, I\u2019'll hand the call over to Merdad. \nMerdad Parsey: Thank you, Johanna. We have had a busy first quarter at Gilead, with a cadence of clinical readouts that will continue throughout the rest of the year. Importantly, we anticipate an FDA regulatory decision on seladelpar and 3 Phase III updates across HIV prevention, bladder cancer, and breast cancer. \n Starting on Slide 17, we continue to progress our industry-leading Virology pipeline, which is building momentum following a data-rich presence at CROI in March. This included robust virologic suppression data from our once-daily oral combination of bictegravir with Lenacapavir from the Phase III portion of the ARTISTRY-1 trial. \n This novel combination has the potential to benefit people with HIV on complex regimens. We have since started 2 Phase III trials of this combination, one in virologically suppressed individuals and another in virologically suppressed treatment-experienced individuals. We expect to complete enrollment in the first half of 2025. \n We also have 2 once-weekly oral programs: first, a combination of lenacapavir with Merck\u2019s NRTTI, islatravir, in virologically suppressed people with HIV, expected to advance into Phase III later this year. And second, a combination of a capsid inhibitor with GS-1720, our novel oral integrase inhibitor. We're working to advance this combination into a Phase III study. This second program has the potential to be the first once-weekly oral regimen containing an INSTI agent. INSTIs are the standard-of-care treatment for HIV, and an important treatment option for clinicians who continue to prefer INSTI-based regimens.\n Finally, we presented Phase Ib data from our twice-yearly parenteral program of lenacapavir plus our 2 broadly neutralizing antibodies for people with HIV at CROI, and we intend to share data from the Phase III study in the second half of this year. \n Moving to PrEP, we plan to share an update from our Phase III PURPOSE-1 trial in the second half of this year. Data from PURPOSE-01, together with data from PURPOSE-2, is expected to support the filing of Lenacapavir for HIV prevention. This PrEP option would not only offer a convenient dosing schedule as the first twice-yearly subcutaneous regimen, but could also be transformative in terms of adherence to HIV prevention regimens. \n Turning to Slide 18. Our Trodelvy program continues to be evaluated across a range of solid tumors with 7 Phase 3 trials currently underway across breast, bladder, and metastatic non-small cell lung cancers with plans to start the Phase III trial in endometrial cancer later this year. \n Abstract titles were just released yesterday for the upcoming ASCO meeting, and we'\u2019re pleased to have over a dozen Oncology presentations this year. We will be presenting late-breaking Phase III data from our second-line plus metastatic non-small cell lung cancer trial, EVOKE-01. Updated data from first-line, PD-L1 high subjects in Cohort A of the Phase III EVOKE-02 trial will also be shared. We plan on providing updates from Cohorts C and D, evaluating Trodelvy plus pembro and chemotherapy in PD-L1 all-comers at a medical congress in the second half of this year. In addition, presentations for both the Phase III EDGE-Gastric trial and Phase III ARC-9 studies will be highlighted. \n Depending on the timing of event accruals, we anticipate 2 more Phase III updates this year for Trodelvy. These include overall survival data from our confirmatory Phase 3 bladder cancer study, TROPiCS-04, that could support Trodelvy\u2019s submission for full regulatory approval in the U.S. and enable ex-U.S. filings. \n In TNBC, where Trodelvy is the only ADC to have demonstrated statistically significant improvement in overall survival in the second-line setting, we expect to share an update on the Phase III ASCENT-03 trial in first-line PD-L1 negative patients later this year. \n Moving on to Cell Therapy. I\u2019'm pleased to share Kite's approach to the development of novel cell therapies that Cindy and the team presented at last month\u2019's investor event. As you can see on slide 19 Yescarta and Tecartus established Kite as the leader in Cell Therapy, and we plan to potentially extend this leadership into multiple myeloma, while also paving the way for innovative next-generation constructs. \n On anito-cel in later-line multiple myeloma, we expect to provide a Phase III iMMagine-1 trial update in the second half of this year. This update follows the highly encouraging Phase I data presented at ASH last year, where anito-cel demonstrated durable responses with median progression-free survival not yet met at 26.5 months median follow-up \u2013and no cases of parkinsonian symptoms observed in the trial.\n For our next generation cell therapy assets, we have bicistronic and optimized manufacturing constructs in Phase I trials, which are aimed at overcoming resistance mechanisms, providing potentially deeper and more sustained responses, and improving product potency. Beyond that, we have early research in allogeneic and in vivo CAR, with plans to expand into a range of other disease areas \u2013such as multiple myeloma with anito-cel, solid tumors, and autoimmune diseases. \n Moving to Inflammation on Slide 20. We recently completed our acquisition of CymaBay and added seladelpar, an investigational PPAR-delta agonist to our portfolio. In Phase III clinical trials, seladelpar demonstrated significant improvement in both pruritus and markers of cholestasis related to the risk of progression for PBC. As previously announced, FDA and EMA accepted our regulatory filings for seladelpar for the management of PBC in certain adult patients. We anticipate an FDA regulatory decision by August 14th and a decision from European regulators early next year. We continue to work with global regulatory authorities to expand the reach of seladelpar for PBC patients. \n Further, as we look at the rest of our Inflammation pipeline, we have several early phase assets that have progressed into Phase II trials, including our potentially first-in-class oral TPL2 inhibitor, a potentially best-in-class oral alpha-4-beta-7 anti-integrin, and an oral IRAK4 inhibitor. \n Wrapping up on Slide 21. We continue to progress on our clinical milestones for the year, and we have had 2 First Patients in and 1 data readout completed in the first quarter and we remain on-track for our remaining milestones. \n And now, I\u2019'll hand the call over to Andy. \nAndrew Dickinson: Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Beginning on Slide 23. It was a strong start to the year with our base business up 6% year-overyear. The solid growth achieved across HIV, Oncology, and Liver Disease offset the decline in Veklury, with total product sales up 5% year-over-year to $6.6 billion. As expected, our base business was down quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonal inventory and pricing dynamics in HIV. \n Moving beyond our revenue results, 2 items significantly impacted our EPS performance in the first quarter, as shown on Slide 24. First, our GAAP and non-GAAP results included an acquired IPR&D charge of $3.9 billion or $3.14 per share, associated with the close of the CymaBay acquisition. As an asset acquisition, this transaction was fully expensed in the first quarter. This was a nondeductible expense item, and as a result, impacted our effective tax rate. Excluding this expense, our non-GAAP EPS would have been $1.82 for the first quarter, above expectations primarily driven by higher sales. \n The second item shown on the right hand side is an impairment charge that is included in our GAAP results and excluded from our non-GAAP results. As a reminder, this relates to the carrying value of the IPR&D indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired from Immunomedics. \n At the end of 2023, the carrying value was $5.9 billion, all associated with non-small cell lung cancer. As a result of the EVOKE-01 readout in late January, we have re-assessed and reduced the remaining value to $3.5 billion. This primarily reflects the smaller addressable market that Trodelvy could serve among 2L+ metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients, a delay in expected launch timing, and associated competitive activity. \n We remain confident that Trodelvy will deliver attractive returns over time, with sales now exceeding $1 billion a year, a strong IP portfolio, and a development program with multiple shots-on-goal in new indications as well as earlier-lines of therapy, including some opportunities not included in the initial deal model. In the meantime, you can see that the impairment impacted our first quarter GAAP EPS by $1.46 per share. \n Moving to the rest of our non-GAAP results on Slide 25. For the first quarter, product gross margin was down modestly to 85.4%, primarily due to product mix. R&D and SG&A were each down 2% year-over-year. This is the second consecutive quarter of operating expense declines on a year-over-year basis, reflecting our continued focus on disciplined expense management. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was a negative 30%, reflecting the nondeductibility of the CymaBay acquired IPR&D charge. \n Overall, our diluted earnings per share was a negative $1.32 compared to a positive $1.37 for the same period last year, primarily reflecting the $3.14 per share expense related to the CymaBay acquisition. \n Switching to full-year guidance on Slide 26. There is no change to our revenue expectations for 2024 at this time. We continue to expect total product sales in the range of $27.1 to $27.5 billion; and we continue to expect total product sales, excluding Veklury, in the range of $25.8 to $26.2 billion, representing growth of 4% to 6% for our base business year-over-year. Additionally, there is no change to our Veklury guidance of approximately $1.3 billion for the full year. As discussed last quarter, we do not expect to update our Veklury guidance until our third quarter earnings call, absent a very clear trend in COVID-19 infections. \n Shifting to the other parts of the P&L for 2024 on a non-GAAP basis. There is no change to our gross margin guidance where we continue to expect product gross margin in the range of 85% to 86%. We now expect R&D to grow at the higher end of our previous low-to-mid single digit growth range, reflecting the incremental expenses associated with the CymaBay acquisition. \n We continue to expect SG&A expenses to decline a mid-single digit percentage relative to 2023. On a dollar basis, SG&A is expected to be modestly higher than our previous SG&A expectations as we incorporate CymaBay expenses. However, we can manage this within the window of the previously-issued operating expense guidance. Acquired IPR&D is now expected to be approximately $4.4B, due to the CymaBay transaction as well as milestones anticipated throughout the rest of the year.  \n Operating income is now expected in the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion, reflecting the updated acquired IPR&D guidance and the modest increase to operating expenses associated with the CymaBay transaction. Given the non-deductible impact of the CymaBay acquisition, the effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be approximately 30%. This includes a negative impact of approximately 11% from the one-time charge for the acquisition of CymaBay. We therefore now expect diluted EPS in the range of $3.45 to $3.85. As shown on Slide 27, this has only been updated to reflect the transactions that were closed in the first quarter of 2024. Excluding these charges, you can see that we are comfortably within the range of the EPS guidance we shared back in early February. On a GAAP basis, we expect full year 2024 diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.10 and $0.50. \n Moving to Slide 28. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with sufficient flexibility in our balance sheet. Specifically, as demonstrated in the first quarter, we announced a 2.7% increase to our quarterly dividend and returned approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders. In addition, we acquired CymaBay for $4.3 billion, adding seladelpar to our portfolio. Overall, we\u2019'll continue to be disciplined in our use of capital. And while we will continue to be flexible and opportunistic\u2013, it is unlikely that Gilead will be engaging in any sizeable M&A transactions in the near-term. \n Before I wrap it up, on Slide 29, a quick note on our expectations now that the CymaBay transaction has closed. Pending regulatory approval, we expect to launch seladelpar in the U.S. before the end of 2024, as Johanna highlighted earlier, with a modest revenue contribution expected this year. \n Additionally, we have shared that the transaction is expected to add to operating expenses this year as we make incremental investments to support the launch as well as other R&D efforts, all of which we are able to manage within the window of the previously-issued operating expense guidance. \n And as we look ahead, while the transaction will be dilutive to our EPS this year, we expect the deal to be breakeven to earnings in 2025, and significantly accretive in 2026 onwards. \n And now, I\u2019'll invite Rebecca to begin the Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n Our first question comes from Chris Schott at JPMorgan. \nChristopher Schott: Just had a question on the HIV franchise and the impact from the Medicare redesign as we think about 2025, I know this is coming from more and more conversations. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that impact to your franchise? And maybe just more broadly, can we directionally still think about top line growth and margin expansion for Gilead next year despite this headwind? So any color you can provide there would be appreciated. \nDaniel O'Day: Great, Chris. Welcome, everybody. This is Dan. I'm going to have Johanna cover this question. Thank you. \nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Chris, for the question. So we do expect an impact of the Part D redesign to be weighted towards our HIV business and expect our HIV growth in 2025 to be offset by the Part D redesign impact. So as a result, we expect our HIV sales to be roughly flat year-on-year in 2025. Having said that, overall, we expect our total business to grow despite the impact of the Part D we designed in 2025 with the top line, building momentum in 2020 -- beyond 2025, right, '26 and beyond. So we do expect growth in '25, but our HIV business, the demand of HIV will offset the impact of Part D. \nAndrew Dickinson: Chris, it's Andy. I'll take the question on margin expansion. As you know, we don't provide more specific guidance for 2025 beyond what Johanna just mentioned. What we have said historically, and I've underscored, is that we are very focused on disciplined expense management. That will be true in 2025 as it is today. You've seen that in the last 2 quarters. I think on a non-GAAP basis for this quarter, if you look at our operating margin, if you strip out the CymaBay transaction, you see an improvement in our operating margin and we expect that to continue over time. So we do expect broadly for our operating margin to improve over time as you see the continued top line growth and the disciplined expense management. So thanks for the question. More details, of course, to be provided at early next year when we provide our 2025 guidance specifically. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Daina Graybosch at Leerink Partners. \nDaina Graybosch: It's for Kite. FDA's ODAC recently had 2 important meetings of relevance for multiple myeloma and CAR-T there. One, dealt with the early death risk from CARVYKTI and ABECMA. And the second was to recommend MRD as an intermediate endpoint for accelerated approval in multiple myeloma. And I wonder how you're thinking about both of these ODACs in relation to anito-cel in your earlier line trial design. \nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Daina. We've got Cindy Perettie here, so we'll go right over to her. \nCindy Perettie: Thanks, Daina. So if I start off with the early line ODAC, I think we believe this is positive for everybody. What it's shown is that people recognize the value of having CAR Ts therapies earlier in their disease. They value the disease-free intervals that they get from that. So we were very happy to see that. I think we were equally as excited to see the second ODAC around MRD, minimal residual disease, as a secondary -- as an additional endpoint. I think the piece around this is that we're really encouraged that the ODAC decision is going to open up the door for us to potentially bring anito-cel to market faster for patients. And we're in the process right now of understanding how the MRD surrogate endpoint can be used with regulatory agencies and the application of our program and so more to come on that front. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Umer Raffat of Evercore ISI. \nUmer Raffat: I just thought I'll spend a quick second on CymaBay given the recent deal. My question is, did Gilead, during the diligence process, deploy independent pathologists to evaluate the cases of \"possible\" liver pathology that happened in the NASH trial previously as well as the paired liver biopsy data from the PBC trial at the lower dose where CymaBay didn't think it would need safety adjudication? I'd be very curious how you guys did that and if you would ever publish that. \nDaniel O'Day: Merdad is here, so I'll let him answer. \nMerdad Parsey: Thanks, Umer. Let me start by saying we think seladelpar is one of those medicines that will bring a lot of benefit to patients and really some near-term expansion of our liver portfolio and our -- and what we think will synergize with many of the other -- much of the other work that we're doing in liver disease overall. \n We obviously did thorough diligence in our approach to seladelpar and CymaBay. We didn't do a third -- I think your question was around whether we did an independent third-party review of the pathology. We did not do that. However, we did a lot of thorough diligence on the data itself and the outcomes. And we are confident around the outcome and what it means for patients over time. \n Obviously, we're waiting right now the -- our upcoming PDUFA date and also the file in the EMA, which we are optimistic about. And following the questions and all those sorts of items that we're in. So we're looking forward to providing an update on that as those filings proceed. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren at TD Cowen. \nTyler Van Buren: I was hoping you could help set expectations for EVOKE-01 and 02 presentations at ASCO. For EVOKE-02, the late breaker tag is interesting. So is that related to the 3-month OS benefit in the PD-1 refractory patients? Or could we -- or should we be expecting something more? And for EVOKE-02, what should we hope to see with the Cohort A data that should leave us confident in the EVOKE-03 readout next year? \nMerdad Parsey: Thanks, Tyler, it's Merdad again here. So it's a little challenging because I can't share too many details now because we're under embargo for both of those. And obviously, happy to fill in a lot of the blanks once the data are released, and we can talk about it in ASCO. I think for EVOKE-01, we think there are a number of pipeline updates in our ASCO presentations that we have upcoming, which were -- we see as a real change for us and a real evolution of our pipeline overall and our ability to build our oncology pipeline and bring new options for patients. \n As part of the late breaker session for EVOKE-01, as you mentioned, we will include data on overall survival, on PFS, ORR and duration of response as well as the safety profile, of course. And I wish I could give you more details, but I can't at this point. As you say, we will also be providing other updates there, including the EVOKE-02 Cohort A data looking at the PD-L1 high non-small cell population. And again, it's -- I can't really talk about the details of those data, but we are looking forward to sharing those results with everyone and talking about the implications of that for our broader lung cancer and especially the frontline lung cancer EVOKE-03 study that we are conducting right now is underway with our partners at Merck. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham at Bank of America. \nGeoffrey Meacham: Merdad, a question for you. On the cell therapy front, you usually have the anito-cel update later this year, which is big. But beyond that, I wasn't sure what the priority was among the next-gen CAR assets that you've got kind of cartooned on Slide 19. There's a lot of competition in this space, but you guys are among the only players that have real scale and you could move the next-gen stuff, I think, pretty fast. But if you had to pick sort of a priority list, will be good to know. \nDaniel O'Day: Thanks, Geoff. This is Dan. We're going to have Cindy Perettie answer that question, if you don't mind. So Cindy, over to you. \nCindy Perettie: So we have 3 products right now, or 3 constructs that are in Phase Ia and b clinical trials. The first one is a bicistronic CD19, CD20 that has 41BB and CD28. The second one is that same construct with fast manufacturing, 3-day manufacturing. And the other one is a CD19 like Yescarta with 3-day manufacturing. So we're looking at all 3 of those in parallel with the goal of picking the winner to advance that rapidly into our pivotal trials. So that's what's coming up next. Obviously, we've shared a lot around anito-cel as well. With anito-cel, we have the iMMagine-1 readout, and we expect to move quickly into earlier lines as it relates to anito-cel, and you'll hear more about that later this year. Hopefully, that answers your question. We certainly have a number of plays in early research, but we would plan to advance our next-generation lymphoma assets quickly. And obviously, with the scale that we have at Kite as well as the integrated fact that we can create the vector as well as the construct in-house. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Yee at Jefferies. \nMichael Yee: Following up on the Trodelvy data coming at ASCO and your enthusiasm for frontline, can you just remind us, a, do you believe that your data in EVOKE second line that will be at ASCO is at least as competitive or better than Astra, and that is why you're excited about frontline? And b, if you are, do you have a triple therapy on top of chemo combo or is your whole first-line strategy just on top of PD-1? \nMerdad Parsey: Thanks, Michael. This is Merdad again. As we've noted, I think, and as you talked about, the EVOKE-01 data in second line will be something that we discuss at ASCO and show those data. And the full data set is -- does motivate us to go forward in lung cancer and including with discussions with regulators. The unmet need in this population is great, and the data give us options, including discussions with health authorities and conducting follow-up trials. We'll be able to share more once the data are provided at ASCO, and so we look forward to having those deeper discussions once we can speak directly to the data. \n And I'm sorry, and the second part of your question was around the front line. Again, I think once we are able to share the EVOKE-02 data, the update on EVOKE-02 data, we'll be able to talk more. But it does continue to allow us to think about the frontline and our confidence around about EVOKE-03. And then the last part of your question on other combinations. We do think about our intra-portfolio combinations. For example, we have a combination of dambinelumab and Trodelvy in a trial where we're looking to see if we can get additional efficacy from those sorts of combinations. So we do continuously look at our portfolio and look for opportunities for moving the needle with combinations from within our portfolio. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Salveen Richter of Goldman Sachs. \nSalveen Richter: So you currently have about $5 billion in cash and noted leverage is back to pre-Immunomedics deal levels. How are you thinking about meaningful or bolt-on BD post the CymaBay acquisition? And is there any preference now between virology, I&I and oncology? \nAndrew Dickinson: Salveen, it's Andy. Maybe I'll start with that one. In our prepared remarks, I highlighted that in the near term, we don't expect sizable M&A.\n So we have a lot of execution ahead of us. We have a deep portfolio, a lot of growth drivers, including seladelpar. So we're very clearly highlighting that in the short term, we will continue to do ordinary course business development, the standard licensing deals. You saw a couple of those in the first quarter. But it's unlikely that we'd pursue any meaningful M&A in the near term. We've also said historically that deals like CymaBay are exactly what we're looking for and that we should do deals like that on a regular basis over the cycle and whether that's every 2 years on average or more or less, that's a general ballpark. So I think you're appropriately highlighting we have -- we generate a lot of operating cash flow. You saw that again in the first quarter. We will rebuild our cash over time. We're going to continue to invest in the pipeline. But at least in the short run, we don't expect any meaningful M&A in the short run. \nDaniel O'Day: And Salveen, this is Dan. Just to answer the end of your question. I mean, we're always therapeutic area agnostic when we approach these. I mean, first of all, we've got robust portfolios around both urology and oncology and a building portfolio in inflammation. So we look, frankly, across those spectrums. Seladelpar is a great example of finding an opportunity within our liver disease or -- franchise and be able to use that channel. But equally, we'll look for opportunities and synergies that complement our portfolio across therapeutic areas. And that's our approach. We think that makes sense. We look for the most attractive science. And as Andy said, we have a lot in our hands now to work through and to execute on. And so we'll keep the bar very high. \nOperator: Our next question comes from James Shin at Deutsche Bank. \nJames Shin: I wanted to ask on Trodelvy's efforts in HR+/HER2-. DESTINY-Breast06 is going to have data pretty soon it seems. And you also have ASCENT-07. Sort of sounds similar to DESTINY-Breast04 versus TROPiCS-02. Can you share like how you think this landscape will play out with these 2 trials? \nMerdad Parsey: Thanks for the question, James. Well, it's -- I've learned to try to keep away from prognostication. So that's harder to do. We -- look, maybe the way I would put it is we are proud of the fact that Trodelvy is still the only TROP2 ADC that is approved, and that is in large part driven by the important role that Trodelvy plays in breast cancer right now for patients. And we do continue to want to push that, along with the ASCENT-07. We have a number of other trials ongoing to expand our footprint in breast cancer. I think we are right now in TNBC, the leading regimen. \n And as we are continuing to advance our HR+/HER2- and in particular, in the IHC-0 population, I think we remain confident around our place there. We've shown a benefit in randomized clinical trials there, and that's been the basis for our regulatory filings and approvals. So I don't think we can assume success. We'll have to see what the data are. But looking forward into the year that's coming with ASCENT-03 coming up, I think that will provide us additional information to further expand our potential in breast cancer. Johanna, do you want to add? \nJohanna Mercier: Maybe just to add to that. I would also say that the more options these patients have, these women have, in HR+ in earlier lines of therapy instead of cycling through chemotherapies, the better. So with DB06 results and moving potentially that compound up earlier, it actually allows for Trodelvy to also play a more important and a bigger population than it is today because of the profile of the TROPiCS-02 label. And so we do believe that there's opportunities for this ADC to move up and also differentiate itself versus other ADCs in this marketplace, depends effect profile, the safety profile, not only on the efficacy. And so in light of the IHC-0 setting being really our strong foothold in HR+/HER2-, we believe that will continue, whether that's in later lines of therapy or earlier lines of these studies play out. \nOperator: Our Next question comes from Mohit Bansal, Wells Fargo. \nMohit Bansal: Maybe a big picture question, if you think about medium to longer term because, I mean, yes, you do not have an LOE. But I mean, HIV growth is somewhere around low single digits. And oncology, I mean, again, I mean, it dropped too and all. The expansion opportunities seem limited at this point. So just trying to understand how do you turn this low single digit to more like a high single-digit kind of growth for overall company? CymaBay is definitely an addition, but how are you thinking about it from medium to long term, which probably people like us are missing? \nDaniel O'Day: Mohit, maybe I'll start and then have others add. First of all, I think just stepping back and thinking about the portfolio that we've built over the past 4 years now more than doubling the size of the portfolio and with significant advances in our HIV portfolio and oncology and with outside of cell therapy. So as we think about growth moving forward, I mean, first of all, I would say on the HIV side of the business, we have to constantly remind ourselves and others that in addition to the treatment market and the potential for long-acting treatment that we have a very robust program on, and we'll update you a little bit more on towards the second half of this year with an analyst event, we've got the PrEP market that is just beginning to kind of be dimensionalized. \n And that is -- I think that provides significant growth opportunity when you think about your time frame, which you mentioned, which is until the end of the decade. So I think it allows us to think about accelerated HIV total growth prevention and treatment as we head towards the second half of the decade. That -- on top of that, then we have the entirety of the oncology portfolio. So both cell therapy within the large B-cell lymphoma area as well as potentially the multiple myeloma entry with the anito-cel. And then on top of that, a very robust oncology portfolio that has both Trodelvy and other novel agents that we'll read out over the course of this decade. And I'll just remind you, again, we've got close to 20 readouts this year, of which 3 of those are in Phase III, including lenacapavir for prep in the second half of this year, 2 Trodelvy Phase III readouts. And then importantly, we've added seladelpar to the mix with a PDUFA date in August. \n And then finally, just the opportunity to update you on the anito-cel at the end of the year as well. So we'll be providing more guidance as we continue to look at the entirety of our portfolio, but we really think we have within the company today, by the way, I'll just mention, in addition to complementing where needed from the outside. But within the company today, we have what it takes to drive a substantial growth in our business over the course of the next decade with focus on expense management as well to produce good returns for investors. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Baker at Redburn Atlantic. \nSimon Baker: One on seladelpar, if I may. And a question really around the competitive dynamics at launch. If all goes according to plan, your launch in August and Ipsen will launch Elafibranor in June. So I was just wondering if that really makes any difference. You've obviously got far greater infrastructure than Ipsen. Is it too early for them to steal in March? Or paradoxically thus having somebody else on the market promoting PBC actually raise disease awareness and help the situation? So any color around the dynamics at launch would be very helpful. \nJohanna Mercier: Thanks, Simon. It's Johanna. Let me take that one. And I think you're absolutely right. I think the fact that there is more than one competitor hitting the market is great for patients namely around increasing disease awareness around PDC and the fact that there are 2 options available. Having said that, I also feel incredibly confident that seladelpar is well differentiated to potentially be best in disease when you think about the significant impact and clinically meaningful impact we have with the ALP normalization in the clinical jet Phase III clinical trial we've seen as well as the improvement in pruritus which is a key symptom of the disease. And today, there really is no effective antipruritic options for PBC patients. And so all of that put together, in addition to the fact that we believe our footprint, both commercial and medical is incredibly well established when it comes to liver disease. It already covers about 80% of all U.S. PBC prescribers. And with that strong differentiated profile we were just referring to, I don't think those 3 months make a difference. I think really it's about best-in-class launch and that potential with seladelpar that we look forward for our PDUFA date. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Skorney at Baird. \nUnknown Analyst: This is Charlie on for Brian. So again, to ask something about seladelpar. Just wondering if you have any ambitions for potentially looking at a label for first line in the future, considering there's a lot of unmet need with pruritus there. As well as any potential synergies you may be considering with the remainder of your liver portfolio? \nMerdad Parsey: Thanks, Charlie. This is Merdad. Frontline is a challenge given the -- what is currently the background standard of care. But as you know, we think that seladelpar is going to bring a lot of benefit to a lot of patients, especially given the pruritus and the potential for getting to patients earlier in their course will be really important for us. And so we have to see how the market starts to respond to the presence of seladelpar in the second line. And recall, I think the other thing to recall or think about is the -- how long people actually get frontline therapy before moving on to second-line therapy, given the efficacy profile of the frontline therapies and the fact that there haven't been any options, one could anticipate that patients are moved to second-line therapy relatively early in their treatment course and making -- moving up formally for registrational trials to the frontline potentially superfluous. So I think we'll see how that plays out in the market. And once we see our label and all those sorts of things, so we'll be able to update more after that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams at RBC Capital Markets. \nBrian Abrahams: PURPOSE 1 is obviously an upcoming readout. So I wanted to clarify some elements of its unique design, specifically what's the sensitivity of assessing when HIV infection occurred to accurately project the control infection rate? And then how do you control for potential intrinsic differences in risk behavior that the screened out group serving as the control may have versus individuals who are -- who make it into the trial? \nMerdad Parsey: Brian, thanks, it's Merdad again. And I could talk about this for a long time. Let me -- I'll try to give a very concise answer. The recency assay that's been developed for HIV, it has been studied very thoroughly, and we can, based on the diagnosis at the time of screening, create a profile for anyone who's potentially HIV infected at that time as to how recently they were infected. And I think that's a key part. And that relates to the second part of your question in that the -- we don't, in a sense, need to compare risk behaviors before and after randomization and that we'll be looking at the overall incidence of HIV at the time of screening and then comparing in this counterfactual design with what happens after people start therapy. So I think between those 2 elements and all the discussions we've had with the regulators and the experts in the field, we're confident in that the design will provide the information necessary to get us to approval and for adoption. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn at Morgan Stanley. \nTerence Flynn: Great. Two parts on the CAR-T franchise. So just was wondering, high level, your comment to a anito-cel if it proves there is parkinsonism, so meaning it's less differentiated. And then the second part is, curious where your progress stands with respect to developing the CAR-T for immunology. Obviously, a lot of focus here amongst a number of other companies in the industry. So just curious on Gilead's thoughts on the [ floor ]. \nCindy Perettie: Thanks, Terence, for the question. So on the commitment to anito-cel, we're -- as it relates to Parkinson's, we absolutely feel that we're differentiated potentially on both safety and efficacy. As we noted earlier, we have not observed the neurotox that some of the other constructs have observed, and we'll continue to monitor it, but we feel great about the profile right now. And then the efficacy profile, early signals are we think we will be equivalent or could be best-in-class. So we're 100% behind anito-cel and we're looking forward to bringing those data soon. \n The second question around autoimmune space. So we continue to monitor the autoimmune space. And as you've heard from Andy and others before, we will play in that space. We are taking time to take a look at what's in the space versus what we have in our portfolio, and we'll be -- I don't have any updates further than that today. \nOperator: Our last question comes from Carter Gould at Barclays. \nCarter L. Gould: Maybe just to round things out on cell therapy, you flagged the same dynamics that have been kind of persisting in the U.S. as far as the -- some of the constraints of the ATCs. I also saw the Tennessee oncology reference. But I guess putting that all together, just your level of confidence you sort of hit that return to more meaningful growth in the second half of the year. I didn't hear that mentioned and clearly, that's a point of focus. Any commentary there would be appreciated. \nCindy Perettie: Yes. No, we feel very confident that we're going to return to growth in the second half of the year, as we stated. I think just as a reminder, we had shared in quarter 4 our guidance was that we'd be flat to slightly down in quarter 1. And part of that is due to the restructure. So we are putting our strategy into play. We feel very confident about the approach we're taking in the U.S. And we now are looking at having almost a fully stacked sales team back out and working hard. I think a piece that we need to talk about as well as the market dynamics. So the things we're observing. We're observing out-of-class competition with the bispecifics, the ATC constraints that we've spoken about in the past based on multiple myeloma constructs coming in. But what we're seeing is a lot of the hospitals and ATCs are working through those constraints, and we feel really confident about the second half of this year. \nDaniel O'Day: Thank you, Cindy. This is Dan again. So I appreciate all of you joining. Maybe just a bit of a summary statement. I want you all to know we at Gilead are very focused on the near-term execution and the long-term plans. We'll continue to stay disciplined and agile in our approach. Just as highlights, we've got 54 active clinical programs, no major patent expiries through the end of the decade, a variety of opportunities for growth and a lot more to deliver. On top of that, we are on track to provide updates from 3 Phase III clinical trials for Trodelvy, lenacapavir. We've got the seladelpar PDUFA date in August. Any update on the anito-cel Phase II update with the management we'll have at the end of the year. So rest assured that we are firmly focused on the many opportunities we have, and we have a lot more potential to deliver. With that, I'll hand over to Jacquie for closing comments. \nJacquie Ross: Thank you, Dan. To close, just one housekeeping item. I can share that we are tentatively planning to release our second quarter 2024 earnings results on Thursday, August 8. Please note that this is day is provisional and could be changed to accommodate scheduling conflicts that arise between now and then. As always, we will announce our confirmed date following the close of the second quarter. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the quarter. With that, we'll close our call for today. Thank you.",

            "name": "Merdad Parsey",
            "content": "Thank you, Johanna. We have had a busy first quarter at Gilead, with a cadence of clinical readouts that will continue throughout the rest of the year. Importantly, we anticipate an FDA regulatory decision on seladelpar and 3 Phase III updates across HIV prevention, bladder cancer, and breast cancer. \n Starting on Slide 17, we continue to progress our industry-leading Virology pipeline, which is building momentum following a data-rich presence at CROI in March. This included robust virologic suppression data from our once-daily oral combination of bictegravir with Lenacapavir from the Phase III portion of the ARTISTRY-1 trial. \n This novel combination has the potential to benefit people with HIV on complex regimens. We have since started 2 Phase III trials of this combination, one in virologically suppressed individuals and another in virologically suppressed treatment-experienced individuals. We expect to complete enrollment in the first half of 2025. \n We also have 2 once-weekly oral programs: first, a combination of lenacapavir with Merck's NRTTI, islatravir, in virologically suppressed people with HIV, expected to advance into Phase III later this year. And second, a combination of a capsid inhibitor with GS-1720, our novel oral integrase inhibitor. We're working to advance this combination into a Phase III study. This second program has the potential to be the first once-weekly oral regimen containing an INSTI agent. INSTIs are the standard-of-care treatment for HIV, and an important treatment option for clinicians who continue to prefer INSTI-based regimens.\n Finally, we presented Phase Ib data from our twice-yearly parenteral program of lenacapavir plus our 2 broadly neutralizing antibodies for people with HIV at CROI, and we intend to share data from the Phase III study in the second half of this year. \n Moving to PrEP, we plan to share an update from our Phase III PURPOSE-1 trial in the second half of this year. Data from PURPOSE-01, together with data from PURPOSE-2, is expected to support the filing of Lenacapavir for HIV prevention. This PrEP option would not only offer a convenient dosing schedule as the first twice-yearly subcutaneous regimen, but could also be transformative in terms of adherence to HIV prevention regimens. \n Turning to Slide 18. Our Trodelvy program continues to be evaluated across a range of solid tumors with 7 Phase 3 trials currently underway across breast, bladder, and metastatic non-small cell lung cancers with plans to start the Phase III trial in endometrial cancer later this year. \n Abstract titles were just released yesterday for the upcoming ASCO meeting, and we''re pleased to have over a dozen Oncology presentations this year. We will be presenting late-breaking Phase III data from our second-line plus metastatic non-small cell lung cancer trial, EVOKE-01. Updated data from first-line, PD-L1 high subjects in Cohort A of the Phase III EVOKE-02 trial will also be shared. We plan on providing updates from Cohorts C and D, evaluating Trodelvy plus pembro and chemotherapy in PD-L1 all-comers at a medical congress in the second half of this year. In addition, presentations for both the Phase III EDGE-Gastric trial and Phase III ARC-9 studies will be highlighted. \n Depending on the timing of event accruals, we anticipate 2 more Phase III updates this year for Trodelvy. These include overall survival data from our confirmatory Phase 3 bladder cancer study, TROPiCS-04, that could support Trodelvy's submission for full regulatory approval in the U.S. and enable ex-U.S. filings. \n In TNBC, where Trodelvy is the only ADC to have demonstrated statistically significant improvement in overall survival in the second-line setting, we expect to share an update on the Phase III ASCENT-03 trial in first-line PD-L1 negative patients later this year. \n Moving on to Cell Therapy. I''m pleased to share Kite's approach to the development of novel cell therapies that Cindy and the team presented at last month''s investor event. As you can see on slide 19 Yescarta and Tecartus established Kite as the leader in Cell Therapy, and we plan to potentially extend this leadership into multiple myeloma, while also paving the way for innovative next-generation constructs. \n On anito-cel in later-line multiple myeloma, we expect to provide a Phase III iMMagine-1 trial update in the second half of this year. This update follows the highly encouraging Phase I data presented at ASH last year, where anito-cel demonstrated durable responses with median progression-free survival not yet met at 26.5 months median follow-up \u2013and no cases of parkinsonian symptoms observed in the trial.\n For our next generation cell therapy assets, we have bicistronic and optimized manufacturing constructs in Phase I trials, which are aimed at overcoming resistance mechanisms, providing potentially deeper and more sustained responses, and improving product potency. Beyond that, we have early research in allogeneic and in vivo CAR, with plans to expand into a range of other disease areas \u2013such as multiple myeloma with anito-cel, solid tumors, and autoimmune diseases. \n Moving to Inflammation on Slide 20. We recently completed our acquisition of CymaBay and added seladelpar, an investigational PPAR-delta agonist to our portfolio. In Phase III clinical trials, seladelpar demonstrated significant improvement in both pruritus and markers of cholestasis related to the risk of progression for PBC. As previously announced, FDA and EMA accepted our regulatory filings for seladelpar for the management of PBC in certain adult patients. We anticipate an FDA regulatory decision by August 14th and a decision from European regulators early next year. We continue to work with global regulatory authorities to expand the reach of seladelpar for PBC patients. \n Further, as we look at the rest of our Inflammation pipeline, we have several early phase assets that have progressed into Phase II trials, including our potentially first-in-class oral TPL2 inhibitor, a potentially best-in-class oral alpha-4-beta-7 anti-integrin, and an oral IRAK4 inhibitor. \n Wrapping up on Slide 21. We continue to progress on our clinical milestones for the year, and we have had 2 First Patients in and 1 data readout completed in the first quarter and we remain on-track for our remaining milestones. \n And now, I''ll hand the call over to Andy. Thanks, Umer. Let me start by saying we think seladelpar is one of those medicines that will bring a lot of benefit to patients and really some near-term expansion of our liver portfolio and our -- and what we think will synergize with many of the other -- much of the other work that we're doing in liver disease overall. \n We obviously did thorough diligence in our approach to seladelpar and CymaBay. We didn't do a third -- I think your question was around whether we did an independent third-party review of the pathology. We did not do that. However, we did a lot of thorough diligence on the data itself and the outcomes. And we are confident around the outcome and what it means for patients over time. \n Obviously, we're waiting right now the -- our upcoming PDUFA date and also the file in the EMA, which we are optimistic about. And following the questions and all those sorts of items that we're in. So we're looking forward to providing an update on that as those filings proceed. Thanks, Tyler, it's Merdad again here. So it's a little challenging because I can't share too many details now because we're under embargo for both of those. And obviously, happy to fill in a lot of the blanks once the data are released, and we can talk about it in ASCO. I think for EVOKE-01, we think there are a number of pipeline updates in our ASCO presentations that we have upcoming, which were -- we see as a real change for us and a real evolution of our pipeline overall and our ability to build our oncology pipeline and bring new options for patients. \n As part of the late breaker session for EVOKE-01, as you mentioned, we will include data on overall survival, on PFS, ORR and duration of response as well as the safety profile, of course. And I wish I could give you more details, but I can't at this point. As you say, we will also be providing other updates there, including the EVOKE-02 Cohort A data looking at the PD-L1 high non-small cell population. And again, it's -- I can't really talk about the details of those data, but we are looking forward to sharing those results with everyone and talking about the implications of that for our broader lung cancer and especially the frontline lung cancer EVOKE-03 study that we are conducting right now is underway with our partners at Merck. Thanks, Michael. This is Merdad again. As we've noted, I think, and as you talked about, the EVOKE-01 data in second line will be something that we discuss at ASCO and show those data. And the full data set is -- does motivate us to go forward in lung cancer and including with discussions with regulators. The unmet need in this population is great, and the data give us options, including discussions with health authorities and conducting follow-up trials. We'll be able to share more once the data are provided at ASCO, and so we look forward to having those deeper discussions once we can speak directly to the data. \n And I'm sorry, and the second part of your question was around the front line. Again, I think once we are able to share the EVOKE-02 data, the update on EVOKE-02 data, we'll be able to talk more. But it does continue to allow us to think about the frontline and our confidence around about EVOKE-03. And then the last part of your question on other combinations. We do think about our intra-portfolio combinations. For example, we have a combination of dambinelumab and Trodelvy in a trial where we're looking to see if we can get additional efficacy from those sorts of combinations. So we do continuously look at our portfolio and look for opportunities for moving the needle with combinations from within our portfolio. Thanks for the question, James. Well, it's -- I've learned to try to keep away from prognostication. So that's harder to do. We -- look, maybe the way I would put it is we are proud of the fact that Trodelvy is still the only TROP2 ADC that is approved, and that is in large part driven by the important role that Trodelvy plays in breast cancer right now for patients. And we do continue to want to push that, along with the ASCENT-07. We have a number of other trials ongoing to expand our footprint in breast cancer. I think we are right now in TNBC, the leading regimen. \n And as we are continuing to advance our HR+/HER2- and in particular, in the IHC-0 population, I think we remain confident around our place there. We've shown a benefit in randomized clinical trials there, and that's been the basis for our regulatory filings and approvals. So I don't think we can assume success. We'll have to see what the data are. But looking forward into the year that's coming with ASCENT-03 coming up, I think that will provide us additional information to further expand our potential in breast cancer. Johanna, do you want to add? Thanks, Charlie. This is Merdad. Frontline is a challenge given the -- what is currently the background standard of care. But as you know, we think that seladelpar is going to bring a lot of benefit to a lot of patients, especially given the pruritus and the potential for getting to patients earlier in their course will be really important for us. And so we have to see how the market starts to respond to the presence of seladelpar in the second line. And recall, I think the other thing to recall or think about is the -- how long people actually get frontline therapy before moving on to second-line therapy, given the efficacy profile of the frontline therapies and the fact that there haven't been any options, one could anticipate that patients are moved to second-line therapy relatively early in their treatment course and making -- moving up formally for registrational trials to the frontline potentially superfluous. So I think we'll see how that plays out in the market. And once we see our label and all those sorts of things, so we'll be able to update more after that. Brian, thanks, it's Merdad again. And I could talk about this for a long time. Let me -- I'll try to give a very concise answer. The recency assay that's been developed for HIV, it has been studied very thoroughly, and we can, based on the diagnosis at the time of screening, create a profile for anyone who's potentially HIV infected at that time as to how recently they were infected.

            "name": "Daniel O'Day",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to start by thanking the Gilead teams for delivering a strong first quarter, which you see in our commercial performance and our clinical execution. Total product sales, excluding Veklury, grew 6% year-over-year to $6.1 billion, driven by higher demand across HIV, oncology and liver disease. Veklury sales continue to track with the rates of hospitalization for COVID-19 and reached a total of $555 million.  \n Once again, sales growth for the quarter reflected the diversity of our portfolio. HIV product sales grew 4% year-over-year. Oncology product sales were up 18%, driven by Trodelvy, which is well established as the #1 regimen for second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and by our transformative cell therapies. As we outlined at the recent Kite analyst event in Maryland, we have exciting plans to build on our clear market leadership in cell therapy, such as expand into community networks in the U.S., more than double our manufacturing capacity, and move into new indications and disease areas with next-generation products.  \n From an EPS perspective, first quarter results reflect the close of the CymaBay acquisition with an inquired IP R&D charge of $3.9 billion or an expense of $3.14 per share. Excluding this charge, non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $1.82 for the first quarter, which is above expectations, driven by higher product sales. The CymaBay acquisition brings us an important registrational medicine, seladelpar, which has the potential to address significant unmet need in liver disease. We have filed for regulatory approval of seladelpar as a treatment for primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC, with both FDA and EMA, and we expect an FDA regulatory decision in August.  \n If approved, we will leverage our industry-leading commercial infrastructure and long-standing expertise in liver disease to bring seladelpar a potentially transformative therapy to people with PBC who might benefit. Moving to clinical execution. We're very pleased with momentum in our HIV pipeline, which was reflected in our 80 data abstracts at CROI. Based on the strength of the data, we've initiated Phase III trials for bictegravir and lenacapavir, our novel once-daily oral regimen, and plan to advance once weekly oral programs, including lenacapavir plus islatravir into Phase III.\n Later this year, we will host an HIV analyst event to share details of how we will further shape the HIV landscape with innovative options for prevention and treatment, including the next wave of long-acting therapies. \n Before I pass it to Johanna, I will briefly recap our 2024 milestones on Slide 6. We have already achieved first patient in for the Phase III ARTISTRY-1 and ARTISTRY-2 trials, evaluating once-daily lenacapavir in combination with bictegravir as well as Phase II first patient in for SWIFT evaluating GS-1427, our oral alpha-4-beta-7 inhibitor. We are also on track for our upcoming milestones, including updates from 3 Phase III clinical trials for Trodelvy and lenacapavir.  \n Looking ahead to the rest of 2024, this is a time of focused execution for Gilead. We will see disciplined and agile in our approach, and we will focus the organization on both near-term execution and longer-term plans. With 54 clinical programs in play, no major patent expiration for the decade and many opportunities for growth, we have a lot of potential and a lot to deliver. \n My thanks again to the Gilead teams for their great work this quarter and the ongoing progress across our diverse portfolio of therapies. With that, I'll hand it over to Johanna. Great, Chris. Welcome, everybody. This is Dan. I'm going to have Johanna cover this question. Thank you. Thanks, Daina. We've got Cindy Perettie here, so we'll go right over to her. Merdad is here, so I'll let him answer. Thanks, Geoff. This is Dan. We're going to have Cindy Perettie answer that question, if you don't mind. So Cindy, over to you. And Salveen, this is Dan. Just to answer the end of your question. I mean, we're always therapeutic area agnostic when we approach these. I mean, first of all, we've got robust portfolios around both urology and oncology and a building portfolio in inflammation. So we look, frankly, across those spectrums. Seladelpar is a great example of finding an opportunity within our liver disease or -- franchise and be able to use that channel. But equally, we'll look for opportunities and synergies that complement our portfolio across therapeutic areas. And that's our approach. We think that makes sense. We look for the most attractive science. And as Andy said, we have a lot in our hands now to work through and to execute on. And so we'll keep the bar very high. Mohit, maybe I'll start and then have others add. First of all, I think just stepping back and thinking about the portfolio that we've built over the past 4 years now more than doubling the size of the portfolio and with significant advances in our HIV portfolio and oncology and with outside of cell therapy. So as we think about growth moving forward, I mean, first of all, I would say on the HIV side of the business, we have to constantly remind ourselves and others that in addition to the treatment market and the potential for long-acting treatment that we have a very robust program on, and we'll update you a little bit more on towards the second half of this year with an analyst event, we've got the PrEP market that is just beginning to kind of be dimensionalized. \n And that is -- I think that provides significant growth opportunity when you think about your time frame, which you mentioned, which is until the end of the decade. So I think it allows us to think about accelerated HIV total growth prevention and treatment as we head towards the second half of the decade. That -- on top of that, then we have the entirety of the oncology portfolio. So both cell therapy within the large B-cell lymphoma area as well as potentially the multiple myeloma entry with the anito-cel. And then on top of that, a very robust oncology portfolio that has both Trodelvy and other novel agents that we'll read out over the course of this decade. And I'll just remind you, again, we've got close to 20 readouts this year, of which 3 of those are in Phase III, including lenacapavir for prep in the second half of this year, 2 Trodelvy Phase III readouts. And then importantly, we've added seladelpar to the mix with a PDUFA date in August. \n And then finally, just the opportunity to update you on the anito-cel at the end of the year as well. So we'll be providing more guidance as we continue to look at the entirety of our portfolio, but we really think we have within the company today, by the way, I'll just mention, in addition to complementing where needed from the outside. But within the company today, we have what it takes to drive a substantial growth in our business over the course of the next decade with focus on expense management as well to produce good returns for investors. Thank you, Cindy. This is Dan again. So I appreciate all of you joining. Maybe just a bit of a summary statement. I want you all to know we at Gilead are very focused on the near-term execution and the long-term plans. We'll continue to stay disciplined and agile in our approach.

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Andrew Dickinson",
            "content": "Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Beginning on Slide 23. It was a strong start to the year with our base business up 6% year-overyear. The solid growth achieved across HIV, Oncology, and Liver Disease offset the decline in Veklury, with total product sales up 5% year-over-year to $6.6 billion. As expected, our base business was down quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonal inventory and pricing dynamics in HIV. \n Moving beyond our revenue results, 2 items significantly impacted our EPS performance in the first quarter, as shown on Slide 24. First, our GAAP and non-GAAP results included an acquired IPR&D charge of $3.9 billion or $3.14 per share, associated with the close of the CymaBay acquisition. As an asset acquisition, this transaction was fully expensed in the first quarter. This was a nondeductible expense item, and as a result, impacted our effective tax rate. Excluding this expense, our non-GAAP EPS would have been $1.82 for the first quarter, above expectations primarily driven by higher sales. \n The second item shown on the right hand side is an impairment charge that is included in our GAAP results and excluded from our non-GAAP results. As a reminder, this relates to the carrying value of the IPR&D indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired from Immunomedics. \n At the end of 2023, the carrying value was $5.9 billion, all associated with non-small cell lung cancer. As a result of the EVOKE-01 readout in late January, we have re-assessed and reduced the remaining value to $3.5 billion. This primarily reflects the smaller addressable market that Trodelvy could serve among 2L+ metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients, a delay in expected launch timing, and associated competitive activity. \n We remain confident that Trodelvy will deliver attractive returns over time, with sales now exceeding $1 billion a year, a strong IP portfolio, and a development program with multiple shots-on-goal in new indications as well as earlier-lines of therapy, including some opportunities not included in the initial deal model. In the meantime, you can see that the impairment impacted our first quarter GAAP EPS by $1.46 per share. \n Moving to the rest of our non-GAAP results on Slide 25. For the first quarter, product gross margin was down modestly to 85.4%, primarily due to product mix. R&D and SG&A were each down 2% year-over-year. This is the second consecutive quarter of operating expense declines on a year-over-year basis, reflecting our continued focus on disciplined expense management. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was a negative 30%, reflecting the nondeductibility of the CymaBay acquired IPR&D charge. \n Overall, our diluted earnings per share was a negative $1.32 compared to a positive $1.37 for the same period last year, primarily reflecting the $3.14 per share expense related to the CymaBay acquisition. \n Switching to full-year guidance on Slide 26. There is no change to our revenue expectations for 2024 at this time. We continue to expect total product sales in the range of $27.1 to $27.5 billion; and we continue to expect total product sales, excluding Veklury, in the range of $25.8 to $26.2 billion, representing growth of 4% to 6% for our base business year-over-year. Additionally, there is no change to our Veklury guidance of approximately $1.3 billion for the full year. As discussed last quarter, we do not expect to update our Veklury guidance until our third quarter earnings call, absent a very clear trend in COVID-19 infections. \n Shifting to the other parts of the P&L for 2024 on a non-GAAP basis. There is no change to our gross margin guidance where we continue to expect product gross margin in the range of 85% to 86%. We now expect R&D to grow at the higher end of our previous low-to-mid single digit growth range, reflecting the incremental expenses associated with the CymaBay acquisition. \n We continue to expect SG&A expenses to decline a mid-single digit percentage relative to 2023. On a dollar basis, SG&A is expected to be modestly higher than our previous SG&A expectations as we incorporate CymaBay expenses. However, we can manage this within the window of the previously-issued operating expense guidance. Acquired IPR&D is now expected to be approximately $4.4B, due to the CymaBay transaction as well as milestones anticipated throughout the rest of the year.  \n Operating income is now expected in the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion, reflecting the updated acquired IPR&D guidance and the modest increase to operating expenses associated with the CymaBay transaction. Given the non-deductible impact of the CymaBay acquisition, the effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be approximately 30%. This includes a negative impact of approximately 11% from the one-time charge for the acquisition of CymaBay. We therefore now expect diluted EPS in the range of $3.45 to $3.85. As shown on Slide 27, this has only been updated to reflect the transactions that were closed in the first quarter of 2024. Excluding these charges, you can see that we are comfortably within the range of the EPS guidance we shared back in early February. On a GAAP basis, we expect full year 2024 diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.10 and $0.50. \n Moving to Slide 28. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with sufficient flexibility in our balance sheet. Specifically, as demonstrated in the first quarter, we announced a 2.7% increase to our quarterly dividend and returned approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders. In addition, we acquired CymaBay for $4.3 billion, adding seladelpar to our portfolio. Overall, we''ll continue to be disciplined in our use of capital. And while we will continue to be flexible and opportunistic\u2013, it is unlikely that Gilead will be engaging in any sizeable M&A transactions in the near-term. \n Before I wrap it up, on Slide 29, a quick note on our expectations now that the CymaBay transaction has closed. Pending regulatory approval, we expect to launch seladelpar in the U.S. before the end of 2024, as Johanna highlighted earlier, with a modest revenue contribution expected this year. \n Additionally, we have shared that the transaction is expected to add to operating expenses this year as we make incremental investments to support the launch as well as other R&D efforts, all of which we are able to manage within the window of the previously-issued operating expense guidance. \n And as we look ahead, while the transaction will be dilutive to our EPS this year, we expect the deal to be breakeven to earnings in 2025, and significantly accretive in 2026 onwards. \n And now, I''ll invite Rebecca to begin the Q&A. Chris, it's Andy. I'll take the question on margin expansion. As you know, we don't provide more specific guidance for 2025 beyond what Johanna just mentioned. What we have said historically, and I've underscored, is that we are very focused on disciplined expense management. That will be true in 2025 as it is today. You've seen that in the last 2 quarters. I think on a non-GAAP basis for this quarter, if you look at our operating margin, if you strip out the CymaBay transaction, you see an improvement in our operating margin and we expect that to continue over time. So we do expect broadly for our operating margin to improve over time as you see the continued top line growth and the disciplined expense management. So thanks for the question. More details, of course, to be provided at early next year when we provide our 2025 guidance specifically. Salveen, it's Andy. Maybe I'll start with that one. In our prepared remarks, I highlighted that in the near term, we don't expect sizable M&A.\n So we have a lot of execution ahead of us. We have a deep portfolio, a lot of growth drivers, including seladelpar. So we're very clearly highlighting that in the short term, we will continue to do ordinary course business development, the standard licensing deals. You saw a couple of those in the first quarter. But it's unlikely that we'd pursue any meaningful M&A in the near term. We've also said historically that deals like CymaBay are exactly what we're looking for and that we should do deals like that on a regular basis over the cycle and whether that's every 2 years on average or more or less, that's a general ballpark. So I think you're appropriately highlighting we have -- we generate a lot of operating cash flow. You saw that again in the first quarter. We will rebuild our cash over time. We're going to continue to invest in the pipeline. But at least in the short run, we don't expect any meaningful M&A in the short run."

            "content": "Thanks, Daina. So if I start off with the early line ODAC, I think we believe this is positive for everybody. What it's shown is that people recognize the value of having CAR Ts therapies earlier in their disease. They value the disease-free intervals that they get from that. So we were very happy to see that. I think we were equally as excited to see the second ODAC around MRD, minimal residual disease, as a secondary -- as an additional endpoint. I think the piece around this is that we're really encouraged that the ODAC decision is going to open up the door for us to potentially bring anito-cel to market faster for patients. And we're in the process right now of understanding how the MRD surrogate endpoint can be used with regulatory agencies and the application of our program and so more to come on that front. So we have 3 products right now, or 3 constructs that are in Phase Ia and b clinical trials. The first one is a bicistronic CD19, CD20 that has 41BB and CD28. The second one is that same construct with fast manufacturing, 3-day manufacturing. And the other one is a CD19 like Yescarta with 3-day manufacturing. So we're looking at all 3 of those in parallel with the goal of picking the winner to advance that rapidly into our pivotal trials. So that's what's coming up next. Obviously, we've shared a lot around anito-cel as well. With anito-cel, we have the iMMagine-1 readout, and we expect to move quickly into earlier lines as it relates to anito-cel, and you'll hear more about that later this year. Hopefully, that answers your question. We certainly have a number of plays in early research, but we would plan to advance our next-generation lymphoma assets quickly. And obviously, with the scale that we have at Kite as well as the integrated fact that we can create the vector as well as the construct in-house. Thanks, Terence, for the question. So on the commitment to anito-cel, we're -- as it relates to Parkinson's, we absolutely feel that we're differentiated potentially on both safety and efficacy. As we noted earlier, we have not observed the neurotox that some of the other constructs have observed, and we'll continue to monitor it, but we feel great about the profile right now. And then the efficacy profile, early signals are we think we will be equivalent or could be best-in-class. So we're 100% behind anito-cel and we're looking forward to bringing those data soon. \n The second question around autoimmune space. So we continue to monitor the autoimmune space. And as you've heard from Andy and others before, we will play in that space. We are taking time to take a look at what's in the space versus what we have in our portfolio, and we'll be -- I don't have any updates further than that today. Yes. No, we feel very confident that we're going to return to growth in the second half of the year, as we stated. I think just as a reminder, we had shared in quarter 4 our guidance was that we'd be flat to slightly down in quarter 1. And part of that is due to the restructure. So we are putting our strategy into play. We feel very confident about the approach we're taking in the U.S. And we now are looking at having almost a fully stacked sales team back out and working hard. I think a piece that we need to talk about as well as the market dynamics. So the things we're observing. We're observing out-of-class competition with the bispecifics, the ATC constraints that we've spoken about in the past based on multiple myeloma constructs coming in. But what we're seeing is a lot of the hospitals and ATCs are working through those constraints, and we feel really confident about the second half of this year."

            "name": "Johanna Mercier",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan, and Good after noon, everyone. With the first quarter marking the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for our base business, our teams delivered a strong start to 2024, notably navigating the seasonal first quarter dynamics and establishing a firm base on which we can continue to build this year. \n Beginning on Slide 8, total product sales, excluding Veklury, were $6.1 billion for the first quarter, up 6% year-one, reflecting solid growth of our HIV, oncology and liver disease businesses. Including Veklury, total product sales were $6.6 billion, up 5% year-over-year.  \n Moving to HIV on Slide 9. Sales were up 4% year-over-year to $4.3 billion, primarily driven by higher demand as well as favorable pricing dynamics in Europe that are not expected to repeat. Quarter-over-quarter sales were down 7%, driven by the typical seasonality we experienced in the first quarter of the year, partially offset by higher demand. As a reminder, quarterly HIV growth is, in general, more variable and less indicative of overall trends than the full year. This is evident in the first quarter of every year where inventory drawdown typically occurs following a build that generally happens towards the end of the prior year and patient co-pays and deductibles start of every year, and together with shifts in channel mix lowers average realized price in the first quarter.  \n As always, we typically see these quarterly pricing and inventory dynamics normalize as we progress throughout the year. We continue to expect approximately 4% HIV sales growth for 2024. Supporting that outlook, the treatment market grew in line with our expectations, as shown on Slide 10. Biktarvy remains the leading regimen for HIV treatment across major markets for new starts as well as for those switching regimens with sales up 10% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, reflecting strong demand.  \n Quarter-over-quarter, sales were down 5% as the higher demand was offset by the typical seasonal factors discussed earlier. It's notable that 6 years after launch, Biktarvy continues to gain market share in the U.S. up 3 percentage points year-over-year to approximately 49% share and once again, outpacing all other branded regimens for HIV treatment. Moreover, we continue to see Biktarvy's benefit extend into broader populations of people with HIV. Most recently, Biktarvy was granted FDA approval for use in virologically suppressed individuals with known or suspected M184 resistance, a common form of treatment resistance.  \n Turning to prevention. Descovy sales were down 5% year-over-year to $426 million, driven by lower average realized price due to channel mix, partially offset by higher demand. Sequentially, sales were down 16%, reflecting the seasonal dynamics discussed earlier, partially offset by higher demand. While market volumes in February were temporarily disrupted by the cyberattack on Change Healthcare, volumes readily recovered in March. Overall, the PrEP market continued to demonstrate robust growth, up over 11% in the first quarter, with Descovy maintaining over 40%  PrEP market share in the U.S. despite the availability of other regimens, including generics. \n This is a solid setup as we look to potentially launch lenacapavir as early as late next year as the first and only twice yearly subcutaneous prevention option. Given Gilead's strong commercial foundation across treatment and prevention, we are well positioned to maintain leadership in HIV as we look to the evolving marketplace of daily orals, long-acting orals and long-acting injectables. \n Moving to liver disease on Slide 11. Sales for the first quarter were $737 million, up 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable inventory dynamics and the timing of purchases by the Department of Corrections for our HCV products as well as higher demand across HCV, HBV and HDV. Sequentially, sales were up 7%, primarily reflecting the timing of HCV purchases.  \n Despite fewer HCV starts globally year-over-year, our viral hepatitis portfolio overall has remained stable and continues to be a meaningful contributor to our commercial performance. This strength is underpinned by our extensive global footprint and expertise in the treatment of liver diseases. To that end, pending approval, Gilead is excited to bring seladelpar to patients for the treatment of certain adults with PBC, impacting approximately 130,000 people in the U.S. and about 125,000 people in Europe. With the sales force that covers almost 80% of the U.S. prescriber base for PBC, we expect to readily make seladelpar available to patients upon approval in the second half of this year.  \n Seladelpar has demonstrated the potential to be best-in-class with a differentiated clinical profile to existing and emerging therapies, particularly on a key symptom of the disease, pruritus. Following its launch in 2024, we expect seladelpar to contribute modestly to sales and more meaningfully in 2025 and beyond.  \n Turning to Slide 12. Veklury continues to be the standard of care antiviral for hospitalized patients treated with COVID-19, with market share well over 60% in the United States. COVID-related hospitalizations were lower in the first quarter with the winter wave peaking earlier than expected in the U.S. and Europe as compared to other regions such as Japan. As a result, Veklury sales overall were down 3% year-over-year and down 23% sequentially to $555 million.  \n Shifting to oncology on Slide 13. Sales were up 18% year-over-year to $789 million and are now firmly above a $3 billion annual run rate. Having treated over 50,000 patients to date, we look forward to bringing our portfolio of medicines and future treatments across lines of therapies and tumor types to many more patients around the world. \n Moving to Slide 14. Trodelvy sales for the first quarter exceeded $300 million, up 39% year-over-year, reflecting continued demand. Sequentially, sales were up 3%, primarily driven by demand outside the U.S. as well as unfavorable fourth quarter pricing dynamics in Europe that did not repeat. This was partially offset by inventory dynamics in the U.S. where we saw a drawdown in the first quarter. \n Overall, Trodelvy''s strong market share reflects its awareness amongst providers and patients. In second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, Trodelvy remains the leading regimen with approximately 1/3 in the U.S. And in the pre-treated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer setting, Trodelvy has demonstrated continued adoption, most notably in the IHC0 setting. \n We are confident Trodelvy continues to differentiate itself with its safety profile and clinically meaningful survival benefits, with over 30,000 patients across tumor types already treated to date. We look forward to potentially extending Trodelvy's reach to many more patients in the years ahead particularly in bladder cancer, earlier-line breast cancer settings, and lung cancer. \n Turning to Slide 15, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, Cell Therapy sales were $480 million in the first quarter, up 7% year-over-year. Sequentially, sales were up 3%, in-line with our guidance of flat to slightly up. We''re pleased to see continued demand for Yescarta and Tecartus in both existing and new markets across Europe and other geographies, such as in Japan where we have seen good progress in growing brand share and expanding our network of authorized treatment centers to over 20 to date. \n In the U.S., and consistent with our recent updates, we see opportunity for growth through expanding the number of authorized treatment centers and affiliated satellites, while also driving increased referrals from the community setting.\n For example, we're proud to have established our flagship community collaboration with Tennessee Oncology in the first quarter. We''ve identified many critical learnings on how we can partner effectively with community oncology practices for cell therapy, and we will continue to refine this \u201cblueprint\u201d so that we become more efficient at onboarding new centers over time. We expect to start seeing the Impact from this initiative towards the end of 2024. \n Wrapping up the first quarter, we had a strong start to the year, primarily driven by higher demand across each of our core businesses year-over-year. \n We look forward to carrying this momentum through 2024 and as we bring seladelpar to market later this year following approval. I'd like to thank the commercial teams and cross-functional partners across Gilead and Kite for their strong execution as we diligently expand our therapies to new populations, positively impacting more people all around the world. \n And with that, I''ll hand the call over to Merdad. Thanks, Chris, for the question. So we do expect an impact of the Part D redesign to be weighted towards our HIV business and expect our HIV growth in 2025 to be offset by the Part D redesign impact. So as a result, we expect our HIV sales to be roughly flat year-on-year in 2025. Having said that, overall, we expect our total business to grow despite the impact of the Part D we designed in 2025 with the top line, building momentum in 2020 -- beyond 2025, right, '26 and beyond. So we do expect growth in '25, but our HIV business, the demand of HIV will offset the impact of Part D. Maybe just to add to that. I would also say that the more options these patients have, these women have, in HR+ in earlier lines of therapy instead of cycling through chemotherapies, the better. So with DB06 results and moving potentially that compound up earlier, it actually allows for Trodelvy to also play a more important and a bigger population than it is today because of the profile of the TROPiCS-02 label. And so we do believe that there's opportunities for this ADC to move up and also differentiate itself versus other ADCs in this marketplace, depends effect profile, the safety profile, not only on the efficacy. And so in light of the IHC-0 setting being really our strong foothold in HR+/HER2-, we believe that will continue, whether that's in later lines of therapy or earlier lines of these studies play out. Thanks, Simon. It's Johanna. Let me take that one. And I think you're absolutely right. I think the fact that there is more than one competitor hitting the market is great for patients namely around increasing disease awareness around PDC and the fact that there are 2 options available. Having said that, I also feel incredibly confident that seladelpar is well differentiated to potentially be best in disease when you think about the significant impact and clinically meaningful impact we have with the ALP normalization in the clinical jet Phase III clinical trial we've seen as well as the improvement in pruritus which is a key symptom of the disease. And today, there really is no effective antipruritic options for PBC patients. And so all of that put together, in addition to the fact that we believe our footprint, both commercial and medical is incredibly well established when it comes to liver disease. It already covers about 80% of all U.S. PBC prescribers. And with that strong differentiated profile we were just referring to, I don't think those 3 months make a difference. I think really it's about best-in-class launch and that potential with seladelpar that we look forward for our PDUFA date."
