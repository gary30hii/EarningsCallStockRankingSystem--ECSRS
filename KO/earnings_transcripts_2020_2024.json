[Operator Instructions] All participants will be on listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and therefore questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President and Investor Relations, Financial Planning and Analysis. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.\nTim Leveridge: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that we posted schedules under the Financial Reports and Information tab in the Investors section of our company website at www.coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. I'd also like to note that you can find additional materials in the Investors section of our company website that provide the accompanying slides for today's discussion and an analysis of our margin structure. In addition, this conference may contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent SEC report. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then re-enter the queue. Now, I will turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin today's call by reflecting on the past year including our fourth quarter performance. Then, let's turn the page and look at the New Year. I'll provide thoughts on the current environment and how we will continue to manage through near term volatility. Finally, I will share how we're thinking about the year ahead and why we remain confident about the future. John, will then discuss the quarter and our outlook in more detail. Now before we dive in, I'd like to address our U.S. income tax dispute with the Internal Revenue Service, including both the case and the opinion that was issued by the U.S. Tax Court in November. We believe that the tax court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in its conclusions. We intend to assert our claims on appeal and vigorously defend our position. We've consulted with outside advisors, and conducted comprehensive analysis. We've considered all relevant information including the unconstitutionality of the IRS's retroactive imposition of tax liability. Putting this all together, we believe we will ultimately prevail on appeal. John will provide insight into the range of risks we see, should the case not go in our favor. I also encourage you to refer to Exhibit 99.2 in the Form 8-K we filed this morning for the updated disclosure. The tax matter is clearly important, and we are dedicating ample resources to its resolution, but it is likely to take some time. We remain steadfastly focused on delivering growth in our business, and driving long-term value for our stakeholders. In 2020, we faced significant challenges posed by the global pandemic. Our company proved resilience, moving with agility to adapt our business and accelerate our strategic transformation. Our work isn't done. And I recognize and appreciate the ongoing support, dedication and progress from our people and our system. Turning to the fourth quarter, we saw improving trends through November, but a resurgence in the virus drove renewed lockdowns in many parts of the world. The rise in restrictions impacted our recovery in many markets, resulting in a modest deceleration in volume in December, which is continued year-to-date with volume currently down mid-single digits. Speaking generally, trends are still tied to our exposure to away from home, coupled with a level of lockdown, but our business has become more durable compared to the spring of 2020, based on the learnings and actions we have taken. Our teams around the world have applied these learnings from the peak of the crisis to better navigate short term setbacks. Globally in the fourth quarter, progress remained mixed and even within regions, there was ongoing recovery as well as challenges. For example, in Asia-Pacific, countries are at different stages. In China, we are indeed emerging stronger, thanks to our strategic actions with Q4 share gains to complement our 2020 share gains in both on and off premise. Japan drove incremental transactions through their price pack decoupling, but soft traffic in vending continued pressure mix. In India, challenges remain, but at home trends was strong, and we saw signs of recovery in away from home channels through the holidays. EMEA showed resilience despite experiencing varying levels of lockdown through the quarter, driving a dispersion in results between developed and developing markets. Western Europe was the most affected by the resurgence, while West Africa and Turkey showed positive momentum. In North America, away from home volumes were impacted by multiple states restricting bars and banning indoor dining. Sparkling water trends remained robust with the expansion of AHA and Topo Chico mineral water, as well as simply and fairlife also performing well. In Latin America, trends were strong early in the quarter, but slowed in December due to restrictions and less stimulus support. Single-serve is recovering as a percentage of mix in our business, a multi-serve refillables grew at a double digit pace. Brazil's results remained strong, and Mexico improved sequentially. In global ventures, despite the headwind of renewed UK lockdowns impacting our Costa retail stores, express machines performed well. We continued expansion in China, Japan and further into Europe and our Testing Express and Proud to Serve platforms, along with the launch of costacoffee.com in the U.S. Our Bottling Investment Group further improved operating margin performance and made progress on cooler productivity, and SKU rationalization. Almost all markets gained or maintained share with Vietnam achieving its highest ever sparkling share. From a category perspective, we saw relative outperformance for sparkling in the fourth quarter. Trademark Coke delivered 1% volume growth, delivered by as zero sugar offerings which were up 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. While our overall market share performance continued to be impacted by channel mix, as our highest share away from home business remains pressured. We did gain underlying value in both at home and away from home channels. We are poised to emerge stronger in both channels due to our actions to support customers and to ensure seamless execution from a supply chain perspective. Thinking about 2021, there is no doubt the near term trajectory of our recovery will still be impacted by the presence of the virus in most markets. It is still early days in the vaccination process, and we'd expect to see further improvements in our business as vaccinations become more widely available over the coming months. It's clear that the pace and availability of vaccines will look different around the world, and therefore we'll likely see some level of asynchronous recovery, depending both on vaccine distribution and other macroeconomic factors. Amidst this backdrop, we will ensure that the system remains flexible to adjust the near term uncertainties, while at the same time, continuing to push forward on initiatives we have championed to emerge stronger. So let me touch briefly on our progress against several initiatives today, and we'll provide further detail on these as well as other important business drivers at our Virtual Cagny presentation next week. Our networked organization is coming together and creating empowerment through clear decision rights and accountability. We have our overall operating unit and global category team structures, and are already changing the way we work. We've established a new platform services organization, 9 hubs are currently being stood up. Our ultimate goal is to scale our resources and capabilities to drive value and growth, including investing in new consumer analytics and digital tools. As we go through the transformation, we are ensuring that we have a diverse and equitable representation across our global workforce. Our long term profitable growth will be powered by our optimized brand portfolio. We've streamlined our portfolio from 400 to 200 master brands, allowing global category teams to identify the greatest opportunities and allocate investments accordingly. These targeted investments will leverage our leader brands more effectively, and convert Challenger and Explorer brands into leaders more quickly and consistently. Additionally, our portfolio streamlining allows us to focus attention on resources on what we do best, brand building and innovation. This will make room for more consumer centric products down the road. Great brand building begins with a deep understanding of our consumer that converts into superior quality products. To enhance our marketing effectiveness, we are building targeted experiential campaigns that are data driven and occasion-based and always on. We are eager to share upcoming work generated by this new marketing model including our first ever global Sprite Campaign, is called \"Let's be clear\", it invites drinkers to reset and refresh. And Fanta's new colorful initiative seeks to make snacking moments more playful around the world. At the same time, we are optimizing our marketing spend, focusing on our strongest brands and most compelling opportunities. We have a global creative and media agency review underway, which will improve processes, eliminate duplication, and drive efficiency to fuel reinvestment in our brands. Our innovation pipeline for 2021 has been shaped and coordinated for scale and impact, consists of global bevs like the new taste and design for Coke Zero Sugar, and regional bevs across categories like the expansion of our Authentic Tea House franchise across Asia. We're still pursuing intelligent local experimentation like adding functional benefits to some of our local hydration brands. And there's also innovation that leverages our strength in revenue growth management through packaging initiatives. This includes our first 100% recycled PET bottles in the U.S. for smart water understanding, along with a new 13.2 ounce 100% recycled PET bottle for trademark Coca Cola. We will also continue to expand Topo Chico Hard Seltze, which is already launched in several cities in Latin America and Europe. The global pandemic has undoubtedly expedited the shift to a digital world, and we're structuring the organization around this opportunity. We've been digitizing the enterprise for several years and have stepped up our evolution into an organization that can skillfully execute marketing, commercial, sales and distribution both offline and online. We're also leveraging existing pockets of excellence in e-commerce around the globe. The myCoke B2B platform continues to add outlets and is expanding to new markets. Our O2O partnerships with multiple food aggregators ensure beverage availability and visibility. Our multi-platform venture WABI, it connects our system and other consumer products companies to store owners and end consumers through an ecosystem of digital apps. Thanks to our network model, WABI is now available in 23 cities across five continents. The ecosystem is powerful and has already attracted bottler interest and collaboration in several regions. Bottler alignment also remains an imperative, seamless system connectivity helps us maintain local relevance, while benefiting from global scale. We continue to engage with our bottling partners holistically to fuel the network for long term growth. We're working to lift and shift capabilities. We can focus on being successful today, while also pursuing our ambitions for the future. And before I turn over to John, I want to express how proud I am of our support for communities and our sustainability achievements during the year that brought much disruption to the world. We remain grounded by our purpose and our ESG work is embedded in our business and the value we create. We contributed to COVID-19 relief around the world. We continue to focus on racial equity, including the introduction of our global social justice framework. We've made progress against priorities such as world without waste, which includes setting a new target to reduce the use of virgin PET in our packaging. We're also making progress against our 2030's science-based carbon target, which is a critical milestone to achieving our ambition to be net zero carbon by 2050. We accomplished our goal to empower 5 million women by 2020, creating shared value for these women, their families and communities, while growing our business through their involvement in both retail and distribution businesses. And we won't stop there. We'll have more updates in our business and sustainability report, and World Without Waste report in the coming months. To summarize, we are confident that we will successfully navigate through a dynamic market environment in 2021 to deliver against our objectives. We will emerge stronger with more consumers, higher share, stronger system economics and greater stakeholder impact. As vaccine distributions continue, we'll have more visibility into how the global recovery will take shape. And given our confidence in the levers we have to manage the business, we are providing an outlook for 2021. Importantly, we're staying true to our commitment to consumer centricity and our beverages for life strategy. We've made great progress in equipping the company to win for years to come, as we will fulfill our purpose to refresh the world and make a difference. Now John will provide more details on our results and our guidance.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will go over our fourth quarter performance and touch on the components of our outlook for 2021. First, let me start with a comment on the tax case that James referred to earlier in the call. As he mentioned, we disagree with the U.S. Tax Court opinion and will vigorously defend our position. In the Form 8-K filed this morning, we provide detail on the process we've undergone in arriving at our current position and determining next steps. Thorough analysis has led us to believe we will ultimately be successful, and while we have recorded a tax reserve of $438 million in consideration of the alternative transfer pricing methodologies that could be applied by the courts in resolving the litigated matters. We have not made any changes to our underlying effective tax rates going forward. That said, there is no assurance that the courts will ultimately rule in the company's favor. It is possible that all or some portion of the adjustment proposed by the IRS and affirmed by the Tax Court could be upheld. To this end we have estimated approximately $12 billion for the aggregate incremental tax liability for years up to and including 2020, including interest accrued through December 31, 2020. This amount assumes the IRS prevails and applies their methodology and considers any adjustments from previously accrued transition tax payable under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We have also indicated that applying their methodology would increase our underlying effective tax rates by approximately 3.5%. There are many puts and takes that inform the range of incremental liability and potential change in tax rate. I encourage you to refer to the disclosure in the Form 8-K for more in-depth detail. While there is uncertainty associated with the timing and ultimate resolution, we will continue to prioritize investing in the business to drive long term growth, as well as supporting dividend growth for our shareowners. What we strongly believe we will prevail, we are confident we have ample flexibility between our cash generation and balance sheet, to manage the range of outcomes, outlined in this morning's disclosure. We will be as transparent as possible throughout this process. Turning to our performance in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020. Our Q4 organic revenue decline of 3% showed sequential improvement from the 6% decline in the third quarter, and 9% decline for the full year. October and November volumes were down low single digits and approaching flat year-over-year trends. But as James mentioned, we saw a slowdown in December due to a resurgence in the virus and increased lockdown restrictions in many markets. The contraction in the comparable gross margin was primarily driven by continued pressure on our channel and package mix between away from home and at home, as well as currency headwinds. Additionally, segment mix swung to a headwind in the quarter due to outperformance of our bottling investments group. Comparable operating margin expanded through ongoing disciplined cost management, more than offsetting pressure from the top line. It's worth noting the decline in SG&A spend this quarter was impacted by timing due to the phasing effect of marketing reduction over the year. As we've previously stated, we have been reintroducing marketing spend in a targeted way, identifying compelling opportunities to invest across countries, categories and brands. Fourth quarter comparable EPS of $0.47 represents an increase of 6% and full year comparable earnings of $1.95, reflects an 8% decline relative to our 2019 results. On a comparable currency neutral basis, earnings were up 14% for the quarter and down 2% for the year. Throughout the crisis, we have remained intensely focused on our cash flow goals. While our cash from operations was down 6% for the year, we have continued to make good progress on our working capital, and have exercised tight management of our capital spend. This is exemplified by our 2020 free cash flow performance coming off strong momentum in 2019. We finished up 3% for the year and reached free cash flow conversion of over a 100%, despite the headwinds our business faced. As we begin to see prospects for a recovery later in 2021, driven by vaccination and consumers returning to many of their previous routines, socializing, work and travel, our focus would be on converting top line growth to maximize returns. Our improving level of visibility into a recovery as the year goes on, as well as the many lessons we\u2019ve learned in the last year, have enabled us to provide an outlook for 2021. We currently expect organic revenue percentage growth of high single digits, and comparable earnings per share percentage growth of high single to low double digits versus 2020. While we're confident we will see recovery this year and expect to deliver 2021 earnings that are at or above 2019 levels, we've provided a wider range than usual to account for lingering uncertainty in the near term, as well as the potential for the acceleration to be a synchronous in nature. There are many considerations as you think about the drivers of our guidance. A calendar shift will impact the quarterly cadence, as we have five additional days in the first quarter and six fewer days in the fourth quarter this year. The trajectory of the recovery will be a significant factor. And we expect to be dealing with COVID-19 for the better part of the year, with the first half likely to be more challenging than the second half. Currently year-to-date volume is down mid-single digits, as we left the toughest quarterly comparison of 2020, before the pandemic hit much of the world. To the degree that the top line is driven by away from home recovery, we would expect to channel and package pressures experienced last year to a base, which would drive price mix improvement and gross margin expansion. From a cost perspective, we see several factors at play. In 2020, there were many operating expenses that were significantly reduced or eliminated that are likely to come back this year. We will continue to step up levels of investment behind our brands to drive the top line. We expect the return on that spend to become more favorable as mobility stabilizes and away from home channels regain momentum. The changes we are driving with our strategic transformation will lead to more efficient and productive spending over time. These changes include our organizational restructuring, streamlined portfolio, disciplined innovation and optimized marketing approach. We will continue to flex our spend relative to what is dictated by the market conditions around us. While we are seeing commodity prices begin to rise, given our hedge positions, we currently expect the impact to cost of goods sold to be benign. As we noted in our release, based on current spot rates and our hedge positions, we expect currency to be a tailwind of approximately 2% to 3% to the top line, and approximately 3% to 4% to comparable EPS in 2021. We will continue to focus on free cash flow and expect to deliver at least $10 billion in cash for operations, while we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion. This does not contemplate any payment relating to the tax case. We look forward to providing more insight into the drivers our outlook, General Virtual Cagny Presentation next week. In the face of this global pandemic, I am extremely grateful for our team around the world and the way they were able to pivot and execute through such a challenging environment. I'm also excited about the work we've undertaken to set us up for a very promising future. I am confident that our overall strategic direction will enable us to deliver 2021 earnings that are at or above 2019 levels, as we emerge stronger. With that operator, we are ready to take Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nSteve Powers: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks. So the profit and the free cash flow, flow through that you've delivered in 2020 and guided to in the year to come is impressive, given the top line headwind and the complexities you're facing. I know a lot of that is driven by underlying productivity that's set to continue. But I'd also assume it's been aided by some level of diminished level of strategic investment marketing capabilities, that kind of thing. That is probably set to continue for a good part of '21 before demand is more clearly on an upswing. So, I guess the question is, is there a way to frame how much strategic investment is embedded in the '21 outlook, perhaps relative to 2019 or some other benchmark? And where do you think the right level of investment will be post-pandemic on a run rate basis to make sure you're positioned to hit the high-end of the long term algorithm that you've been targeting? And if there's a way to talk a little bit about the phasing. Does that investment come in coincident with recovery? Should we expect it to be ahead of recovery, just how you're thinking about those dynamics would be great? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Powers: Good morning.\nJames Quincey: Let me start with the future and work backwards. When things have become new normal post-pandemic, the world is fully open. And clearly we'll be back, investing at the sort of pressure levels of marketing and all the other components of the business that we believe is necessary to drive the top line in a margin accretive fashion that is consistent with the long term growth models. And as you think about comparing that to 2019, clearly, we will have baked into that the benefits of not just the new organization, but the fundamental rework of the marketing. Some of it is a reprogramming or where the marketing goes and that's most obviously reflected in the advertising number that we show in our disclosures. But there are other marketing spend, which typically gets called enabling, where we have a major program to really look at how we can make that much more efficient, right across the board of all the things we do from relooking at the agencies, relooking at the way we do research, the digitization and many things. So the will when comparing the new normal at 2019 be an embedded degree of efficiency across the board. But in the end, we are the view that the marketing pressure will need to be similar to the sorts of pressure levels that it was in '18 and '19, when we were achieving the sorts of revenue growth rates and starting to see the flow through into profits that we were looking for. In the run up from now to that future, we have of course taken a measured and balanced view of what we think 2021 will look like. And our guidance ultimately, is a corridor where we believe we can manage whether things get better, in line with our view or quicker than our view, we will be in the corridor and we will start reapplying the pressure of the marketing and the innovation that we believe will drive the revenue growth. Or if things are a little slower on the opening, we'll pull the levers and be more cautious about the rate at which we reapply the marketing pressures, or as you mentioned free cash flow obviously one of the levers to sustaining or in fact growing free cash flow last year was to back off on some of the CapEx. Simply understood, some of our CapEx is in new found in equipment or new vending equipment. And if those channels are not open, there's no point in putting new equipment in there until they're on the verge of being open. So there's a self-regulation between the marketing and some of the CapEx on. If the lockdown is greater, we will logically back off and then as the lockdown reduces and the market is more open, those things will come back on. And so, we'd spend more marketing more CapEx but have more revenue. And that's why we believe we can operate within the corridor of the guidance we've provided and emerge stronger than this and really drive growth into the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. I want to talk a little bit about North America profitability over the longer term. I mean, obviously this year, there was a nice step up, but tough to look at 2020 as I guess, change in isolation. But I was struck by the news and you mentioned it today, the 13-ounce bottle. So I was just curious about efforts to get broader and more aggressive on price tag management, revenue growth management in the U.S. Talked about what that could mean for longer term profitability in North America, even without addressing the nature of your supply chain here. And by the way, if there's anything you are starting to explore in terms of supply chain structure in the U.S. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. The revenue growth management journey has been a multiyear journey globally, and indeed, more recently reviewed [ph] in North America. We've started to see some good benefits come through from that. Just over 13-ounce bottle is obviously good from a revenue growth point of view. It is also worth mentioning that 100% recycled PET bottle on Coke, which is the first one in the U.S., that's very linked to our World Without Waste strategy. So clearly, we are going to continue to explore and drive particularly some of the smaller packages, whether it's this smaller bottle or some of the sleeker cans as part of providing the sizes that consumers are interested in. This also connects with our revenue growth management story. And as I said on previous calls, I believe that is a multiyear runway for our efforts on RGM in North America that are starting to pay dividends over time, that is not just helping on the margin front, but frankly, is helping on the revenue front. So, I think there's a lot more that can be done to drive that in North America. And that's kind of in the underlying category of margin. Of course, there are structural changes to the margin on whether we have re-franchised or not to the bottlers or whether we continue or what our exact role is in kind of the system's internal supply chain. And therefore, if we do finish products, or we get -- the bottlers manufacture those products. Of course, what we will do overtime is look to do the most efficient and effective ecosystem of supply options for ourselves and our bottling partners. We have recently moved some lines to third-party co-packing of water. And as and when other opportunities are there, we'll consider them. But ultimately, we have to have the most efficient and effective supply chain between ourselves and the bottlers to satisfy the consumers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hi, good morning. So, John, I just wanted to follow up on the comments around ample flexibility to handle the tax judgment. And I was just looking for a bit more detail on two separate scenarios. One, just more short term versus the unfavorable $3 billion opinion potentially in order to appeal that, might you have to post cash that could impact your dividend plans. How do you think about that as well as capital allocation? And then second, if we think about the subsequent decade, if there were to be an unfavorable outcome, I understand that's not what you believe, but what if type of scenario. Are the cash outflows far enough out that it doesn't have a significant impact in terms of the way you think about the dividend and sustainability? Or do you have to sort of adjust plans ahead of time in case and how do you think through that conceptually?\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Dara. As I mentioned, in the script, I think we've got ample flexibility through both the way in which we've been managing the balance sheet. And when we think about the cash generation prospects for the next few years to manage any scenario, we continue to believe that we have a very strong case and unlikely to have to consider that worst case scenario. But the work we've done, really beginning last year to organize our debt portfolio in a way that gives us more flexibility. And when we take that into consideration, along with the cash will generate in the next two to three years, I think we feel pretty confident we can take care of just about any scenario.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Thank you. I'd like to ask for a few more details on advertising spend. I think John, you mentioned a few phrases Creative Media review, marketing efficiency and such. Then also, I think you mentioned marketing pressure being similar to kind of '18, '19 levels. So, if we look at '19, the ad spend was roughly around $4.3 billion, obviously is much lower than that for 2020. Should we expect that figure to get back to where it was this year? Or is it a sort of thing that you've just become more efficient? And perhaps it's a figure that's 5% lower or 10% lower than what was running out before?\nJohn Murphy: Yes, thanks. So, I don't think we're fixed on a number that's necessarily linked to 2019. Given a couple of factors, number one, the work that we have highlighted, we are doing around efficiency. We believe that there's a tremendous opportunity for us to drive greater efficiency across the marketing spend portfolio, and particularly in the enabling area. Secondly, we've also become I think, a lot more flexible. We've learned a lot in the last year that allows us to, so to speak, turn the tap on and off with much greater fluency than perhaps we've done in the past. And then thirdly, as you look at the marketing landscape, the mix of spending that will be required market-to-market is going to evolve. And we need to be flexible in order to handle that. So net-net is we will continue to focus on what our markets need, both in total investment terms, as well as in the mix of spend that's appropriate for each of these markets. We will continue to drive the kind of efficiency that we now know is available to us. And I think we land in whatever landing spot that means in terms of total dollars, but I think we've got a good handle on both being efficient, being effective and investing appropriately as markets recover across the world.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to touch on innovation. Obviously, it sounds like you're making a lot of progress on your portfolio streamlining initiatives. And you've been doing, I think a good job at managing all of this. But I guess I'm trying to understand how you're balancing this innovation and messaging your new, more streamlined portfolio strategy within your organization? And then, are you at all concerned that this increases some risk of stifling innovation and possibly discouraging risk taking over the long term?\nJames Quincey: I guess the headline answer is, no, we don't think we're going to stifle innovation, quite the opposite, we're looking actually for innovation to continue, where it was in '18 and '19 in terms of playing an important role in driving consumer engagement, interest of customers, and therefore revenue growth and on to profitability. And so this is very much about finding a way to be able to identify the biggest best within the innovation pipeline, understanding that there's still going to be an very important role for experimentation. There's just no way of knowing from the outset, no matter what one might think from a personal point of view as to which ones are going to be the absolute best going forward. So we're back to innovation. Clearly, we did less in 2020. We will be increasing meaningfully the degree of innovation in 2021. Very focused on are these attracting more consumers to our portfolios, is it allowing them to enjoy our beverages perhaps more frequently or greater financial at greater prices. Ultimately, we're looking for more impact. We had looked at our innovation pipeline, and while we had done a lot, we had some inefficiency in it. So we're driving for greater impact, which we were able to achieve in 2020, and that we will get again in 2021. So I think there's absolutely the right level of focus on innovation. We'll continue to learn more as we go through 2021. But none of this rationalization portfolio is about stifling, quite the contrary. It's about if you like, clearing away the least successful so there's more room for the most successful and for the next generation of innovation.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sean King with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nSean King: Hi, good morning. With respect to your restructuring and streamlining plans announced last or mid-last year, are you seeing any areas for greater opportunity for savings across your organization? I guess just given that the disruption has dragged on longer than most throughout the time.\nJames Quincey: I think what we have at the moment is a very clear plan that we have been implementing on resetting the organization, Let's go Forward. Again, the need and the objectives of the organizational change we made were pre-existing, as COVID we knew we needed to find a way to make the organization more agile, more focused and to scale up some of the activities to a more platform level, especially given the ever increasing importance of data and the logic that that can't be done lots of different ways everywhere. So, it was a preexisting idea that we took the necessity, if we like, or the opportunity in the course of 2020, to accelerate its implementation. Of course, there'll be ongoing opportunities, and we'll learn with the world will evolve, we will evolve and change will happen into the future. But I would not start the planning that this is recurring levels of productivity at these sorts of levels, much beyond the couple of current years, it will impact at the moment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning. Just a question on the comments of a balanced outlook for 2021. I mean, I fully appreciate that you're giving guidance, and it's a wider range and there's a lot of uncertainty. But I mean, how do you figure out what sales do look like in the third, fourth quarter this year? I mean, are you going off of vaccination rates by country and then assuming things open up 30 days later? I appreciate any effort. But I just don't -- I'm interested to how you do kind of a bottoms up approach to looking at country by country around the world to come up with kind of even a rough ballpark?\nJames Quincey: Great question, Bill. Look, we relatively early on in the crisis, actually going back to the second quarter of last year, there was a team that did a lot of very intense and interesting work on looking at prior crises, whether military, economic or pandemic, going all the way back to our history, rounded years, and looking at what happened on the curves. And we came up with a set of assumptions and a set of analyses that then shaped our view as to what the disparate scenarios we faced were. And in simple terms, the biggest indicator or driver was a view on how long the pandemic would last and therefore, how long each country would take to get back to its 2019 levels of GDP. So, you can take all the countries in the world and you can segment them into, it'll take them one year, it'll take them two years, it'll take them three years, and there are countries that will take four years to get back there. And that is what we've done. And we were able to see, obviously, by the end of 2020, that the progress of the world and the progress of countries quite closely followed the scenarios in our model, and in the overall macro idea. So, it has given us some sense as we continue into year two of those projections, as to what sort of corridor we'll be looking at going forward through '21 and into '22 is likely to look like by country or by region.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nLaurent Grandet: Hey, good morning, James and John. I'd like to focus this morning on the '21 guidance. It seems soft in terms of EPS growth especially in the year where you expect them in the high single digit organic top line growth, and 3% to 4% ForEx tailwind on top of it. So it probably doesn't embed fast recovery of the on-premise channel that is more profitable. But could you help reconcile or should we think it's a conservative EPS guide?\nJames Quincey: I think the simple starting point to reconcile this is a few points, Laurent. One, that the impact in 2020 a lot of it came on some of our finished goods businesses that do not have the same margin levels as the concentrate business. So, for a simple example, the closure of a Costco store has a disproportionate impact on revenue versus profits versus not selling some coke products through the concentrate business. So, what we expect in 2021 is a greater recovery in some of these away from home, particularly our finished product businesses, whether it be some of the Costa businesses or the BIG bottlers, and those are mechanically headwinds in terms of margins. The second very important effect in 2021 is, of course, the reversal of our stewarding of resources in 2020. We clearly took the decision that if there was not good reasons to invest in marketing or in market facing CapEx or market facing operating expenses, then we would not do so. And the more the recovery occurs in 2021, the more we are going to reinstate those expenses, as well as, of course, a number of elements of the incentive schemes which will be budgeted for at 100% in 2021. So that's why we have not gone for line-by-line guidance within 2021. There's so many moving pieces that are not your typical year of moving from a normal year and comparing it to another normal year. You've got these weird effects of what's actually in 2020 and the way we stewarded the resources and we're still able to drive free cash flow. That's why we've given some wider corridors and have given the top and the bottom line, which we think are the most measured and balanced approach that we can give today.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nKevin Grundy: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. James, I wanted to spend a little bit of time on the Topo Chico Hard Seltzer launch in the U.S., but sort of within the context of learnings from the launch of the product in Latin America and Europe, you spent a little bit of time earlier in the call. As I recall, the company made some tweaks to Coke Energy on the formulation with some learnings in Europe. So a handful of questions. How is the product delivering against market share objectives so far in those regions? Where is it sourcing occasions? Has that been in line with the expectations? And then maybe we spent some time on investment. Where does the Topo Chico Hard Seltzer launched in the U.S. sort of rank in terms of the other priorities? You mentioned, a global campaign around Sprite, the importance of Tea in Asia. Maybe you can just sort of characterize for us, even a high level, how big of a priority the product success is this year in the U.S.? So thanks for all that.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. So we've launched Topo Chico Hard Seltzer in a number of Latin America markets, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Peru, Chile, Brazil. Strong initial feedback from consumers and customers, still very early to even have market share rates. But the rate of sale and the repeats look very good, but obviously still too early really to tell. Also, we've launched in a few markets in Europe, again, still very early to tell, but repeat rates and a rate of sale look encouraging. And so in the coming quarters, we'll be happy to share some of those learnings. I'm sure there'll be learnings and we'll tweak things as we go forward. Now, as it relates to your question about the U.S., it's important here to remember how different the U.S. is versus the rest of the international market, because of U.S. alcohol market regulations. The Topo Chico Hard Seltzer will not be going through the company stroke the bottling system in the U.S. It will be handled all by a collaboration with the Molson Coors team. So it is not competing in any way, shape or form as a priority with all the other things that are going on that are all obviously being done by ourselves and the bottlers in the U.S. And I think Molson Coors are very excited about the opportunity in the U.S., it\u2019s certainly been good initial reception from distributors in that marketplace. More to come in future quarters.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. You referred in the earnings call press release that Q4 had better market share trends, roughly even as opposed to down a little bit for the full year. How much of that was due to at least the initial reopening of on-premise and so a channel mix effect? And how much of that was due to commercial momentum, either in particular countries or particular brands that you would expect to carry on into 2021? And then, just as a follow-up on a prior question, can you just give us an update on Coca-Cola Energy? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: So, fourth quarter market share trend were definitely better than they had been in the previous two quarters. And whilst yes, we did benefit from the reopening, remembering that we have generally speaking, materially higher share in the away from home than the at-home then obviously, the reopening tends to improve the overall share trend. But we will also gaining share in Q4 versus Q3 or Q2 in both at-home and away from home. So that is, in the end commercial momentum built into what was going on in those channels. And we would certainly expect to gain share away and at-home in 2021 and therefore gain share overall, particularly as the reopenings happen. And then Coke Energy, we will be obviously, particularly in the U.S. that was trying to launch that coming into the beginning of 2020 was particularly difficult, given the immediate lockdowns. And so we're going to come back on Coke Energy in 2021. Despite the challenges, we've had interesting repeat rates, we've recruited new users to the category at rates that are very interesting versus other recent launches in the category, by bringing new drinkers into energy and had interesting levels of dollar retail sales in year one compared to other innovations. So we think there's something working there back to the original hypothesis that there was space in the energy category to come in with a proposition that would attract new drinkers to the category. So we've got reasons to think that we should double down again in 2021.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, and good morning. So my question is a follow-up on the expense savings from the reorganization and also have a follow-up on RGM. So how much are you embedding in savings from the reorg into EPS guidance for the year? And on the clarification, James, on the comments on RGM and the relationship with the bottlers. Are you embedding higher suggest switch pricing to be executed by the bottlers or into this cost on top of the lower straight spent, perhaps partially offset the mix impact that you had in 2020, and as the pandemic lingers?\nJohn Murphy: Andrea, let me take that. One on the expense savings, we had highlighted in our release last year, an expected benefit of between $350 million and $550 million. And we're on track to deliver that. Some of it falls into this year, some of it will fall into the first part of next year, kind of aligned to the progress that we make on the implementation of the new model. So that's on the expenses. And on the whole topic of RGM, the past year has actually I think, highlighted even more than ever the importance of having this as a key part of our top line algorithm. I don't expect us to have material changes in how we go about it. We're very clear on the drivers at the local market level, when it comes to both pricing and its relationship with inflation, and having the right packaging architecture to enable us to manage as in an optimal way, the conditions of any given market. And if anything, I think our teams around the world are even more focused on that area, as a way to navigate a path forward that allows us to deliver on the revenue objectives that we've outlined.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. Just a higher level or longer term question. So in the past, the company has had longer term goals for operating margins, clearly some M&A and tax accounting changes made those margins less relevant. But given as an even greater focus on efficiency and the recent margin flow through, and probably that gives you some increased confidence around your ability to lean on margins in case of uncertain outcomes, just judging by your outlook for 2021. And I guess appreciating your response to prior questions around mix and spending levels that could potentially return. But I wonder if you have any, just high level thoughts, from the learnings that you had this year about your ability to drive margins on where you think the company's margin structure might be able to go over the longer term? And maybe specifically, how North America factors into that outlook? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Chris. I think the answer really is rooted in our belief in the sustainability of our long term growth algorithm. And as you know, embedded into that algorithm is an assumption that over time we can and we will continue to expand margins. I think any given year needs to be taken in the context of that longer term perspective. 2020, as you say, it was a particularly unusual year, and it afforded us the opportunity to under the umbrella of never waste a crisis to drive greater efficiency and to have a bump in our operating margin performance for 2020. But I would think of the longer term in the context of the long term growth model. And we manage a portfolio of very distinctive markets around the world, and they contribute at different times along that journey and North America is no different. We see plenty of opportunity, as James highlighted earlier in the North American business to improve profitability levels over time. And that will, I think, be a key factor in our belief that the long term growth model, as it currently is expressed is doable and unsustainable. And so I'd like a sort of couch to the whole margin topic in that frame.\nJames Quincey: Thanks so very much, everyone. Just a few closing thoughts. The objectives and the priorities we set for ourselves at the peak of the crisis have really galvanized the company, and are driving our ability to continue to execute through the volatile near term dynamics. While the virus is still a factor in the near term, we're well on our way to emerging stronger and to returning to the path of delivering at the high end of our long-term growth model. Focus and the flexibility of the network model will drive the entire Coke system for years to come. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company, and for joining us today. Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Quincey",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin today's call by reflecting on the past year including our fourth quarter performance. Then, let's turn the page and look at the New Year. I'll provide thoughts on the current environment and how we will continue to manage through near term volatility. Finally, I will share how we're thinking about the year ahead and why we remain confident about the future. John, will then discuss the quarter and our outlook in more detail. Now before we dive in, I'd like to address our U.S. income tax dispute with the Internal Revenue Service, including both the case and the opinion that was issued by the U.S. Tax Court in November. We believe that the tax court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in its conclusions. We intend to assert our claims on appeal and vigorously defend our position. We've consulted with outside advisors, and conducted comprehensive analysis. We've considered all relevant information including the unconstitutionality of the IRS's retroactive imposition of tax liability. Putting this all together, we believe we will ultimately prevail on appeal. John will provide insight into the range of risks we see, should the case not go in our favor. I also encourage you to refer to Exhibit 99.2 in the Form 8-K we filed this morning for the updated disclosure. The tax matter is clearly important, and we are dedicating ample resources to its resolution, but it is likely to take some time. We remain steadfastly focused on delivering growth in our business, and driving long-term value for our stakeholders. In 2020, we faced significant challenges posed by the global pandemic. Our company proved resilience, moving with agility to adapt our business and accelerate our strategic transformation. Our work isn't done. And I recognize and appreciate the ongoing support, dedication and progress from our people and our system. Turning to the fourth quarter, we saw improving trends through November, but a resurgence in the virus drove renewed lockdowns in many parts of the world. The rise in restrictions impacted our recovery in many markets, resulting in a modest deceleration in volume in December, which is continued year-to-date with volume currently down mid-single digits. Speaking generally, trends are still tied to our exposure to away from home, coupled with a level of lockdown, but our business has become more durable compared to the spring of 2020, based on the learnings and actions we have taken. Our teams around the world have applied these learnings from the peak of the crisis to better navigate short term setbacks. Globally in the fourth quarter, progress remained mixed and even within regions, there was ongoing recovery as well as challenges. For example, in Asia-Pacific, countries are at different stages. In China, we are indeed emerging stronger, thanks to our strategic actions with Q4 share gains to complement our 2020 share gains in both on and off premise. Japan drove incremental transactions through their price pack decoupling, but soft traffic in vending continued pressure mix. In India, challenges remain, but at home trends was strong, and we saw signs of recovery in away from home channels through the holidays. EMEA showed resilience despite experiencing varying levels of lockdown through the quarter, driving a dispersion in results between developed and developing markets. Western Europe was the most affected by the resurgence, while West Africa and Turkey showed positive momentum. In North America, away from home volumes were impacted by multiple states restricting bars and banning indoor dining. Sparkling water trends remained robust with the expansion of AHA and Topo Chico mineral water, as well as simply and fairlife also performing well. In Latin America, trends were strong early in the quarter, but slowed in December due to restrictions and less stimulus support. Single-serve is recovering as a percentage of mix in our business, a multi-serve refillables grew at a double digit pace. Brazil's results remained strong, and Mexico improved sequentially. In global ventures, despite the headwind of renewed UK lockdowns impacting our Costa retail stores, express machines performed well. We continued expansion in China, Japan and further into Europe and our Testing Express and Proud to Serve platforms, along with the launch of costacoffee.com in the U.S. Our Bottling Investment Group further improved operating margin performance and made progress on cooler productivity, and SKU rationalization. Almost all markets gained or maintained share with Vietnam achieving its highest ever sparkling share. From a category perspective, we saw relative outperformance for sparkling in the fourth quarter. Trademark Coke delivered 1% volume growth, delivered by as zero sugar offerings which were up 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. While our overall market share performance continued to be impacted by channel mix, as our highest share away from home business remains pressured. We did gain underlying value in both at home and away from home channels. We are poised to emerge stronger in both channels due to our actions to support customers and to ensure seamless execution from a supply chain perspective. Thinking about 2021, there is no doubt the near term trajectory of our recovery will still be impacted by the presence of the virus in most markets. It is still early days in the vaccination process, and we'd expect to see further improvements in our business as vaccinations become more widely available over the coming months. It's clear that the pace and availability of vaccines will look different around the world, and therefore we'll likely see some level of asynchronous recovery, depending both on vaccine distribution and other macroeconomic factors. Amidst this backdrop, we will ensure that the system remains flexible to adjust the near term uncertainties, while at the same time, continuing to push forward on initiatives we have championed to emerge stronger. So let me touch briefly on our progress against several initiatives today, and we'll provide further detail on these as well as other important business drivers at our Virtual Cagny presentation next week. Our networked organization is coming together and creating empowerment through clear decision rights and accountability. We have our overall operating unit and global category team structures, and are already changing the way we work. We've established a new platform services organization, 9 hubs are currently being stood up. Our ultimate goal is to scale our resources and capabilities to drive value and growth, including investing in new consumer analytics and digital tools. As we go through the transformation, we are ensuring that we have a diverse and equitable representation across our global workforce. Our long term profitable growth will be powered by our optimized brand portfolio. We've streamlined our portfolio from 400 to 200 master brands, allowing global category teams to identify the greatest opportunities and allocate investments accordingly. These targeted investments will leverage our leader brands more effectively, and convert Challenger and Explorer brands into leaders more quickly and consistently. Additionally, our portfolio streamlining allows us to focus attention on resources on what we do best, brand building and innovation. This will make room for more consumer centric products down the road. Great brand building begins with a deep understanding of our consumer that converts into superior quality products. To enhance our marketing effectiveness, we are building targeted experiential campaigns that are data driven and occasion-based and always on. We are eager to share upcoming work generated by this new marketing model including our first ever global Sprite Campaign, is called \"Let's be clear\", it invites drinkers to reset and refresh. And Fanta's new colorful initiative seeks to make snacking moments more playful around the world. At the same time, we are optimizing our marketing spend, focusing on our strongest brands and most compelling opportunities. We have a global creative and media agency review underway, which will improve processes, eliminate duplication, and drive efficiency to fuel reinvestment in our brands. Our innovation pipeline for 2021 has been shaped and coordinated for scale and impact, consists of global bevs like the new taste and design for Coke Zero Sugar, and regional bevs across categories like the expansion of our Authentic Tea House franchise across Asia. We're still pursuing intelligent local experimentation like adding functional benefits to some of our local hydration brands. And there's also innovation that leverages our strength in revenue growth management through packaging initiatives. This includes our first 100% recycled PET bottles in the U.S. for smart water understanding, along with a new 13.2 ounce 100% recycled PET bottle for trademark Coca Cola. We will also continue to expand Topo Chico Hard Seltze, which is already launched in several cities in Latin America and Europe. The global pandemic has undoubtedly expedited the shift to a digital world, and we're structuring the organization around this opportunity. We've been digitizing the enterprise for several years and have stepped up our evolution into an organization that can skillfully execute marketing, commercial, sales and distribution both offline and online. We're also leveraging existing pockets of excellence in e-commerce around the globe. The myCoke B2B platform continues to add outlets and is expanding to new markets. Our O2O partnerships with multiple food aggregators ensure beverage availability and visibility. Our multi-platform venture WABI, it connects our system and other consumer products companies to store owners and end consumers through an ecosystem of digital apps. Thanks to our network model, WABI is now available in 23 cities across five continents. The ecosystem is powerful and has already attracted bottler interest and collaboration in several regions. Bottler alignment also remains an imperative, seamless system connectivity helps us maintain local relevance, while benefiting from global scale. We continue to engage with our bottling partners holistically to fuel the network for long term growth. We're working to lift and shift capabilities. We can focus on being successful today, while also pursuing our ambitions for the future. And before I turn over to John, I want to express how proud I am of our support for communities and our sustainability achievements during the year that brought much disruption to the world. We remain grounded by our purpose and our ESG work is embedded in our business and the value we create. We contributed to COVID-19 relief around the world. We continue to focus on racial equity, including the introduction of our global social justice framework. We've made progress against priorities such as world without waste, which includes setting a new target to reduce the use of virgin PET in our packaging. We're also making progress against our 2030's science-based carbon target, which is a critical milestone to achieving our ambition to be net zero carbon by 2050. We accomplished our goal to empower 5 million women by 2020, creating shared value for these women, their families and communities, while growing our business through their involvement in both retail and distribution businesses. And we won't stop there. We'll have more updates in our business and sustainability report, and World Without Waste report in the coming months. To summarize, we are confident that we will successfully navigate through a dynamic market environment in 2021 to deliver against our objectives. We will emerge stronger with more consumers, higher share, stronger system economics and greater stakeholder impact. As vaccine distributions continue, we'll have more visibility into how the global recovery will take shape. And given our confidence in the levers we have to manage the business, we are providing an outlook for 2021. Importantly, we're staying true to our commitment to consumer centricity and our beverages for life strategy. We've made great progress in equipping the company to win for years to come, as we will fulfill our purpose to refresh the world and make a difference. Now John will provide more details on our results and our guidance. Sure. Good morning, Steve. Let me start with the future and work backwards. When things have become new normal post-pandemic, the world is fully open. And clearly we'll be back, investing at the sort of pressure levels of marketing and all the other components of the business that we believe is necessary to drive the top line in a margin accretive fashion that is consistent with the long term growth models. And as you think about comparing that to 2019, clearly, we will have baked into that the benefits of not just the new organization, but the fundamental rework of the marketing. Some of it is a reprogramming or where the marketing goes and that's most obviously reflected in the advertising number that we show in our disclosures. But there are other marketing spend, which typically gets called enabling, where we have a major program to really look at how we can make that much more efficient, right across the board of all the things we do from relooking at the agencies, relooking at the way we do research, the digitization and many things. So the will when comparing the new normal at 2019 be an embedded degree of efficiency across the board. But in the end, we are the view that the marketing pressure will need to be similar to the sorts of pressure levels that it was in '18 and '19, when we were achieving the sorts of revenue growth rates and starting to see the flow through into profits that we were looking for. In the run up from now to that future, we have of course taken a measured and balanced view of what we think 2021 will look like. And our guidance ultimately, is a corridor where we believe we can manage whether things get better, in line with our view or quicker than our view, we will be in the corridor and we will start reapplying the pressure of the marketing and the innovation that we believe will drive the revenue growth. Or if things are a little slower on the opening, we'll pull the levers and be more cautious about the rate at which we reapply the marketing pressures, or as you mentioned free cash flow obviously one of the levers to sustaining or in fact growing free cash flow last year was to back off on some of the CapEx. Simply understood, some of our CapEx is in new found in equipment or new vending equipment. And if those channels are not open, there's no point in putting new equipment in there until they're on the verge of being open. So there's a self-regulation between the marketing and some of the CapEx on. If the lockdown is greater, we will logically back off and then as the lockdown reduces and the market is more open, those things will come back on. And so, we'd spend more marketing more CapEx but have more revenue. And that's why we believe we can operate within the corridor of the guidance we've provided and emerge stronger than this and really drive growth into the future. Sure. The revenue growth management journey has been a multiyear journey globally, and indeed, more recently reviewed [ph] in North America. We've started to see some good benefits come through from that. Just over 13-ounce bottle is obviously good from a revenue growth point of view. It is also worth mentioning that 100% recycled PET bottle on Coke, which is the first one in the U.S., that's very linked to our World Without Waste strategy. So clearly, we are going to continue to explore and drive particularly some of the smaller packages, whether it's this smaller bottle or some of the sleeker cans as part of providing the sizes that consumers are interested in. This also connects with our revenue growth management story. And as I said on previous calls, I believe that is a multiyear runway for our efforts on RGM in North America that are starting to pay dividends over time, that is not just helping on the margin front, but frankly, is helping on the revenue front. So, I think there's a lot more that can be done to drive that in North America. And that's kind of in the underlying category of margin. Of course, there are structural changes to the margin on whether we have re-franchised or not to the bottlers or whether we continue or what our exact role is in kind of the system's internal supply chain. And therefore, if we do finish products, or we get -- the bottlers manufacture those products. Of course, what we will do overtime is look to do the most efficient and effective ecosystem of supply options for ourselves and our bottling partners. We have recently moved some lines to third-party co-packing of water. And as and when other opportunities are there, we'll consider them. But ultimately, we have to have the most efficient and effective supply chain between ourselves and the bottlers to satisfy the consumers. I guess the headline answer is, no, we don't think we're going to stifle innovation, quite the opposite, we're looking actually for innovation to continue, where it was in '18 and '19 in terms of playing an important role in driving consumer engagement, interest of customers, and therefore revenue growth and on to profitability. And so this is very much about finding a way to be able to identify the biggest best within the innovation pipeline, understanding that there's still going to be an very important role for experimentation. There's just no way of knowing from the outset, no matter what one might think from a personal point of view as to which ones are going to be the absolute best going forward. So we're back to innovation. Clearly, we did less in 2020. We will be increasing meaningfully the degree of innovation in 2021. Very focused on are these attracting more consumers to our portfolios, is it allowing them to enjoy our beverages perhaps more frequently or greater financial at greater prices. Ultimately, we're looking for more impact. We had looked at our innovation pipeline, and while we had done a lot, we had some inefficiency in it. So we're driving for greater impact, which we were able to achieve in 2020, and that we will get again in 2021. So I think there's absolutely the right level of focus on innovation. We'll continue to learn more as we go through 2021. But none of this rationalization portfolio is about stifling, quite the contrary. It's about if you like, clearing away the least successful so there's more room for the most successful and for the next generation of innovation. I think what we have at the moment is a very clear plan that we have been implementing on resetting the organization, Let's go Forward. Again, the need and the objectives of the organizational change we made were pre-existing, as COVID we knew we needed to find a way to make the organization more agile, more focused and to scale up some of the activities to a more platform level, especially given the ever increasing importance of data and the logic that that can't be done lots of different ways everywhere. So, it was a preexisting idea that we took the necessity, if we like, or the opportunity in the course of 2020, to accelerate its implementation. Of course, there'll be ongoing opportunities, and we'll learn with the world will evolve, we will evolve and change will happen into the future. But I would not start the planning that this is recurring levels of productivity at these sorts of levels, much beyond the couple of current years, it will impact at the moment. Great question, Bill. Look, we relatively early on in the crisis, actually going back to the second quarter of last year, there was a team that did a lot of very intense and interesting work on looking at prior crises, whether military, economic or pandemic, going all the way back to our history, rounded years, and looking at what happened on the curves. And we came up with a set of assumptions and a set of analyses that then shaped our view as to what the disparate scenarios we faced were. And in simple terms, the biggest indicator or driver was a view on how long the pandemic would last and therefore, how long each country would take to get back to its 2019 levels of GDP. So, you can take all the countries in the world and you can segment them into, it'll take them one year, it'll take them two years, it'll take them three years, and there are countries that will take four years to get back there. And that is what we've done. And we were able to see, obviously, by the end of 2020, that the progress of the world and the progress of countries quite closely followed the scenarios in our model, and in the overall macro idea. So, it has given us some sense as we continue into year two of those projections, as to what sort of corridor we'll be looking at going forward through '21 and into '22 is likely to look like by country or by region. I think the simple starting point to reconcile this is a few points, Laurent. One, that the impact in 2020 a lot of it came on some of our finished goods businesses that do not have the same margin levels as the concentrate business. So, for a simple example, the closure of a Costco store has a disproportionate impact on revenue versus profits versus not selling some coke products through the concentrate business. So, what we expect in 2021 is a greater recovery in some of these away from home, particularly our finished product businesses, whether it be some of the Costa businesses or the BIG bottlers, and those are mechanically headwinds in terms of margins. The second very important effect in 2021 is, of course, the reversal of our stewarding of resources in 2020. We clearly took the decision that if there was not good reasons to invest in marketing or in market facing CapEx or market facing operating expenses, then we would not do so. And the more the recovery occurs in 2021, the more we are going to reinstate those expenses, as well as, of course, a number of elements of the incentive schemes which will be budgeted for at 100% in 2021. So that's why we have not gone for line-by-line guidance within 2021. There's so many moving pieces that are not your typical year of moving from a normal year and comparing it to another normal year. You've got these weird effects of what's actually in 2020 and the way we stewarded the resources and we're still able to drive free cash flow. That's why we've given some wider corridors and have given the top and the bottom line, which we think are the most measured and balanced approach that we can give today. Yes, sure. So we've launched Topo Chico Hard Seltzer in a number of Latin America markets, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Peru, Chile, Brazil. Strong initial feedback from consumers and customers, still very early to even have market share rates. But the rate of sale and the repeats look very good, but obviously still too early really to tell. Also, we've launched in a few markets in Europe, again, still very early to tell, but repeat rates and a rate of sale look encouraging. And so in the coming quarters, we'll be happy to share some of those learnings. I'm sure there'll be learnings and we'll tweak things as we go forward. Now, as it relates to your question about the U.S., it's important here to remember how different the U.S. is versus the rest of the international market, because of U.S. alcohol market regulations. The Topo Chico Hard Seltzer will not be going through the company stroke the bottling system in the U.S. It will be handled all by a collaboration with the Molson Coors team. So it is not competing in any way, shape or form as a priority with all the other things that are going on that are all obviously being done by ourselves and the bottlers in the U.S. And I think Molson Coors are very excited about the opportunity in the U.S., it's certainly been good initial reception from distributors in that marketplace. More to come in future quarters. So, fourth quarter market share trend were definitely better than they had been in the previous two quarters. And whilst yes, we did benefit from the reopening, remembering that we have generally speaking, materially higher share in the away from home than the at-home then obviously, the reopening tends to improve the overall share trend. But we will also gaining share in Q4 versus Q3 or Q2 in both at-home and away from home. So that is, in the end commercial momentum built into what was going on in those channels. And we would certainly expect to gain share away and at-home in 2021 and therefore gain share overall, particularly as the reopenings happen. And then Coke Energy, we will be obviously, particularly in the U.S. that was trying to launch that coming into the beginning of 2020 was particularly difficult, given the immediate lockdowns. And so we're going to come back on Coke Energy in 2021. Despite the challenges, we've had interesting repeat rates, we've recruited new users to the category at rates that are very interesting versus other recent launches in the category, by bringing new drinkers into energy and had interesting levels of dollar retail sales in year one compared to other innovations. So we think there's something working there back to the original hypothesis that there was space in the energy category to come in with a proposition that would attract new drinkers to the category. So we've got reasons to think that we should double down again in 2021. Thanks, Chris. I think the answer really is rooted in our belief in the sustainability of our long term growth algorithm. And as you know, embedded into that algorithm is an assumption that over time we can and we will continue to expand margins. I think any given year needs to be taken in the context of that longer term perspective. 2020, as you say, it was a particularly unusual year, and it afforded us the opportunity to under the umbrella of never waste a crisis to drive greater efficiency and to have a bump in our operating margin performance for 2020. But I would think of the longer term in the context of the long term growth model. And we manage a portfolio of very distinctive markets around the world, and they contribute at different times along that journey and North America is no different. We see plenty of opportunity, as James highlighted earlier in the North American business to improve profitability levels over time. And that will, I think, be a key factor in our belief that the long term growth model, as it currently is expressed is doable and unsustainable. And so I'd like a sort of couch to the whole margin topic in that frame. Thanks so very much, everyone. Just a few closing thoughts. The objectives and the priorities we set for ourselves at the peak of the crisis have really galvanized the company, and are driving our ability to continue to execute through the volatile near term dynamics. While the virus is still a factor in the near term, we're well on our way to emerging stronger and to returning to the path of delivering at the high end of our long-term growth model. Focus and the flexibility of the network model will drive the entire Coke system for years to come. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company, and for joining us today. Thank you."

            "name": "John Murphy",
            "content": "Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will go over our fourth quarter performance and touch on the components of our outlook for 2021. First, let me start with a comment on the tax case that James referred to earlier in the call. As he mentioned, we disagree with the U.S. Tax Court opinion and will vigorously defend our position. In the Form 8-K filed this morning, we provide detail on the process we've undergone in arriving at our current position and determining next steps. Thorough analysis has led us to believe we will ultimately be successful, and while we have recorded a tax reserve of $438 million in consideration of the alternative transfer pricing methodologies that could be applied by the courts in resolving the litigated matters. We have not made any changes to our underlying effective tax rates going forward. That said, there is no assurance that the courts will ultimately rule in the company's favor. It is possible that all or some portion of the adjustment proposed by the IRS and affirmed by the Tax Court could be upheld. To this end we have estimated approximately $12 billion for the aggregate incremental tax liability for years up to and including 2020, including interest accrued through December 31, 2020. This amount assumes the IRS prevails and applies their methodology and considers any adjustments from previously accrued transition tax payable under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We have also indicated that applying their methodology would increase our underlying effective tax rates by approximately 3.5%. There are many puts and takes that inform the range of incremental liability and potential change in tax rate. I encourage you to refer to the disclosure in the Form 8-K for more in-depth detail. While there is uncertainty associated with the timing and ultimate resolution, we will continue to prioritize investing in the business to drive long term growth, as well as supporting dividend growth for our shareowners. What we strongly believe we will prevail, we are confident we have ample flexibility between our cash generation and balance sheet, to manage the range of outcomes, outlined in this morning's disclosure. We will be as transparent as possible throughout this process. Turning to our performance in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020. Our Q4 organic revenue decline of 3% showed sequential improvement from the 6% decline in the third quarter, and 9% decline for the full year. October and November volumes were down low single digits and approaching flat year-over-year trends. But as James mentioned, we saw a slowdown in December due to a resurgence in the virus and increased lockdown restrictions in many markets. The contraction in the comparable gross margin was primarily driven by continued pressure on our channel and package mix between away from home and at home, as well as currency headwinds. Additionally, segment mix swung to a headwind in the quarter due to outperformance of our bottling investments group. Comparable operating margin expanded through ongoing disciplined cost management, more than offsetting pressure from the top line. It's worth noting the decline in SG&A spend this quarter was impacted by timing due to the phasing effect of marketing reduction over the year. As we've previously stated, we have been reintroducing marketing spend in a targeted way, identifying compelling opportunities to invest across countries, categories and brands. Fourth quarter comparable EPS of $0.47 represents an increase of 6% and full year comparable earnings of $1.95, reflects an 8% decline relative to our 2019 results. On a comparable currency neutral basis, earnings were up 14% for the quarter and down 2% for the year. Throughout the crisis, we have remained intensely focused on our cash flow goals. While our cash from operations was down 6% for the year, we have continued to make good progress on our working capital, and have exercised tight management of our capital spend. This is exemplified by our 2020 free cash flow performance coming off strong momentum in 2019. We finished up 3% for the year and reached free cash flow conversion of over a 100%, despite the headwinds our business faced. As we begin to see prospects for a recovery later in 2021, driven by vaccination and consumers returning to many of their previous routines, socializing, work and travel, our focus would be on converting top line growth to maximize returns. Our improving level of visibility into a recovery as the year goes on, as well as the many lessons we've learned in the last year, have enabled us to provide an outlook for 2021. We currently expect organic revenue percentage growth of high single digits, and comparable earnings per share percentage growth of high single to low double digits versus 2020. While we're confident we will see recovery this year and expect to deliver 2021 earnings that are at or above 2019 levels, we've provided a wider range than usual to account for lingering uncertainty in the near term, as well as the potential for the acceleration to be a synchronous in nature. There are many considerations as you think about the drivers of our guidance. A calendar shift will impact the quarterly cadence, as we have five additional days in the first quarter and six fewer days in the fourth quarter this year. The trajectory of the recovery will be a significant factor. And we expect to be dealing with COVID-19 for the better part of the year, with the first half likely to be more challenging than the second half. Currently year-to-date volume is down mid-single digits, as we left the toughest quarterly comparison of 2020, before the pandemic hit much of the world. To the degree that the top line is driven by away from home recovery, we would expect to channel and package pressures experienced last year to a base, which would drive price mix improvement and gross margin expansion. From a cost perspective, we see several factors at play. In 2020, there were many operating expenses that were significantly reduced or eliminated that are likely to come back this year. We will continue to step up levels of investment behind our brands to drive the top line. We expect the return on that spend to become more favorable as mobility stabilizes and away from home channels regain momentum. The changes we are driving with our strategic transformation will lead to more efficient and productive spending over time. These changes include our organizational restructuring, streamlined portfolio, disciplined innovation and optimized marketing approach. We will continue to flex our spend relative to what is dictated by the market conditions around us. While we are seeing commodity prices begin to rise, given our hedge positions, we currently expect the impact to cost of goods sold to be benign. As we noted in our release, based on current spot rates and our hedge positions, we expect currency to be a tailwind of approximately 2% to 3% to the top line, and approximately 3% to 4% to comparable EPS in 2021. We will continue to focus on free cash flow and expect to deliver at least $10 billion in cash for operations, while we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion. This does not contemplate any payment relating to the tax case. We look forward to providing more insight into the drivers our outlook, General Virtual Cagny Presentation next week. In the face of this global pandemic, I am extremely grateful for our team around the world and the way they were able to pivot and execute through such a challenging environment. I'm also excited about the work we've undertaken to set us up for a very promising future. I am confident that our overall strategic direction will enable us to deliver 2021 earnings that are at or above 2019 levels, as we emerge stronger. With that operator, we are ready to take Q&A. Thanks, Dara. As I mentioned, in the script, I think we've got ample flexibility through both the way in which we've been managing the balance sheet. And when we think about the cash generation prospects for the next few years to manage any scenario, we continue to believe that we have a very strong case and unlikely to have to consider that worst case scenario. But the work we've done, really beginning last year to organize our debt portfolio in a way that gives us more flexibility. And when we take that into consideration, along with the cash will generate in the next two to three years, I think we feel pretty confident we can take care of just about any scenario. Yes, thanks. So, I don't think we're fixed on a number that's necessarily linked to 2019. Given a couple of factors, number one, the work that we have highlighted, we are doing around efficiency. We believe that there's a tremendous opportunity for us to drive greater efficiency across the marketing spend portfolio, and particularly in the enabling area. Secondly, we've also become I think, a lot more flexible. We've learned a lot in the last year that allows us to, so to speak, turn the tap on and off with much greater fluency than perhaps we've done in the past. And then thirdly, as you look at the marketing landscape, the mix of spending that will be required market-to-market is going to evolve. And we need to be flexible in order to handle that. So net-net is we will continue to focus on what our markets need, both in total investment terms, as well as in the mix of spend that's appropriate for each of these markets. We will continue to drive the kind of efficiency that we now know is available to us. And I think we land in whatever landing spot that means in terms of total dollars, but I think we've got a good handle on both being efficient, being effective and investing appropriately as markets recover across the world. Andrea, let me take that. One on the expense savings, we had highlighted in our release last year, an expected benefit of between $350 million and $550 million. And we're on track to deliver that. Some of it falls into this year, some of it will fall into the first part of next year, kind of aligned to the progress that we make on the implementation of the new model. So that's on the expenses. And on the whole topic of RGM, the past year has actually I think, highlighted even more than ever the importance of having this as a key part of our top line algorithm. I don't expect us to have material changes in how we go about it. We're very clear on the drivers at the local market level, when it comes to both pricing and its relationship with inflation, and having the right packaging architecture to enable us to manage as in an optimal way, the conditions of any given market. And if anything, I think our teams around the world are even more focused on that area, as a way to navigate a path forward that allows us to deliver on the revenue objectives that we've outlined."

If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then re-enter the queue. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks Tim and good morning everyone. In the third quarter, we saw ongoing improvement and progress. While our business continued to be affected by lockdowns in some markets, especially in places with strong exposure to the away-from-home channels we are encouraged by the response and execution of our system. Together with our bottlers, we continue to focus on winning as the world reopens. We've moved quickly to address the near-term realities and we are working to deliver on the priorities we outlined in our second quarter call. I'm also inspired each and every day by what I see from our associates their resilience, their drive, and their pride in this great system. They're working purposefully to serve our consumers and customers and to do it safely. They are making a difference in the communities around the world, and for this and much more, I offer my sincerest thanks and appreciation. Today, I'll provide an update on the quarter including where we're seeing the most improvements in our business and where recovery is moving at slow pace. Also I'll share some thoughts on the remainder of the year and as we look forward to 2021. Then I'll share progress we're already making to emerge stronger. And finally, I'll hand over to John to discuss the quarter in more detail including how we continue to execute in this challenging environment. In the third quarter, we continued to rebound from the pressures we experienced at the peak of the lockdown as the world generally moves into the recovery phase. That said, the trajectory of our business trends continue to be closely linked to the size of our away-from-home business in any given country and the level of the lockdowns in the market. From the 25% volume decline that we saw in April, the mid-single-digit declines through the summer, and the low single-digit decline since September, our volume trends have continued to improve. Much of the sequential improvement has been driven by the away-from-home channels, which represent roughly half of our business globally. Our away-from-home volume was down in the mid-teens in the quarter, a significant improvement from the April lows which approached 50% declines. This was driven by the agility of our sales teams throughout the system and the efforts to create value for our customers during the gradual reopening phase. We are seeing the away-from-home recovery starting to stabilize given the ongoing restrictions in many regions. Our at-home channels also saw an acceleration throughout the quarter. Specifically, grocery and e-commerce channels continue to experience solid demand benefiting both from shifts in consumer behavior and our system's actions to capture those opportunities. The system is working jointly to manage the supply and distribution shifts make key decisions around portfolio priorities and leverage digital data to identify new outlets to further growth. We continue to see progress, but the environment remains dynamic and it is not a straight-line recovery around the world different markets are seeing varying degrees of impact. In EMEA, at-home channels continued to perform well and sparkling soft drinks and juices remained resilient. Volume improved in away-from-home channels throughout the quarter as activities resumed with limitations. In Latin America, volume improved as government restrictions eased. Specifically, Brazil continues to be an outperformer. But economic pressures remain and our recovery in Mexico has been slower than expected. Moving to North America, strong performance in at-home channels was offset by continued softness in our foodservice business. While some away-from-home channels have been slower to recover, we benefited from traffic improvements in channels like convenience retail and quick service restaurants. Importantly, digital partnerships with restaurants and aggregators to optimize menus have resulted in a four-point increase in attachment rates and digital commerce retail sales have more than doubled year-to-date outpacing the category. In Asia-Pacific, China is well on its way to emerge stronger driven by solid performance in sparkling's soft drinks. Recovery efforts in India and Japan continue and we have seen meaningful improvement in the face of ongoing restrictions. Global Ventures remains pressured, but has seen a significant improvement from Q2 with organic revenues improving by over 30 points. Our Costa retail stores, one of the most affected parts of our company at the peak of the global lockdowns, are now almost entirely open. While traffic is unlikely to fully recover in the near-term, our First One on Us campaign has shown promising signs driving over one million new consumers to the Costa app. We continue our journey to be a global multi-platform coffee company under the Costa brand. Across our channels and regions, our brand portfolio is working hard to return to pre-COVID levels of growth and we have made progress in the quarter. For example trademark Coke delivered volume growth in Q3. We also saw growth in local champions like Simply and fairlife in the U.S. and Thums Up in India. With the NARTD category continuing to be affected by a shift to at-home channels, our underlying strength in value share this quarter was more than offset by the negative mix in away-from-home where we tend to have stronger share positions. Clicking down, we are seeing positive share momentum in EMEA and Latin America including gains in sparkling soft drinks. In fact, trademark Coca-Cola saw share gains in 80% of our top markets globally this quarter. Share gains are a key metric of our determination to emerge stronger, and we are intent on recapturing lost ground and more through the recovery phase. In summary, we are encouraged by the improvement in our business. However, it's important to remember the world is in a fragile state. We've seen reopening trends begin to moderate, and the away-from-home recovery showed signs of stalling in September with the increase of restrictions in several markets. There is potential for increased regional lockdowns as we enter colder seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. We don't expect to return to the peak levels of global lockdown, but we are prepared for setbacks due to the local spikes in cases and targeted restrictions and closures. The pandemic has been a catalyst for change for our company, but the initial work behind our strategic transformation was in motion for some time before the crisis hit. We've been challenging legacy ways of doing business and the pandemic helped us realize we could be bolder in our efforts. Last quarter, we highlighted five priorities to accelerate our transformation. We set out to optimize our portfolio and instill more discipline in our innovation approach, coupled with more effective marketing, stepped-up revenue growth management and execution, and enhanced system collaboration. We also said we'll evolve our organization and invest in capabilities to ensure we can bring the strategy to life. We're moving swiftly to deliver against those priorities with our goal to reach pre-COVID growth levels ahead of the economic recovery. Firstly, we set out to position our portfolio for success, focusing on scaled growth through targeted resource allocation and optimization. Over the past few months, a cross-functional team has worked to identify the right brands for a growth portfolio that will drive quality leadership and help us achieve our Beverages for Life ambitions. We have finalized the master brands in this growth portfolio, which consists of about 200 global regional and local brands that will allow us to remain truly consumer-centric, focusing on those brands that can be scaled to drive profits for the long-term. For the brands who are not selected, we have begun the work with our bottlers to quickly sunset or thoughtfully transition them to one of the growth brands over the next year. Secondly, our marketing transformation is also underway. We have undertaken a global initiative to improve marketing efficiency and effectiveness, jointly led by our marketing, procurement and finance teams. This is a top priority and the initial work to date has validated the opportunity to sustainably reduce our spend via proven procurement methodologies and other efficiency levers, while maintaining and improving marketing effectiveness. Importantly, this is not a top-down-driven exercise to reduce expenses. There is no savings target. Rather by improving our processes, eliminating duplication and optimizing spend on things like third-party agencies, we will increase our effectiveness and be able to fuel reinvestment in our brands. When it comes to innovation, we're focusing on bigger, more scalable bets. And to be clear, this strategy does not mean less innovation overall. Already this mindset is showing results. Year-to-date, revenue contribution from innovation is higher than last year and the amount of revenue per innovation has doubled. Innovation will come in different forms. We can leverage a trademark to expand the category like we're doing with Coke Energy. We can also create a brand like AHA to participate in a growing category or subcategory. And we can also expand our addressable market by entering a new category like we've done so with Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, which debuted last month in select cities across Latin America with more markets coming soon including the U.S. Ultimately, we're combining discipline with agility to win drinkers share and profits. We continue to experiment on a local level and our new approach allows us to move faster to find and scale our best initiatives. We have a robust pipeline in the works for next year and expect innovation to continue to contribute meaningfully to our growth going forward. And as we adapt our organization, we continue to apply our enhanced revenue growth management capabilities, provide beverage options at the right price and for the occasion consumers are looking for and to bring new drinkers to our brands. We are also strengthening our bottling partnerships across the system to enhance execution across channels. In order to ensure the structure of our company facilitates the success of our accelerated strategy, we're becoming a more networked organization that will combine the power of scale with deep knowledge to win locally. We expect this new networked model to be established and functioning at the beginning of the next year and Platform Services will be fully integrated, standardized and scaled over the course of next year. We're streamlining from 17 business units to nine operating units, which will accelerate decision-making while maintaining local market execution. We've announced five global category leads to steer the new marketing model and ensure relentless consumer focus on brands that can be scaled to even stronger positions. We're also creating a new Platform Services organization, which will be a critical enabler in supporting a networked web-working. It will be a collection of 10 areas of expertise, known as hubs that will partner with the operating units, categories and the center to develop capabilities and services needed to support their strategies as well as enable collaboration and execution. Our people are confident and engaged in this transformation and an enterprise mindset is taking hold. Our new leadership teams have been formed, and there are clear job descriptions to ensure accountability across functions. The changes to our structure will result in reallocation and a reduction in the number of associates. This is underway through a combination of voluntary separation programs as well as some level of involuntary reductions. Although these changes are never easy, I am certain they will allow us to emerge stronger. In addition, to executing on the five priorities, environmental, social and governance initiatives, always remain at the forefront of our minds and actions. Our ESG goals are embedded in how we operate as a business and we will continue to make progress across our key sustainability initiatives including our World Without Waste goals. For example, across markets representing 30% of our global volume we now have introduced 100% recycled plastic packaging options in at least one brand and this has grown even during the pandemic. And last month, The Netherlands and Norway became the second and third markets after Sweden to announce they will manufacture the entire local portfolio in 100% recycled PET. In the U.S., we continue to join other stakeholders in supporting policies to drive improved packaging collection and demand for recycled material such as California's new mandatory recycled-content legislation. In recognition of the importance of this topic to our company, and I know to many of you as well, I hope you will join us for our virtual ESG Investor Day on November 13th. To sum up, we are continuing to navigate through the uncertainties of the global pandemic. We are heading to a phase where the world is adapting to a new way of living with COVID. The progress we've made on accelerating our strategic transformation will give us the focus and flexibility to manage our business and execute with excellence today and to set ourselves up for better results in the long run. With that, I'll pass it over to you John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to comment on our third quarter performance and give perspective on the financial implications of our structural changes and new operating model. I'll also provide some additional context on our outlook. In the third quarter, I am pleased to report that our focus and flexibility enabled us to drive sequential improvement from the second quarter. Our organic revenue performance was down 6% driven by price/mix down 3% and concentrate sales down 4%. This quarter's performance compares to a 26% organic revenue decline in the second quarter. While most of that improvement came in the form of better volume trends, we also saw improved price/mix particularly when you look at this on a two-year average. Comparable gross margin contracted by about 140 basis points. This was primarily driven by continued albeit less pressure from our channel mix between away-from-home and at-home in addition to currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin expanded by approximately 230 basis points due to ongoing cost management offsetting the pressure from the top line. While our marketing spend remained below last year's levels, we did increase it sequentially and in a targeted way as we saw recovery in the business. We continue to monitor the effectiveness of spend with the goal of investing ahead of recovery. Below operating income we saw a strong sequential improvement in many of our equity stakes as our bottlers have quickly moved to adapt to the changes. Therefore, third quarter comparable EPS of $0.55 declined 2% year-over-year. This was better than our internal expectations, given stronger-than-anticipated volume trends in September and the improved equity income. While the pandemic has weighed on our cash from operations year-to-date, we saw significant sequential improvement in the third quarter and remain intensely focused on the free cash flow opportunities ahead. These include further progress in our working capital initiatives and being better stewards of our capital spend. While much has changed this year with the onset of the pandemic, our focus on converting top line growth to maximize returns has not. The changes we are making will lead us to more efficient and productive spending. These include our organizational restructuring, streamlined portfolio, disciplined innovation and optimized marketing approach. As James mentioned we're streamlining our master brands by approximately 50%, which significantly reduces complexity with an impact of less than 1% to top line and profits. We expect this impact to be more than offset over time by the benefits of greater focus on our growth brands. The combination of voluntary separation programs and involuntary reductions are estimated to result in expenses ranging from approximately $350 million to $550 million. While we are not defining a targeted level of cost savings historically in these scenarios we have seen a similar level of savings as compared to the cost of the programs. These actions will help us achieve a structure that is designed for growth, which in turn will fuel reinvestment to drive top line and margins for the long-term. Said another way the strategic priorities we've accelerated are designed to drive results that get us back to our long-term growth algorithm as fast as possible. In our last call, we talked about adapting to the various phases of the pandemic focusing on what we can manage and control and not getting ahead of ourselves with regard to when things might return to normal. We see no reason to change this approach for the remainder of the year. Different countries around the world are going through different phases. Some still dealing with the first wave, others dealing with or expecting a second wave and their respective governments taking a variety of approach. All of which means continued uncertainty regarding the pandemic and the macroeconomic picture. So within this context we will continue to hold off on providing more detailed guidance today. Having said that there are important factors to consider for the fourth quarter. We will be benefiting from two extra days in the quarter. To the degree that away-from-home channels are impacted by targeted restrictions, we would expect price/mix pressure to continue due to channel and package mix. This mix shift in our business will also continue to have implications for gross margins. We will continue to be prudent in our marketing expenditures, but stepping up investment in a targeted way ahead of recovery with a more efficient and effective approach. As we noted in our release, we expect a currency headwind of approximately 3% to the top line and approximately 9% to comparable operating income in the fourth quarter based on current spot rates and our hedge positions. Looking at today's rates and hedge positions at this stage the currency impact would be minimal as we head into next year. Coming out of an unusual year like 2020 will surely have implications for 2021. It is fair to assume that 2021 will have several considerations including the cycling of 2020 impacts, the step-up in discretionary spending as well as the strategic acceleration initiatives we've outlined. While it's too early to provide specific commentary, our actions give us increased confidence to recover faster than the broader economic recovery. We will provide more insight as part of our fourth quarter call. As we think about the long-term, we will continue our journey to improve cash flow where we had made much progress last year, as well as focus on asset optimization with a goal to becoming asset-right over time. Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have confidence in the health of our system as we emerge from the peak of lockdowns across the globe. System health is crucial to our success. We also remain committed to our dividend policy and balance sheet goals. We recognize the dividend is important to our investor base and continue to believe our long-term model can deliver the cash necessary to reinvest to grow the business while also supporting the dividend. We will continue to work to return to a dividend payout ratio as a percentage of free cash flow that approaches 75% over time. The acceleration of our strategy and the progress James outlined today will help drive long-term top and bottom line growth, not only for us but for the entire Coke system. The challenges that we faced during this pandemic are by no means, in the rearview mirror. Nevertheless, we are seeing promising signs, that the actions we're taking have put us on track to equip the organization and the data system to win. We are confident that we will return to the high-end of our long-term growth model. And do so having made an impact, with our stakeholders and having gained consumers' share and improved system economics. With that operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Thank you, Operator, and good morning everyone.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nBryan Spillane: So John, maybe you want to pick up a little bit on some of the commentary related to the outlook and into 2021. And I understand it's early. But I think a lot of investors are trying to figure out or -- the game, how quickly you can get back to the high watermark so kind of 2019 levels and kind of what that path looks like in 2021. So maybe if you could help us a little bit with, some of the puts and takes I guess for next year. There's going to be some cost savings. There's some discretionary spend that might have to come back, so maybe if you could just kind of help us a little bit with, what those building blocks will look like for next year.\nJohn Murphy: Sure. Bryan thanks for the question. It's still early and there's as we talked on the call a fair degree of uncertainty remaining. And we'll have certainly a lot more to visibility I think when we get to the fourth quarter call. In the meantime, as we just discussed 2021 will be an unusual year. We're cycling a number of unusual impacts from this year. We will see a step-up in our discretionary spending, as we go into the fourth quarter and into the first half of next year. And we're also going to I believe see the benefit from the strategic initiatives that we have outlined in the July and on this morning's call. Our new organizational structure will be, well in place at that stage. So I would anchor our spending in 2021 going into 2022 off our 2019 base, and take into account the actions that we have discussed to both drive the top line and to drive greater efficiency, across the organization. And we'll be in a position to talk more in detail, on the Q4 call.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. And I wanted to talk maybe a little bit longer term, because you have announced and have been discussing on today's call just a tremendous amount of change that, you're introducing not just to your organization immediately, but also to the broader system, all at a time when everyone needs to be nimble and quick in adapting to what's right in front of them and the near-term reality. So, I guess one, could you just talk a little bit about what you're hearing across the system, in terms of comfort, or excitement, or fear about the changes, the ability to absorb? And then also, how may you describe kind of your long-term view? Pre-COVID you were already optimistic. Post-COVID we're looking at a world maybe with a smaller footprint and smaller traffic around away-from-home. So how would you describe kind of your long-term view today versus maybe what it was 12 months ago? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Look, the headline is, we're more confident today, in the long-term growth potential of the company and the bottling system than we were pre-COVID. And the reason I say that is, look as we came into the crisis, we'd obviously done a lot of things reinvested in Coke re-franchised. And we had launched the total beverage strategy with Beverages for Life. And we were starting to get traction. We were starting to see the business both the company and the bottlers get up towards the higher end of our long-term growth model and come off several years, of good revenue growth and starting to see the earnings take off in dollar terms for the company, in EPS and for the bottlers as well. And building off that strategy of Beverages for Life, the actions we're taking this year really being very focused on what are the brands that can take us into the future. As John said, we're going to we're letting go half more -- slightly more than half of the brand, so we can focus on those with the greatest potential. They account for a relatively small amount of revenue and profit, but they take up a disproportionate to that amount of time, process and shelf space. So the focus on, the portfolio the updating and change to the marketing model, as John mentioned, not just the efficiency but the effectiveness of the model, with the new organization, with the new networked organization and with the Platform Services. These actions are helping us not just adapt and prosper within the COVID crisis and clearly Q3 was better than Q2. But it's giving us confidence that, we are not only going to emerge from this crisis ahead of the economy overall in a stronger position, but we will be even better setup to drive the Beverages for Life strategy going forward. And I think you can see that play through from the company, into the bottlers. Yes, every country is not equal. But a simple sign is that our third quarter was better, because our equity income was better, which is a direct result of the bottler is doing better in the third quarter. So I think the way the system grasped the nettle in March and April and rapidly shared the learnings, and shared the adaptation strategies has paid dividends for the company and the bottlers during the crisis. And I think we are well set up and are all collectively being proactive in setting ourselves up to be stronger, when this ends whether that's because the bottlers are going to intersect with the upgraded marketing, with deeper execution against revenue growth management, and local execution. Everyone is very focused on the efficiency of the supply chain and the rationalization of the product portfolio will pay dividends through the bottling supply chain. The idea of moving resources from the kind of -- the back office on to the feet on the street will pay dividends in the bottling system. So I think you see a system in sync philosophically. And driving the changes needed to both win in the crisis and emerge stronger. And I believe we're in a better position the company and the bottlers today to be stronger in the long term than we were precrisis. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. \nNik Modi: Yes, good morning everyone. So James I was wondering if you could just help us understand just kind of two things. Some of the work we've done with just local players are making some inroads in terms of market share and this is mainly in the emerging markets. So I want to understand the tension between your kind of SKU footprint or your brand footprint and the need to be local so you can compete with some of these local competitors. And then just -- I guess I wanted more clarity on what's the timeline? Like how do you think about the failing fast phenomenon that you've been discussing for the past several quarters, how much time are you going to give new initiatives before you decide you're going to ax them? Because sometimes you have to stick with an idea to kind of build it, but I just wanted to get your perspective around that. \nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean market share -- firstly our headline approach on market share is to win in the channels that are open. I mean it's -- we've talked about it on the last quarter it's clear. And so we have a stronger position in away-from-home channels and a higher share in away-from-home channels than we have in at-home channels and therefore mechanically as those have closed down and locked down we kind of mechanically lose share. So what we have focused on is to say to the system we must focus on winning share in the channels that are open. Because then as the world recovers -- and I'm a strong believer that as the world recovers with the fact that we are social animals means we will mix and mingle. Some of these channels will evolve and not -- they won't all come back in the same way, but away-from-home will come back and humans will go out and socialize and do lots of things. Because they want the experiences they're not going to stay stuck at home. So it will come back. So we're focused on winning share in the channels that are open and so we have been winning share in the -- for the at-home channels. And that is true across the board. That's true across many, many, many of the countries. It's very rare to win in every country all the time, but we have been winning broadly across the world in the at-home channel. And so -- and I think you've seen commentary about how bigger brands and people have been returning to the brands they know and love from other categories and other sectors too. So I think that that's very much what's going on. And as we look forward to kind of the focus on going forward the reduction of the portfolio by about half is actually going to allow us to bring more stronger innovation to the table. This is not about less innovation and less ability to tap into local insights it's actually about leveraging the most successful vehicles to do that. So already this year, we have seen the revenue per innovation double versus what we had last year. So it is about combining the platforms and the global and regional brands and the platforms to connect to local insights and that is part of the art of bringing it to life. And of course in terms of how long do you wait before you pull some of these innovations we have some pretty clear metrics. Of course the first thing is to decide what's the innovation for, what's its objective? It could be -- we talked on the call are we trying to get into a new category, are we trying to get -- are we trying to do a flavor extension on the existing brand, is it a packaging innovation, what sort of innovations are we talking about. But each one has its mission and has its goals and we are very focused on tracking how it's doing and we'll sunset it as and when hope is no longer there or rational hope is no longer there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nSteve Powers: Hey thanks, good morning. Maybe you could pick up on some of what you were speaking to Lauren about and drill down a level. I'm wondering if you could talk about the organization's reaction internally to the announcements made over the last few months just around restructuring and the pivot more formally to a networked model and Platform Services etcetera. I'm curious if you've been able to do any formal feedback or capture any formal feedback from employees in that regard? And if so, if you found the reactions to vary at all by region or function or make you more or less encouraged. Any feedback from the organization at large would be great to hear that? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Look firstly the two big things to say about that. Firstly of course, we have not reached the end of the process. We have gone -- made a decision very early on to make this redesign more in the open. I mean often restructurings are done in the room by a few people and then announced to everyone. That's not what we have done. We have decided that we are going to enroll enlist and engage with a much much broader piece of the organization to make sure the design is what we want. And so therefore you have a more public -- a longer public timeline which is what we're in. We have gone through a large part of the voluntary separation plan, but we have not completely finished the design and we are still working on that. But all of that leads to the obvious conclusion that a lot of the feedback is around uncertainty and when will I know what happens to me which is completely and totally understandable and we are working as fast as we can to provide as much certainty as possible. So that is still ongoing. And as John commented we expect the large majority of all of that to have been completed for the clarity by the end of the year. Some parts of the world not given local consultation requirements. But the -- when you stand back from the restructuring process, when you take the feedback from the employees and we've done surveys and both formal and informal, in the end you're going to end up with two types of feedback. You're either going to get a type of feedback which is, I don't understand what we're trying to do or I don't understand how we're going to do it yet. And the very encouraging thing about where we've got to so far is, there's a great deal of clarity in the employee base around the strategic reasons to do what we're doing and how it will help improve and drive the business. And there's a -- certainly from the people that have been announced leaders at the top piece of their network they have -- they also have that very clear and are very energized about bringing it to life. So the majority of the questions the vast majority of the questions are on how is it going to come to life and of course what does this mean to me which is an encouraging sign. It's a natural reaction, but it's also an encouraging sign that this is on track to deliver the sorts of benefits and support the ability of the company and the system to drive the top line. And the feedback from the bottlers is also positive on how this will help them and we will collectively as a system be stronger. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. \nDara Mohsenian: Hi, good morning. So James I was hoping to review the restructuring program in a bit more detail. First, maybe just can you give us a sense and help us better understand how the program came about. How much of the reorganization plans that were announced were in process pre-COVID or are already in the back of your mind and would play out over time versus how much impact COVID may have had on changing your plans?  And then conceptually just to help us give us some perspective for how significant you think changes under this program will be operationally in your organization maybe a sense relative to past restructurings and sort of your enthusiasm for the ultimate fundamental as well as execution payback from the program. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. The thinking behind where we're going predates COVID. In fact, we had a senior leadership meeting with the top 200 in February before the crisis became completely apparent where we started to talk about what would it take to bring a much more networked organization to life and started to talk about some of the dimensions. So the idea of the reorganization, the purpose of being a networked organization predates COVID.  And it's a logical consequence from starting to bring the Beverages for Life strategy to life no pun intended. So it is very much a continuation of where we're going. It's an agenda item that was clear. It was coming. Obviously in February, we were at the relative beginning stages. What the time of COVID particularly Q2 what that did to influence the program was really a couple of things. One, it was clear that when we took the actions to refocus the system on safety and continuity of supply in Q2, the clarity of moving quickly on refocusing on fewer SKUs and the boldness of those decisions are paid off very quickly. And the insight was not just that, but the ability of the organization to act with speed was very encouraging. That led us to conclude that we should accelerate even in the course of the pandemic the move to the networked organization and really drive that forward and push that on. And so that's what we've done.  As I just said on the last call, we're largely through it. Of course, the other thing that came out of pandemic was a decision to try and make it as enrolling and engaging with the organization as possible even at the risk of having a longer period of uncertainty because the design is more in the public. And I think that has proven to be very powerful in helping us optimize the design of what we want. And so that increases our confidence level that it will be another key component to helping us emerge stronger from the crisis and get up to the top range of the long-term growth model. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Carlos Laboy with HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nCarlos Laboy: Yes. Good morning, everyone. James you have several new presidents including new heads for the U.S., Latin America and Europe. How might their respective divisions change under their new leadership? What might be some of the top opportunities that you wish for each of these individuals to focus on? \nJames Quincey: Yes. They're not all new to the parts of the world they're in. Obviously, Nikolaos who is leading Europe was leading EMEA before which obviously included Europe. So very much in the case of Europe, which was doing very well. Nikolaos represents a great deal of strategic continuity. And obviously self-evidently in the case of Europe we have the challenges of not just the expansion of the portfolio and success in the categories, but also the recovery of the away-from-home channel. So -- but there's a great deal of leadership continuity in Europe.  In the case of Latin America, Henrique who's now leading Latin America was leading the Brazilian business and Brazil is the star performer so far this year. And that is not just a consequence of the actions they've been taking in the short-term. The Brazilian system us with the bottlers have been very focused on responding to what several years ago was a very deep recession or depression in the Brazilian economy doubling down on the brand portfolio, doubling down on affordability through big investments with the bottlers in returnable packaging looking at execution and coolers. And that is paying dividends this year and helping drive Brazil to be the best-performing business unit so far in terms of absolute growth. And so Henrique deeply knows Latin America and the strategic challenges that we have there and will be fully capable to lead there.  And then Alfredo is coming in to the U.S., where we have been on a good track in terms of driving the portfolio and gaining share in the U.S. business. And certainly, we're hoping to continue the best of everything that was happening in the U.S. before, but also infuse it with some of the thinking from Latin America whether that be around revenue growth management particularly in the economic times we're in, some of the sharpness on the portfolio and on the margins and working with the bottlers as well on the supply chain. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. John, a quick housekeeping question. And then James, a question on seltzers. So the housekeeping question is you indicated marketing spend was below last year's levels, but sort of picking up sequentially. Can you frame the magnitude for us either year-over-year or as a percent of sales?  James, the broader question is on the Topo Chico launch in hard seltzers specifically in the U.S. Just maybe spend a little bit of time how the agreement with Molson Coors came about and why you determined they're the right partner? How the Coca-Cola Company is defining success in the category? Is there a specific market share ambition? And then more broadly how do you plan to differentiate in an increasingly crowded category what is Topo Chico's proverbial right to win? So thanks to offer all that.\nJohn Murphy : First, the housekeeper here. 30% decline year-over-year. But Q3 and Q2, showed -- I don't have the number exactly in front of me but showed about 65% on 30% from Q3 over Q2. So we continue to look at that sequential improvement Kevin quarter-to-quarter. And I'd expect Q4 based on what we're seeing around the world to \u2013 for us to continue to have targeted investments in those markets where it makes sense to do so. And as I said earlier, as you look at 2021, I would encourage you to think about 2019 as an anchor. And then from there factor in the work that we have underway on the marketing area, particularly marketing innovation to drive greater efficiency. We know there's a lot of opportunity when you wire the organization together. And the way we're doing it, it unlocks a lot of opportunity for us to do the same with less or to do more with the same. And that is \u2013 that will be the part of the strategy conversation going into 2021, as to which of the approaches we take on a market-by-market basis.\nJames Quincey: Yes Topo Chico. We're very excited about opportunities in Topo Chico. Obviously, it's a fantastic sparkling mineral water brand and has done very well. The U.S. situation is very unique and specific. Clearly our starting position for innovations is to work with our bottling system. The best result is much more likely in terms of scale and profit to be the nexus between brands that the company owns and drives and go through the bottling system, and that's how we're approaching the Topo Chico Hard Seltzer outside the U.S. In the U.S., it's very specifically driven by the nature of the regulation of the beer market or the alcohol market in the U.S. And many of you I'm sure are familiar with the 3-tier system for the U.S. marketplace, which is unique to the U.S. So we're launching in Latin America with our bottlers. But as it relates to the U.S., we have to find a path within in the 3-tier system. And so that's why we've looked for an external partner or more specifically a partner already in the alcohol industry. It also relates to the fact that having someone who is an existing brewer is a much easier supply chain path into the category. And it also happens to be the case that the network of distributors the Molson Coors has also connects with some of the parallel businesses of people who are connected to the Coke system. So the U.S. structure is very specific to the U.S. regulatory requirements and to the partners who we think can help us drive what's needed for Topo Chico. How do we find success? This is going to be an explorer brand from us. I mean we are for sure clear that what we don't know about the alcohol and Hard Seltzer category is more than what we do know. And we need to continue to work our way to understand these opportunities as much as we did with Lemon-Do in Japan, starting small, learning and then expanding as we got success. And so we will take a very similar approach in the U.S. with Topo Chico Hard Seltzer as to working exactly what connects with consumers and what connects with retailers. And in terms of differentiation, clearly there's going to be differentiation through the flavors, through the product itself, through the packaging. But also I think it builds on a tremendous strength. I mean Topo Chico is still growing fantastically across the U.S. and is the leading sparkling water brand in places like Texas. So I think that the brand itself is an established iconic interesting brand for the consumers that are interested in Hard Seltzer. So I think it's everything there indicates that it should be a great opportunity, we just need to bring it to life.\nJohn Murphy: And Kevin just to clarify, when I said the 65%, 65% was Q2 over prior year and Q3 was 30%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. And so my question is more on what you can control on the reinvestment commentary in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year. John, should we be thinking that would continue to be fully financed by the restructuring savings? In other words, should we expect your operating margins to continue to move in the right direction in 2021, given the cost savings and the mix improving? Thank you.\nJohn Murphy: So I think we need to \u2013 you need to think about 2020 as being a very unusual year in which we have obviously been able to manage very tightly our cost base through the pandemic and particularly through the worst phases of it, which in turn has allowed us to deliver operating margin improvements that are out of the normal pattern you would expect. I would encourage you to think about our long-term growth model has been the \u2013 again the anchor. Embedded in our long-term growth model is a belief that we can over time continue to expand margins. And the actions that we are taking, which will have an impact in 2021 going into 2022 also, those actions are I believe will allow us to deliver on that algorithm as we go forward. So again, 2021 versus 2020, we're going to be cycling an unusual set of circumstances. And I think that needs to be appropriately factored in to the models that you will be deploying.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning. Can you just give me \u2013 give us a little more color on the master brand reduction. And when I say that I understand that it's only 1% of kind of total revenue but maybe where that's dispersed in terms of is there one geography that's going to see more cuts? Is there a bigger hit, as we're kind of looking at our models from certain areas? And then also just trying to understand these \u2013 I know they don't generate a lot of revenue but they certainly are occupying some shelf space. So how quickly can you replace that shelf space? Or is there any risk that that shelf space is taken by competitors who see some free space? Or just help me understand kind of the color on how it really affects the revenue model over the next maybe six to 12 months.\nJames Quincey: Yeah. So the brands themselves are distributed across the categories probably slightly more in the hydration space than any of the other -- of sparkling coffee and tea or juice dairy and plant. But the brands are distributed across all the different categories. They tend to be much more local in terms of brands. And so two things are going to happen. One, there's going to be some brands we're going to retire. But there are some brands where the better answer is to transition it into one of the regional brands. So it might be we have a strong regional juice brand and then there's a local brand in one market and we're going to transition it into the regional brand because it's going to be much more efficient and effective to leverage the marketing and the innovation but from that regional brand rather than repeating everything into the local brand. So the -- we're talking mainly about the very tail and a much more local brand tail but brands that are spread across multiple categories. Clearly our objective is to convert the shelf space from these brands into ones that we own. Some of that has already effectively happened because of COVID. In the Q2 in particular in order to preserve the effectiveness of the supply chain, we already stopped making a set of SKUs including some of the brands and captured that shelf space for our main brands. Other places where it's a transition from a local brand to a regional or a global brand clearly we'll be managing that with the customers so we would not expect to lose shelf space. I think in simple terms of the revenue model, the benefits -- I would think about it is the benefits we're going to get from freeing up that shelf space and freeing up the process and innovation time of those brands should be made up by -- at least made up by existing global or regional brands. And I would not -- I certainly am not starting to think that this is a headwind to results in the next six to 12 months I would just assume that we're going to make it all up with the portfolio we have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. A couple of questions on some of your commentary. When you are talking about being at the high end of your algorithm, because of the structural changes that you've made, or more because as we go into 2021 obviously there's a very unique comparison for this year? And also I believe the commentary for share repurchase is new. If that's the case can you maybe just provide a little more context on what you're seeing in terms of cash flow and balance sheet that makes you feel comfortable to be talking about a potential share repurchase at this juncture? Thank you.\nJohn Murphy: So let me take that. On the last point there's actually no change in our views on share repurchase. I think it's very consistent with what we've talked about on previous calls, our priorities as we look ahead are to reinvest in the business and to continue to support the dividend. We continue to have an opportunistic view on the M&A front, although don't expect a whole lot on that on the horizon there. And share repos have really -- was our number fourth on the on the priority list and we expect them to stay there for the foreseeable future. So that's on that point. Regarding the higher end of the algorithm, yeah, I think 2021 is -- we're going to be cycling a set of unusual factors. My view on the algorithm I think James will share this too is that we're talking about getting back to the higher end of the algorithm. As you think about the -- over the next -- over the mid-term. So the higher end when I think about the algorithm I'm looking at a 2022 versus 2019. 2021 versus 2020 is going to produce a not usual set I think of results. But that's to be expected given what's happened particularly in Q2 and in Q3.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you. Just a point of clarification on the brand reduction what kind of impact will that have if any on working capital? And does that help you get where you want to go? And then my main question is on trademark Coke, which looked very, very strong. Can you give us more color on that, what you're doing to grow share despite the fact that you brought advertising down and where you see the brand equity today compared to last year? Thank you.\nJohn Murphy: Let me take the working capital question. Minimal impact overall. There's a real opportunity here to clean up our internal supply chain end-to-end. So when you think about the amount of small purchases that are required to support these brands that are -- that represent the long end of the tail it's a pretty sizable number, but relative to our overall working capital it's not that material. But it certainly gives us a little bit of a tailwind as we go into 2021.\nJames Quincey: Yeah on Coke, I mean, look firstly, while we have been judicious in our use of marketing spend in Q2 particularly but also in Q3 we have continued to market including marketing strongly behind the Coke brand. So we have continued to market. Clearly that's also been linked by great work with the bottlers on some revenue growth management, particularly affordability plays in some parts of the world, adjusting the portfolio, the packaging portfolio given the skew to at-home channels in many other parts of the world, good local execution. So there is continued focus and investment behind Coke. And I think that's clearly paying dividends as we've gone from Q2 to Q3. So as you pointed out in Q3 Coke is growing. Coke is gaining share. And that is also being powered by an ongoing focus on Coke Zero Sugar where that grew high single digits in the third quarter in terms of volume. So we are clearly continuing to invest behind Coke among many of the other brands. And we see the brand responding and doing well and believe as we increase investment into the fourth quarter and into 2021, that Coke will continue to be a motor of growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBonnie Herzog: Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I just had a quick question on North America. Your price/mix in the quarter was especially strong relative to expectations. So could you drill down a little bit more on the key drivers of the strength, especially, since it looks like you took some pricing? And then, really, how should we think about this going forward in the context of mix and, especially, if we see some of the pressures in the on-premise channel getting better? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. Yes. Obviously, it was pleasing in the third quarter to see the price/mix from North America. Firstly, that was -- got a big component being driven by our focus on some of the premium offerings, whether that be Simply or fairlife which -- and some of the finished goods businesses we own. So, obviously, there's a sort of -- there's good news, because we're driving premium categories or subcategories, but also recognize that some of that is finished goods products that we are selling. And that offset some of the pressures we feel in fountain channels and in other away-from-home channels. So it's good news. I'm not sure that we'll always do 4%, but it's being driven in part by this mix effect of the different finished goods versus non-finished goods and fountain business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sean King from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nSean King: Good morning. You said that FX would have a minimal impact on your preliminary 2021 outlook. I guess how much variability could still exist? And are you hedged on the G10 currencies into 2021 at this point? And then, on top of that any color you can provide on your inflation outlook, given aluminum and freight rising recently.\nJohn Murphy: Yes. So with regard to 2021, we are substantially hedged on the G10 currencies. And as we've discussed in prior calls, the bigger variable and point of volatility is what happens to the large emerging currencies, particularly in Latin America and in Africa. So to the extent that they stay pretty solid and will be in -- as I said, we would see minimal impact. And then, with regard to the commodity situation, this year has been a favorable year for us on the commodity front. And we would expect 2021 based on the latest estimates we have on the various components to be pretty even with 2020. And to your point on aluminum, in particular, there'll be maybe just a slight favorability based on what we see at the moment. We do see on PET, there will be some -- I think some slight increases, but we can manage those with other offsets inside of the cost of goods line.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLaurent Grandet: Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for squeezing me in the lineup. So I got a question about the U.S. fountain business. While the particularity of the U.S. business is that, you own the fountain business and in the current circumstances and with the broader strategy, the reflection you have on your organization, I wanted to understand if you envisage refranchising the fountain business there and managing the same way you do, I mean, outside of the U.S. And what was the rationale to keep it in-house? And how are you adjusting that piece of the business to be more agile and support the overall goal you have set for the company post-COVID? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes. It was a little difficult to hear you there Laurent, but I think you're asking a question about the U.S. fountain business and how it's doing. I mean, clearly, it's a big part of the operation. It's about 30% of the volume in the U.S. and it's a very important package format or channel intersection. Clearly, it's been heavily affected by the COVID crisis. And within that QSRs have clearly been at the better end, whereas things related to transport and amusement have been -- continue to be at the more impacted end. But we very much manage the business not just to do the best for each and every one of the customers that use the fountain equipment, but as one of the packaging formats that brings our brands to life. So the brand strategies are holistic and look across the different packaging formats and different channel formats and we continue to think that that business will be a prosperous business with a good road to recovery. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks. \nJames Quincey: Thank you, operator. So in conclusion, we think during the third quarter we began to see some encouraging signs of recovery from the global lockdown. We also made progress in transforming our organizational structure to better position the Coca-Cola system to pursue our Beverages for Life strategy. These steps will enable us to scale a portfolio of drinks that will help us emerge stronger and win in this ever-changing marketplace. So as always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us today. Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "James Quincey",
            "content": "Thanks Tim and good morning everyone. In the third quarter, we saw ongoing improvement and progress. While our business continued to be affected by lockdowns in some markets, especially in places with strong exposure to the away-from-home channels we are encouraged by the response and execution of our system. Together with our bottlers, we continue to focus on winning as the world reopens. We've moved quickly to address the near-term realities and we are working to deliver on the priorities we outlined in our second quarter call. I'm also inspired each and every day by what I see from our associates their resilience, their drive, and their pride in this great system. They're working purposefully to serve our consumers and customers and to do it safely. They are making a difference in the communities around the world, and for this and much more, I offer my sincerest thanks and appreciation. Today, I'll provide an update on the quarter including where we're seeing the most improvements in our business and where recovery is moving at slow pace. Also I'll share some thoughts on the remainder of the year and as we look forward to 2021. Then I'll share progress we're already making to emerge stronger. And finally, I'll hand over to John to discuss the quarter in more detail including how we continue to execute in this challenging environment. In the third quarter, we continued to rebound from the pressures we experienced at the peak of the lockdown as the world generally moves into the recovery phase. That said, the trajectory of our business trends continue to be closely linked to the size of our away-from-home business in any given country and the level of the lockdowns in the market. From the 25% volume decline that we saw in April, the mid-single-digit declines through the summer, and the low single-digit decline since September, our volume trends have continued to improve. Much of the sequential improvement has been driven by the away-from-home channels, which represent roughly half of our business globally. Our away-from-home volume was down in the mid-teens in the quarter, a significant improvement from the April lows which approached 50% declines. This was driven by the agility of our sales teams throughout the system and the efforts to create value for our customers during the gradual reopening phase. We are seeing the away-from-home recovery starting to stabilize given the ongoing restrictions in many regions. Our at-home channels also saw an acceleration throughout the quarter. Specifically, grocery and e-commerce channels continue to experience solid demand benefiting both from shifts in consumer behavior and our system's actions to capture those opportunities. The system is working jointly to manage the supply and distribution shifts make key decisions around portfolio priorities and leverage digital data to identify new outlets to further growth. We continue to see progress, but the environment remains dynamic and it is not a straight-line recovery around the world different markets are seeing varying degrees of impact. In EMEA, at-home channels continued to perform well and sparkling soft drinks and juices remained resilient. Volume improved in away-from-home channels throughout the quarter as activities resumed with limitations. In Latin America, volume improved as government restrictions eased. Specifically, Brazil continues to be an outperformer. But economic pressures remain and our recovery in Mexico has been slower than expected. Moving to North America, strong performance in at-home channels was offset by continued softness in our foodservice business. While some away-from-home channels have been slower to recover, we benefited from traffic improvements in channels like convenience retail and quick service restaurants. Importantly, digital partnerships with restaurants and aggregators to optimize menus have resulted in a four-point increase in attachment rates and digital commerce retail sales have more than doubled year-to-date outpacing the category. In Asia-Pacific, China is well on its way to emerge stronger driven by solid performance in sparkling's soft drinks. Recovery efforts in India and Japan continue and we have seen meaningful improvement in the face of ongoing restrictions. Global Ventures remains pressured, but has seen a significant improvement from Q2 with organic revenues improving by over 30 points. Our Costa retail stores, one of the most affected parts of our company at the peak of the global lockdowns, are now almost entirely open. While traffic is unlikely to fully recover in the near-term, our First One on Us campaign has shown promising signs driving over one million new consumers to the Costa app. We continue our journey to be a global multi-platform coffee company under the Costa brand. Across our channels and regions, our brand portfolio is working hard to return to pre-COVID levels of growth and we have made progress in the quarter. For example trademark Coke delivered volume growth in Q3. We also saw growth in local champions like Simply and fairlife in the U.S. and Thums Up in India. With the NARTD category continuing to be affected by a shift to at-home channels, our underlying strength in value share this quarter was more than offset by the negative mix in away-from-home where we tend to have stronger share positions. Clicking down, we are seeing positive share momentum in EMEA and Latin America including gains in sparkling soft drinks. In fact, trademark Coca-Cola saw share gains in 80% of our top markets globally this quarter. Share gains are a key metric of our determination to emerge stronger, and we are intent on recapturing lost ground and more through the recovery phase. In summary, we are encouraged by the improvement in our business. However, it's important to remember the world is in a fragile state. We've seen reopening trends begin to moderate, and the away-from-home recovery showed signs of stalling in September with the increase of restrictions in several markets. There is potential for increased regional lockdowns as we enter colder seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. We don't expect to return to the peak levels of global lockdown, but we are prepared for setbacks due to the local spikes in cases and targeted restrictions and closures. The pandemic has been a catalyst for change for our company, but the initial work behind our strategic transformation was in motion for some time before the crisis hit. We've been challenging legacy ways of doing business and the pandemic helped us realize we could be bolder in our efforts. Last quarter, we highlighted five priorities to accelerate our transformation. We set out to optimize our portfolio and instill more discipline in our innovation approach, coupled with more effective marketing, stepped-up revenue growth management and execution, and enhanced system collaboration. We also said we'll evolve our organization and invest in capabilities to ensure we can bring the strategy to life. We're moving swiftly to deliver against those priorities with our goal to reach pre-COVID growth levels ahead of the economic recovery. Firstly, we set out to position our portfolio for success, focusing on scaled growth through targeted resource allocation and optimization. Over the past few months, a cross-functional team has worked to identify the right brands for a growth portfolio that will drive quality leadership and help us achieve our Beverages for Life ambitions. We have finalized the master brands in this growth portfolio, which consists of about 200 global regional and local brands that will allow us to remain truly consumer-centric, focusing on those brands that can be scaled to drive profits for the long-term. For the brands who are not selected, we have begun the work with our bottlers to quickly sunset or thoughtfully transition them to one of the growth brands over the next year. Secondly, our marketing transformation is also underway. We have undertaken a global initiative to improve marketing efficiency and effectiveness, jointly led by our marketing, procurement and finance teams. This is a top priority and the initial work to date has validated the opportunity to sustainably reduce our spend via proven procurement methodologies and other efficiency levers, while maintaining and improving marketing effectiveness. Importantly, this is not a top-down-driven exercise to reduce expenses. There is no savings target. Rather by improving our processes, eliminating duplication and optimizing spend on things like third-party agencies, we will increase our effectiveness and be able to fuel reinvestment in our brands. When it comes to innovation, we're focusing on bigger, more scalable bets. And to be clear, this strategy does not mean less innovation overall. Already this mindset is showing results. Year-to-date, revenue contribution from innovation is higher than last year and the amount of revenue per innovation has doubled. Innovation will come in different forms. We can leverage a trademark to expand the category like we're doing with Coke Energy. We can also create a brand like AHA to participate in a growing category or subcategory. And we can also expand our addressable market by entering a new category like we've done so with Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, which debuted last month in select cities across Latin America with more markets coming soon including the U.S. Ultimately, we're combining discipline with agility to win drinkers share and profits. We continue to experiment on a local level and our new approach allows us to move faster to find and scale our best initiatives. We have a robust pipeline in the works for next year and expect innovation to continue to contribute meaningfully to our growth going forward. And as we adapt our organization, we continue to apply our enhanced revenue growth management capabilities, provide beverage options at the right price and for the occasion consumers are looking for and to bring new drinkers to our brands. We are also strengthening our bottling partnerships across the system to enhance execution across channels. In order to ensure the structure of our company facilitates the success of our accelerated strategy, we're becoming a more networked organization that will combine the power of scale with deep knowledge to win locally. We expect this new networked model to be established and functioning at the beginning of the next year and Platform Services will be fully integrated, standardized and scaled over the course of next year. We're streamlining from 17 business units to nine operating units, which will accelerate decision-making while maintaining local market execution. We've announced five global category leads to steer the new marketing model and ensure relentless consumer focus on brands that can be scaled to even stronger positions. We're also creating a new Platform Services organization, which will be a critical enabler in supporting a networked web-working. It will be a collection of 10 areas of expertise, known as hubs that will partner with the operating units, categories and the center to develop capabilities and services needed to support their strategies as well as enable collaboration and execution. Our people are confident and engaged in this transformation and an enterprise mindset is taking hold. Our new leadership teams have been formed, and there are clear job descriptions to ensure accountability across functions. The changes to our structure will result in reallocation and a reduction in the number of associates. This is underway through a combination of voluntary separation programs as well as some level of involuntary reductions. Although these changes are never easy, I am certain they will allow us to emerge stronger. In addition, to executing on the five priorities, environmental, social and governance initiatives, always remain at the forefront of our minds and actions. Our ESG goals are embedded in how we operate as a business and we will continue to make progress across our key sustainability initiatives including our World Without Waste goals. For example, across markets representing 30% of our global volume we now have introduced 100% recycled plastic packaging options in at least one brand and this has grown even during the pandemic. And last month, The Netherlands and Norway became the second and third markets after Sweden to announce they will manufacture the entire local portfolio in 100% recycled PET. In the U.S., we continue to join other stakeholders in supporting policies to drive improved packaging collection and demand for recycled material such as California's new mandatory recycled-content legislation. In recognition of the importance of this topic to our company, and I know to many of you as well, I hope you will join us for our virtual ESG Investor Day on November 13th. To sum up, we are continuing to navigate through the uncertainties of the global pandemic. We are heading to a phase where the world is adapting to a new way of living with COVID. The progress we've made on accelerating our strategic transformation will give us the focus and flexibility to manage our business and execute with excellence today and to set ourselves up for better results in the long run. With that, I'll pass it over to you John. Good morning. Sure. Look, the headline is, we're more confident today, in the long-term growth potential of the company and the bottling system than we were pre-COVID. And the reason I say that is, look as we came into the crisis, we'd obviously done a lot of things reinvested in Coke re-franchised. And we had launched the total beverage strategy with Beverages for Life. And we were starting to get traction. We were starting to see the business both the company and the bottlers get up towards the higher end of our long-term growth model and come off several years, of good revenue growth and starting to see the earnings take off in dollar terms for the company, in EPS and for the bottlers as well. And building off that strategy of Beverages for Life, the actions we're taking this year really being very focused on what are the brands that can take us into the future. As John said, we're going to we're letting go half more -- slightly more than half of the brand, so we can focus on those with the greatest potential. They account for a relatively small amount of revenue and profit, but they take up a disproportionate to that amount of time, process and shelf space. So the focus on, the portfolio the updating and change to the marketing model, as John mentioned, not just the efficiency but the effectiveness of the model, with the new organization, with the new networked organization and with the Platform Services. These actions are helping us not just adapt and prosper within the COVID crisis and clearly Q3 was better than Q2. But it's giving us confidence that, we are not only going to emerge from this crisis ahead of the economy overall in a stronger position, but we will be even better setup to drive the Beverages for Life strategy going forward. And I think you can see that play through from the company, into the bottlers. Yes, every country is not equal. But a simple sign is that our third quarter was better, because our equity income was better, which is a direct result of the bottler is doing better in the third quarter. So I think the way the system grasped the nettle in March and April and rapidly shared the learnings, and shared the adaptation strategies has paid dividends for the company and the bottlers during the crisis. And I think we are well set up and are all collectively being proactive in setting ourselves up to be stronger, when this ends whether that's because the bottlers are going to intersect with the upgraded marketing, with deeper execution against revenue growth management, and local execution. Everyone is very focused on the efficiency of the supply chain and the rationalization of the product portfolio will pay dividends through the bottling supply chain. The idea of moving resources from the kind of -- the back office on to the feet on the street will pay dividends in the bottling system. So I think you see a system in sync philosophically. And driving the changes needed to both win in the crisis and emerge stronger. And I believe we're in a better position the company and the bottlers today to be stronger in the long term than we were precrisis. Sure. I mean market share -- firstly our headline approach on market share is to win in the channels that are open. I mean it's -- we've talked about it on the last quarter it's clear. And so we have a stronger position in away-from-home channels and a higher share in away-from-home channels than we have in at-home channels and therefore mechanically as those have closed down and locked down we kind of mechanically lose share. So what we have focused on is to say to the system we must focus on winning share in the channels that are open. Because then as the world recovers -- and I'm a strong believer that as the world recovers with the fact that we are social animals means we will mix and mingle. Some of these channels will evolve and not -- they won't all come back in the same way, but away-from-home will come back and humans will go out and socialize and do lots of things. Because they want the experiences they're not going to stay stuck at home. So it will come back. So we're focused on winning share in the channels that are open and so we have been winning share in the -- for the at-home channels. And that is true across the board. That's true across many, many, many of the countries. It's very rare to win in every country all the time, but we have been winning broadly across the world in the at-home channel. And so -- and I think you've seen commentary about how bigger brands and people have been returning to the brands they know and love from other categories and other sectors too. So I think that that's very much what's going on. And as we look forward to kind of the focus on going forward the reduction of the portfolio by about half is actually going to allow us to bring more stronger innovation to the table. This is not about less innovation and less ability to tap into local insights it's actually about leveraging the most successful vehicles to do that. So already this year, we have seen the revenue per innovation double versus what we had last year. So it is about combining the platforms and the global and regional brands and the platforms to connect to local insights and that is part of the art of bringing it to life. And of course in terms of how long do you wait before you pull some of these innovations we have some pretty clear metrics. Of course the first thing is to decide what's the innovation for, what's its objective? It could be -- we talked on the call are we trying to get into a new category, are we trying to get -- are we trying to do a flavor extension on the existing brand, is it a packaging innovation, what sort of innovations are we talking about. But each one has its mission and has its goals and we are very focused on tracking how it's doing and we'll sunset it as and when hope is no longer there or rational hope is no longer there. Sure. Look firstly the two big things to say about that. Firstly of course, we have not reached the end of the process. We have gone -- made a decision very early on to make this redesign more in the open. I mean often restructurings are done in the room by a few people and then announced to everyone. That's not what we have done. We have decided that we are going to enroll enlist and engage with a much much broader piece of the organization to make sure the design is what we want. And so therefore you have a more public -- a longer public timeline which is what we're in. We have gone through a large part of the voluntary separation plan, but we have not completely finished the design and we are still working on that. But all of that leads to the obvious conclusion that a lot of the feedback is around uncertainty and when will I know what happens to me which is completely and totally understandable and we are working as fast as we can to provide as much certainty as possible. So that is still ongoing. And as John commented we expect the large majority of all of that to have been completed for the clarity by the end of the year. Some parts of the world not given local consultation requirements. But the -- when you stand back from the restructuring process, when you take the feedback from the employees and we've done surveys and both formal and informal, in the end you're going to end up with two types of feedback. You're either going to get a type of feedback which is, I don't understand what we're trying to do or I don't understand how we're going to do it yet. And the very encouraging thing about where we've got to so far is, there's a great deal of clarity in the employee base around the strategic reasons to do what we're doing and how it will help improve and drive the business. And there's a -- certainly from the people that have been announced leaders at the top piece of their network they have -- they also have that very clear and are very energized about bringing it to life. So the majority of the questions the vast majority of the questions are on how is it going to come to life and of course what does this mean to me which is an encouraging sign. It's a natural reaction, but it's also an encouraging sign that this is on track to deliver the sorts of benefits and support the ability of the company and the system to drive the top line. And the feedback from the bottlers is also positive on how this will help them and we will collectively as a system be stronger. Sure. The thinking behind where we're going predates COVID. In fact, we had a senior leadership meeting with the top 200 in February before the crisis became completely apparent where we started to talk about what would it take to bring a much more networked organization to life and started to talk about some of the dimensions. So the idea of the reorganization, the purpose of being a networked organization predates COVID.  And it's a logical consequence from starting to bring the Beverages for Life strategy to life no pun intended. So it is very much a continuation of where we're going. It's an agenda item that was clear. It was coming. Obviously in February, we were at the relative beginning stages. What the time of COVID particularly Q2 what that did to influence the program was really a couple of things. One, it was clear that when we took the actions to refocus the system on safety and continuity of supply in Q2, the clarity of moving quickly on refocusing on fewer SKUs and the boldness of those decisions are paid off very quickly. And the insight was not just that, but the ability of the organization to act with speed was very encouraging. That led us to conclude that we should accelerate even in the course of the pandemic the move to the networked organization and really drive that forward and push that on. And so that's what we've done.  As I just said on the last call, we're largely through it. Of course, the other thing that came out of pandemic was a decision to try and make it as enrolling and engaging with the organization as possible even at the risk of having a longer period of uncertainty because the design is more in the public. And I think that has proven to be very powerful in helping us optimize the design of what we want. And so that increases our confidence level that it will be another key component to helping us emerge stronger from the crisis and get up to the top range of the long-term growth model. Yes. They're not all new to the parts of the world they're in. Obviously, Nikolaos who is leading Europe was leading EMEA before which obviously included Europe. So very much in the case of Europe, which was doing very well. Nikolaos represents a great deal of strategic continuity. And obviously self-evidently in the case of Europe we have the challenges of not just the expansion of the portfolio and success in the categories, but also the recovery of the away-from-home channel. So -- but there's a great deal of leadership continuity in Europe.  In the case of Latin America, Henrique who's now leading Latin America was leading the Brazilian business and Brazil is the star performer so far this year. And that is not just a consequence of the actions they've been taking in the short-term. The Brazilian system us with the bottlers have been very focused on responding to what several years ago was a very deep recession or depression in the Brazilian economy doubling down on the brand portfolio, doubling down on affordability through big investments with the bottlers in returnable packaging looking at execution and coolers. And that is paying dividends this year and helping drive Brazil to be the best-performing business unit so far in terms of absolute growth. And so Henrique deeply knows Latin America and the strategic challenges that we have there and will be fully capable to lead there.  And then Alfredo is coming in to the U.S., where we have been on a good track in terms of driving the portfolio and gaining share in the U.S. business. And certainly, we're hoping to continue the best of everything that was happening in the U.S. before, but also infuse it with some of the thinking from Latin America whether that be around revenue growth management particularly in the economic times we're in, some of the sharpness on the portfolio and on the margins and working with the bottlers as well on the supply chain. Yes Topo Chico. We're very excited about opportunities in Topo Chico. Obviously, it's a fantastic sparkling mineral water brand and has done very well. The U.S. situation is very unique and specific. Clearly our starting position for innovations is to work with our bottling system. The best result is much more likely in terms of scale and profit to be the nexus between brands that the company owns and drives and go through the bottling system, and that's how we're approaching the Topo Chico Hard Seltzer outside the U.S. In the U.S., it's very specifically driven by the nature of the regulation of the beer market or the alcohol market in the U.S. And many of you I'm sure are familiar with the 3-tier system for the U.S. marketplace, which is unique to the U.S. So we're launching in Latin America with our bottlers. But as it relates to the U.S., we have to find a path within in the 3-tier system. And so that's why we've looked for an external partner or more specifically a partner already in the alcohol industry. It also relates to the fact that having someone who is an existing brewer is a much easier supply chain path into the category. And it also happens to be the case that the network of distributors the Molson Coors has also connects with some of the parallel businesses of people who are connected to the Coke system. So the U.S. structure is very specific to the U.S. regulatory requirements and to the partners who we think can help us drive what's needed for Topo Chico. How do we find success? This is going to be an explorer brand from us. I mean we are for sure clear that what we don't know about the alcohol and Hard Seltzer category is more than what we do know. And we need to continue to work our way to understand these opportunities as much as we did with Lemon-Do in Japan, starting small, learning and then expanding as we got success. And so we will take a very similar approach in the U.S. with Topo Chico Hard Seltzer as to working exactly what connects with consumers and what connects with retailers. And in terms of differentiation, clearly there's going to be differentiation through the flavors, through the product itself, through the packaging. But also I think it builds on a tremendous strength. I mean Topo Chico is still growing fantastically across the U.S. and is the leading sparkling water brand in places like Texas. So I think that the brand itself is an established iconic interesting brand for the consumers that are interested in Hard Seltzer. So I think it's everything there indicates that it should be a great opportunity, we just need to bring it to life. Yeah. So the brands themselves are distributed across the categories probably slightly more in the hydration space than any of the other -- of sparkling coffee and tea or juice dairy and plant. But the brands are distributed across all the different categories. They tend to be much more local in terms of brands. And so two things are going to happen. One, there's going to be some brands we're going to retire. But there are some brands where the better answer is to transition it into one of the regional brands. So it might be we have a strong regional juice brand and then there's a local brand in one market and we're going to transition it into the regional brand because it's going to be much more efficient and effective to leverage the marketing and the innovation but from that regional brand rather than repeating everything into the local brand. So the -- we're talking mainly about the very tail and a much more local brand tail but brands that are spread across multiple categories. Clearly our objective is to convert the shelf space from these brands into ones that we own. Some of that has already effectively happened because of COVID. In the Q2 in particular in order to preserve the effectiveness of the supply chain, we already stopped making a set of SKUs including some of the brands and captured that shelf space for our main brands. Other places where it's a transition from a local brand to a regional or a global brand clearly we'll be managing that with the customers so we would not expect to lose shelf space. I think in simple terms of the revenue model, the benefits -- I would think about it is the benefits we're going to get from freeing up that shelf space and freeing up the process and innovation time of those brands should be made up by -- at least made up by existing global or regional brands. And I would not -- I certainly am not starting to think that this is a headwind to results in the next six to 12 months I would just assume that we're going to make it all up with the portfolio we have. Yeah on Coke, I mean, look firstly, while we have been judicious in our use of marketing spend in Q2 particularly but also in Q3 we have continued to market including marketing strongly behind the Coke brand. So we have continued to market. Clearly that's also been linked by great work with the bottlers on some revenue growth management, particularly affordability plays in some parts of the world, adjusting the portfolio, the packaging portfolio given the skew to at-home channels in many other parts of the world, good local execution. So there is continued focus and investment behind Coke. And I think that's clearly paying dividends as we've gone from Q2 to Q3. So as you pointed out in Q3 Coke is growing. Coke is gaining share. And that is also being powered by an ongoing focus on Coke Zero Sugar where that grew high single digits in the third quarter in terms of volume. So we are clearly continuing to invest behind Coke among many of the other brands. And we see the brand responding and doing well and believe as we increase investment into the fourth quarter and into 2021, that Coke will continue to be a motor of growth. Yes, sure. Yes. Obviously, it was pleasing in the third quarter to see the price/mix from North America. Firstly, that was -- got a big component being driven by our focus on some of the premium offerings, whether that be Simply or fairlife which -- and some of the finished goods businesses we own. So, obviously, there's a sort of -- there's good news, because we're driving premium categories or subcategories, but also recognize that some of that is finished goods products that we are selling. And that offset some of the pressures we feel in fountain channels and in other away-from-home channels. So it's good news. I'm not sure that we'll always do 4%, but it's being driven in part by this mix effect of the different finished goods versus non-finished goods and fountain business. Yes. It was a little difficult to hear you there Laurent, but I think you're asking a question about the U.S. fountain business and how it's doing. I mean, clearly, it's a big part of the operation. It's about 30% of the volume in the U.S. and it's a very important package format or channel intersection. Clearly, it's been heavily affected by the COVID crisis. And within that QSRs have clearly been at the better end, whereas things related to transport and amusement have been -- continue to be at the more impacted end. But we very much manage the business not just to do the best for each and every one of the customers that use the fountain equipment, but as one of the packaging formats that brings our brands to life. So the brand strategies are holistic and look across the different packaging formats and different channel formats and we continue to think that that business will be a prosperous business with a good road to recovery. Thank you, operator. So in conclusion, we think during the third quarter we began to see some encouraging signs of recovery from the global lockdown. We also made progress in transforming our organizational structure to better position the Coca-Cola system to pursue our Beverages for Life strategy. These steps will enable us to scale a portfolio of drinks that will help us emerge stronger and win in this ever-changing marketplace. So as always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us today. Thank you."

            "name": "John Murphy",
            "content": "Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to comment on our third quarter performance and give perspective on the financial implications of our structural changes and new operating model. I'll also provide some additional context on our outlook. In the third quarter, I am pleased to report that our focus and flexibility enabled us to drive sequential improvement from the second quarter. Our organic revenue performance was down 6% driven by price/mix down 3% and concentrate sales down 4%. This quarter's performance compares to a 26% organic revenue decline in the second quarter. While most of that improvement came in the form of better volume trends, we also saw improved price/mix particularly when you look at this on a two-year average. Comparable gross margin contracted by about 140 basis points. This was primarily driven by continued albeit less pressure from our channel mix between away-from-home and at-home in addition to currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin expanded by approximately 230 basis points due to ongoing cost management offsetting the pressure from the top line. While our marketing spend remained below last year's levels, we did increase it sequentially and in a targeted way as we saw recovery in the business. We continue to monitor the effectiveness of spend with the goal of investing ahead of recovery. Below operating income we saw a strong sequential improvement in many of our equity stakes as our bottlers have quickly moved to adapt to the changes. Therefore, third quarter comparable EPS of $0.55 declined 2% year-over-year. This was better than our internal expectations, given stronger-than-anticipated volume trends in September and the improved equity income. While the pandemic has weighed on our cash from operations year-to-date, we saw significant sequential improvement in the third quarter and remain intensely focused on the free cash flow opportunities ahead. These include further progress in our working capital initiatives and being better stewards of our capital spend. While much has changed this year with the onset of the pandemic, our focus on converting top line growth to maximize returns has not. The changes we are making will lead us to more efficient and productive spending. These include our organizational restructuring, streamlined portfolio, disciplined innovation and optimized marketing approach. As James mentioned we're streamlining our master brands by approximately 50%, which significantly reduces complexity with an impact of less than 1% to top line and profits. We expect this impact to be more than offset over time by the benefits of greater focus on our growth brands. The combination of voluntary separation programs and involuntary reductions are estimated to result in expenses ranging from approximately $350 million to $550 million. While we are not defining a targeted level of cost savings historically in these scenarios we have seen a similar level of savings as compared to the cost of the programs. These actions will help us achieve a structure that is designed for growth, which in turn will fuel reinvestment to drive top line and margins for the long-term. Said another way the strategic priorities we've accelerated are designed to drive results that get us back to our long-term growth algorithm as fast as possible. In our last call, we talked about adapting to the various phases of the pandemic focusing on what we can manage and control and not getting ahead of ourselves with regard to when things might return to normal. We see no reason to change this approach for the remainder of the year. Different countries around the world are going through different phases. Some still dealing with the first wave, others dealing with or expecting a second wave and their respective governments taking a variety of approach. All of which means continued uncertainty regarding the pandemic and the macroeconomic picture. So within this context we will continue to hold off on providing more detailed guidance today. Having said that there are important factors to consider for the fourth quarter. We will be benefiting from two extra days in the quarter. To the degree that away-from-home channels are impacted by targeted restrictions, we would expect price/mix pressure to continue due to channel and package mix. This mix shift in our business will also continue to have implications for gross margins. We will continue to be prudent in our marketing expenditures, but stepping up investment in a targeted way ahead of recovery with a more efficient and effective approach. As we noted in our release, we expect a currency headwind of approximately 3% to the top line and approximately 9% to comparable operating income in the fourth quarter based on current spot rates and our hedge positions. Looking at today's rates and hedge positions at this stage the currency impact would be minimal as we head into next year. Coming out of an unusual year like 2020 will surely have implications for 2021. It is fair to assume that 2021 will have several considerations including the cycling of 2020 impacts, the step-up in discretionary spending as well as the strategic acceleration initiatives we've outlined. While it's too early to provide specific commentary, our actions give us increased confidence to recover faster than the broader economic recovery. We will provide more insight as part of our fourth quarter call. As we think about the long-term, we will continue our journey to improve cash flow where we had made much progress last year, as well as focus on asset optimization with a goal to becoming asset-right over time. Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have confidence in the health of our system as we emerge from the peak of lockdowns across the globe. System health is crucial to our success. We also remain committed to our dividend policy and balance sheet goals. We recognize the dividend is important to our investor base and continue to believe our long-term model can deliver the cash necessary to reinvest to grow the business while also supporting the dividend. We will continue to work to return to a dividend payout ratio as a percentage of free cash flow that approaches 75% over time. The acceleration of our strategy and the progress James outlined today will help drive long-term top and bottom line growth, not only for us but for the entire Coke system. The challenges that we faced during this pandemic are by no means, in the rearview mirror. Nevertheless, we are seeing promising signs, that the actions we're taking have put us on track to equip the organization and the data system to win. We are confident that we will return to the high-end of our long-term growth model. And do so having made an impact, with our stakeholders and having gained consumers' share and improved system economics. With that operator, we are ready to take questions. Sure. Bryan thanks for the question. It's still early and there's as we talked on the call a fair degree of uncertainty remaining. And we'll have certainly a lot more to visibility I think when we get to the fourth quarter call. In the meantime, as we just discussed 2021 will be an unusual year. We're cycling a number of unusual impacts from this year. We will see a step-up in our discretionary spending, as we go into the fourth quarter and into the first half of next year. And we're also going to I believe see the benefit from the strategic initiatives that we have outlined in the July and on this morning's call. Our new organizational structure will be, well in place at that stage. So I would anchor our spending in 2021 going into 2022 off our 2019 base, and take into account the actions that we have discussed to both drive the top line and to drive greater efficiency, across the organization. And we'll be in a position to talk more in detail, on the Q4 call. First, the housekeeper here. 30% decline year-over-year. But Q3 and Q2, showed -- I don't have the number exactly in front of me but showed about 65% on 30% from Q3 over Q2. So we continue to look at that sequential improvement Kevin quarter-to-quarter. And I'd expect Q4 based on what we're seeing around the world to \u2013 for us to continue to have targeted investments in those markets where it makes sense to do so. And as I said earlier, as you look at 2021, I would encourage you to think about 2019 as an anchor. And then from there factor in the work that we have underway on the marketing area, particularly marketing innovation to drive greater efficiency. We know there's a lot of opportunity when you wire the organization together. And the way we're doing it, it unlocks a lot of opportunity for us to do the same with less or to do more with the same. And that is \u2013 that will be the part of the strategy conversation going into 2021, as to which of the approaches we take on a market-by-market basis. And Kevin just to clarify, when I said the 65%, 65% was Q2 over prior year and Q3 was 30%. So I think we need to \u2013 you need to think about 2020 as being a very unusual year in which we have obviously been able to manage very tightly our cost base through the pandemic and particularly through the worst phases of it, which in turn has allowed us to deliver operating margin improvements that are out of the normal pattern you would expect. I would encourage you to think about our long-term growth model has been the \u2013 again the anchor. Embedded in our long-term growth model is a belief that we can over time continue to expand margins. And the actions that we are taking, which will have an impact in 2021 going into 2022 also, those actions are I believe will allow us to deliver on that algorithm as we go forward. So again, 2021 versus 2020, we're going to be cycling an unusual set of circumstances. And I think that needs to be appropriately factored in to the models that you will be deploying. So let me take that. On the last point there's actually no change in our views on share repurchase. I think it's very consistent with what we've talked about on previous calls, our priorities as we look ahead are to reinvest in the business and to continue to support the dividend. We continue to have an opportunistic view on the M&A front, although don't expect a whole lot on that on the horizon there. And share repos have really -- was our number fourth on the on the priority list and we expect them to stay there for the foreseeable future. So that's on that point. Regarding the higher end of the algorithm, yeah, I think 2021 is -- we're going to be cycling a set of unusual factors. My view on the algorithm I think James will share this too is that we're talking about getting back to the higher end of the algorithm. As you think about the -- over the next -- over the mid-term. So the higher end when I think about the algorithm I'm looking at a 2022 versus 2019. 2021 versus 2020 is going to produce a not usual set I think of results. But that's to be expected given what's happened particularly in Q2 and in Q3. Let me take the working capital question. Minimal impact overall. There's a real opportunity here to clean up our internal supply chain end-to-end. So when you think about the amount of small purchases that are required to support these brands that are -- that represent the long end of the tail it's a pretty sizable number, but relative to our overall working capital it's not that material. But it certainly gives us a little bit of a tailwind as we go into 2021. Yes. So with regard to 2021, we are substantially hedged on the G10 currencies. And as we've discussed in prior calls, the bigger variable and point of volatility is what happens to the large emerging currencies, particularly in Latin America and in Africa. So to the extent that they stay pretty solid and will be in -- as I said, we would see minimal impact. And then, with regard to the commodity situation, this year has been a favorable year for us on the commodity front. And we would expect 2021 based on the latest estimates we have on the various components to be pretty even with 2020. And to your point on aluminum, in particular, there'll be maybe just a slight favorability based on what we see at the moment. We do see on PET, there will be some -- I think some slight increases, but we can manage those with other offsets inside of the cost of goods line."

We\u2019ve just closed the books on what has arguably been the toughest and most complex quarter in Coca-Cola history. And given the global pandemic, of course, this comes as no surprise. From the initial lockdowns and closures of hundreds of thousands of our customer outlets to the gradual reopening and now another round of spikes in various countries, the impacts have been profound. In this challenging environment, we\u2019ve seen some remarkable actions around the world. And I\u2019d like to express my thanks to the countless people on the frontlines who are working to improve our communities worldwide. And I\u2019d also like to recognize my colleagues across The Coca-Cola Company and our bottling system for their tireless efforts in prioritizing the safety of our people, ensuring the resiliency of our supply chain, supporting our millions of customers globally, and for being a force of good in their communities. As we navigated the quarter, we used a combination of focus and flexibility to manage through what we believe will be the peak levels of global lockdown. John will discuss the results in further detail, but as you think about the quarter and consider the future, I\u2019d like to highlight the strong relationship of our performance with the intersection of two key factors. The trajectory of our business trends in the near term is closely linked to the size of our away-from-home business in any given country and the level of lockdowns in the market. For example, markets like Western Europe, which had high levels of restrictions and a meaningful away-from-home exposures; and in India, which had an intense lockdown, experienced significant impacts. However, many of our Latin American markets with less restrictive measures and a lower away-from-home presence fared better. Further as we went through the quarter and restrictions generally eased globally, our business saw improvements from the 25% volume declines in April to the single-digit declines we are seeing now in July. The lockdowns also affected our share performance in the quarter. Our underlying performance in NARTD was positive and benefited from strong share gains in the at-home channel. However, this was entirely offset by a full point of negative channel mix due to the away-from-home pressure where we have strong shares. And as on-premise begins to revive, we fully expect to return to share growth, and we are already seeing sequential improvements in monthly trends. Moving forward, we are maintaining that same level of focus on flexibility that helped us navigate the quarter as we focus on winning during the reopening phases. Thankfully, a good starting point matters. As a system, we went into the crisis in a strong position and the system has rallied. There is a sense of optimism about what is possible as we move forward. Importantly, we are leveraging the crisis as a catalyst to accelerate the business transformation that was already underway, and we remain guided by our purpose, which is to refresh the world and make a difference, and we are clear on how we will emerge stronger. We will win more consumers, gain share, maintain strong system economics, strengthen our impact across our stakeholders, and equip our organization to win in the future. And as we think about that future, there are two important points I\u2019d like to make. In addition to the near-term realities of the pandemic and consumer shifts, the uncertainty around the trajectory of the macroeconomic environment is significant. We generally align with forecasts that imply the global economy could take 2 to 3 years to fully recover. Notwithstanding the macros and NorthStar its return to pre-COVID levels and to do this ahead of the economic recovery. Second, we see the underlying structural reasons that Beverages for Life strategy with the consumer at the heart of everything we do remains essential. The commercial beverage industry will remain vibrant in the years to come. We know consumers will continue to spend more on commercial beverages and they will continue to demand greater choice. This drives the need for a broad, strong portfolio and a powerful scaled distribution system to supply that demand. Our Beverages for Life vision began a transformation of the organization, supported by a refreshed culture focused on a growth mindset. We are already well on our way down this path and seeing good results. The pandemic is prompting us to move even faster. At CAGNY, earlier this year, we introduced the key elements of our strategy to accelerate top-line growth and maximize returns. We recognize that some elements need to evolve and others need to be pushed harder to reflect the new reality. So, we are accelerating our strategy across five priorities. First, we are prioritizing a portfolio that combines strong global brands plus regional and scaled local brands to address critical age cohorts, need [indiscernible] and drinking occasions. Second, we are establishing a more disciplined innovation framework and a new path forward for increased marketing effectiveness and efficiency. Third, we are strengthening our RGM and execution capabilities to drive relevance and responsiveness. And to capitalize on these initiatives, we are enhancing our system collaboration and capturing supply chain efficiencies to fuel growth. And as a result, we are continuing to evolve our organization to support the accelerated strategy and invest in new capabilities to accomplish these objectives. John will discuss how we are leveraging each of these initiatives to drive improved return and prioritize our capital allocation to the most attractive opportunities.  Turning to the portfolio. At the outset of the pandemic, our goal was to ruthlessly prioritize core brands and SKUs to strengthen the resilience of our supply chain. In China, we placed a big emphasis on our sparkling portfolio during the height of the lockdown. And as a result, the category grew 14% in volume this quarter, led by trademark Coke with strong growth in Zero Sugar offerings. The learnings from the last several months and the insights from our already accelerated SKU rationalization has convinced us to go even deeper on this opportunity by streamlining brands. We are shifting to prioritizing fewer but bigger and stronger brands across various consumer needs. At the same time, we need to do a better job nurturing and growing smaller, more enduring propositions and exiting some zombie brands not just zombie SKUs. As a reference point, of our 400 master brands, more than half are single-country brands with little to no scale. The total combined revenue of those brands is approximately 2% of our total. They\u2019re growing slower than the company average but each one still requires resources and investments. So in the case of a brand like Odwalla and its chilled direct store delivery, which has struggled over the last several years, we started to stop operations effective July 31. This gives us the flexibility to support our investments in brands like Minute Maid and Simply and to continue to scale rising stars like Topo Chico. Turning to innovation and marketing. Innovation remains critical to our Beverages for Life strategy and launch activity has been on the rise over several years. While this expansion of innovation has been a considerable growth driver for the Coke system, many launches failed to escape the tail and struggled to grow. We can do better. We believe the best way forward is to be more choiceful and target bigger, more scalable bets and be disciplined in our experimentation. Over time, our Leader, Challenger and Explorer brands can grow to positions that deliver scale and profitability. We are raising the bar and adding more discipline to our innovation pipeline against the fine criterias, either recruiting new consumers, increasing the frequency of existing consumers and/or being margin accretive. We are leading with global bets like the continued opportunity with reduced-sugar offerings in brand Coke. We also continue a high potential regional and local bets like AHA-flavored sparkling water in the U.S. AHA captured double-digit retail value share in its first 18 week and has even more potential given its wide appeal. With consumers prioritizing health, safety and hygiene even more, there is a runway for innovation in functional benefits and contactless solutions. We\u2019ll prioritize innovation centers on products, packaging and equipment. Last week, for example, we announced the introduction of touchless Freestyle machines in the U.S., which allows consumers to choose and pour drinks from their phones in just a few seconds without the need to create an account or download an app. This is an example of leveraging increased flexibility to create a solution, test it and roll it out in a few months. In addressing our marketing effectiveness and efficiency, we are targeting several areas to improve how we do things. In effect, taking a fresh approach to ensure all our investments have a future role. We are increasing our focus on the cut through quality of our messages and their alignment with in-market execution plans through purpose-driven occasion-based initiatives. The next phase of our global campaign that started with the pandemic is going live now with a large program pairing Coca Meal. Together Tastes Better will kick off in the U.S. that will be rolled out globally. Open to that are another holistic program, invites the world to enjoy the simple and important things in life and will also be introduced this summer across multiple media channels. These campaigns are designed to be flexible and were created for Coca-Cola teams around the world to tailor and localize their markets and platforms. They\u2019re prime examples of how driving maximum impact on rates with focused investment. Further, on the efficiency side, we are pushing our marketing ratios and reassessing our overall marketing return on investment on everything from ad viewership across traditional media to improving effectiveness in digital. Turning to RGM and execution. Beyond these brand and innovation initiatives, we are deploying our capabilities in revenue growth management and execution to adapt to changing channel dynamics. Providing beverages people desire at a price they can afford is increasingly important, given the macroeconomic pressures could be substantial and enduring. By segmenting our markets to provide solutions to fit every budget, revenue growth management also creates opportunity to deliver value through more profitable channels and premium packages. RGM is not just about price. It is about offering a range of solutions to consumers at every part of the value chain and balancing profitability to maintain and grow our consumer base. In the case of Latin America, we\u2019re moving quickly to increase our refillable offerings to address affordability. At the same time, in Japan, we\u2019re working to decouple the 500 ml Coke offering to a larger and smaller pack options to help drive both transactions and enhance our revenue per case. Beyond RGM, we are working with our bottling partners to improve execution by addressing changing channel dynamics and supporting our customers, be it through periods of elevated demand like we\u2019ve seen in grocery and modern trade or the lockdown-related challenges we\u2019re seeing in on-premise spots. In Europe, we\u2019re launching a new campaign, Open Like Never Before as a means to support on-premise reopenings as well as smaller independent outlets and at-home occasions. In the U.S., we\u2019ve helped over 300,000 of our foodservice outlets manage through the lockdown and now we are there to help them get back and be stronger than ever through initiatives like our rapid response resource. We are continuing to invest heavily in executing digital strategies to drive sales, efficiencies, and data analytics across our business. We recently appointed a Global VP of offline to online digital transformation to work closely with leaders across the system to unify and scale our e-commerce and digital strategy. We are aggressively going up in the omnichannel opportunity with the consumer at the center. Partnering with a large e-commerce platform in China, we increased our system revenue through that customer by 65% during the recent 618 Festival, the largest mid-year shopping festival in China. Our partnerships with third-party aggregators are driving incidents as consumers quickly migrate to mobile delivery for groceries and prepared meals. For instance, working with large restaurant delivery intermediaries in North America, we added value bundles to over 4,500 restaurant venues in the quarter. We\u2019re also accelerating our B2B platforms to streamline the value chain with modern trade. In the U.S., we\u2019ve added more than 8,000 outlets to the myCoke digitized ordering platform just this quarter, allowing a contactless relationship with our customers. Finally, we\u2019re experimenting with direct-to-consumer by expanding platforms like Coca-Cola Into Our World throughout Latin America. This web-based solution delivers to homes as quickly as the next day and currently enjoys one million household users at a healthy double-digit growth rate. To execute these initiatives with speed and effectiveness, we\u2019ve worked closely with our bottling partners through the crisis. The connectivity across the system has been extraordinary. In the last few months, we\u2019ve held global and regional system meetings with leadership, allowing us to accomplish even more than we thought possible. We will continue this increased engagement and sharing of best practices with our bottlers from top to bottom post-pandemic as we recognize the opportunity to collaborate even more closely across the supply chain and to leverage our collective global scale. Ultimately, we aspire to grow faster system-wide and deliver stronger results that will enable us to continue investing and putting our purpose into action. Turning to the organization. Since we set out on the Beverages for Life journey, we have evolved our organization every step of the way and we continue to do so to ensure structure follows strategy. To focus on a growth portfolio of profitable brands with quality leadership positions that is supported by an efficient and effective marketing model, we need to be flexible. Our system is continuing to move further away from a complicated three dimensional organizational structure to more of a network model, improving our agility and maximizing scale. As the pandemic acts as a catalyst to accelerate our strategy, our organization is moving into the future faster too. And we must set up properly to empower our system to win. This will require us to reallocate people resources and could mean some reductions due to our evolving approach. There is no doubt that we faced significant pressures in the second quarter but we exited the quarter with promising signs the most challenging period is indeed behind us in much of the world. There is still a lot of work to do. There is no doubt the world will be different following the crisis. In many ways, the future is coming at us faster than ever. We are embracing the changes and pivoting our business to take advantage of new opportunities. We are poised as a system to accelerate our transformation to return to driving growth in years to come. Before I hand the call over to John, I\u2019d like to take a moment to comment on the social justice movements that had significant impacts around the world. Let me be clear, our stance is there is no place for racism or institutionalized inequality in the world. We are taking an active approach and focusing our efforts on listening, leading, investing and advocating. We are engaging stakeholders, employees and other business leaders and we\u2019ve paused social media for the time being while we review our policies to ensure a higher level of accountability and transparency. We recently committed to spend an incremental $500 million with black-owned suppliers and are actively contributing to communities on this important issue. With that, John will discuss our results and provide more details on how we plan to drive returns as our increased focus provides the flexibility we need.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to spend my time this morning focused on three things. One, some commentary on the quarter and the rest of year outlook. Two, thoughts on the broader and longer-term implications to value creation for our company and our system. And, finally, on our capital allocation priorities. As expected, our second quarter was one with significant hurdles to overcome as lockdown and social distancing requirements placed profound pressures on our customers and consumers. In the second quarter, volumes were down 16% driven by declines in higher revenue per case away-from-home channels. Organic revenues declined 26% driven by a 22% decline in concentrate shipments and a 4% decline in price/mix. The gap between concentrate shipments and unit cases this quarter is attributable to cycling the timing of shipments from last year, primarily in EMEA and Latin America, along with rationalization of stock levels after some safety stock building in the first quarter. The majority of the price/mix pressure during the quarter was driven by segment mix from meaningful declines in our cost of business in Global Ventures, as well as Bottling Investments. Underlying gross margin was down approximately 300 basis points, primarily driven by volume declines in capital intensive finished goods businesses like Costa, foodservice in North America and our Bottling Investments, in addition to negative package and channel mix pressure. Despite the significant pressure of top-line and gross margin, in addition to the currency headwinds, comparable operating margins were only slightly lower than last year, given the effective management of our SG&A expenses. While we had a considerable amounts of leverage during the quarter from cost management, part of it is attributable to timing due to modifying our full-year marketing spend forecast, which included an adjustment from the first quarter. As we look to the remainder of the year, we will continue to hold off on providing full year guidance, given the amounts of uncertainty that remains. That said, there are some factors worth highlighting as you think about the second half. While we believe the second quarter will be the most severely impacted, we do expect the top-line trajectory to continue to correlate closely to the level of mobility of consumers and the health of the away-from-home channels, as James discussed earlier. The pandemic is not behind us. There is still good reason to be cautious as global COVID infections continue to increase with case growth generally shifting from developed to emerging markets. While we are seeing sequential improvements, recovery will likely not to be linear. Some markets that were recovering are having a second spike in cases like we\u2019re seeing in Iran, Australia, Romania and here in the United States. Depending on the trajectory of recovery in away-from-home, channel and package mix will continue to put pressure on our gross margin. At the same time, while we do expect continued cost savings in the back half, the amount of leverage should moderate as we look to accelerate our marketing investments, given improving ROI characteristics in a number of markets. I\u2019d also add that if the top-line improves faster than expectations, we are prepared to reinvest more aggressively to further strengthen our position heading into 2021. And finally, moving to below the line, in an effort to extend the duration of our outstanding debt in the first half, we issued $11.5 billion of long-term maturities, resulting in higher interest expense. While we firmly believe this is the right thing to do longer term, you will continue to see a year-over-year increase in interest expense in the back half of the year. James laid out the approach we are taking on the portfolio, innovation, marketing, execution and system efficiencies to return our company to top-line growth at the high end of our growth algorithm. We believe strongly in our future being propelled by top-line growth, but we also appreciate the top-line must ultimately create value that meets or exceeds our shareholder expectations. To this end, we are focused on the following critical objectives. First, we are defining, even more sharply, the optimal set of our P&L and balance sheet. We have developed a clear mission, strategic drivers and financial expectations for each of our business segments and have set objectives to improve margins and free cash flow across the board. We\u2019ll leverage these improved returns and invest what is needed to fund continued growth, while ensuring our balance sheet remains fit for purpose for our future needs. Second, opportunities abound because of this more efficient growth. As James discussed earlier, we are moving with speed to optimize marketing spend, consolidated behind our growth portfolio and business segment priorities. Using our productivity mindset, we are continuing to uncover cost saving opportunities across the supply chain and operating expenses. While the hallmark of our business is winning locally with our consumers and customers, we continue to see opportunities to scale several services across the system to unlock synergies. In addition, as we evolve the organization to follow the strategy, this too will drive better resource allocation. And as James mentioned, our global system will continue to collaborate as our strategy accelerates and evolves and together, we are working to be nimbler to sustain the growth that follows. As we pursue these objectives, our capital allocation priorities remain the same \u2013 reinvest for appropriates in the business to drive momentum and continue to grow the dividend, returning cash to our shareholders. M&A and share repurchase are unlikely to play a prominent role in the near term. Our balance sheet is strong and we remain confident in our liquidity position as we continue to navigate through the crisis. As we work through the system to manage through the current challenges caused by COVID-19, our bottlers are not immune to the effects of the business disruption. That said, approximately 80% of our business, volumetrically, is in the hands of our top-15 bottlers or run through our Bottling Investment group. The remaining 20% are small to mid-sized. Our large public bottlers are well managed companies with healthy balance sheets. Nearly all of our small-to-mid-sized bottlers are in a stable position and taking proactive steps in efficient working capital management, expenses and capital to manage the situation. As we close the books on the second quarter, there is no doubt that this has been a challenging time for the Coca-Cola system. Throughout, our system has remained focused on the journey ahead, pivoting and adapting to ensure that we accelerate our transformation, allowing our system to emerge stronger. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBryan Spillane: Hi, thank you, and good morning, everyone.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nBryan Spillane: I guess my question is just around the balance between efficiency and growth. We\u2019ve come a long way in the last couple of years to exit last year to be at the top end of the revenue growth algorithm. And I guess, now we\u2019re contemplating trying to get back to that level, but at the same time, with a focus on efficiency. So, James, maybe if you could talk a little bit about organizationally how you\u2019re just going to balance, trying to achieve both of those things at the same time.\nJames Quincey: Yes, thanks. Thanks, Bryan. Look, clearly we've got to do both. If we just aim for top line growth, we \u2013 I'm sure we'll get back up to the top end of the algorithm where we were for the last few years. But if we do that without focusing on efficiency, that's not going to work for the company or work for the bottlers or work for the shareholders. And the inverse is true. If we just stop worrying about the top line and focus on efficiency, we'll do well for a year or 2, but then the wheels will come off. So we've got to do both. And the way we're going to approach it is to really attack the priorities we've talked about. In the good years, the pre-COVID years, we got up to the top end of the revenue growth thing. We were doing a lot of innovation. We were curating a lot of brands. We knew we had things that were working really well and other brands that were struggling. And as we were at the top end of the growth, you\u2019ve seen that we need to not just remove the zombie SKUs but prune down some of the explorer brands so you can refocus on those with most potentials. When times are going well, you set a certain pace for that sort of activity. And now in the COVID times and in these more impaired economic times, for at least for the near future, we need to accelerate that. So that's why we said, look, we need to \u2013 let's really bring forward the agenda of which every wave of innovation generates, you diverge and then you need to converge on the best \u2013 the best product to excel. Let's accelerate that. Let's get really focused. That will also allow us to get more focused and more efficient on how we do the marketing and where we direct the marketing investments. So the 2 things that we\u2019ll work together to both be more able to drive the top line, because we're more able to get back to the sort of growth rates we want, all the top line, and be able to win new consumers and win share in the marketplace and yet do so in a more efficient way. We've also seen over the last number of years, as we've moved to platform services as we've evolved their organization, we can see that we have things that were ahead of us that could also be done, and we're going to accelerate those. Not just as a company, but we're looking for ways as a system, so how can we build on some of the great collaboration that already exists, like the cross-enterprise procurement group, where we buy collectively our core imports, our core commodities. How can we take that to the next level? So, we're really looking for the really \u2013 to build on the learnings of the pre-COVID. We knew we had things that were to \u2013 that had to be done. Let's accelerate those so that we can generate the efficiencies that will both fuel the growth and getting the top line back up and allow us to bridge in terms of resources given that revenue is still impacted in the near term. So it's got to be done, and we're going to \u2013 the last part of that is really it's going to build on the culture of work we have done in recent years to focus on a growth mindset. We've got to keep pushing that idea and keep looking for what's working, and take the resources from the brands and the ideas and the projects that aren't working and funnel them back to those with the most opportunity. So it\u2019s really an end-to-end idea from the consumer backwards through to the structure and the culture of the organization, so that actually you end up with an agenda that's not just a mix of 2 things, strategy and growth and efficiency, but actuallyeach of those components is necessary and enables the other.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping -- you touched a bit, of course on revenue growth management, but I think that\u2019s an area where we've all been, I think, well educated on revenue growth management as a great tool to drive growth in, let's call it, roughly economic expansion. And then in an economic downturn, still probably a bit less explored, the price/mix performance in Latin America, and I think you highlighted Mexico in particular in the press release, was really notable. So, if you could talk a little bit about where you are in terms of implementing revenue growth management strategies to benefit you or to help support the business in a downturn, is Mexico simply a lead market and there's much more to come on that front? But additional color there, I think, could be helpful. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure, sure Lauren. Yes, I mean, interestingly, the whole approach for revenue growth management, certainly in one of its early iterations at the company with the bottlers actually came at times of economic difficulty, particularly in Latin America. So, it is an approach that is a capability, a way of doing things that is just as useful in the good times as it is in the bad times. And so once you see us applying that capability, which the company, together with the bottlers, have spent the last few years refreshing, it's now being directed at the new challenges. And as you say, whereas we might have been putting more emphasis on using it to develop the premium opportunities in the last few years, we're going to have to use it to focus on some of the affordability opportunities. Examples of those is really, for example in Mexico, but also places like Brazil and a number of others, really focusing down on refillable packaging. The benefit of refillable packaging in the context of RGM is, of course, you can \u2013 the economics allow you to offer the product at a lower price point. So we can really connect to what is likely to be some economic stress on disposable income, and therefore the need for affordable products, for refillables and that works in Latin America, that works in Africa, that works in a number of different places. But it also can \u2013 as a capability, RGM can work in countries like Japan. In Japan, we sell a lot of half-liter PET bottles for something like Coke. And in this current environment, what we're going to do is try and split that up. So have one slightly bigger package and one slightly smaller package. The smaller package, obviously, will allow us to offer a lower price point; and the slightly bigger package will be a sharing package which will offer more advantage per liter. And so we can really use this capability to come in and adapt the portfolio, not just in the emerging markets, but also in the developed markets, knowing that, yes, there will still be people looking for premium products and stock up. But there are also people under a lot of disposable income pressure, and there, the number 1 objective, at least in the beverage category for us, is to bring down the entry price point. What's the lowest price at which you can buy a Coke?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning guys.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nDara Mohsenian: Just taking a step back, obviously, the June and July to date unit case volume trends showed a significant sequential improvement versus April and May. Do you feel like you have enough visibility that it's reasonable at this point to generally expect sequential progress from those July numbers as we look at the balance of the year and the remainder of the back half? I know you obviously won't give us a specific number, but more conceptually, perhaps you could touch on that. And that's a global question. But within that answer, I was hoping you could parse out thoughts by region a bit more and imagine the answer may be very different in Asia and Europe versus the U.S. and Latin America, just given the relative differences we're seeing in sequential COVID case counts.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I think the simple answer is no. And by no, what I mean is there are too many, to use the famous Rumsfeld little framework, there are too many known unknowns ahead of us. Because whilst, yes, we have seen sequential improvement through the second quarter and into the beginning of July, in all geographies, all major geographies around the world, the principal unknown is the degree of lockdown going forward. As we talked about it in the second quarter, the biggest variables affecting the business were: One, the degree of lockdown; and two, the degree of away-from-home business in that country with the lockdown. And the simple fact remains that while things have got better undoubtedly, July is better than June, June was better than May, May was better than April, the reality remains that the virus is not completely under control. There have been countries which have repeated lockdowns or cities and states within countries that have repeated lockdowns. And so honestly, I think we could \u2013 if we saw the virus starting to be under control, we would imagine, yes, we would see sequential improvement through the months and quarters going forward. But we cannot discount there might be further waves of lockdowns, partial or full. Having said that, I am pretty confident that second quarter will ultimately prove to have been the most difficult and the most impacted quarter, principally because I think the governments are getting smarter about how they apply public health measures and getting things under their control, such that we're unlikely to see the whole world entering a lockdown at the same point in time. I'm not sure that completely helps, but unfortunately, that's the outlook we see, with a strong degree of uncertainty.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nNik Modi: Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Maybe I could just take another spin on Dara's question and ask specifically on areas where we've seen the virus kind of come back. So you think about Australia, parts of Hong Kong, Texas, et cetera. James, I mean, it's very helpful on understanding kind of the July trends, but things have been moving so quickly. Perhaps you can talk about maybe what you're seeing or just give us some context on some of those markets just so we can get a better understanding of how things have shaped since the end of June.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean, look, the \u2013 I think the fairest thing would be to say that those markets where we've seen repeat lockdowns, they have never \u2013 or they have not yet gone down at the same sort of degree they went down in the first round of their lockdown, whether that be February, March or April. And on a global basis, obviously, April was the most difficult month. So we are not seeing that round 2 is as bad as round 1. I think that if you take somewhere like Japan, which started off with the lockdown and they opened up a bit then they locked down again, yes, the number started getting negative again, but they weren't really as bad as they had been at the initial stage. So you do get a bit of a wiggly line, so you can't \u2013 that's why I made the point on Dara's question, you can't assume, not that I necessarily think you were, you can't assume it was a straight line from where we are now to good. I think there's going to be some variations as you start to look across the months. But the second waves have not yet looked as bad as the first waves, whether I look across any of the countries you really mentioned or some of the other ones.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. James, I would like to focus on the chart that you had on the 400 master brands, with 50% accounting for 98% of revenue and 50% just 2% of revenue. And I know this is a very big question that you could probably talk about for a long time, but kind of high level, how \u2013 what do you think the right mix is? And how do you get to that right mix? Presumably, there were certain incentives, relationships with the bottlers that got you where you are now. How do you see that evolving over time? And what do you \u2013 how do you think the financial impact will be when you get to a more optimal mix? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I am not sure there is a destination where there's one right number of the mix between leaders, challengers and explorers. And we will always have a tail of smaller brands. That's not the issue that we're after. And actually, it would probably be a sign of weakness to have no smaller brands in the portfolio because it would mean we're not nurturing the future, we're not nurturing the explorers that will be challengers, that will be leaders in the future. What we want to see is a steady pipeline of progression of creating ever-stronger brands that have real quality leadership. Obviously, they've got to pass through the challengers phase. And therefore, you've got to launch a whole series of explorers, small brands, to try and get there, knowing that most of them will not make it. What we're looking at here is that we have not been as assertive enough and directive enough at weeding out the explorers that have not worked and are unlikely to work so that we can redirect the resources on to the explorers and the challengers that have the most opportunity into the future. So it's not a question of a certain number of explorers are right or wrong, it's a question of, are they succeeding or not? And we \u2013 I think we talked at the Investor Day that the success criteria for explorer is very fast growth and starting to gain a core of very engaged and loyal consumers, and that you're really starting to make waves in the category even though small. And that the success criteria for a challenger was being able to gain enough market share that, over time, you could believe you were going to get to leadership. Because at leadership, you have both scale and disproportionately more favorable economics and margin versus the other two categories. So what we're looking at here is, in a way, the result of lots of experimentation and exploration, which is a good thing, but we are looking at an incomplete task of weeding out the ones that work. And so what we're looking at, particularly in a large bucket of smaller brands, is they stayed small for some good period of time, and they're not growing, so they're not meeting the success criteria for saying \u2013 there as an explorer brand. And that's true across all categories. I mean, our objective remains to create a broad portfolio of leaders across all sorts of categories. And so really, we are just accelerating the work that we knew needed to happen on all those explorer brands that were not meeting our own success criteria, if they were going somewhere, they were growing, et cetera. And that will allow us to redirect resources to those that are best positioned to grow. So again, we'll be fueling top line growth more efficiently, allowing us to get back to where we were in 2019 and emerge stronger ahead of the pack with better margins for our system.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nSteve Powers: Yes, hi everyone. Good morning. I guess a question for me on capital allocation. John, you were pretty clear on the priorities and the near-term deemphasis on M&A and share repurchase. But the implication there is that you have high confidence in your ability to both reinvest heavily in the business and also continue to maintain, even grow, the dividend, whereas the market's been increasingly concerned about your ability to do just that in recent weeks and months. So can you maybe expand on what drives your confidence there? And is there any set of circumstances that you can envision in the near to medium term that might better challenge your ability to defend the dividend, again, given the takes in your prioritization?\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Steve. First and foremost, I think the decisions on capital allocation, we take into account not just the short-term, but also taking a view as to where we think the business will be over the next couple of years. And as we look at that, even though, as James said, there are a number of known unknowns, you got \u2013 I think you got to divide the calendar into a few parts. One is what's happening in the here and now, number two is the sort of the length and shape of the recovery and then number three is getting back to some degree of what people are, I think, calling a new normal. So we've got tremendous confidence in the beverage industry in general. We think that the fundamentals for growth going forward longer-term remain the same, albeit with the challenges in the near-term. And we think that we can and we'll get back to the high end of our long-term growth algorithm over time. And so with that context, we're comfortable in maintaining our position around our capital allocation and, first and foremost, continuing to support the business as we go forward in terms of capital and marketing investments; and then number two, continuing to support the dividend in that period. Wrapped around that, of course, is our overall debt strategy. We are confident, with the decisions we've taken year-to-date, that the balance sheet is strong enough to withhold the near-term pressures. And we're \u2013 while we may go slightly outside of our range this year, we see that being a short-term blip. So I'll also say we're confident in the industry, in our ability to emerge stronger. And with that in mind, the priorities that we lay out, we think, are achievable. Obviously, as James just said, there are lots of kind of known unknowns, and we will continue to review and adapt as those unknowns become more known.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nLaurent Grandet: Yes, good morning everyone. James, I'd like to focus my question on the on-premise channel. Can you please unbundle the on-premise performance and trends? So what are you seeing in QSRs versus casual dining, contract caterers or sports/concert venues or travel? Trying to figure out the pace of the recovery by those subchannels. And is it fair to assume that the piece that is recovering the fastest, like QSR, is probably not \u2013 less profitable? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I'll try and add a little bit of texture on this one for you. But the first thing to bear in mind is the predominant effect is the degree of lockdown in the country as it relates to those channels. So there isn't really a way to describe the global trends by those different channels because it very much depended \u2013 or does depend still on what sorts of measures governments have put in place to \u2013 for health reasons. And so there's \u2013 the global trend is not really that meaningful. I would just urge you to look more at the degree of lockdown on the total business. If we take one country and look at what we see as to have happened there, and take the U.S., which is the one you're probably most familiar with. If we look at the away-from-home channels, first point to know is there was sequential improvement as we went from April to May to June. And so things got better. Clearly, the biggest determinant of how our channel did was what percent of its business needed people to be inside the building. So you mentioned QSR. Actually, QSR was one of the, in aggregate in the U.S., was at the better end of the impact. Why? Because many of them have well-developed drive-thru and digitally enabled takeaway businesses. So actually, they not only improved but they were not the most affected of the eating-away channels. The sorts of channels that were most impacted by the lockdowns were bars, full-service restaurants, at-work locations. Some of these places were, simply put, there was no foot traffic. And so the declines were significant. And given that many offices are still not going back to full working, if at all. For example, at-work remains one of the most affected channels, much more so than QSR or other casual dining or even bars and restaurants. So the simplest way to think about or to analyze the away-from-home channels is simply to look at the degree that the restrictions in place at any moment in time and how that affects their business, vis-\u00e0-vis do they have takeaway or business that can leave the location? And to what extent are they dependent fully on people being in the location?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBonnie Herzog: Good morning. I actually had a question on the ramping of your marketing spend in the second half as it sounds like you've started to accelerate spending ahead of the recovery. So I really wanted to understand how quickly you expect the spending to impact the top line, given there's typically a lag. And then I assume there will be a bigger drag on your margins from the stepped-up spending in the second half. But maybe clarify that and then maybe highlight any offsets you might have or levers you can pull to minimize the impact from this? Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Bonnie. Let me take that one. Again, as I mentioned here, I think it's important to kind of divide the calendar up. As you know, for the second quarter, we did take a significant step back from marketing because we didn't think it was going to be that effective. And as we look to the second half of the year, I think the name of the game is to stay flexible and be able to adapt as quickly as possible. With that in mind, as we see the shape of the recovery taking place around the world, there are opportunities to step up, to step back up our investment levels. And I think there's also an opportunity to use this time to completely rethink the amount of investment a market actually needs in an optimal level going forward. So that's very much a key priority for the second half of the year. In terms of specific numbers, I don't have specific numbers to provide because I think it's, again, going back to what I said about being flexible, it's a function of being able to adapt and react as markets demonstrate the trajectory that they're on. But as we go forward and as we go into 2021, a key priority is to emerge stronger, as James alluded to earlier, and to emerge stronger faster. And so with that in mind, it's a key objective in the second half of the year, is to position ourselves well for 2021, and particularly in the markets that are really important to us and the markets where the competitive pressures are strongest. So stepping it up on a case-by-case basis in the second half of the year and being ready for 2021. And for sure, as I said in the script, as we look into the second half of the year, you're not going to potentially see the same cost efficiencies that drove the sort of the operating margin impact in the second quarter in the second half of the year as we continue to look at our marketing needs and take decisions accordingly.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBill Chappell: Hey, thanks. Good morning. James, I just wanted to step back, trying to understand like how we should look at the \u2013 in the slide deck, the announcements today, because, I mean, on one side, you can say, look, we're trying to be more nimble, we're trying to be stronger coming out. The other side, you can say, look, earnings don't matter this year, they might not really matter this year. Let's \u2013 don't waste a good crisis, let's step up all our spending and move forward and we can really accelerate everything over the next year. And if it's the latter, then you didn't really talk about kind of how much this is going to cost and whether it's going to impact this year and next year in terms of costs. So maybe a little more color on which way it is and what you're expecting to spend?\nJames Quincey: I'm not sure whether you are referring as much the DME or any additional costs because we're changing our product. But let me try a couple of things and then see whether it answers the question. I mean, firstly, let me just underline what John said. We are going to be good stewards of our capital. And yes, of course, we could just pile on the marketing spend because \"no one cares about the earnings this year.\" Yes, but that still comes from our bottom line and our capital available. And if you look \u2013 if you ignore calendar years and just think about the business, why would I want to spend money in a period if I can't get the return, particularly if there's a strong lockdown? So we don't take an approach of overly thinking in the calendar years when it comes to marketing. We're about generating momentum for the brands and the business. And as John said, if we see opportunities to invest and generate and accelerate the top line growth, that's what we're going to do, which is the inverse of what we saw in the second quarter. We thought no marketing is going to make much difference in the second quarter, so we pulled back heavily. And then we'll have to gauge and be adaptable as we work through the uncertainty in these known unknowns as to where or which countries and which categories versus which lockdowns is it going to make sense to spend? So we are going to be judicious in our use of marketing, in our use of capital expenditure. We \u2013 much as you can see the sales trend improving through the quarter to July, our expectation is that the general direction of travel is sequential improvement, therefore, we expect to come back and spend more marketing. But we're going to be focused on getting that right.  But said more generally, if we're going to emerge stronger, we need to get the business back to the right level of investment to drive the top line growth. That's what's going to create the profit growth for the Coca-Cola Company. And that is going to go behind the revamped approach to the portfolio, the revamped approach to how we continue to do marketing. If we do have to let go of some brands, potentially even ones we've acquired, like Odwalla, we may need to take some charges. And even though it wouldn't affect the cash flow because we're using it, perhaps we converted the brand to something else or maybe it wasn't making any money, but there might have to be some charges. Obviously, our intent would be to make those decisions as quickly as possible and recognize them as soon as they're made. I hope that provides something of color to your question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. So I'm wondering if you can elaborate more on the efficiency and ROI commentary that you guys just made. If you can see operating margins inflect already in the third quarter year-over-year, or more of a fourth quarter aspiration? And a clarification on John's comments about capital allocation. Is there any room to accelerate the divestitures of the Bottling Investments that you've done so far and become even more asset-light to repurpose the funds into dividends and buybacks? Thank you.\nJohn Murphy: So on \u2013 thanks, Andrea. On the second question, there's \u2013 as we've in previous calls, I think we have a very open book with respect to the balance sheet and rightsizing and optimizing the balance sheet as we go forward. And there's no investment on the balance sheet that does not get a regular review and determination as to whether it should still be there. With respect to that part of the decision-making, our Bottling Investments group is an important piece of the equation. We don't have a timetable for further refranchising, but it certainly is our longer-term goal to be more asset-light, just as we have, I think, stated on previous occasions, and have acted accordingly with previous refranchising efforts. So that will and continues to be a part of the agenda, but not a specific time line on it. And then with respect to the comment on operating margins, I don't have a clear number to give you for either Q3 or Q4. But it goes without saying, is that as we looked at the opportunities that present themselves, we're not necessarily as focused on the months, but we're more focused on building momentum for the business and sustaining it in the \u2013 particularly in the markets that have got outsized importance to us. So we'll make those decisions as they come and as they appear to be the right ones to make at the right time, and the consequences will flow through accordingly.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlos Laboy with HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nCarlos Laboy: Yes. Good morning, everyone. You note big sparkling declines in India, Western Europe and fountain in the U.S. Have deep structural changes, such as heavy client turnover, in any of those three situations prompted you to move toward a reset of the model in those three businesses?\nJames Quincey: Carlos, no, I don't think I would describe any of those as a deep structural change that has driven some sort of reset of the model. Again, they're very, very linked to the degree of lockdown that has been mandated because of COVID. And if you just take those three \u2013 both, I mean, fountain or food service and on-premise in the U.S. and a lot of EMEA, particularly the Western Europe, has a lot of away-from-home business, the outlets were shut. And what we found is that as the outlets start to open, the business starts to flourish again. And India, simply put, there isn't a modern trade as you'd understand it in the developed markets at a large scale. And so when they had a lockdown, it locked down all the small stores. And so literally, the whole marketplace was closed down at that point in time in what would have been a peak season in India. So it's really lockdown-related. And I think as they come off, you'll see the reopenings. We are social creatures, as humans, and we like experiences. People will want to go out. There will be habits that will have changed, but we will go out and experience the world, and these channels will bounce back. John?\nJohn Murphy: Yes, James, just \u2013 if I could just add to that. I think, Carlos, I think what we will see, both in some of the developing markets like India and even here in the United States, is I think there will be a higher turnover, particularly of small customers, in both the sort of more modern away-from-home as well as the traditional away from home. So I think we expect to see that. But that in and of itself, I don't think means a structural reset is necessary. It could just mean there will be more new ones coming along. And for our system, it just \u2013 it will be a key area of focus as we come out of the recovery period.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nKevin Grundy: Hey. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for taking the question. I wanted to come back to investment levels. It was talked about with a couple of different prior questions, but ask it differently and really focus on North America. And my question isn't so much about cadence, but really more about adequacy. And the context being that your key competitor has committed to supporting its brands, this is on the heels of stepped-up investment levels last year. They're now trying to hit an external earnings number, and market share is an increasing focus. If I'm not mistaken, it's also a bigger part of executive comp. And then of course, the snack side of the business is thriving, which gives them some flexibility to lean in on beverages. So setting aside the COVID-related pressures, can you comment on what you're seeing competitively in North America? I think you commented a moment ago that there's also willingness internally at the Coca-Cola Company to forgo any sort of profit targets to lean in and make sure that you're adequately reinvested in key markets, presumably the U.S. would be included in that. Maybe you just can confirm it. And then maybe talk a little bit about some of the governors and key metrics that you guys are looking at: Brand equity, market share, absolute levels of A&M spending, to ensure that your brands are indeed adequately supported and that you don't end up vetted into year-end, and looking out to next year, falling short if you're underinvested? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Do you want a go, John? So I'll go ahead. I'll start, then maybe you can jump in. Clearly, we are go \u2013 I mean, we've set a North Star: Emerge stronger, which is gain more \u2013 engage with more consumers, gain more drinkers, gain share and reestablish system economics for us and the bottling system. So that is where we're headed. And very clearly, that we're going \u2013 if we have to choose between investing and not investing in making more money, but damaging the top line, we're going to invest to drive the top line.  The fundamentals of the Coke system work when we can get back where we were precrisis, which was the top end of the growth algorithm on the top line, and that then flows through with the leverage into the bottom line. So that is going to be the North Star globally. And in North America, we need to make sure that happens. And clearly, we're going to do that in a flexible way that John talked about the DME. Having said that, we fully expect to be spending sequentially more DME in North America in Q3 and into Q4. Obviously, we have key metrics by brand as to what we expect from each brand and what they're doing and going for that. And what we see in the marketplace is, again, a bit like the total volume performance. In terms of share, what we see is that where the world is open, we've been able to gain share. The predominant negative effect is channel mix. And it's worth remembering that our \u2013 we have half as much a gain market share in away-from-home channels as we have in at-home channels. So the closing of the away-from-home, of course, makes a negative impact to our market share. So what we've done \u2013 what we're focusing on is in the channels that are open, let's focus on gaining share where the world is still working, knowing that as the reopenings occur, and being social humans, we'll go out for the experiences, that we will structurally have gained share in channels and then we'll be favored as those where we have historically been stronger start their reopening. So that's our approach overall and in North America.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Thank you, everyone. So to sum up, we're using the current moment of the pandemic as an opportunity to accelerate the implementation of our strategies. With a portfolio of strong brands, a focus on high-impact marketing innovation and a structure that fits the strategy, we are confident that our system will emerge stronger from this crisis and return to delivering good growth for the years to come. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us today. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "James Quincey",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and good morning everyone. We've just closed the books on what has arguably been the toughest and most complex quarter in Coca-Cola history. And given the global pandemic, of course, this comes as no surprise. From the initial lockdowns and closures of hundreds of thousands of our customer outlets to the gradual reopening and now another round of spikes in various countries, the impacts have been profound. In this challenging environment, we've seen some remarkable actions around the world. And I'd like to express my thanks to the countless people on the frontlines who are working to improve our communities worldwide. And I'd also like to recognize my colleagues across The Coca-Cola Company and our bottling system for their tireless efforts in prioritizing the safety of our people, ensuring the resiliency of our supply chain, supporting our millions of customers globally, and for being a force of good in their communities. As we navigated the quarter, we used a combination of focus and flexibility to manage through what we believe will be the peak levels of global lockdown. John will discuss the results in further detail, but as you think about the quarter and consider the future, I'd like to highlight the strong relationship of our performance with the intersection of two key factors. The trajectory of our business trends in the near term is closely linked to the size of our away-from-home business in any given country and the level of lockdowns in the market. For example, markets like Western Europe, which had high levels of restrictions and a meaningful away-from-home exposures; and in India, which had an intense lockdown, experienced significant impacts. However, many of our Latin American markets with less restrictive measures and a lower away-from-home presence fared better. Further as we went through the quarter and restrictions generally eased globally, our business saw improvements from the 25% volume declines in April to the single-digit declines we are seeing now in July. The lockdowns also affected our share performance in the quarter. Our underlying performance in NARTD was positive and benefited from strong share gains in the at-home channel. However, this was entirely offset by a full point of negative channel mix due to the away-from-home pressure where we have strong shares. And as on-premise begins to revive, we fully expect to return to share growth, and we are already seeing sequential improvements in monthly trends. Moving forward, we are maintaining that same level of focus on flexibility that helped us navigate the quarter as we focus on winning during the reopening phases. Thankfully, a good starting point matters. As a system, we went into the crisis in a strong position and the system has rallied. There is a sense of optimism about what is possible as we move forward. Importantly, we are leveraging the crisis as a catalyst to accelerate the business transformation that was already underway, and we remain guided by our purpose, which is to refresh the world and make a difference, and we are clear on how we will emerge stronger. We will win more consumers, gain share, maintain strong system economics, strengthen our impact across our stakeholders, and equip our organization to win in the future. And as we think about that future, there are two important points I'd like to make. In addition to the near-term realities of the pandemic and consumer shifts, the uncertainty around the trajectory of the macroeconomic environment is significant. We generally align with forecasts that imply the global economy could take 2 to 3 years to fully recover. Notwithstanding the macros and NorthStar its return to pre-COVID levels and to do this ahead of the economic recovery. Second, we see the underlying structural reasons that Beverages for Life strategy with the consumer at the heart of everything we do remains essential. The commercial beverage industry will remain vibrant in the years to come. We know consumers will continue to spend more on commercial beverages and they will continue to demand greater choice. This drives the need for a broad, strong portfolio and a powerful scaled distribution system to supply that demand. Our Beverages for Life vision began a transformation of the organization, supported by a refreshed culture focused on a growth mindset. We are already well on our way down this path and seeing good results. The pandemic is prompting us to move even faster. At CAGNY, earlier this year, we introduced the key elements of our strategy to accelerate top-line growth and maximize returns. We recognize that some elements need to evolve and others need to be pushed harder to reflect the new reality. So, we are accelerating our strategy across five priorities. First, we are prioritizing a portfolio that combines strong global brands plus regional and scaled local brands to address critical age cohorts, need [indiscernible] and drinking occasions. Second, we are establishing a more disciplined innovation framework and a new path forward for increased marketing effectiveness and efficiency. Third, we are strengthening our RGM and execution capabilities to drive relevance and responsiveness. And to capitalize on these initiatives, we are enhancing our system collaboration and capturing supply chain efficiencies to fuel growth. And as a result, we are continuing to evolve our organization to support the accelerated strategy and invest in new capabilities to accomplish these objectives. John will discuss how we are leveraging each of these initiatives to drive improved return and prioritize our capital allocation to the most attractive opportunities.  Turning to the portfolio. At the outset of the pandemic, our goal was to ruthlessly prioritize core brands and SKUs to strengthen the resilience of our supply chain. In China, we placed a big emphasis on our sparkling portfolio during the height of the lockdown. And as a result, the category grew 14% in volume this quarter, led by trademark Coke with strong growth in Zero Sugar offerings. The learnings from the last several months and the insights from our already accelerated SKU rationalization has convinced us to go even deeper on this opportunity by streamlining brands. We are shifting to prioritizing fewer but bigger and stronger brands across various consumer needs. At the same time, we need to do a better job nurturing and growing smaller, more enduring propositions and exiting some zombie brands not just zombie SKUs. As a reference point, of our 400 master brands, more than half are single-country brands with little to no scale. The total combined revenue of those brands is approximately 2% of our total. They're growing slower than the company average but each one still requires resources and investments. So in the case of a brand like Odwalla and its chilled direct store delivery, which has struggled over the last several years, we started to stop operations effective July 31. This gives us the flexibility to support our investments in brands like Minute Maid and Simply and to continue to scale rising stars like Topo Chico. Turning to innovation and marketing. Innovation remains critical to our Beverages for Life strategy and launch activity has been on the rise over several years. While this expansion of innovation has been a considerable growth driver for the Coke system, many launches failed to escape the tail and struggled to grow. We can do better. We believe the best way forward is to be more choiceful and target bigger, more scalable bets and be disciplined in our experimentation. Over time, our Leader, Challenger and Explorer brands can grow to positions that deliver scale and profitability. We are raising the bar and adding more discipline to our innovation pipeline against the fine criterias, either recruiting new consumers, increasing the frequency of existing consumers and/or being margin accretive. We are leading with global bets like the continued opportunity with reduced-sugar offerings in brand Coke. We also continue a high potential regional and local bets like AHA-flavored sparkling water in the U.S. AHA captured double-digit retail value share in its first 18 week and has even more potential given its wide appeal. With consumers prioritizing health, safety and hygiene even more, there is a runway for innovation in functional benefits and contactless solutions. We'll prioritize innovation centers on products, packaging and equipment. Last week, for example, we announced the introduction of touchless Freestyle machines in the U.S., which allows consumers to choose and pour drinks from their phones in just a few seconds without the need to create an account or download an app. This is an example of leveraging increased flexibility to create a solution, test it and roll it out in a few months. In addressing our marketing effectiveness and efficiency, we are targeting several areas to improve how we do things. In effect, taking a fresh approach to ensure all our investments have a future role. We are increasing our focus on the cut through quality of our messages and their alignment with in-market execution plans through purpose-driven occasion-based initiatives. The next phase of our global campaign that started with the pandemic is going live now with a large program pairing Coca Meal. Together Tastes Better will kick off in the U.S. that will be rolled out globally. Open to that are another holistic program, invites the world to enjoy the simple and important things in life and will also be introduced this summer across multiple media channels. These campaigns are designed to be flexible and were created for Coca-Cola teams around the world to tailor and localize their markets and platforms. They're prime examples of how driving maximum impact on rates with focused investment. Further, on the efficiency side, we are pushing our marketing ratios and reassessing our overall marketing return on investment on everything from ad viewership across traditional media to improving effectiveness in digital. Turning to RGM and execution. Beyond these brand and innovation initiatives, we are deploying our capabilities in revenue growth management and execution to adapt to changing channel dynamics. Providing beverages people desire at a price they can afford is increasingly important, given the macroeconomic pressures could be substantial and enduring. By segmenting our markets to provide solutions to fit every budget, revenue growth management also creates opportunity to deliver value through more profitable channels and premium packages. RGM is not just about price. It is about offering a range of solutions to consumers at every part of the value chain and balancing profitability to maintain and grow our consumer base. In the case of Latin America, we're moving quickly to increase our refillable offerings to address affordability. At the same time, in Japan, we're working to decouple the 500 ml Coke offering to a larger and smaller pack options to help drive both transactions and enhance our revenue per case. Beyond RGM, we are working with our bottling partners to improve execution by addressing changing channel dynamics and supporting our customers, be it through periods of elevated demand like we've seen in grocery and modern trade or the lockdown-related challenges we're seeing in on-premise spots. In Europe, we're launching a new campaign, Open Like Never Before as a means to support on-premise reopenings as well as smaller independent outlets and at-home occasions. In the U.S., we've helped over 300,000 of our foodservice outlets manage through the lockdown and now we are there to help them get back and be stronger than ever through initiatives like our rapid response resource. We are continuing to invest heavily in executing digital strategies to drive sales, efficiencies, and data analytics across our business. We recently appointed a Global VP of offline to online digital transformation to work closely with leaders across the system to unify and scale our e-commerce and digital strategy. We are aggressively going up in the omnichannel opportunity with the consumer at the center. Partnering with a large e-commerce platform in China, we increased our system revenue through that customer by 65% during the recent 618 Festival, the largest mid-year shopping festival in China. Our partnerships with third-party aggregators are driving incidents as consumers quickly migrate to mobile delivery for groceries and prepared meals. For instance, working with large restaurant delivery intermediaries in North America, we added value bundles to over 4,500 restaurant venues in the quarter. We're also accelerating our B2B platforms to streamline the value chain with modern trade. In the U.S., we've added more than 8,000 outlets to the myCoke digitized ordering platform just this quarter, allowing a contactless relationship with our customers. Finally, we're experimenting with direct-to-consumer by expanding platforms like Coca-Cola Into Our World throughout Latin America. This web-based solution delivers to homes as quickly as the next day and currently enjoys one million household users at a healthy double-digit growth rate. To execute these initiatives with speed and effectiveness, we've worked closely with our bottling partners through the crisis. The connectivity across the system has been extraordinary. In the last few months, we've held global and regional system meetings with leadership, allowing us to accomplish even more than we thought possible. We will continue this increased engagement and sharing of best practices with our bottlers from top to bottom post-pandemic as we recognize the opportunity to collaborate even more closely across the supply chain and to leverage our collective global scale. Ultimately, we aspire to grow faster system-wide and deliver stronger results that will enable us to continue investing and putting our purpose into action. Turning to the organization. Since we set out on the Beverages for Life journey, we have evolved our organization every step of the way and we continue to do so to ensure structure follows strategy. To focus on a growth portfolio of profitable brands with quality leadership positions that is supported by an efficient and effective marketing model, we need to be flexible. Our system is continuing to move further away from a complicated three dimensional organizational structure to more of a network model, improving our agility and maximizing scale. As the pandemic acts as a catalyst to accelerate our strategy, our organization is moving into the future faster too. And we must set up properly to empower our system to win. This will require us to reallocate people resources and could mean some reductions due to our evolving approach. There is no doubt that we faced significant pressures in the second quarter but we exited the quarter with promising signs the most challenging period is indeed behind us in much of the world. There is still a lot of work to do. There is no doubt the world will be different following the crisis. In many ways, the future is coming at us faster than ever. We are embracing the changes and pivoting our business to take advantage of new opportunities. We are poised as a system to accelerate our transformation to return to driving growth in years to come. Before I hand the call over to John, I'd like to take a moment to comment on the social justice movements that had significant impacts around the world. Let me be clear, our stance is there is no place for racism or institutionalized inequality in the world. We are taking an active approach and focusing our efforts on listening, leading, investing and advocating. We are engaging stakeholders, employees and other business leaders and we've paused social media for the time being while we review our policies to ensure a higher level of accountability and transparency. We recently committed to spend an incremental $500 million with black-owned suppliers and are actively contributing to communities on this important issue. With that, John will discuss our results and provide more details on how we plan to drive returns as our increased focus provides the flexibility we need. Good morning. Yes, thanks. Thanks, Bryan. Look, clearly we've got to do both. If we just aim for top line growth, we \u2013 I'm sure we'll get back up to the top end of the algorithm where we were for the last few years. But if we do that without focusing on efficiency, that's not going to work for the company or work for the bottlers or work for the shareholders. And the inverse is true. If we just stop worrying about the top line and focus on efficiency, we'll do well for a year or 2, but then the wheels will come off. So we've got to do both. And the way we're going to approach it is to really attack the priorities we've talked about. In the good years, the pre-COVID years, we got up to the top end of the revenue growth thing. We were doing a lot of innovation. We were curating a lot of brands. We knew we had things that were working really well and other brands that were struggling. And as we were at the top end of the growth, you've seen that we need to not just remove the zombie SKUs but prune down some of the explorer brands so you can refocus on those with most potentials. When times are going well, you set a certain pace for that sort of activity. And now in the COVID times and in these more impaired economic times, for at least for the near future, we need to accelerate that. So that's why we said, look, we need to \u2013 let's really bring forward the agenda of which every wave of innovation generates, you diverge and then you need to converge on the best \u2013 the best product to excel. Let's accelerate that. Let's get really focused. That will also allow us to get more focused and more efficient on how we do the marketing and where we direct the marketing investments. So the 2 things that we'll work together to both be more able to drive the top line, because we're more able to get back to the sort of growth rates we want, all the top line, and be able to win new consumers and win share in the marketplace and yet do so in a more efficient way. We've also seen over the last number of years, as we've moved to platform services as we've evolved their organization, we can see that we have things that were ahead of us that could also be done, and we're going to accelerate those. Not just as a company, but we're looking for ways as a system, so how can we build on some of the great collaboration that already exists, like the cross-enterprise procurement group, where we buy collectively our core imports, our core commodities. How can we take that to the next level? So, we're really looking for the really \u2013 to build on the learnings of the pre-COVID. We knew we had things that were to \u2013 that had to be done. Let's accelerate those so that we can generate the efficiencies that will both fuel the growth and getting the top line back up and allow us to bridge in terms of resources given that revenue is still impacted in the near term. So it's got to be done, and we're going to \u2013 the last part of that is really it's going to build on the culture of work we have done in recent years to focus on a growth mindset. We've got to keep pushing that idea and keep looking for what's working, and take the resources from the brands and the ideas and the projects that aren't working and funnel them back to those with the most opportunity. So it's really an end-to-end idea from the consumer backwards through to the structure and the culture of the organization, so that actually you end up with an agenda that's not just a mix of 2 things, strategy and growth and efficiency, but actuallyeach of those components is necessary and enables the other. Sure, sure Lauren. Yes, I mean, interestingly, the whole approach for revenue growth management, certainly in one of its early iterations at the company with the bottlers actually came at times of economic difficulty, particularly in Latin America. So, it is an approach that is a capability, a way of doing things that is just as useful in the good times as it is in the bad times. And so once you see us applying that capability, which the company, together with the bottlers, have spent the last few years refreshing, it's now being directed at the new challenges. And as you say, whereas we might have been putting more emphasis on using it to develop the premium opportunities in the last few years, we're going to have to use it to focus on some of the affordability opportunities. Examples of those is really, for example in Mexico, but also places like Brazil and a number of others, really focusing down on refillable packaging. The benefit of refillable packaging in the context of RGM is, of course, you can \u2013 the economics allow you to offer the product at a lower price point. So we can really connect to what is likely to be some economic stress on disposable income, and therefore the need for affordable products, for refillables and that works in Latin America, that works in Africa, that works in a number of different places. But it also can \u2013 as a capability, RGM can work in countries like Japan. In Japan, we sell a lot of half-liter PET bottles for something like Coke. And in this current environment, what we're going to do is try and split that up. So have one slightly bigger package and one slightly smaller package. The smaller package, obviously, will allow us to offer a lower price point; and the slightly bigger package will be a sharing package which will offer more advantage per liter. And so we can really use this capability to come in and adapt the portfolio, not just in the emerging markets, but also in the developed markets, knowing that, yes, there will still be people looking for premium products and stock up. But there are also people under a lot of disposable income pressure, and there, the number 1 objective, at least in the beverage category for us, is to bring down the entry price point. What's the lowest price at which you can buy a Coke? Good morning. Sure. I think the simple answer is no. And by no, what I mean is there are too many, to use the famous Rumsfeld little framework, there are too many known unknowns ahead of us. Because whilst, yes, we have seen sequential improvement through the second quarter and into the beginning of July, in all geographies, all major geographies around the world, the principal unknown is the degree of lockdown going forward. As we talked about it in the second quarter, the biggest variables affecting the business were: One, the degree of lockdown; and two, the degree of away-from-home business in that country with the lockdown. And the simple fact remains that while things have got better undoubtedly, July is better than June, June was better than May, May was better than April, the reality remains that the virus is not completely under control. There have been countries which have repeated lockdowns or cities and states within countries that have repeated lockdowns. And so honestly, I think we could \u2013 if we saw the virus starting to be under control, we would imagine, yes, we would see sequential improvement through the months and quarters going forward. But we cannot discount there might be further waves of lockdowns, partial or full. Having said that, I am pretty confident that second quarter will ultimately prove to have been the most difficult and the most impacted quarter, principally because I think the governments are getting smarter about how they apply public health measures and getting things under their control, such that we're unlikely to see the whole world entering a lockdown at the same point in time. I'm not sure that completely helps, but unfortunately, that's the outlook we see, with a strong degree of uncertainty. Sure. I mean, look, the \u2013 I think the fairest thing would be to say that those markets where we've seen repeat lockdowns, they have never \u2013 or they have not yet gone down at the same sort of degree they went down in the first round of their lockdown, whether that be February, March or April. And on a global basis, obviously, April was the most difficult month. So we are not seeing that round 2 is as bad as round 1. I think that if you take somewhere like Japan, which started off with the lockdown and they opened up a bit then they locked down again, yes, the number started getting negative again, but they weren't really as bad as they had been at the initial stage. So you do get a bit of a wiggly line, so you can't \u2013 that's why I made the point on Dara's question, you can't assume, not that I necessarily think you were, you can't assume it was a straight line from where we are now to good. I think there's going to be some variations as you start to look across the months. But the second waves have not yet looked as bad as the first waves, whether I look across any of the countries you really mentioned or some of the other ones. Sure. I am not sure there is a destination where there's one right number of the mix between leaders, challengers and explorers. And we will always have a tail of smaller brands. That's not the issue that we're after. And actually, it would probably be a sign of weakness to have no smaller brands in the portfolio because it would mean we're not nurturing the future, we're not nurturing the explorers that will be challengers, that will be leaders in the future. What we want to see is a steady pipeline of progression of creating ever-stronger brands that have real quality leadership. Obviously, they've got to pass through the challengers phase. And therefore, you've got to launch a whole series of explorers, small brands, to try and get there, knowing that most of them will not make it. What we're looking at here is that we have not been as assertive enough and directive enough at weeding out the explorers that have not worked and are unlikely to work so that we can redirect the resources on to the explorers and the challengers that have the most opportunity into the future. So it's not a question of a certain number of explorers are right or wrong, it's a question of, are they succeeding or not? And we \u2013 I think we talked at the Investor Day that the success criteria for explorer is very fast growth and starting to gain a core of very engaged and loyal consumers, and that you're really starting to make waves in the category even though small. And that the success criteria for a challenger was being able to gain enough market share that, over time, you could believe you were going to get to leadership. Because at leadership, you have both scale and disproportionately more favorable economics and margin versus the other two categories. So what we're looking at here is, in a way, the result of lots of experimentation and exploration, which is a good thing, but we are looking at an incomplete task of weeding out the ones that work. And so what we're looking at, particularly in a large bucket of smaller brands, is they stayed small for some good period of time, and they're not growing, so they're not meeting the success criteria for saying \u2013 there as an explorer brand. And that's true across all categories. I mean, our objective remains to create a broad portfolio of leaders across all sorts of categories. And so really, we are just accelerating the work that we knew needed to happen on all those explorer brands that were not meeting our own success criteria, if they were going somewhere, they were growing, et cetera. And that will allow us to redirect resources to those that are best positioned to grow. So again, we'll be fueling top line growth more efficiently, allowing us to get back to where we were in 2019 and emerge stronger ahead of the pack with better margins for our system. Sure. I'll try and add a little bit of texture on this one for you. But the first thing to bear in mind is the predominant effect is the degree of lockdown in the country as it relates to those channels. So there isn't really a way to describe the global trends by those different channels because it very much depended \u2013 or does depend still on what sorts of measures governments have put in place to \u2013 for health reasons. And so there's \u2013 the global trend is not really that meaningful. I would just urge you to look more at the degree of lockdown on the total business. If we take one country and look at what we see as to have happened there, and take the U.S., which is the one you're probably most familiar with. If we look at the away-from-home channels, first point to know is there was sequential improvement as we went from April to May to June. And so things got better. Clearly, the biggest determinant of how our channel did was what percent of its business needed people to be inside the building. So you mentioned QSR. Actually, QSR was one of the, in aggregate in the U.S., was at the better end of the impact. Why? Because many of them have well-developed drive-thru and digitally enabled takeaway businesses. So actually, they not only improved but they were not the most affected of the eating-away channels. The sorts of channels that were most impacted by the lockdowns were bars, full-service restaurants, at-work locations. Some of these places were, simply put, there was no foot traffic. And so the declines were significant. And given that many offices are still not going back to full working, if at all. For example, at-work remains one of the most affected channels, much more so than QSR or other casual dining or even bars and restaurants. So the simplest way to think about or to analyze the away-from-home channels is simply to look at the degree that the restrictions in place at any moment in time and how that affects their business, vis-a\u0300-vis do they have takeaway or business that can leave the location? And to what extent are they dependent fully on people being in the location? I'm not sure whether you are referring as much the DME or any additional costs because we're changing our product. But let me try a couple of things and then see whether it answers the question. I mean, firstly, let me just underline what John said. We are going to be good stewards of our capital. And yes, of course, we could just pile on the marketing spend because \"no one cares about the earnings this year.\" Yes, but that still comes from our bottom line and our capital available. And if you look \u2013 if you ignore calendar years and just think about the business, why would I want to spend money in a period if I can't get the return, particularly if there's a strong lockdown? So we don't take an approach of overly thinking in the calendar years when it comes to marketing. We're about generating momentum for the brands and the business. And as John said, if we see opportunities to invest and generate and accelerate the top line growth, that's what we're going to do, which is the inverse of what we saw in the second quarter. We thought no marketing is going to make much difference in the second quarter, so we pulled back heavily. And then we'll have to gauge and be adaptable as we work through the uncertainty in these known unknowns as to where or which countries and which categories versus which lockdowns is it going to make sense to spend? So we are going to be judicious in our use of marketing, in our use of capital expenditure. We \u2013 much as you can see the sales trend improving through the quarter to July, our expectation is that the general direction of travel is sequential improvement, therefore, we expect to come back and spend more marketing. But we're going to be focused on getting that right.  But said more generally, if we're going to emerge stronger, we need to get the business back to the right level of investment to drive the top line growth. That's what's going to create the profit growth for the Coca-Cola Company. And that is going to go behind the revamped approach to the portfolio, the revamped approach to how we continue to do marketing. If we do have to let go of some brands, potentially even ones we've acquired, like Odwalla, we may need to take some charges. And even though it wouldn't affect the cash flow because we're using it, perhaps we converted the brand to something else or maybe it wasn't making any money, but there might have to be some charges. Obviously, our intent would be to make those decisions as quickly as possible and recognize them as soon as they're made. I hope that provides something of color to your question. Carlos, no, I don't think I would describe any of those as a deep structural change that has driven some sort of reset of the model. Again, they're very, very linked to the degree of lockdown that has been mandated because of COVID. And if you just take those three \u2013 both, I mean, fountain or food service and on-premise in the U.S. and a lot of EMEA, particularly the Western Europe, has a lot of away-from-home business, the outlets were shut. And what we found is that as the outlets start to open, the business starts to flourish again. And India, simply put, there isn't a modern trade as you'd understand it in the developed markets at a large scale. And so when they had a lockdown, it locked down all the small stores. And so literally, the whole marketplace was closed down at that point in time in what would have been a peak season in India. So it's really lockdown-related. And I think as they come off, you'll see the reopenings. We are social creatures, as humans, and we like experiences. People will want to go out. There will be habits that will have changed, but we will go out and experience the world, and these channels will bounce back. John? Do you want a go, John? So I'll go ahead. I'll start, then maybe you can jump in. Clearly, we are go \u2013 I mean, we've set a North Star: Emerge stronger, which is gain more \u2013 engage with more consumers, gain more drinkers, gain share and reestablish system economics for us and the bottling system. So that is where we're headed. And very clearly, that we're going \u2013 if we have to choose between investing and not investing in making more money, but damaging the top line, we're going to invest to drive the top line.  The fundamentals of the Coke system work when we can get back where we were precrisis, which was the top end of the growth algorithm on the top line, and that then flows through with the leverage into the bottom line. So that is going to be the North Star globally. And in North America, we need to make sure that happens. And clearly, we're going to do that in a flexible way that John talked about the DME. Having said that, we fully expect to be spending sequentially more DME in North America in Q3 and into Q4. Obviously, we have key metrics by brand as to what we expect from each brand and what they're doing and going for that. And what we see in the marketplace is, again, a bit like the total volume performance. In terms of share, what we see is that where the world is open, we've been able to gain share. The predominant negative effect is channel mix. And it's worth remembering that our \u2013 we have half as much a gain market share in away-from-home channels as we have in at-home channels. So the closing of the away-from-home, of course, makes a negative impact to our market share. So what we've done \u2013 what we're focusing on is in the channels that are open, let's focus on gaining share where the world is still working, knowing that as the reopenings occur, and being social humans, we'll go out for the experiences, that we will structurally have gained share in channels and then we'll be favored as those where we have historically been stronger start their reopening. So that's our approach overall and in North America. Thank you, everyone. So to sum up, we're using the current moment of the pandemic as an opportunity to accelerate the implementation of our strategies. With a portfolio of strong brands, a focus on high-impact marketing innovation and a structure that fits the strategy, we are confident that our system will emerge stronger from this crisis and return to delivering good growth for the years to come. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us today. Thank you."

            "name": "John Murphy",
            "content": "Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to spend my time this morning focused on three things. One, some commentary on the quarter and the rest of year outlook. Two, thoughts on the broader and longer-term implications to value creation for our company and our system. And, finally, on our capital allocation priorities. As expected, our second quarter was one with significant hurdles to overcome as lockdown and social distancing requirements placed profound pressures on our customers and consumers. In the second quarter, volumes were down 16% driven by declines in higher revenue per case away-from-home channels. Organic revenues declined 26% driven by a 22% decline in concentrate shipments and a 4% decline in price/mix. The gap between concentrate shipments and unit cases this quarter is attributable to cycling the timing of shipments from last year, primarily in EMEA and Latin America, along with rationalization of stock levels after some safety stock building in the first quarter. The majority of the price/mix pressure during the quarter was driven by segment mix from meaningful declines in our cost of business in Global Ventures, as well as Bottling Investments. Underlying gross margin was down approximately 300 basis points, primarily driven by volume declines in capital intensive finished goods businesses like Costa, foodservice in North America and our Bottling Investments, in addition to negative package and channel mix pressure. Despite the significant pressure of top-line and gross margin, in addition to the currency headwinds, comparable operating margins were only slightly lower than last year, given the effective management of our SG&A expenses. While we had a considerable amounts of leverage during the quarter from cost management, part of it is attributable to timing due to modifying our full-year marketing spend forecast, which included an adjustment from the first quarter. As we look to the remainder of the year, we will continue to hold off on providing full year guidance, given the amounts of uncertainty that remains. That said, there are some factors worth highlighting as you think about the second half. While we believe the second quarter will be the most severely impacted, we do expect the top-line trajectory to continue to correlate closely to the level of mobility of consumers and the health of the away-from-home channels, as James discussed earlier. The pandemic is not behind us. There is still good reason to be cautious as global COVID infections continue to increase with case growth generally shifting from developed to emerging markets. While we are seeing sequential improvements, recovery will likely not to be linear. Some markets that were recovering are having a second spike in cases like we're seeing in Iran, Australia, Romania and here in the United States. Depending on the trajectory of recovery in away-from-home, channel and package mix will continue to put pressure on our gross margin. At the same time, while we do expect continued cost savings in the back half, the amount of leverage should moderate as we look to accelerate our marketing investments, given improving ROI characteristics in a number of markets. I'd also add that if the top-line improves faster than expectations, we are prepared to reinvest more aggressively to further strengthen our position heading into 2021. And finally, moving to below the line, in an effort to extend the duration of our outstanding debt in the first half, we issued $11.5 billion of long-term maturities, resulting in higher interest expense. While we firmly believe this is the right thing to do longer term, you will continue to see a year-over-year increase in interest expense in the back half of the year. James laid out the approach we are taking on the portfolio, innovation, marketing, execution and system efficiencies to return our company to top-line growth at the high end of our growth algorithm. We believe strongly in our future being propelled by top-line growth, but we also appreciate the top-line must ultimately create value that meets or exceeds our shareholder expectations. To this end, we are focused on the following critical objectives. First, we are defining, even more sharply, the optimal set of our P&L and balance sheet. We have developed a clear mission, strategic drivers and financial expectations for each of our business segments and have set objectives to improve margins and free cash flow across the board. We'll leverage these improved returns and invest what is needed to fund continued growth, while ensuring our balance sheet remains fit for purpose for our future needs. Second, opportunities abound because of this more efficient growth. As James discussed earlier, we are moving with speed to optimize marketing spend, consolidated behind our growth portfolio and business segment priorities. Using our productivity mindset, we are continuing to uncover cost saving opportunities across the supply chain and operating expenses. While the hallmark of our business is winning locally with our consumers and customers, we continue to see opportunities to scale several services across the system to unlock synergies. In addition, as we evolve the organization to follow the strategy, this too will drive better resource allocation. And as James mentioned, our global system will continue to collaborate as our strategy accelerates and evolves and together, we are working to be nimbler to sustain the growth that follows. As we pursue these objectives, our capital allocation priorities remain the same \u2013 reinvest for appropriates in the business to drive momentum and continue to grow the dividend, returning cash to our shareholders. M&A and share repurchase are unlikely to play a prominent role in the near term. Our balance sheet is strong and we remain confident in our liquidity position as we continue to navigate through the crisis. As we work through the system to manage through the current challenges caused by COVID-19, our bottlers are not immune to the effects of the business disruption. That said, approximately 80% of our business, volumetrically, is in the hands of our top-15 bottlers or run through our Bottling Investment group. The remaining 20% are small to mid-sized. Our large public bottlers are well managed companies with healthy balance sheets. Nearly all of our small-to-mid-sized bottlers are in a stable position and taking proactive steps in efficient working capital management, expenses and capital to manage the situation. As we close the books on the second quarter, there is no doubt that this has been a challenging time for the Coca-Cola system. Throughout, our system has remained focused on the journey ahead, pivoting and adapting to ensure that we accelerate our transformation, allowing our system to emerge stronger. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions. Thanks, Steve. First and foremost, I think the decisions on capital allocation, we take into account not just the short-term, but also taking a view as to where we think the business will be over the next couple of years. And as we look at that, even though, as James said, there are a number of known unknowns, you got \u2013 I think you got to divide the calendar into a few parts. One is what's happening in the here and now, number two is the sort of the length and shape of the recovery and then number three is getting back to some degree of what people are, I think, calling a new normal. So we've got tremendous confidence in the beverage industry in general. We think that the fundamentals for growth going forward longer-term remain the same, albeit with the challenges in the near-term. And we think that we can and we'll get back to the high end of our long-term growth algorithm over time. And so with that context, we're comfortable in maintaining our position around our capital allocation and, first and foremost, continuing to support the business as we go forward in terms of capital and marketing investments; and then number two, continuing to support the dividend in that period. Wrapped around that, of course, is our overall debt strategy. We are confident, with the decisions we've taken year-to-date, that the balance sheet is strong enough to withhold the near-term pressures. And we're \u2013 while we may go slightly outside of our range this year, we see that being a short-term blip. So I'll also say we're confident in the industry, in our ability to emerge stronger. And with that in mind, the priorities that we lay out, we think, are achievable. Obviously, as James just said, there are lots of kind of known unknowns, and we will continue to review and adapt as those unknowns become more known. Thanks, Bonnie. Let me take that one. Again, as I mentioned here, I think it's important to kind of divide the calendar up. As you know, for the second quarter, we did take a significant step back from marketing because we didn't think it was going to be that effective. And as we look to the second half of the year, I think the name of the game is to stay flexible and be able to adapt as quickly as possible. With that in mind, as we see the shape of the recovery taking place around the world, there are opportunities to step up, to step back up our investment levels. And I think there's also an opportunity to use this time to completely rethink the amount of investment a market actually needs in an optimal level going forward. So that's very much a key priority for the second half of the year. In terms of specific numbers, I don't have specific numbers to provide because I think it's, again, going back to what I said about being flexible, it's a function of being able to adapt and react as markets demonstrate the trajectory that they're on. But as we go forward and as we go into 2021, a key priority is to emerge stronger, as James alluded to earlier, and to emerge stronger faster. And so with that in mind, it's a key objective in the second half of the year, is to position ourselves well for 2021, and particularly in the markets that are really important to us and the markets where the competitive pressures are strongest. So stepping it up on a case-by-case basis in the second half of the year and being ready for 2021. And for sure, as I said in the script, as we look into the second half of the year, you're not going to potentially see the same cost efficiencies that drove the sort of the operating margin impact in the second quarter in the second half of the year as we continue to look at our marketing needs and take decisions accordingly. So on \u2013 thanks, Andrea. On the second question, there's \u2013 as we've in previous calls, I think we have a very open book with respect to the balance sheet and rightsizing and optimizing the balance sheet as we go forward. And there's no investment on the balance sheet that does not get a regular review and determination as to whether it should still be there. With respect to that part of the decision-making, our Bottling Investments group is an important piece of the equation. We don't have a timetable for further refranchising, but it certainly is our longer-term goal to be more asset-light, just as we have, I think, stated on previous occasions, and have acted accordingly with previous refranchising efforts. So that will and continues to be a part of the agenda, but not a specific time line on it. And then with respect to the comment on operating margins, I don't have a clear number to give you for either Q3 or Q4. But it goes without saying, is that as we looked at the opportunities that present themselves, we're not necessarily as focused on the months, but we're more focused on building momentum for the business and sustaining it in the \u2013 particularly in the markets that have got outsized importance to us. So we'll make those decisions as they come and as they appear to be the right ones to make at the right time, and the consequences will flow through accordingly. Yes, James, just \u2013 if I could just add to that. I think, Carlos, I think what we will see, both in some of the developing markets like India and even here in the United States, is I think there will be a higher turnover, particularly of small customers, in both the sort of more modern away-from-home as well as the traditional away from home. So I think we expect to see that. But that in and of itself, I don't think means a structural reset is necessary. It could just mean there will be more new ones coming along. And for our system, it just \u2013 it will be a key area of focus as we come out of the recovery period."

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be on listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and, therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations Department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President and Investor Relations Officer. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.\nTim Leveridge: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and John Murphy, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that we posted schedules under the financial reports and information tab in the Investors section of our company website at www.coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. I would also like to note that you can find additional materials in the Investors section of our company website that provide an analysis of our margin structure. In addition, this conference call may contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements, contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over to your questions. We recognize there will be a good deal of questions. [Operator Instructions] Now, let me turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Tim and good morning everyone. I'll start by noting that we're operating in truly extraordinary times, times of great challenges, but also times in which we can see many key opportunities ahead. First and foremost, on behalf of our company and our entire system, I'd like to share our deepest sympathies for all those who have been affected by this global pandemic. We also sincerely thank those who've been working to keep all of us safe through the crisis, particularly those on the front lines in the health care community. I also want to recognize our system associates, who are ensuring we can continue to supply beverages all around the world. We're still in the most intense first phase of the crisis in many places, if not most of the world. Through it all, we remain grounded in our purpose to refresh the world and make a difference. We start with employee health and safety which is paramount, followed by business continuity and our support of communities around the world. The vast majority of our office-based employees are working remotely. For those associates in our manufacturing and distribution facilities, we're using enhanced hygiene and sanitation practices. Through these practices, we are ensuring, our system associates are well and our products are safe and that they're delivered safely to our customers and consumers. We're closely linked with our bottlers on business continuity, which includes contingency planning for our global supply chain. And thanks to this hard work -- efforts across the whole system we don't foresee any material disruptions at this time. It's important to note that our business has a long heritage of supporting communities in times of need. The Coca-Cola system has made significant commitments to support relief efforts in markets impacted across the globe. Our system is committed to contributing more than $100 million and is focused on community relief programs, medical supplies and equipment during the outbreak phase, as well as on developing other actions for the recovery phase in markets hit hardest by the pandemic. Those commitments to date include the $40 million charitable grant from the Coca-Cola Foundation. We are working collaboratively with governments at all levels, federal, state and local to help steer the nation and the world towards recovery. We are all confident that we can with the communities we proudly call home rebound if we all work together for a better future. Now, as we look to the future, we recognize these are truly unprecedented times. And for that reason, we will take a different approach to our guidance and our discussion today. Recognizing that the operating backdrop has changed rapidly in the last several weeks, we will spend limited time discussing our first quarter results. In addition, given the great uncertainty in the current environment, we feel it's prudent to hold off providing fiscal year 2020 guidance. We expect to come back in our second quarter call in July with greater clarity. Today, I'd like to share, one, what we've been learning and observing as the situation evolves. Second, the actions we're taking now both to adapt to the current environment and to best position ourselves for the future. Third, and finally what gives me confidence that we will emerge even stronger. And lastly, I'll turn it over to John to discuss our financial strategy. The first quarter began with good momentum coming off strong results in 2019. We were successfully executing our long-term strategy. Through February, we had solid broad-based strength across the globe with the exception of China, where the progression of the virus was already well ahead of the rest of the world. Looking at it excluding China, our business was growing volumes 3% and we were continuing to gain value share. But as shelter at home and social distancing practice increased rapidly and globally, there has been temporary but profound pressure on our customers and our business. The biggest impact has been a sharp decline in the important away-from-home portion of our business, which includes our eating and drinking channels as well as our on-the-go orientated channels like convenience retail. While our exposure varies across markets, away-from-home broadly represents about half of our business given our strong share positions. In some markets like the U.S., drive-thru operations and carryout have helped offset some of the pressure, but most restaurants are operating on limited hours and are seeing overall trips decline sharply. In the at-home channels, we've seen some early pantry loading particularly in certain developed markets at the beginning of many of the lockdown phases. Then, as we get past the initial phases of the lockdown however, we are seeing levels normalize. In other markets like India, for example, the severity of the distancing measures has negatively impacted at-home as well, simply due to the significant reduction in shopping trips. At this stage, it's a little too early to determine exactly what level at-home trends will stabilize at. We've also seen a significant increase in e-commerce channels where we have been accelerating our presence versus the pre crisis. However, given the net effect of these shifts we expect a temporary but significant impact on our business in the second quarter primarily coming from the slowdown in our away from home business. For context, if we look at our April month-to-date trends we are seeing volumes down globally approximately 25% driven by the sharp declines in our away from home businesses. Fortunately based on the latest projections, we do expect the second quarter to be the most severely impacted. With that said, there is still a good deal of uncertainty around the trajectory of the pandemic as well as the resulting macroeconomic impact. While we're seeing different impacts across geographies and at different times, generally we expect three phases. The outright with its corresponding social distancing measures, a period of graduated re-openings; and finally a return to a new normal. Consumer mindset and shopping behavior will be different in each phase and they'll vary across markets, but we foresee some similar patterns that I'll discuss in greater detail. Of course, we can look to China for some early learnings about the various phases. I'm happy to say that our plants there are all operating and employees have returned to company offices in Shanghai. We're seeing encouraging signs of increased consumption as outlets reopen resulting in sequential improvement in China. However, the consumption is still lower than prior year and we expect the full recovery to take time especially as there are still limits on crowd sizes. As we anticipate a recovery in China, we're planning key actions with bottlers to regain momentum including our pre summer sales promotion and increased cooler placement. We will follow the strategy that has proved successful before the pandemic adjusted with greater focus on channels and packages that will have traction as the new normal unfolds. While we're encouraged by the improving trends in China, we recognize other countries may not follow the same trajectory and changes in social distancing practices may be gradual. And the situation in China could certainly continue to evolve. It is simply too soon to estimate exactly what might lay head. That's why we're taking swift action now to adapt in the near-term while best positioning ourselves for success later. Our global workforce is a critical asset and protecting people and roles is a high priority. Teams around the world are being asked to work differently and they're rising to the occasion. We have implemented real-time network collaboration routines to accelerate knowledge sharing. We're adapting local market strategies across our system including supply chain, stakeholder engagement and workforce management. We've adopted dynamic resource allocation practices in many regions matching people to projects and scaling the best ideas across geographies. In many ways the strategy we laid out at CAGNY remains the same, centered around brand building innovation, revenue growth management and execution. Having the ability to dial up and recalibrate aspects of that strategy is critical in this environment. A culture of agility is key. We are working seamlessly with our bottlers and retail customers to meet real-time demand given the rapid shifts in customer patterns. Bottler alignment has never been more important and the work we've done to strengthen the system in recent years is bearing fruit in step-up execution. For our retail customers, grocery stores for example, we're focused on maximizing system efficiency by ruthlessly prioritizing to deliver on core SKUs and key brands and help customers simplify their supply chains. We're also taking this opportunity to reshape our innovation pipeline to eliminate a longer tail of smaller projects and allocate resources to fewer, larger, more scalable and more relevant solutions for this environment. With shoppers spending less time browsing, it's crucial that we work to minimize out of stocks and maximize share of visible inventory. In markets around the world, we've redeployed on the ground sales reps and especially those orientated towards the on-premise trade and refocus them on merchandising, resulting in increased share of displays of stock on the floor. As consumers adjust to stay at home lifestyle, they're making fewer shopping trips and filling bigger baskets often based on availability and orientate to known trusted brands. Therefore, we are working with our customers to maximize promotional effectiveness and reconsidering multipack promotions and frequency to ensure the mix of our product and packaging offerings are meeting their needs. Our consumer centric total beverage strategy has enabled us to deliver products that shoppers want when stocking up on essentials whether it's to refresh, hydrate or provide functional benefits. We also recognize the importance of customers both big and small and are working to support independent retailers. We're implementing measures to support small retailers in many countries. For example in Brazil mom-and-pop stores face mounting pressure and they are a key pillar not only of our business but local communities. We have played a leading role in the formation of the Small Trade Activity Recovery or STAR program. Along with consumer product peers, the STAR coalition will connect companies, government and small retail associations to help small and medium retailers. We've also experienced an upsurge in e-commerce across the globe with the growth rate of the channel doubling in many countries. Consumers are getting necessities delivered to their door in many cases with contactless delivery. Revenue growth management plays a key role in our current strategy as we shift towards package sizes that are fit for purpose online sales and as we reallocate consumer and trade promotions to digital. For grocery e-delivery companies, we've increased in-app visibility with a focus on multi packs, so consumers can access our beverage within a click's reach of desire. We are also acting fast to address the needs of restaurant partners as they adapt to the current environment. In North America, we've offered our foodservice restaurant partners an alternative to fountain drink by ensuring bottle can availability for delivery. In the U.S. we partnered with the national leading food aggregators to increase our product profile and accelerate customer menu optimization by included beverage options and value bundles. Also, we've recently played an active role in The Great American Takeout movement with the National Restaurant Association. We're also being mindful about the right level of brand marketing and new product launches given the consumer mindset across markets. We've developed and determined that in this initial phase there is limited effectiveness to broad-based brand marketing. With this in mind, we've reduced our direct consumer communication we'll pause sizable marketing campaigns through the early stages of the crisis and reengage when the timing is right. These plans will vary from market to market with our earliest reengagement focusing on the recovery in China. At the same time, we are leveraging our associates to address longer-term opportunities recognizing that near-term realities will subside. Looking ahead, we may not know the exact shape of the recovery but we are taking action today to be prepared for the future. For the recovery phase RGM is key as we prepare to strike the right balance of affordability and recruitment packs in addition to premium offerings. This is one area where we are much better positioned versus our system 10 years ago when our portfolio and SKU optionality was not nearly as sophisticated as it is today. We'll also embrace some seismic consumer behavior shifts that are taking place, especially in e-commerce. We believe the accelerating expansion of the channel is sustainable and we want to continue to be well positioned for long-term growth. We are investing in digital capabilities to strengthen consumer connections and further piloting several different digital-enabled initiatives using fulfillment methods, whether B2B to home or B2C platforms in many countries to capture online demand for at-home consumption in the future. We're seeing good results in these early days and are looking to scale similar partnerships with more customers. In times when a crisis hit it can be easy to lose sight of the long-term but we will continue to build a more sustainable business for the future. Late last year, we refreshed our purpose statement: to refresh the world and make a difference and our company's purpose is now more important than ever. Tomorrow the company will publish its 2019 Business and Sustainability Report, reflecting a continued journey towards driving a more sustainable business. While there are still many unknowns ahead, we do know that over 134 years of business we've seen many types of crises, be they military, economic or pandemic and the Coca-Cola Company has always emerged stronger in the end. We are in a better position today than we were heading into previous periods of challenge. We've made meaningful progress in accelerating our capabilities, reshaping our bottling system, pivoting our portfolio and transforming our culture. Undoubtedly, there will be ups and downs in the coming months. But with our bottling partners, we are clear on what needs to be done both now and into the future to manage our business, focus our strategies, accelerate our actions and redirect our investments. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and thanks to all of you for joining us. I'd like to complement James' remarks with a particular focus on the following areas: our people, 2020 profitability and cash flow, capital allocation priorities, our bottling system and our post-COVID readiness. It maybe a little unusual to start the finance review on people, but in these times it is absolutely the right place to start. The manner in which we have seen sacrifice, commitment, resilience and adaptability in the past weeks has stood out, and we have been able to accomplish things which in normal times would have seemed impossible. As with many companies, job security is a concern for our people. And for us, it has been a key priority as we navigate through this period. Where necessary we have furloughed some employees and we have done so on full pay through June. The length, severity and overall impact of the crisis will ultimately determine how we will come out of this and we will be very thoughtful on our approach. What we do see as James mentioned is a lot of redeployment enabling the company to pivot quickly with the work that matters most in these times. The agility we are seeing across the world in this regard has been impressive and is opening the door to new ways of working that are allowing us to be a lot more responsive. For me some of the work that matters most is smart use of the many levers we have at our disposal to maximize profit and cash flow. On the revenue side, we have made substantial changes to our brand pack portfolio focus and are leveraging the playbooks on affordability and value that have served us so well in past crisis around the world. On the expenditure side, I would divide it into four key focus areas and with a particular emphasis on quarter 2. One, as James mentioned, we have been pulling back on our marketing spend for now. Staying close to our consumers in a relevant way is a key guiding principle, and staying disciplined to demand an appropriate ROI is a close second. Two, we are taking a similar approach with our trade dollars. While much of that spend is managed by our bottlers in both our bottling investments and North America businesses this is an important area to effectively manage and be willing to reengineer. Three, we are attacking all discretionary operating expenses and challenging what is essential and making sure every dollar being spent on services, travel, meetings, et cetera is appropriate. And four, we have paused all capital spend other than what is absolutely essential or has already been committed. By moving quickly and decisively we will avoid waste, improve ROI and spend and give us maximum flexibility for the second half of the year as we gain clarity on the outlook. Finally as a quick reminder for your models, the reductions to marketing and trade spend will get phased over the balance of the year. Our capital allocation priorities should be framed against our liquidity position and our balance sheet. With the actions taken since March, our overall liquidity is strong and so to is our balance sheet. We will of course continue to focus on protecting the progress we made on working capital and free cash flow in 2019. And in this context, our capital allocation priorities remain very much focused on investing wisely to support our business operations and continuing to prioritize our dividend. Specifically with regard to the dividend, we currently have no intentions to change our approach. Regarding M&A, we do not foresee any significant activity going forward this year, nor do we intend to repurchase shares. We are also mindful of staying close to the debt range we have previously highlighted. We will of course review our overall approach to capital allocation as we know more about the length and severity of the crisis. James spoke earlier about how our global bottling system is adapting to the coronavirus pandemic. I cannot overstate the admiration we all have for everything our bottling partners are doing to stay close to their people, their customers and their communities. Many of them are battle heartened when it comes to managing crisis and I know they are proactively taking steps to preserve cash, strengthen their balance sheets and manage their P&Ls. Currently we do not have any major concerns surrounding our bottling partners from a liquidity perspective and we are working closely with them to anticipate and deal effectively with a scenario where the coronavirus situation is longer and more severe than currently anticipated. As we noted in our release, we are unable to provide an update to our full year 2020 financial outlook. We expect to have a better picture of how the recovery will unfold when we report our second quarter results in July. Meantime, I would like to highlight the following. In looking at currency impacts for comparable net revenues based on current spot rates and including the impact of hedge positions, we expect a mid-single-digit full year headwind. For comparable operating income also based on current spot rates, expect a high single-digit headwind with most of the headwind coming from our developing and emerging markets. We still expect the company's underlying effective tax rate to be 19.5% for the year. Looking ahead it's important that we adapt quickly to the current environment while also best positioning ourselves to win in the post-COVID world. Emerging stronger from this crisis, demands a willingness to challenge the status quo. To that end we are using this time to do just that. The last couple of months have already taught us how to do many things very differently. In closing, let me say, I have never been more proud to be part of the Coca-Cola system are indeed more optimistic. It's a testament to the culture of transformation taking hold across the organization. Our people and the strategic alignment of our system gives me the confidence in our ability to not only manage through the current crisis but to emerge from it stronger. With that operator we are ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nSteve Powers: Thanks. Hi, guys. Good morning. I hope you're all well and thanks for all that detail. I guess building on where you focused your prepared remarks James, I think everyone on the call is likely trying to tease out to some extent the depth and duration of what hopefully is a bottom in 2Q and then how the system is likely to emerge on the back side. When you think about what you and your bottling partners have seen thus far in China but also Italy, elsewhere in Europe and the U.S., are there common experiences whether positive or negative that you can pass along that can help us better get underneath that question? And how are you handicapping the forward prospects in key emerging markets like Brazil or India, where arguably the implications are just now taking shape? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Let me offer a few thoughts and see whether that helps. Firstly, there's a set of in the famous expression known unknowns here that heavily influence the shape of how long this \u2013 the virus crisis will last and the resulting economic crisis and the degree of ups and downs and volatile on the way. And those known unknowns are all out there and we can't determine which way they're going to take us. And I think that's important because while there are some learnings from the earlier markets like China, South Korea or even some of the European markets, we're still at the beginning. We're still at the beginning. What do I mean by that? We can see the path of how China or South Korea or Singapore, some of those countries came into the crisis, how the lockdowns occurred by channel, by pack, by brand, the change in consumer behavior; and then being able to follow that journey as they have opened up and the thing has started to stabilize. And you can see China, we were doing great in January. We had a fantastic start to the year double-digit growth. It was a very profound lockdown in February, much deeper than the minus 25% we're currently seeing globally and we started to build back up volatile from week-to-week in March. And we're kind of getting close towards neutral in China now, still below where we were last year and where we were in January. But I think it's important to emphasize that doesn't mean it's over. We can see from Singapore or Tokyo Japan they have a kind of a second wave of the lockdown. So what we see is very clear experiences on what happens in the first phase of the lockdown pantry load channel changes et cetera, et cetera. And we've done a great job of moving those, link around the world. Now we expect to see the next phase of the crisis come which is post generalized global lockdowns. We're going to see a graduated set of re-openings around the world. How long they will take to get from where we are now to the new normal depends on these known unknowns, and could include further retreats to lockdowns as we've seen in a couple of countries. So we can't -- known unknown. What we can do is focus on what we're good at. We can focus on a few simple ideas. One the beverage industry is a great industry. As I said on the call, every previous crisis military economic or pandemic in that last 134 years, the Coke Company has come out stronger. We've done that by doing essentially two things at the same time. One, using the DNA of our system which knows how to manage in an economic crisis resulting from whatever, manage the business on a day-to-day, week-to-week, quarter-to-quarter basis, having the flexibility and adaptability to do the right amount of brand building innovation, revenue growth manage our next Houston market. But at the same time, have an eye on where is this going in the long-term such that, as we work our way through the winding path of what the crisis takes us, we end up emerging stronger. And so I would emphasize. And that's obviously why we haven't provided full year guidance. We are still at the beginning. We may be at the end of the big global lockdown, but we are still some way from the new normal.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nBryan Spillane: Hey. Good morning, everybody. So I guess, just thinking about the comments James that you made about maybe changes in packaging. And maybe linking that to as we get past this initial lockdown phase and thinking about the business, maybe a year out. What is the sort of dynamic that you're sort of trying to focus on? Is it one a recession and a consumer maybe more focused on value, or is it the second being more the consumer-focused changes in consumer behavior patterns? Maybe consumers buying more e-commerce more reluctant to have that away-from-home consumption just trying to understand how you're kind of thinking about how the business changes once we get past that lockdown phase? And again does it imply maybe a greater shift to the at-home packaging versus away-from-home?\nJames Quincey: Yeah, great question. Look, you could clearly see a set of clear trends on the packaging. I mean in the lockdown, obviously the away-from-home channels are down heavily which means the immediate consumption packaging are down heavily. And we're much more focused on at-home which tends to be larger or multi packs. But it also sees a big step-up in e-commerce. We've seen a near doubling of our -- of the importance of the growth of e-commerce for us. So once we get past the lockdown I think, we'll see an environment through these graduated re-openings of society still with the spectre of the virus over us with a reality of an impacted economy. And I think what we'd like to see is a step change in some already ongoing trends like a step-up in e-commerce. It is both economically attractive and kind of spectre of the virus friendly, so I think we'll see a lot more e-commerce. I think it will take time for the highest aggregation channels to come back. But I think they will come back in the end. In the new normal there will be new consumer behavior at that point in time, because ultimately we are social animals. That aggregation will come back. But I think, we're also going to see a very profound theme of affordability. What we're seeing in the lockdown is not just the effect of the lockdown of certain channels. But I think that anticipation by the consumer of where the economy is going. There's going to be an economic impact. We're in the face of all this uncertainty. So we're going to see a lot more -- a lot more affordability where we've launched refillable PET back again in South Africa. We're investing in refillables in Latin America. We're really looking at how we can drive affordability for them. So a lot more e-commerce in the future, we're certainly going to see a profound theme of affordability coming up in the next years. We're going to see a lot of attempts by governments by us as well to support the smaller outlet base, as those will be the ones who've most suffered in the lockdown, whatever channel they're in. So we have been able to pivot and we expect to continue to pivot our brand marketing our innovation our revenue growth management and the execution by the bottlers through each stage of this crisis as it moves forward. In the end, the crisis management DNA is out there in the system. We may not have faced a global pandemic in living memory. But all around the world in the system we have lots of managers who've been in countries which have faced crisis. And as the spectre of the virus lifts what we'll be left with is an impacted economy -- some new consumer behaviors but an impacted economy. And this is when the Coke system can shine and always has shone in the past.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC. Your line is now open.\nNik Modi: Yeah. Thanks good morning everyone. James you talked about really focusing on the core some core SKUs in order to have it in stock obviously with the demand surge. But can you talk a little bit about, how your interaction with the retail community has been in terms of how they're thinking about some of the longer-lasting impacts of the decisions they make in terms of how many products they shelve and the kind of assortment they carry, any perspective around that? I know it's early but I'm already starting to hear some of this coming back in the retail community, in terms of how they're thinking about streamlining their assortment and portfolio choices, so just curious, if you've been hearing the same?\nJames Quincey: Yes absolutely. And two things come together in the short term and they both work in the same direction which is the crisis management of keeping the supply chain open, while we have all these restrictions in the period of the lockdown and the virus crisis. And then I think you've got this likelihood of an impacted economy going forward for some period of time. In both those circumstances, both of those things lead you to a similar set of actions whether you're a manufacturer or an at-home retailer which is to focus on the biggest most important most well-known brands and affordability and making sure you can get availability in store. I mean one of the -- one of -- we've had a lot of focus on supporting the grocery customers. Because of course, we've got a strong bottling system that can deliver reliable supply onto the floor. So we've seen ourselves be able to gain share of inventory in the store because we've been able to sustain the supply chain. So really being able to be there for the customers and execute and deliver product on the floor. But both us and them will also be driving to a rationalization on focusing on what's the most effective set of brands and SKUs to push through which will mean a cutting of the longer tail in this coming period. Will more choice, more innovation come back when new normal and economy reestablishes itself? Yes, I'm sure it will. But in this period it's going to be a question of focus.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey guys, I hope you all are well. James I just want to press a bit more on Steve's question and I know it's hard to answer it. But if one sort of makes the assumption that government-mandated closures and the social distancing all by the end of Q2 doesn't reemerge this disease in a major way this summer, could you just give us some thoughts on the pace of recovery you're expecting on your business as you look out over the next few quarters? And I'm trying to sort of separate out the direct social distancing impact more from the secondary economic impact as we look going forward. Is it more of a V-shaped recovery in your mind for your business or U-shaped or even L-shaped as we look through year-end 2020? And then just taking a step back thinking about 2021, obviously you're not giving expectations any time soon. But again assuming the social distancing doesn't reemerge in a big way in the winter, how confident are you that whatever the volume degradation ends up being in 2020 is, is mostly recovered in 2021? Is it most of it? Is it -- hard to imagine a lot of that comes back? Just conceptually how do you think about these things longer term? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I would love to be able to tell you there's an answer to that question, but there isn't. What we do know is, what is -- we can see the shape of the social distancing measures into the coming months and there are already governments that have distancing measures into Q3. We're very focused as ever on picking up on the re-openings. Those re-openings if we take Europe and the U.S. in May and June, there are people in government that are talking about three phases and they're talking about the reopening part of Phase 1, not yet 2 and 3 are happening in the same quarter. So I think we will see social distancing measures for some period of time into Q3. Hopefully they will not be as severe as the second quarter. Maybe they will last to the fourth maybe not. We just cannot know. What -- we have to focus on is, in a way to use your -- this alphabet soup of scenarios the U the V and L. We have to be ready in case, it's a V. If it does bounce back, we don't want to be so conservative we are not ready for a spring back of the economy and a spring back in demand and we want to be ahead of the curve. I don't think it's -- I have said before I don't think the V is the most likely scenario, but we will be ready if it occurs. The U, clearly you want to take the middle scenario we understand. And certainly, I think the U is more likely than the V and how that's going to go forward. And clearly we need to prepare to act on that one with a lot of the measures we took up. Is the L possible? Yes the L is possible too. Our approach is to make sure we are both flexible and ready and have the plans charged and ready to go when the spring back comes. We also need to manage the recessionary period and the lockdown periods and social distancing periods with specific and tailored plans to do the best we can in those things. And of course we need to be prepared and understand that if it is the L or anything along those lines, we need to have given ourselves some flexibility to respond to those scenarios as well. So the key that we are focused on is, how we anticipate the scenarios that could be ahead of us, across the whole range how do we give ourselves the flexibility to act on them and make sure we manage the business day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter to get the best possible result as we go along this winding path; because we cannot see over the horizon and yet retain a focus that by the end of this crisis the Coca-Cola Company will have emerged stronger and be better setup for the long term as it has always done in every previous crises for its 134 years.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nBonnie Herzog: Hi, thank you. Good morning everyone. I am -- was hoping you could give us a little more color on what you're doing to ensure your supply chain, really is accommodating some of the demand volatility that we've seen in recent weeks. And how is this different in the U.S. versus across some of your emerging markets for instance? And then along those same lines, you probably have a lot of excess capacity at this point for servicing restaurants and in your fountain business. So curious how you manage that side of your supply chain given there's probably a lot of excess capacity there? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. We're clearly very focused on adapting the supply chain. And if I break it down into a few pieces, there's of course sourcing the ingredients that we use in the concentrate in the bottling plant, our own concentrate manufacturing or fountain manufacturing the bottling plants and then on through the distribution. There's been a lot of challenges. But I would like to congratulate the supply chain teams at the company and at all of the bottling partners for the incredible work they've done at basically keeping everything running. I was certainly on record a few weeks ago saying, the supply chains around the world will be creaking. There's been a lot of pressure at the borders, whether it's the provincial \u2013 province-to-province borders in some countries or country-to-country borders in other parts of the world moving some of the ingredients that are basically shipped around the world. But once they're within the country, which is the larger of these, the great advantage of the Coke system is that the Cokes are made locally. All our drinks are basically made locally. The drinks in the U.S. are made in the U.S., the drinks in Germany are made in Germany, the drinks in Kenya are made in Kenya. And so the local supply chain is then able to work designated as part of the food system, so an essential service to allow to run the production systems and distribution. So, we've had relatively \u2013 we've had some issues on timing of ingredients. Those are much better than they were a few weeks ago. Production facilities are largely running. We made a lot of adaptations to ensure safety and sanitation and security for the employees and that's true over the concentrate plants and most of the bottling plants just a couple of places that we see some plant shutdown. And then distribution, we've largely kept up and running everywhere and doubled down on that. Yes. There are issues in the odd countries here and there on the \u2013 on availability of \u2013 in some of the logistics for drivers or having to swap drivers at borders. But generally speaking, it's been \u2013 we've been able to adapt and it's the great strength of having ultimately a local supply chain in each country. And yeah, there are some parts of the supply chain that are running 24/7 and there are some places \u2013 parts like the fountain supply that are much more low utilization. And we'll have to manage through that as we see how these graduated re-openings start to take place in the coming months and quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi. Good morning, everybody. John, if you could just maybe link two things you talked about. You mentioned comfort in your liquidity in the various areas of liquidity you have available as well as the \u2013 a small conversation about the bottlers and such. But can you link them in some way that, if we do end up in an environment, where some of the bottlers need some assistance do you feel like you have the liquidity to either buy them in again or perhaps bail out, or will something like that need to be reliant on consolidation within the bottlers?\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Kau. Let me frame the liquidity position that we have and indeed some of our bottlers first. We've \u2013 as I mentioned, we've taken quick actions in March to anticipate whatever outcome in the back half of the year good bad or indifferent. Keep in mind that, with our bottlers over 50% of our business globally is in the hands of our large public play on bottlers, all of whom came into 2020 with strong balance sheets. And I believe we're doing a very good job also to anticipate a number of different outcomes for the year. We are staying very close to all of our bottlers around the world, small, medium and large. And that will be on a case-by-case basis as to what eventually happens in the coming months, but we feel that we have \u2013 we have plenty of gunpowder available to manage whatever situation evolves in that period. So all in all, we're confident in the overall strength of the system to withstand the coming months.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping \u2013 you talked a lot about sort of the various actions that you're taking on equity expenses and so on and ability to protect profitability from that perspective. But when you're also thinking about gross margins, I was hoping you could just try to weave together all the different things you've talked about trimming this fiscal tail, I guess the smaller innovation efforts, affordability pack efforts, and impact on right now just with the shortfall in immediate consumption; the relative profitability of fountain foodservice. Just \u2013 I think it's \u2013 because for me anyways there certainly no one that likes talking about the quarter, but gross margins were quite strong in the quarter. And so I'm just trying to think forward as we weave together all these different elements how we should think about gross margin as we work through these times? Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Yeah. So for the quarter gross margins were positively impacted with the mix of the inventory build and a relatively poor performance from our lower-margin segments. With respect to the outlook what I would focus on a couple of points that James also made is that the system is using a number of playbooks. If you think about where revenue growth management started in the world -- in our world, it was really born in Argentina and Latin America during the crisis of the early 2000s. And we're leveraging many of the lessons and indeed the capabilities to focus on our core sparkling brands, which, as you know, have a more favorable margin, to be very clear on the price pack architectures to be able to get full benefit from both an affordability play, but as well as to be able to segment in our channels and markets with the appropriate packs for value. And also during this period, it's been an opportunity to trim back significantly the long tail, which as we've highlighted in previous calls that tail is typically comprised of some of the more \u2013 the younger explorer and challenger brands, which by nature are lower margins. So I think a combination of the playbooks that we know work, a focus on the bigger brands and the key packages that typically are higher margin and being in the position to prioritize our leader brands and packages gives us comfort that the -- on the gross margin front that we can continue to build on the momentum that we've had for the last couple of years.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nBill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning. Just more specifically, maybe you can talk a little bit about kind of the -- sorry about that.\nJames Quincey: Bill, yes, we lost you. We can hear you now.\nBill Chappell: Can you hear me now?\nJames Quincey: Yes, yes.\nBill Chappell: Sorry about that. Good morning. I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the sports event business and kind of how you plan for that over the next couple of quarters? And when I say that, everything from the Olympics to football to what have you, it seems like there's a longer time frame before we have those type of group events. And so, I guess, trying to understand how movable some of your expenditures are in terms of can you quickly cancel those and move them around? And also, how do you plan for not having those type of events to supply for probably six months plus?\nJames Quincey: Yes. Certainly, the expectation when you look at the \u2013 to the extent that there are public reopening plans and talk about what the phases would look like, most sporting events sit in phase three, i.e., towards the back end. So, I think, that it's pretty clear that we're going to see a relatively limited, not say none, amount of large sporting events with audiences in the next couple of quarters, but it's not likely. Hopefully, it will come to pass, but I think it's going to be difficult. Now, how we adapt to that? And, obviously, the biggest one of that is the Olympics, which has now been pushed out to next year. Obviously, there's some degree of fixed investment in the asset in the sponsorship. And, obviously, we're talking to all our partners about how this disruption of the virus impact the assets and what we can do together. The majority of the spend is largely in the activation of the marketing programs with the asset and those tend to be variable cost media buys, one sort or another or a marketing activation, where we can actually repurpose that money to other things. So, as John talked about on the call, we have been very assertive in increasing the degree of flexibility and reprioritization of all the marketing and OpEx. But all the marketing spend in the downhill of the year to maximize flexibility, because we just know which channels or events are going to open up when and potentially change from one day to the next. And so, we're maximizing flexibility. The good news is most of the marketing spend, the large majority of the marketing spend is variable and we retain the opportunity to change our plans as we go through the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about as, kind of, moving into the post-COVID environment, how you feel you're situated for the affordability issue, given changes in your price pack architecture that you've done over the last 10-or-so years? And also, what changes you've done in your culture, right? I mean one of the big things that you've tried to do from the beginning of the first days is make some significant changes in the culture of the Coca-Cola Company. Perhaps you can add to what are you doing along those lines either to push that forward and to meet the challenges and accountability and the speed that you're looking for given the crisis environment? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. We commented a little earlier that responding in a crisis has certainly been part of the DNA of the Coke system. From a cultural point of view, we have been clearly focused in the last few years on -- through some of the organizational changes, through some of the work on training skill building and developing the culture to increase the degree of agility, the nimbleness of the global organization. But also the degree of networking has become a much more networked organization which obviously the two things work together, which has been fantastic in a way because there's no better time to have got better at those two things than when you've got a global crisis. And the value of the learnings that can be moved around the world is certainly very high. So we've been focusing on a number of things the culture, but certainly ramping up the agility and the network, creating a networked organization has certainly helped us in this crisis. And then as we focused in on affordability, John mentioned it earlier, the revenue growth management approach has been part of -- our crisis manufacturing was born in a crisis or many crises and we have developed that capability around the world over the years -- actually over the last couple of years we had another big push to drive revenue management capability around the one. It wasn't just that we were looking for premium pricing and smaller packaging, yes we were looking for those things but they were an output of a capability we were building that is now going to be turned towards responding to the different environments that we'll see across the different countries as their macros perform. And so the system us and the bottlers, have upgraded our ability to really pivot towards affordability in whatever shape that means in the country you're in and using whichever brands is relevant in the phase we're talking about. So I think we are in the best shape we've been going into a global crisis than we have been for a long time.\nJohn Murphy: And James, if I just could add on the cost management side to sort of amplify the point on networking and agility. I think as we go into the rest of the year we've had the opportunity over the last four to six weeks to work very closely with all markets to be clear on what's fixed, what's variable, what's committed, what's non-committed, and then what are the key decision points that we will have over the coming weeks to be able to pivot us an appropriately into the second half of the year and it will be very market centric. In some markets we will want to accelerate investments and in some markets pull back. But the network that's in place the digital infrastructure we have to allow us to connect is -- certainly are elements that are serving us very well at the moment.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, and good morning. Are you seeing at-home consumption accelerate or decelerate in April against March? And do you view the fewer shopping trips you alluded to mostly offset by commerce in most places and the negative impact, mostly localized in some countries like you said in India and epicenter cities like New York? In other words, I'm trying to see how concerned are you with center destocking at this point? Are there still a lot of out-of-stocks in your view at retail, and we could actually see at-home accelerate as you progress your revenue management initiatives? And should we expect the negative price/mix impact because of the bigger weight of the multi-serve in the next few quarters? I really appreciate. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Taking it a bit in reverse order, yeah, if we -- if there's a big shift in the mix towards future consumption packages versus immediate consumption in any given country that will be a headwind to mix in the coming quarters. There maybe all sorts of other effects, as John mentioned some of our vertically integrated businesses have been impacted. We run the fountain business all coursed through our BIGs. So there'll be a lot of mix effects in the coming quarters, but that one will be a headwind as we think about the future quarters. In terms of the trajectory of at-home, one can't simply look at March versus April because each country is following its own path. What we see is as the virus has started to take off, you start to see footfall starting to decline in some of the away-from-home channels then the lockdown starts to get occur and you get big declines in footfall in the away-from-home channels and you get a spike in stock-up volumes in the at-home for a few weeks, and then you obviously are into the lockdown and then the numbers start to normalize and you start to see some stability in the future consumption. Now what's happening within the at-home channel is you have to I think layer on conceptually not just a closure of channels and consumers moving from A to B, but an anticipation or at least a consumer response to the uncertainty of where we're all going economically and therefore a shift in the prioritization of the categories that they buy even within the at-home channel. So, it's quite clear and it's a visible pattern not always the same categories but it's a very visible pattern around the world. You see what consumers deem as essential spikes up and stays up in the at-home channels. Some things like beverages sell more but not nearly enough to compensate for the losses in the away-from-home channels. And then some categories and the smaller SKUs get heavily deprioritized both by the customers and by the consumers. So, it's important to see those complete trends. It's certainly not the case that e-commerce is offsetting the losses from away-from-home relatively -- e-commerce even though it's doubled in sales for a beverage category it's still a very small percentage of the total beverage category. So, there's a lot of adaptation going on and you literally need to go place by place.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.\nLaurent Grandet: Hey good morning everyone and many thanks for your detailed comments on how you approach the crisis. One question on the advertising spend you mentioned in your pre-remarks you are pushing back your advertising spend to later in the year. So, could you please give us a bit more direction on how we should think about the sequencing by quarter and also by brand? And finally, also, should we think your strong innovation pipeline and for the year is now put on hold? Thank you.\nJohn Murphy: Sure. Yes.\nJames Quincey: Go on John.\nJohn Murphy: Okay. Go ahead James. Yes, so the approach as we talked for the rest of the year has been to really stay close to the consumer in a relevant way. And in the second quarter that actually means in many markets coming off air. We have had a number of communications announcing that we will take a pause for now while we focus our efforts on our communities and on other priorities and that we'll be back later in the year. But back later in the year looks like it's going to be very much dependent on the shape of the recovery. And so for the quarter the upcoming quarter, we're creating as much optionality as we can so that markets can do the right thing in the second half of the year. Tim and the team can take you through some of the implications on the -- that I alluded to in my remarks on the phasing for the rest of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carlos Laboy with HSBC. Your line is now open.\nCarlos Laboy: Yes, good morning everyone. In some key -- if some key emerging markets remain weak or go into a protracted recession here, how do you prompt North America and Europe to accelerate the pace of change and growth? There were some promising momentum what kind of things can you do to step up the rate of transformation in developed markets here?\nJames Quincey: I mean we're going to have to manage the portfolio here. Certainly, we will have to look at each part of the world and adopt the strategy and the approach and the right balance of marketing innovation, RGM, and execution that's appropriate for the macro and the context of the consumer behaviors. We had a great program and a lot of momentum coming back in the North American business and also the European business. We'll have to manage each step as we take it. I mean certainly [Technical Difficulty] and so we will have lots of things ready to roll against the different scenarios we see coming out. So, we certainly would be looking to see North America or -- and Europe doing better as we come out of the new normal.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nKevin Grundy: Thanks. Good morning everyone. We've covered a lot of ground. I wanted to ask James on emerging markets. Historically, the company has tried to offset some of these FX headwinds in EMs with pricing. But sort of building on some of your early commentary, do you foresee that some of the demand challenges broadly in a number of these key markets are going to compromise your ability to put your pricing to offset some of these FX? And how are you sort of weighing market share objectives overall health of consumer with profitability over the next 12 months? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Our starting point is the approach that we compete locally. The economics of the industry are more local than they are dollar. So we focus on staying close to consumers and the customers and competing locally to build the franchise is to gain market share and to sustain or improve profitability in a local sense. In the short-term, we do not -- that does not mean we use pricing to track and try and offset ForEx that will make us less competitive in the local context. Over the long run, clearly, as currencies devalue, they tend to import inflation and therefore the pricing over the medium-term tends to track to offset the FX. We've been hit harder this year than we expected from some of the emerging markets and we don't see ourselves pricing just to try and offset that. We will obviously be driving affordability to try and drive demand and sustain the business. And therefore, on the top line, we can try and make sure that we get the right level of profitability. Now over the last few years, we have tried to say look we do not aim for the Coca-Cola Company to just be the sum of all the local wins and occasional losses in the local marketplaces. We are pulling levers as a corporation to balance out the portfolio to achieve objectives of making sure the shareholders get returns in U.S. dollars. Clearly, this year is going to be a very atypical year. We're going to manage the year as we've described. But going into the future we will certainly be back to try and balance the three legs of the stool as we have tried in prior years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sean King with UBS. Your line is now open.\nSean King: Thank you. I wanted to dig into your commodity hedging exposure and if there is any opportunity to benefit from the relative correction we've seen in certain input prices. I mean, on the other side with ethanol production near shuttered, do you see any risk throughout the system for CO2 supply?\nJames Quincey: Sean, thanks for the question. I'm glad you raised it, because I should have highlighted in my remarks earlier with Lauren's question on commodities. The commodity outlook is favorable overall and so I expect that both the company with our finished goods businesses and indeed our bottling system can take advantage of some of those commodity pricing in the rest of the year and into 2021. On the CO2 front, yes, we're aware of the challenges, particularly in the U.S. due to the bioethanol raw gas feedstock sourcing depletion. But our team has got a number of contingency plans in place and we don't foresee an issue in the foreseeable future at this point.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Thank you. Coca-Cola has a history of leadership of resilience and of doing the right thing, no matter whether the times are good or whether challenges exist. And this time will be no different. We've never been better positioned than we are today to manage through this situation and come out even stronger. So as always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in the company and for joining us today. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "James Quincey",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim and good morning everyone. I'll start by noting that we're operating in truly extraordinary times, times of great challenges, but also times in which we can see many key opportunities ahead. First and foremost, on behalf of our company and our entire system, I'd like to share our deepest sympathies for all those who have been affected by this global pandemic. We also sincerely thank those who've been working to keep all of us safe through the crisis, particularly those on the front lines in the health care community. I also want to recognize our system associates, who are ensuring we can continue to supply beverages all around the world. We're still in the most intense first phase of the crisis in many places, if not most of the world. Through it all, we remain grounded in our purpose to refresh the world and make a difference. We start with employee health and safety which is paramount, followed by business continuity and our support of communities around the world. The vast majority of our office-based employees are working remotely. For those associates in our manufacturing and distribution facilities, we're using enhanced hygiene and sanitation practices. Through these practices, we are ensuring, our system associates are well and our products are safe and that they're delivered safely to our customers and consumers. We're closely linked with our bottlers on business continuity, which includes contingency planning for our global supply chain. And thanks to this hard work -- efforts across the whole system we don't foresee any material disruptions at this time. It's important to note that our business has a long heritage of supporting communities in times of need. The Coca-Cola system has made significant commitments to support relief efforts in markets impacted across the globe. Our system is committed to contributing more than $100 million and is focused on community relief programs, medical supplies and equipment during the outbreak phase, as well as on developing other actions for the recovery phase in markets hit hardest by the pandemic. Those commitments to date include the $40 million charitable grant from the Coca-Cola Foundation. We are working collaboratively with governments at all levels, federal, state and local to help steer the nation and the world towards recovery. We are all confident that we can with the communities we proudly call home rebound if we all work together for a better future. Now, as we look to the future, we recognize these are truly unprecedented times. And for that reason, we will take a different approach to our guidance and our discussion today. Recognizing that the operating backdrop has changed rapidly in the last several weeks, we will spend limited time discussing our first quarter results. In addition, given the great uncertainty in the current environment, we feel it's prudent to hold off providing fiscal year 2020 guidance. We expect to come back in our second quarter call in July with greater clarity. Today, I'd like to share, one, what we've been learning and observing as the situation evolves. Second, the actions we're taking now both to adapt to the current environment and to best position ourselves for the future. Third, and finally what gives me confidence that we will emerge even stronger. And lastly, I'll turn it over to John to discuss our financial strategy. The first quarter began with good momentum coming off strong results in 2019. We were successfully executing our long-term strategy. Through February, we had solid broad-based strength across the globe with the exception of China, where the progression of the virus was already well ahead of the rest of the world. Looking at it excluding China, our business was growing volumes 3% and we were continuing to gain value share. But as shelter at home and social distancing practice increased rapidly and globally, there has been temporary but profound pressure on our customers and our business. The biggest impact has been a sharp decline in the important away-from-home portion of our business, which includes our eating and drinking channels as well as our on-the-go orientated channels like convenience retail. While our exposure varies across markets, away-from-home broadly represents about half of our business given our strong share positions. In some markets like the U.S., drive-thru operations and carryout have helped offset some of the pressure, but most restaurants are operating on limited hours and are seeing overall trips decline sharply. In the at-home channels, we've seen some early pantry loading particularly in certain developed markets at the beginning of many of the lockdown phases. Then, as we get past the initial phases of the lockdown however, we are seeing levels normalize. In other markets like India, for example, the severity of the distancing measures has negatively impacted at-home as well, simply due to the significant reduction in shopping trips. At this stage, it's a little too early to determine exactly what level at-home trends will stabilize at. We've also seen a significant increase in e-commerce channels where we have been accelerating our presence versus the pre crisis. However, given the net effect of these shifts we expect a temporary but significant impact on our business in the second quarter primarily coming from the slowdown in our away from home business. For context, if we look at our April month-to-date trends we are seeing volumes down globally approximately 25% driven by the sharp declines in our away from home businesses. Fortunately based on the latest projections, we do expect the second quarter to be the most severely impacted. With that said, there is still a good deal of uncertainty around the trajectory of the pandemic as well as the resulting macroeconomic impact. While we're seeing different impacts across geographies and at different times, generally we expect three phases. The outright with its corresponding social distancing measures, a period of graduated re-openings; and finally a return to a new normal. Consumer mindset and shopping behavior will be different in each phase and they'll vary across markets, but we foresee some similar patterns that I'll discuss in greater detail. Of course, we can look to China for some early learnings about the various phases. I'm happy to say that our plants there are all operating and employees have returned to company offices in Shanghai. We're seeing encouraging signs of increased consumption as outlets reopen resulting in sequential improvement in China. However, the consumption is still lower than prior year and we expect the full recovery to take time especially as there are still limits on crowd sizes. As we anticipate a recovery in China, we're planning key actions with bottlers to regain momentum including our pre summer sales promotion and increased cooler placement. We will follow the strategy that has proved successful before the pandemic adjusted with greater focus on channels and packages that will have traction as the new normal unfolds. While we're encouraged by the improving trends in China, we recognize other countries may not follow the same trajectory and changes in social distancing practices may be gradual. And the situation in China could certainly continue to evolve. It is simply too soon to estimate exactly what might lay head. That's why we're taking swift action now to adapt in the near-term while best positioning ourselves for success later. Our global workforce is a critical asset and protecting people and roles is a high priority. Teams around the world are being asked to work differently and they're rising to the occasion. We have implemented real-time network collaboration routines to accelerate knowledge sharing. We're adapting local market strategies across our system including supply chain, stakeholder engagement and workforce management. We've adopted dynamic resource allocation practices in many regions matching people to projects and scaling the best ideas across geographies. In many ways the strategy we laid out at CAGNY remains the same, centered around brand building innovation, revenue growth management and execution. Having the ability to dial up and recalibrate aspects of that strategy is critical in this environment. A culture of agility is key. We are working seamlessly with our bottlers and retail customers to meet real-time demand given the rapid shifts in customer patterns. Bottler alignment has never been more important and the work we've done to strengthen the system in recent years is bearing fruit in step-up execution. For our retail customers, grocery stores for example, we're focused on maximizing system efficiency by ruthlessly prioritizing to deliver on core SKUs and key brands and help customers simplify their supply chains. We're also taking this opportunity to reshape our innovation pipeline to eliminate a longer tail of smaller projects and allocate resources to fewer, larger, more scalable and more relevant solutions for this environment. With shoppers spending less time browsing, it's crucial that we work to minimize out of stocks and maximize share of visible inventory. In markets around the world, we've redeployed on the ground sales reps and especially those orientated towards the on-premise trade and refocus them on merchandising, resulting in increased share of displays of stock on the floor. As consumers adjust to stay at home lifestyle, they're making fewer shopping trips and filling bigger baskets often based on availability and orientate to known trusted brands. Therefore, we are working with our customers to maximize promotional effectiveness and reconsidering multipack promotions and frequency to ensure the mix of our product and packaging offerings are meeting their needs. Our consumer centric total beverage strategy has enabled us to deliver products that shoppers want when stocking up on essentials whether it's to refresh, hydrate or provide functional benefits. We also recognize the importance of customers both big and small and are working to support independent retailers. We're implementing measures to support small retailers in many countries. For example in Brazil mom-and-pop stores face mounting pressure and they are a key pillar not only of our business but local communities. We have played a leading role in the formation of the Small Trade Activity Recovery or STAR program. Along with consumer product peers, the STAR coalition will connect companies, government and small retail associations to help small and medium retailers. We've also experienced an upsurge in e-commerce across the globe with the growth rate of the channel doubling in many countries. Consumers are getting necessities delivered to their door in many cases with contactless delivery. Revenue growth management plays a key role in our current strategy as we shift towards package sizes that are fit for purpose online sales and as we reallocate consumer and trade promotions to digital. For grocery e-delivery companies, we've increased in-app visibility with a focus on multi packs, so consumers can access our beverage within a click's reach of desire. We are also acting fast to address the needs of restaurant partners as they adapt to the current environment. In North America, we've offered our foodservice restaurant partners an alternative to fountain drink by ensuring bottle can availability for delivery. In the U.S. we partnered with the national leading food aggregators to increase our product profile and accelerate customer menu optimization by included beverage options and value bundles. Also, we've recently played an active role in The Great American Takeout movement with the National Restaurant Association. We're also being mindful about the right level of brand marketing and new product launches given the consumer mindset across markets. We've developed and determined that in this initial phase there is limited effectiveness to broad-based brand marketing. With this in mind, we've reduced our direct consumer communication we'll pause sizable marketing campaigns through the early stages of the crisis and reengage when the timing is right. These plans will vary from market to market with our earliest reengagement focusing on the recovery in China. At the same time, we are leveraging our associates to address longer-term opportunities recognizing that near-term realities will subside. Looking ahead, we may not know the exact shape of the recovery but we are taking action today to be prepared for the future. For the recovery phase RGM is key as we prepare to strike the right balance of affordability and recruitment packs in addition to premium offerings. This is one area where we are much better positioned versus our system 10 years ago when our portfolio and SKU optionality was not nearly as sophisticated as it is today. We'll also embrace some seismic consumer behavior shifts that are taking place, especially in e-commerce. We believe the accelerating expansion of the channel is sustainable and we want to continue to be well positioned for long-term growth. We are investing in digital capabilities to strengthen consumer connections and further piloting several different digital-enabled initiatives using fulfillment methods, whether B2B to home or B2C platforms in many countries to capture online demand for at-home consumption in the future. We're seeing good results in these early days and are looking to scale similar partnerships with more customers. In times when a crisis hit it can be easy to lose sight of the long-term but we will continue to build a more sustainable business for the future. Late last year, we refreshed our purpose statement: to refresh the world and make a difference and our company's purpose is now more important than ever. Tomorrow the company will publish its 2019 Business and Sustainability Report, reflecting a continued journey towards driving a more sustainable business. While there are still many unknowns ahead, we do know that over 134 years of business we've seen many types of crises, be they military, economic or pandemic and the Coca-Cola Company has always emerged stronger in the end. We are in a better position today than we were heading into previous periods of challenge. We've made meaningful progress in accelerating our capabilities, reshaping our bottling system, pivoting our portfolio and transforming our culture. Undoubtedly, there will be ups and downs in the coming months. But with our bottling partners, we are clear on what needs to be done both now and into the future to manage our business, focus our strategies, accelerate our actions and redirect our investments. With that, I'll turn the call over to John. Let me offer a few thoughts and see whether that helps. Firstly, there's a set of in the famous expression known unknowns here that heavily influence the shape of how long this \u2013 the virus crisis will last and the resulting economic crisis and the degree of ups and downs and volatile on the way. And those known unknowns are all out there and we can't determine which way they're going to take us. And I think that's important because while there are some learnings from the earlier markets like China, South Korea or even some of the European markets, we're still at the beginning. We're still at the beginning. What do I mean by that? We can see the path of how China or South Korea or Singapore, some of those countries came into the crisis, how the lockdowns occurred by channel, by pack, by brand, the change in consumer behavior; and then being able to follow that journey as they have opened up and the thing has started to stabilize. And you can see China, we were doing great in January. We had a fantastic start to the year double-digit growth. It was a very profound lockdown in February, much deeper than the minus 25% we're currently seeing globally and we started to build back up volatile from week-to-week in March. And we're kind of getting close towards neutral in China now, still below where we were last year and where we were in January. But I think it's important to emphasize that doesn't mean it's over. We can see from Singapore or Tokyo Japan they have a kind of a second wave of the lockdown. So what we see is very clear experiences on what happens in the first phase of the lockdown pantry load channel changes et cetera, et cetera. And we've done a great job of moving those, link around the world. Now we expect to see the next phase of the crisis come which is post generalized global lockdowns. We're going to see a graduated set of re-openings around the world. How long they will take to get from where we are now to the new normal depends on these known unknowns, and could include further retreats to lockdowns as we've seen in a couple of countries. So we can't -- known unknown. What we can do is focus on what we're good at. We can focus on a few simple ideas. One the beverage industry is a great industry. As I said on the call, every previous crisis military economic or pandemic in that last 134 years, the Coke Company has come out stronger. We've done that by doing essentially two things at the same time. One, using the DNA of our system which knows how to manage in an economic crisis resulting from whatever, manage the business on a day-to-day, week-to-week, quarter-to-quarter basis, having the flexibility and adaptability to do the right amount of brand building innovation, revenue growth manage our next Houston market. But at the same time, have an eye on where is this going in the long-term such that, as we work our way through the winding path of what the crisis takes us, we end up emerging stronger. And so I would emphasize. And that's obviously why we haven't provided full year guidance. We are still at the beginning. We may be at the end of the big global lockdown, but we are still some way from the new normal. Yeah, great question. Look, you could clearly see a set of clear trends on the packaging. I mean in the lockdown, obviously the away-from-home channels are down heavily which means the immediate consumption packaging are down heavily. And we're much more focused on at-home which tends to be larger or multi packs. But it also sees a big step-up in e-commerce. We've seen a near doubling of our -- of the importance of the growth of e-commerce for us. So once we get past the lockdown I think, we'll see an environment through these graduated re-openings of society still with the spectre of the virus over us with a reality of an impacted economy. And I think what we'd like to see is a step change in some already ongoing trends like a step-up in e-commerce. It is both economically attractive and kind of spectre of the virus friendly, so I think we'll see a lot more e-commerce. I think it will take time for the highest aggregation channels to come back. But I think they will come back in the end. In the new normal there will be new consumer behavior at that point in time, because ultimately we are social animals. That aggregation will come back. But I think, we're also going to see a very profound theme of affordability. What we're seeing in the lockdown is not just the effect of the lockdown of certain channels. But I think that anticipation by the consumer of where the economy is going. There's going to be an economic impact. We're in the face of all this uncertainty. So we're going to see a lot more -- a lot more affordability where we've launched refillable PET back again in South Africa. We're investing in refillables in Latin America. We're really looking at how we can drive affordability for them. So a lot more e-commerce in the future, we're certainly going to see a profound theme of affordability coming up in the next years. We're going to see a lot of attempts by governments by us as well to support the smaller outlet base, as those will be the ones who've most suffered in the lockdown, whatever channel they're in. So we have been able to pivot and we expect to continue to pivot our brand marketing our innovation our revenue growth management and the execution by the bottlers through each stage of this crisis as it moves forward. In the end, the crisis management DNA is out there in the system. We may not have faced a global pandemic in living memory. But all around the world in the system we have lots of managers who've been in countries which have faced crisis. And as the spectre of the virus lifts what we'll be left with is an impacted economy -- some new consumer behaviors but an impacted economy. And this is when the Coke system can shine and always has shone in the past. Yes absolutely. And two things come together in the short term and they both work in the same direction which is the crisis management of keeping the supply chain open, while we have all these restrictions in the period of the lockdown and the virus crisis. And then I think you've got this likelihood of an impacted economy going forward for some period of time. In both those circumstances, both of those things lead you to a similar set of actions whether you're a manufacturer or an at-home retailer which is to focus on the biggest most important most well-known brands and affordability and making sure you can get availability in store. I mean one of the -- one of -- we've had a lot of focus on supporting the grocery customers. Because of course, we've got a strong bottling system that can deliver reliable supply onto the floor. So we've seen ourselves be able to gain share of inventory in the store because we've been able to sustain the supply chain. So really being able to be there for the customers and execute and deliver product on the floor. But both us and them will also be driving to a rationalization on focusing on what's the most effective set of brands and SKUs to push through which will mean a cutting of the longer tail in this coming period. Will more choice, more innovation come back when new normal and economy reestablishes itself? Yes, I'm sure it will. But in this period it's going to be a question of focus. Sure. I would love to be able to tell you there's an answer to that question, but there isn't. What we do know is, what is -- we can see the shape of the social distancing measures into the coming months and there are already governments that have distancing measures into Q3. We're very focused as ever on picking up on the re-openings. Those re-openings if we take Europe and the U.S. in May and June, there are people in government that are talking about three phases and they're talking about the reopening part of Phase 1, not yet 2 and 3 are happening in the same quarter. So I think we will see social distancing measures for some period of time into Q3. Hopefully they will not be as severe as the second quarter. Maybe they will last to the fourth maybe not. We just cannot know. What -- we have to focus on is, in a way to use your -- this alphabet soup of scenarios the U the V and L. We have to be ready in case, it's a V. If it does bounce back, we don't want to be so conservative we are not ready for a spring back of the economy and a spring back in demand and we want to be ahead of the curve. I don't think it's -- I have said before I don't think the V is the most likely scenario, but we will be ready if it occurs. The U, clearly you want to take the middle scenario we understand. And certainly, I think the U is more likely than the V and how that's going to go forward. And clearly we need to prepare to act on that one with a lot of the measures we took up. Is the L possible? Yes the L is possible too. Our approach is to make sure we are both flexible and ready and have the plans charged and ready to go when the spring back comes. We also need to manage the recessionary period and the lockdown periods and social distancing periods with specific and tailored plans to do the best we can in those things. And of course we need to be prepared and understand that if it is the L or anything along those lines, we need to have given ourselves some flexibility to respond to those scenarios as well. So the key that we are focused on is, how we anticipate the scenarios that could be ahead of us, across the whole range how do we give ourselves the flexibility to act on them and make sure we manage the business day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter to get the best possible result as we go along this winding path; because we cannot see over the horizon and yet retain a focus that by the end of this crisis the Coca-Cola Company will have emerged stronger and be better setup for the long term as it has always done in every previous crises for its 134 years. Sure. We're clearly very focused on adapting the supply chain. And if I break it down into a few pieces, there's of course sourcing the ingredients that we use in the concentrate in the bottling plant, our own concentrate manufacturing or fountain manufacturing the bottling plants and then on through the distribution. There's been a lot of challenges. But I would like to congratulate the supply chain teams at the company and at all of the bottling partners for the incredible work they've done at basically keeping everything running. I was certainly on record a few weeks ago saying, the supply chains around the world will be creaking. There's been a lot of pressure at the borders, whether it's the provincial \u2013 province-to-province borders in some countries or country-to-country borders in other parts of the world moving some of the ingredients that are basically shipped around the world. But once they're within the country, which is the larger of these, the great advantage of the Coke system is that the Cokes are made locally. All our drinks are basically made locally. The drinks in the U.S. are made in the U.S., the drinks in Germany are made in Germany, the drinks in Kenya are made in Kenya. And so the local supply chain is then able to work designated as part of the food system, so an essential service to allow to run the production systems and distribution. So, we've had relatively \u2013 we've had some issues on timing of ingredients. Those are much better than they were a few weeks ago. Production facilities are largely running. We made a lot of adaptations to ensure safety and sanitation and security for the employees and that's true over the concentrate plants and most of the bottling plants just a couple of places that we see some plant shutdown. And then distribution, we've largely kept up and running everywhere and doubled down on that. Yes. There are issues in the odd countries here and there on the \u2013 on availability of \u2013 in some of the logistics for drivers or having to swap drivers at borders. But generally speaking, it's been \u2013 we've been able to adapt and it's the great strength of having ultimately a local supply chain in each country. And yeah, there are some parts of the supply chain that are running 24/7 and there are some places \u2013 parts like the fountain supply that are much more low utilization. And we'll have to manage through that as we see how these graduated re-openings start to take place in the coming months and quarters. Bill, yes, we lost you. We can hear you now. Yes, yes. Yes. Certainly, the expectation when you look at the \u2013 to the extent that there are public reopening plans and talk about what the phases would look like, most sporting events sit in phase three, i.e., towards the back end. So, I think, that it's pretty clear that we're going to see a relatively limited, not say none, amount of large sporting events with audiences in the next couple of quarters, but it's not likely. Hopefully, it will come to pass, but I think it's going to be difficult. Now, how we adapt to that? And, obviously, the biggest one of that is the Olympics, which has now been pushed out to next year. Obviously, there's some degree of fixed investment in the asset in the sponsorship. And, obviously, we're talking to all our partners about how this disruption of the virus impact the assets and what we can do together. The majority of the spend is largely in the activation of the marketing programs with the asset and those tend to be variable cost media buys, one sort or another or a marketing activation, where we can actually repurpose that money to other things. So, as John talked about on the call, we have been very assertive in increasing the degree of flexibility and reprioritization of all the marketing and OpEx. But all the marketing spend in the downhill of the year to maximize flexibility, because we just know which channels or events are going to open up when and potentially change from one day to the next. And so, we're maximizing flexibility. The good news is most of the marketing spend, the large majority of the marketing spend is variable and we retain the opportunity to change our plans as we go through the year. Sure. We commented a little earlier that responding in a crisis has certainly been part of the DNA of the Coke system. From a cultural point of view, we have been clearly focused in the last few years on -- through some of the organizational changes, through some of the work on training skill building and developing the culture to increase the degree of agility, the nimbleness of the global organization. But also the degree of networking has become a much more networked organization which obviously the two things work together, which has been fantastic in a way because there's no better time to have got better at those two things than when you've got a global crisis. And the value of the learnings that can be moved around the world is certainly very high. So we've been focusing on a number of things the culture, but certainly ramping up the agility and the network, creating a networked organization has certainly helped us in this crisis. And then as we focused in on affordability, John mentioned it earlier, the revenue growth management approach has been part of -- our crisis manufacturing was born in a crisis or many crises and we have developed that capability around the world over the years -- actually over the last couple of years we had another big push to drive revenue management capability around the one. It wasn't just that we were looking for premium pricing and smaller packaging, yes we were looking for those things but they were an output of a capability we were building that is now going to be turned towards responding to the different environments that we'll see across the different countries as their macros perform. And so the system us and the bottlers, have upgraded our ability to really pivot towards affordability in whatever shape that means in the country you're in and using whichever brands is relevant in the phase we're talking about. So I think we are in the best shape we've been going into a global crisis than we have been for a long time. Sure. Taking it a bit in reverse order, yeah, if we -- if there's a big shift in the mix towards future consumption packages versus immediate consumption in any given country that will be a headwind to mix in the coming quarters. There maybe all sorts of other effects, as John mentioned some of our vertically integrated businesses have been impacted. We run the fountain business all coursed through our BIGs. So there'll be a lot of mix effects in the coming quarters, but that one will be a headwind as we think about the future quarters. In terms of the trajectory of at-home, one can't simply look at March versus April because each country is following its own path. What we see is as the virus has started to take off, you start to see footfall starting to decline in some of the away-from-home channels then the lockdown starts to get occur and you get big declines in footfall in the away-from-home channels and you get a spike in stock-up volumes in the at-home for a few weeks, and then you obviously are into the lockdown and then the numbers start to normalize and you start to see some stability in the future consumption. Now what's happening within the at-home channel is you have to I think layer on conceptually not just a closure of channels and consumers moving from A to B, but an anticipation or at least a consumer response to the uncertainty of where we're all going economically and therefore a shift in the prioritization of the categories that they buy even within the at-home channel. So, it's quite clear and it's a visible pattern not always the same categories but it's a very visible pattern around the world. You see what consumers deem as essential spikes up and stays up in the at-home channels. Some things like beverages sell more but not nearly enough to compensate for the losses in the away-from-home channels. And then some categories and the smaller SKUs get heavily deprioritized both by the customers and by the consumers. So, it's important to see those complete trends. It's certainly not the case that e-commerce is offsetting the losses from away-from-home relatively -- e-commerce even though it's doubled in sales for a beverage category it's still a very small percentage of the total beverage category. So, there's a lot of adaptation going on and you literally need to go place by place. Go on John. I mean we're going to have to manage the portfolio here. Certainly, we will have to look at each part of the world and adopt the strategy and the approach and the right balance of marketing innovation, RGM, and execution that's appropriate for the macro and the context of the consumer behaviors. We had a great program and a lot of momentum coming back in the North American business and also the European business. We'll have to manage each step as we take it. I mean certainly [Technical Difficulty] and so we will have lots of things ready to roll against the different scenarios we see coming out. So, we certainly would be looking to see North America or -- and Europe doing better as we come out of the new normal. Sure. Our starting point is the approach that we compete locally. The economics of the industry are more local than they are dollar. So we focus on staying close to consumers and the customers and competing locally to build the franchise is to gain market share and to sustain or improve profitability in a local sense. In the short-term, we do not -- that does not mean we use pricing to track and try and offset ForEx that will make us less competitive in the local context. Over the long run, clearly, as currencies devalue, they tend to import inflation and therefore the pricing over the medium-term tends to track to offset the FX. We've been hit harder this year than we expected from some of the emerging markets and we don't see ourselves pricing just to try and offset that. We will obviously be driving affordability to try and drive demand and sustain the business. And therefore, on the top line, we can try and make sure that we get the right level of profitability. Now over the last few years, we have tried to say look we do not aim for the Coca-Cola Company to just be the sum of all the local wins and occasional losses in the local marketplaces. We are pulling levers as a corporation to balance out the portfolio to achieve objectives of making sure the shareholders get returns in U.S. dollars. Clearly, this year is going to be a very atypical year. We're going to manage the year as we've described. But going into the future we will certainly be back to try and balance the three legs of the stool as we have tried in prior years. Sean, thanks for the question. I'm glad you raised it, because I should have highlighted in my remarks earlier with Lauren's question on commodities. The commodity outlook is favorable overall and so I expect that both the company with our finished goods businesses and indeed our bottling system can take advantage of some of those commodity pricing in the rest of the year and into 2021. On the CO2 front, yes, we're aware of the challenges, particularly in the U.S. due to the bioethanol raw gas feedstock sourcing depletion. But our team has got a number of contingency plans in place and we don't foresee an issue in the foreseeable future at this point. Thank you. Coca-Cola has a history of leadership of resilience and of doing the right thing, no matter whether the times are good or whether challenges exist. And this time will be no different. We've never been better positioned than we are today to manage through this situation and come out even stronger. So as always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in the company and for joining us today. Have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, James, and thanks to all of you for joining us. I'd like to complement James' remarks with a particular focus on the following areas: our people, 2020 profitability and cash flow, capital allocation priorities, our bottling system and our post-COVID readiness. It maybe a little unusual to start the finance review on people, but in these times it is absolutely the right place to start. The manner in which we have seen sacrifice, commitment, resilience and adaptability in the past weeks has stood out, and we have been able to accomplish things which in normal times would have seemed impossible. As with many companies, job security is a concern for our people. And for us, it has been a key priority as we navigate through this period. Where necessary we have furloughed some employees and we have done so on full pay through June. The length, severity and overall impact of the crisis will ultimately determine how we will come out of this and we will be very thoughtful on our approach. What we do see as James mentioned is a lot of redeployment enabling the company to pivot quickly with the work that matters most in these times. The agility we are seeing across the world in this regard has been impressive and is opening the door to new ways of working that are allowing us to be a lot more responsive. For me some of the work that matters most is smart use of the many levers we have at our disposal to maximize profit and cash flow. On the revenue side, we have made substantial changes to our brand pack portfolio focus and are leveraging the playbooks on affordability and value that have served us so well in past crisis around the world. On the expenditure side, I would divide it into four key focus areas and with a particular emphasis on quarter 2. One, as James mentioned, we have been pulling back on our marketing spend for now. Staying close to our consumers in a relevant way is a key guiding principle, and staying disciplined to demand an appropriate ROI is a close second. Two, we are taking a similar approach with our trade dollars. While much of that spend is managed by our bottlers in both our bottling investments and North America businesses this is an important area to effectively manage and be willing to reengineer. Three, we are attacking all discretionary operating expenses and challenging what is essential and making sure every dollar being spent on services, travel, meetings, et cetera is appropriate. And four, we have paused all capital spend other than what is absolutely essential or has already been committed. By moving quickly and decisively we will avoid waste, improve ROI and spend and give us maximum flexibility for the second half of the year as we gain clarity on the outlook. Finally as a quick reminder for your models, the reductions to marketing and trade spend will get phased over the balance of the year. Our capital allocation priorities should be framed against our liquidity position and our balance sheet. With the actions taken since March, our overall liquidity is strong and so to is our balance sheet. We will of course continue to focus on protecting the progress we made on working capital and free cash flow in 2019. And in this context, our capital allocation priorities remain very much focused on investing wisely to support our business operations and continuing to prioritize our dividend. Specifically with regard to the dividend, we currently have no intentions to change our approach. Regarding M&A, we do not foresee any significant activity going forward this year, nor do we intend to repurchase shares. We are also mindful of staying close to the debt range we have previously highlighted. We will of course review our overall approach to capital allocation as we know more about the length and severity of the crisis. James spoke earlier about how our global bottling system is adapting to the coronavirus pandemic. I cannot overstate the admiration we all have for everything our bottling partners are doing to stay close to their people, their customers and their communities. Many of them are battle heartened when it comes to managing crisis and I know they are proactively taking steps to preserve cash, strengthen their balance sheets and manage their P&Ls. Currently we do not have any major concerns surrounding our bottling partners from a liquidity perspective and we are working closely with them to anticipate and deal effectively with a scenario where the coronavirus situation is longer and more severe than currently anticipated. As we noted in our release, we are unable to provide an update to our full year 2020 financial outlook. We expect to have a better picture of how the recovery will unfold when we report our second quarter results in July. Meantime, I would like to highlight the following. In looking at currency impacts for comparable net revenues based on current spot rates and including the impact of hedge positions, we expect a mid-single-digit full year headwind. For comparable operating income also based on current spot rates, expect a high single-digit headwind with most of the headwind coming from our developing and emerging markets. We still expect the company's underlying effective tax rate to be 19.5% for the year. Looking ahead it's important that we adapt quickly to the current environment while also best positioning ourselves to win in the post-COVID world. Emerging stronger from this crisis, demands a willingness to challenge the status quo. To that end we are using this time to do just that. The last couple of months have already taught us how to do many things very differently. In closing, let me say, I have never been more proud to be part of the Coca-Cola system are indeed more optimistic. It's a testament to the culture of transformation taking hold across the organization. Our people and the strategic alignment of our system gives me the confidence in our ability to not only manage through the current crisis but to emerge from it stronger. With that operator we are ready for questions. Thanks, Kau. Let me frame the liquidity position that we have and indeed some of our bottlers first. We've \u2013 as I mentioned, we've taken quick actions in March to anticipate whatever outcome in the back half of the year good bad or indifferent. Keep in mind that, with our bottlers over 50% of our business globally is in the hands of our large public play on bottlers, all of whom came into 2020 with strong balance sheets. And I believe we're doing a very good job also to anticipate a number of different outcomes for the year. We are staying very close to all of our bottlers around the world, small, medium and large. And that will be on a case-by-case basis as to what eventually happens in the coming months, but we feel that we have \u2013 we have plenty of gunpowder available to manage whatever situation evolves in that period. So all in all, we're confident in the overall strength of the system to withstand the coming months. Yeah. So for the quarter gross margins were positively impacted with the mix of the inventory build and a relatively poor performance from our lower-margin segments. With respect to the outlook what I would focus on a couple of points that James also made is that the system is using a number of playbooks. If you think about where revenue growth management started in the world -- in our world, it was really born in Argentina and Latin America during the crisis of the early 2000s. And we're leveraging many of the lessons and indeed the capabilities to focus on our core sparkling brands, which, as you know, have a more favorable margin, to be very clear on the price pack architectures to be able to get full benefit from both an affordability play, but as well as to be able to segment in our channels and markets with the appropriate packs for value. And also during this period, it's been an opportunity to trim back significantly the long tail, which as we've highlighted in previous calls that tail is typically comprised of some of the more \u2013 the younger explorer and challenger brands, which by nature are lower margins. So I think a combination of the playbooks that we know work, a focus on the bigger brands and the key packages that typically are higher margin and being in the position to prioritize our leader brands and packages gives us comfort that the -- on the gross margin front that we can continue to build on the momentum that we've had for the last couple of years. And James, if I just could add on the cost management side to sort of amplify the point on networking and agility. I think as we go into the rest of the year we've had the opportunity over the last four to six weeks to work very closely with all markets to be clear on what's fixed, what's variable, what's committed, what's non-committed, and then what are the key decision points that we will have over the coming weeks to be able to pivot us an appropriately into the second half of the year and it will be very market centric. In some markets we will want to accelerate investments and in some markets pull back. But the network that's in place the digital infrastructure we have to allow us to connect is -- certainly are elements that are serving us very well at the moment. Sure. Yes. Okay. Go ahead James. Yes, so the approach as we talked for the rest of the year has been to really stay close to the consumer in a relevant way. And in the second quarter that actually means in many markets coming off air. We have had a number of communications announcing that we will take a pause for now while we focus our efforts on our communities and on other priorities and that we'll be back later in the year. But back later in the year looks like it's going to be very much dependent on the shape of the recovery. And so for the quarter the upcoming quarter, we're creating as much optionality as we can so that markets can do the right thing in the second half of the year. Tim and the team can take you through some of the implications on the -- that I alluded to in my remarks on the phasing for the rest of the year."

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola\u2019s Media Relations department, if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President of IR and FP&A. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.\nTim Leveridge: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019m here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our Chief Financial Officer. Note that we posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website at www.coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning\u2019s discussion to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins. In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the Company\u2019s periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks this morning, we\u2019ll turn the call over for questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing one first and then reenter the queue. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I\u2019d like to reflect on the past year and how we\u2019ve emerged stronger from the pandemic, including positive performance in the fourth quarter. I\u2019ll also highlight the broader macro environment and how we\u2019re executing in the marketplace. Finally, I\u2019ll touch briefly on the accelerators for growth that give us confidence we can achieve the 2022 guidance we\u2019ve provided today, with more on them to come at CAGNY next, this month. John will then discuss financial results for the quarter and our outlook in more detail. Before I get to it, I\u2019d like to acknowledge that our ability to emerge stronger would not have been possible without the efforts of our dedicated employees and system partners around the world, and I\u2019d like to thank them for their hard work, their contribution not only to our results, but to our curious, empowered, inclusive and agile culture. In 2021, the operating environment remained dynamic as the pandemic continued to evolve, and factors like inflation and supply chain disruptions brought additional challenges. But over the year, our organization and system continued to manage through these circumstances with focus and flexibility. We are pleased with the results, which were above 2019 across key metrics, and we remain focused on building a stronger total beverage company. Now, looking more closely at our fourth quarter results. We saw another quarter of sequential improvement versus 2019, and we ended the year with volume ahead of 2019. Notably, it was the first quarter in which away-from-home volume was also ahead of 2019, while at-home channels remained strong. So, recapping the quarter four performance around the world, starting with Asia Pacific. China delivered strong performance in the quarter by capturing a growing trend among consumers of zero-calorie offerings, we doubled our Zero Sugar sparkling portfolio in terms of volume compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. We leveraged RGM strategies and targeting investments to gain share in e-commerce, thus driving growth for the overall business. In India, initiatives to build omnichannel presence and marketing campaigns around key occasions by leveraging festivals and passion points through occasion-led marketing and integrated execution drove a sequential increase in market share and nearly 30% growth in transactions for the quarter. Additionally, our local Thums Up brand became $1 billion brand in India, driven by focused marketing and execution plans. In Japan, while our system was faced with a very challenging year, we gained value share and consumers driven by successful innovation and commercial strategies. In ASEAN and South Pacific, there were strict restrictions and limited reopenings in many markets for a large part of the year. In Q4, acceleration of vaccine efforts and strong results from the Fanta Colorful People and Sprite Make it Clear campaigns helped drive our recovery. In EMEA, volume in Europe in the quarter surpassed 2019 despite mobility restrictions, particularly in Western Europe. Despite the recovery remaining asynchronous in the region, increased investments behind our brands in the marketplace resulted in our system driving the highest incremental retail value among FMCG players in the region. In Africa, volume continued to be ahead of 2019 in the fourth quarter, driven by our key markets with strong double-digit growth in Nigeria and Egypt. Additionally, increased investments behind our affordability and multi-serve packages drove value share for the full year above 2019 in the region. In Eurasia and Middle East, the top line continued to expand faster than the macro environment, driven by strong revenue growth management, execution and digital capabilities. Turkey, one of our key markets, grew 7 points of value share for the year in digital as total digital commerce expanded by close to 90%. In North America, despite COVID cases leading to business closings and some mobility restrictions, value share growth was strong in the quarter, driven by pricing, revenue growth management and strong execution in the market. The new Coca-Cola Zero Sugar continued to deliver strong results, outpacing category growth, while Sprite and smartwater grew drinker base and buy rates. Innovations also delivered strong performances, led by Coke with Coffee and Simply Almond. Latin America delivered another quarter of strong performance with mid-single-digit volume growth versus 2019. This resilience of the system has been driven by years of experience navigating volatile environments through strong and effective execution. Within Global Ventures, Costa continued to recover through the year but was impacted in Q4 due to COVID-related restrictions. Costa Express continued its strong performance in the UK, delivering results ahead of expectations. In China, the Costa ready-to-drink expansion continued its availability now in more than 300,000 outlets, continuing to drive a share position ahead of our key competitor. Finally, our Bottling Investments Group continued to focus on productivity and transformation initiatives, delivering strong operating margin expansion for full year 2021. Due to improved mobility throughout the year, our industry is growing in both, volume and value. Gaining share was a key objective in our emerging stronger agenda. And this year, we gained value share in both, at-home and away-from-home channels. Our NARTD market share is above 2019 levels at a global level and in both at-home and away-from-home channels. We will continue to identify and address opportunities to further improve our value share, driven by data-backed insights. As we close the chapter on 2021, we emerged stronger by delivering both top line and EPS ahead of 2019, and we gained share in a growing industry. The actions we took during the pandemic have resulted in an agile and focused organization that is poised to capture the sizable opportunities that exist, and we continue to look to the future to build on our momentum and drive growth. As we turn to 2022, while it is impossible for us to know whether this variant will be the last, what is clear is that our consumers, our customers and our business are learning and adapting with great resilience. For example, while we have seen some impacts from the Omicron variant through the first few weeks of the year, we are not seeing the same level of disruption as previous waves, and our system is better equipped. Further recovery in 2022 will be determined by macro factors, including overall consumer sentiment as well as supply chain challenges; labor shortages; and of course, the inflationary pressures in interest rates. We are confident we are well equipped to navigate this environment and deliver on the guidance we provided today. Now, I\u2019ll touch on some of the capabilities we\u2019ve built to unlock the next stage of growth and will elaborate more at our virtual CAGNY presentation later this month. We\u2019re excited about where we are today and the substantial initiatives we have in place for 2022. The consumer continues to be at the center of our strategy. And through our total beverage company agenda, we are adapting to the macro and micro trends, which are shaping consumer habits. We advanced our total beverage company agenda last year by streamlining our portfolio, focusing on the core and investing behind a portfolio of brands that allows us to meet the evolving needs of consumers. We completed much of this work on brand eliminations while being deliberate with brand transitions. This optimized portfolio will ensure we follow the consumer and win in emerging and fast-growing categories, and is complemented by the recent strategic acquisition of BODYARMOR as well as relationships like the new agreement with Constellation Brands, which will launch Fresca Mixed, and the extended relationship with Molson Coors, which will launch Simply Spiked Lemonade in the U.S. Our network marketing model, with global category teams and local operating units, is allowing us to focus on end-to-end consumer experiences that are data-driven and always on. Our announcement of WPP as our global marketing network partner is a foundational component of our new marketing model. This new agency approach gives us access to the best created lines, regardless of source, and is underpinned by leading-edge data and technology capabilities. The Real Magic campaign is the first campaign, which was cocreated internally, leveraging this new end-to-end approach, and the campaign is showing strong results with the consumers. We have good visibility into the benefits of the new marketing model. The approach will allow us to deliver best-in-class consumer-centric marketing experiences across our categories and around the world. We also built more discipline into our innovation process in 2021 with a key focus on scalable bets that can build momentum year-over-year. It\u2019s still early, but the approach is working. Revenue per launch and gross profit per launch were up 30% and 25%, respectively, versus prior year. And we took intelligent local experiments and move more rapidly to scale them across geographies. Sustainable packaging like refillables and labelless bottles, along with brands like Coke with Coffee, fairlife, AHA, Costa ready-to-drink and Lemon-Dou are all examples of local winners that have been extended to more markets. For 2022, our innovation process is increasingly supported by data, and our pipeline is robust with built-in agility and consists of big bets along with many shots on goal. The system has stepped up its RGM and execution capabilities, which is helping us navigate an inflationary environment, driving value growth in a segmented way. Due to the strength of our bottling partners and the stronger net alignment of the system, we are prepared to address opportunities as well as challenges may lie ahead. Our networked organizational structure is designed to better connect functions and operating units to help our system scale ideas faster. As we\u2019ve emerged stronger, we kept moving forward on integrating sustainability work into our business as it is a key driver of future growth. During the quarter, we were recognized for our commitment to transparency, an action to address environmental risks by earning an A score in CDP\u2019s assessment for water, an improvement over last year. We improved or maintained our score in CDP\u2019s assessments on other important areas like climate and forests. Additionally, to complement our World Without Waste goals, we announced a new global goal to reach 25% reusable packaging by 2030. Increasing refillable and reusable packaging options responds to consumer affordability and our sustainability aspirations, and it helps create a circular economy, and refillable packages have extremely high levels of collection and our low-carbon footprint beverage containers. Before I turn over to John, I want to say a big thank you and recognize our associates from both the Company and our bottling partners, who work with great dedication and unwavering commitment throughout another challenging year. We expect the recovery will remain asynchronous, but we are encouraged by our growing industry, our own parallel system strength, and a strategic transformation that enables us to be agile and to adapt. Our actions drove strong results in 2021. And we have confidence in our ability to deliver another year of strong performance in 2022 and over the long term. Now, John will provide more details on our results and our 2020 guidance.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we closed the year with strong results, despite the impact of the Omicron variant across many parts of the world. Our Q4 organic revenue growth was 9%. Our price/mix of 10% was driven by a combination of factors, including targeted pricing, revenue growth management initiatives as well as further improvement in away-from-home channels in many markets. Unit case growth showed further sequential improvement on a two-year basis and concentrate sales like unit cases by 10 points in the quarter, primarily due to six fewer days in the quarter. Despite commodity market inflation and the dynamic supply chain environment, comparable gross margin for the quarter was relatively flat versus prior year. Pricing initiatives and favorable channel and package mix were offset by the impact of consolidating the fast-growing finished goods, BODYARMOR business, along with incremental investments to sustain momentum in the overall business for 2022. We continued to invest in markets as they recovered and stepped up year-over-year marketing dollars again in Q4, spending in a targeted way to maximize returns. This increase in marketing investments, along with some top line pressure from six fewer days in the quarter, resulted in comparable operating margin compression of approximately 500 basis points for the quarter. For the full year, comparable operating margin was down approximately 100 basis points versus prior year as improved comparable gross margin was offset by the significant step-up in marketing. Importantly, versus 2019, a key measure we have focused on, comparable operating margin was up approximately 100 basis points. Putting it all together, fourth quarter comparable earnings per share of $0.45 was a decline of 5% year-over-year, resulting in full year comparable earnings per share of $2.32, an increase of 19% versus the prior year, as a strong resurgence in the business also benefited from a 3-point tailwind from currency and tax. We delivered strong free cash flow of $11.3 billion in 2021, with free cash flow conversion of approximately 115% and a dividend payout ratio well below our long-term target of 75%. With these results, we exceeded guidance on every metric for full year 2021. We have done tremendous work to emerge ahead of 2019 and set the stage to drive our growth agenda for years to come. We are spinning the strategy flywheels faster and more effectively. Our organization is focused on execution and enhancing our capabilities to fuel growth. As James mentioned, the pandemic will be one of the many factors, along with the dynamic macro backdrop that we face in the coming year. But our local businesses are ready to adapt and execute for growth. With that in mind, this morning, we provided guidance for 2022 that builds on momentum from 2021. We expect organic revenue growth of approximately 7% to 8%, and we expect comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 8% to 10% versus 2021. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate 3-point currency headwind to comparable revenue and an approximate 3 to 4 points currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. Additionally, due to a certain change in recent regulations, we estimate an effective tax rate increase from 18.6% in 2021 to 20% for 2022, which is an estimated 2 percentage points headwind to EPS. Therefore, all-in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus 2021, including the combined 5- to 6-point headwind from currency and tax. We expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow of 2022 through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. This implies the fourth consecutive year of free cash flow conversion above our long-term range of 90% to 95%. We continue to raise the performance bar across the organization and are confident in delivering on this 2022 guidance. In summary, we expect to deliver another year of strong topline-driven growth, along with maximized returns, driven by the strategic changes we have made in our business. There are several considerations to keep in mind for 2022. Overall, inflationary and supply chain pressures continue to impact costs across several fronts in the business, including input costs, transportation, marketing and operating expenses. With regards to commodity costs, after benefiting from our hedging strategy in 2021, we remain well hedged in 2022, but at higher levels. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect commodity price inflation to have a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2022. However, we are taking actions in the marketplace using multiple levers, including RGM in its many forms, along with our productivity initiatives, to help offset much of the impact. As a reminder, for your modeling, the consolidation of the recently acquired fast-growing BODYARMOR finished goods business will have a mechanical effect on margins. When it comes to capital allocation, our balance sheet remains strong, and our improving cash flow position is allowing us to be even more vigorous in pursuit of priorities that balance financial flexibility with efficient capital structure, first and foremost, to invest in our business; secondly, continuing our track record to grow our dividend; thirdly, to seek opportune M&A and to repurchase shares with excess cash. And finally, due to the calendar shift, there will be one less day in the first quarter and one additional day in the fourth quarter. Despite another year of uncertainty, in 2021, we came together as a system to emerge stronger and position ourselves to drive sustainable growth. We are encouraged by the momentum in our business and are clear on the direction we\u2019re headed. As we look to 2022, we feel confident in our ability to deliver on the commitments we outlined today.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey. God morning. So, I wanted to focus on the 7% to 8% organic sales growth guidance for 2022, obviously, a robust level. Can you give us a bit more detail around the key drivers there? And I\u2019m wondering specifically how much of a tailwind is less COVID impact for 2022 that occurred in 2021 or above-trend pricing, given the cost situation and limited demand elasticity relative to a typical year? And the point behind the question is sort of why are you above the 4% to 6% long-term algorithm? Is it more sustainable factors that can sustain as we look beyond 2022? Is it more -- factors more specific for 2022? It would be helpful to have a bit more detail there. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Good morning, Dara. Firstly, we\u2019re coming out of 2021 with good strong momentum. We\u2019ve seen an improvement on the growth rate relative to 2019, both in the at-home channels and the away-from-home channels. So, we\u2019re coming into the year with good momentum, notwithstanding some ups and downs due to Omicron in certain parts of the world in December and January. And I\u2019m going to answer the second part first. The above algorithm growth in 2022 is more primarily due to the factors of COVID and inflation, but I\u2019ll come back to that. And so, as you look out into the long-term, it is much more likely we will move back into the long-term algorithm. Just to refresh, we\u2019re in a robust industry that has been growing historically. It\u2019s coming back to growth. And if that\u2019s an industry that\u2019s growing at 4% or 5%, and we have a long-term track record of gaining share in the industry, you can see why we focus attention on being in the top half of the revenue growth rate in the algorithm we put out that allows us to then drive the business into the future. So, we still think that is a sound long-term perspective in terms of both the industry growth rate and our ability, not just to be the leader but to be the winner in terms of share and to drive in the top half of the algorithm. Coming back to the near-term and 2022, in particular, a couple of things that support an above algorithm number. Firstly, there are a number of countries that are not yet back at their 2019 levels of revenue or indeed, even volume. And whilst we are not expecting everything to be rosy in 2022, we do expect to see ongoing improvements around the world in terms of reopening, in terms of reactivation. And so, we think there are additional tailwinds in 2022 from a reopening perspective that will support the volume side. And then, in terms of pricing, clearly, it\u2019s a slightly more inflationary environment than normal. And we, as we have talked on previous calls with our bottling partners, very much look to price in the marketplace. We do have a view that we have to have brands that earn the right to take pricing. And secondly, we very much are not looking to just pass through in price but to do it intelligently because, whilst it\u2019s easy to respond to inflation by putting up the prices, there is clearly, as there is broad-based inflation, going to be a squeeze on real incomes in a number of countries. And so, we -- with very long experience in the system of managing inflationary moments when you get a squeeze on real incomes, we very much want to, yes, the company opportunities on premiumization, leverage our strong marketing, leverage our strong innovation. But we do not want to lose consumers out of the industry, so we also will have a foot in affordability. And this is a scenario where we have a lot of experience. The system has a lot of experience, and we intend to push it forward. The net of all that is likely to mean that we see a balance between volume and price/mix within the overall revenue guidance that we\u2019ve given you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. The first thing is not a question. It\u2019s just I\u2019m going to mention the free cash conversion and leave it at that and say, my goodness, how much things have changed. My question though was that I wanted to talk a little bit about North America supply chain. My understanding is there\u2019s -- that\u2019s still been pretty challenged. And I just was looking for any kind of update you could offer on fourth quarter and outlook into next year. Because clearly, the market share performance, everything is great, but that\u2019s still with the supply chain constraints. And I was wondering how that\u2019s shaping up. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. So, I think the system in the U.S. has done an exceptional job in trying to manage through all the different needles that needed to be threaded in terms of the supply chain to provide the brands for our consumers and our customers and have availability of the product. Was it perfect last year? No. Is it likely to be perfect this year? No. But, we are doing the maximum we can to optimize our full availability. And there are issues across a number of dimensions. I would say two things on the line - underlie this, and we can take some examples. There is two effects going on. One, which I\u2019ve talked about on previous calls, which is the kind of the temporal supply shock. When you have a crisis, things whip around. You suddenly sell less fountain and want to sell more cans, and the system is not set up for that. And so, you get these kind of big swings, a bit like the famous case study of the video game business school. And there you get the shock waves of like in earthquake that continue to ripple through the system. And so, we saw that last year, and we will see some of that again in 2022. But they\u2019re temporal. But also there, I believe, were a set of underlying structural squeezes going on in the supply chain that perhaps had not been fully addressed by ourselves or by the industries involved, pre-COVID. And the advent of COVID just doubled down the pressure on them. So, examples of that would be trucking and freight in the U.S. There\u2019s been a long-term squeeze on the availability of trucking, whether it be the hours, regulations, the aging out of the drivers. You had COVID where people didn\u2019t take the test. And so, some of these structural problems are coming home to roost. Everyone, including ourselves, are very involved in fixing them. Similarly, for example, on cans, can capacity, manufacturing accounts have been flat for a decade, but really can use and attraction that have been creeping up. And that just got squeezed as the away-from-home closed and the at-home spiked up in COVID. People are building new canning plants. New capacity is coming online. So, I think what you\u2019re going to see play out through 2022 is the reduction in the kind of temporal amplitudes from the swings from COVID and the steady fixing of some of these structural issues that will still take some time through 2022. Obviously, we are going to do the maximum possible to leverage our portfolio of brands, our portfolio of packaging options to maximize our ability to put the drinks into the hands where the people want them and the customers want to sell them.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Filippo Falorni on for Nick. So first, on your outlook, can you discuss what level of global consumer mobility are you assuming relative to 2019 levels? And whether the lower impact that you saw from Omicron compared to prior waves gives you more confidence that your trends are decoupling from COVID cases and the away-from-home business? And if you can comment on the benefit from your recent reorganization in terms of better market share and better topline growth performance. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Well, clearly, we\u2019ve been gaining market share. And my favorite metric is market share versus 2019, both in the away-from-home and at-home channels we\u2019ve gained overall. We\u2019ve gained in the away-from-home and we\u2019ve gained in the at-home. And we are -- in terms of consumer business, we are assuming a greater degree of reopening. We can certainly begin to see that in Europe as the Omicron variant has moved through. The U.S., just this week, mask mandates are coming down. So, there is going to be an improvement in mobility across the world. It\u2019s not going to be back to 2019 fully in 2022. And I think that\u2019s going to be true, both in terms of domestic mobility and international mobility, I don\u2019t know if you meant per country or people moving around the world. But anyway, the answer is basically the same, which is we are assuming an improvement in mobility, but we\u2019re not assuming a return yet to the full 2019 levels.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: John, I had a question just about the guidance. And if we look at the currency neutral spread between earnings growth and organic sales growth, can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of where the leverage in the income statement will be? Because the tax rates moving up, interest expense, net interest expense, I guess, will be higher because of the BODYARMOR deal. So, it didn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s a lot of leverage below the operating income line. So, I was just trying to get a better understanding of just where the leverage is in the net -- on the P&L.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Bryan. Yes, on the -- as you walk down through the P&L, currency neutral, I think on the first point is top line is very robust. We have done a really nice job, I think, going into \u201822 on optimizing to our RGM efforts and the innovation pipeline that we have at play. And then, secondly, coming out of the reorg work that we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years, we are doing I think a much tighter job on overall resource allocation, finding a good balance between investing as we need to for -- to support the top line, but also taking into account the opportunities that we have driven in the efficiency work that we have done. So, I feel confident that we have some flex from the gross margin line down in the currency neutral basis. And below the operating line are actually our net interest expense, given the tremendous work we\u2019ve done to completely restructure our debt portfolio, is actually a net benefit for us in 2022.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: A couple of things on just kind of understanding the balance between the pricing needs of your own and the commodity inflation you\u2019re seeing versus the kind of pricing needs of your bottlers? I certainly understand that you work as a system, but you\u2019re obviously different businesses and different regions and such. So, how do you work that balance between the two?\nJames Quincey: Let me separate the businesses into the vast majority of the business, which goes through the bottling system, and then some businesses that go in parallel. When we\u2019re talking about pricing needs of the concentrate business a bit that goes through the bottler, in the almost all cases, we have a system whereby we operate what\u2019s called incidence pricing. So, we have agreements with the bottlers where our revenue will be a percent of the revenues that they achieve in the marketplace. So therefore, we are both incentivized to work diligently to increase the total size of the pie in a much more aligned way in terms of both trying to drive the same outcome. So, in that sense, the bottlers -- we work together and the bottlers take the pricing in the marketplace, whether it\u2019s rate pricing or working on the mix between the brands and the packages and the channels, and then we take a percentage of that. And of course, we\u2019re both looking at the various input cost challenges that we have, and we work through and come up with a pricing plan, and the bottlers take that to the marketplace and get it done. We do have a few businesses where we sell the finished goods, whether that be some of the, for example, the chilled juice businesses here in the U.S. or in Europe or the Costa business or the BIG business. Clearly, there, we\u2019re operating the vertically integrated businesses, and we\u2019re doing very much what we do with the bottlers we do our own for those businesses, and we work it all through. So, I think you can take it as we work very much in alignment working back from the consumer, trying to drive value for the customers. And we manage the portfolio of all the different input costs, including our needs to kind of invest in marketing, invest in innovation and invest in execution capacity as the bottlers would do.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JP Morgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: My question is on the pricing that you embed in your guide. And is it pricing actions yet to be implemented or already in the market? And can you elaborate a bit more on -- James, on your commentary about balancing volumes and pricing in 2022, which implies you probably expect an additional low-single-digit volume growth in 2022. And is that predicated mostly on the on-premise recovering as you pointed out, and an improvement in supply of cans and how we should parse it out? Thank you very much. \nJames Quincey: Sure. So, yes, clearly by saying we\u2019re expecting a balance between volume and price in our overall revenue guidance, there is an implicit volume growth that is broad based geographically, obviously more tends to be faster -- rather tends to be in the emerging markets and slower in the developed markets. Yes, it predicated on improvements in away-from-home, particularly in those countries, which are not yet back to 2019 levels. We have -- whilst we have emerged stronger and our total business is bigger than it was in 2019, whether that be volume, revenue or profits, that is not true in every country. And so, -- and actually, in total, away-from-home is not back to where it was in 2019. So, there\u2019s clearly more or less to come back, which is why effectively implicitly, there\u2019s a little more volume into 2022 guidance than in the normal long-term algorithm. And similarly, with price/mix, as I commented earlier, it\u2019s going to be implicitly a little more than usual. And I think you\u2019ll have to kind of look at -- I would encourage everyone to look at some of the two-year stack rates in terms of volume and price to look at how it\u2019s been moving by group and by business segment, as you think about your modeling going into 2022.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: Just following up on that line of -- that line around channel mix is going into next year and how that factors into volume. Certainly, channel mix should be a pretty good story for gross margins going into next year. Would you expect sequential improvement from the Q4 level with the away-from-home being ahead of 2019 levels for the first time? Would you expect, barring geopolitical risk or otherwise, that, that sequential improvement should continue? And can you just frame how we should be thinking about how that might benefit your gross margin rate for the year? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Chris. And just to confirm, you\u2019re talking about sequential improvement in gross margins?\nChris Carey: Sequential improvement in the away-from-home business from the Q4.\nJames Quincey: Right.\nChris Carey: And how that can impact and benefit your gross margins as you get through the year?\nJames Quincey: Yes. Okay. Clearly, as we talked about on the last question, we are expecting some extra improvement in the away-from-home going into 2022. As I said, it\u2019s not yet back to the 2019 levels, and that is a plus from a gross margin point of view. I would not want to characterize that as the biggest thing happening next year. There\u2019s a lot more moving pieces going on. So, I think it is a factor. It\u2019s probably more important, the overall growth of the business and the reopenings in the different geographies. But I think that\u2019s the key. I think, John, do you want to add anything?\nJohn Murphy: Yes. No, I think it\u2019s a good juncture maybe to just say a little bit about gross margins, because I know there will be questions on what we expect. And I think I\u2019d like to just emphasize there\u2019s really several factors that are playing into the 2022 picture. We do have the mechanical effect of the BODYARMOR acquisition that, I think, is important to take into account we had a slight currency tailwind in \u201821, and that\u2019s going to be kind of negated with a similar expected headwind in 2022. I think it\u2019s important to keep in mind what we discussed on the impact of the commodity pressures. There will be, I think offsetting against that, the benefit of some of the pricing power and brand leadership that we have that James has mentioned. And that will, I think, also be complemented by an improving channel mix outlook. But I think it\u2019s important to take into account all of the factors and hence, -- that feeds into the guidance that we provided this morning.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Carlos Laboy from HSBC.\nCarlos Laboy: First of all, congratulations on this 25% refillable goal, because it redirects the industry, this course, completely for investors on PET waste solutions. My question is about marketing and innovation. What might worry you about readiness for normality and about these new marketing and innovation processes for creating new demand and new brand equity for pricing power?\nJames Quincey: Well, thank you for calling out the reusable goal, Carlos. Clearly, achieving it will mean using much less of virgin PET and make it easier to achieve our objectives of a World Without Waste, where we intend to collect back a bottle or can for every one we sell by 2030. In terms of the marketing and the innovation question, I\u2019m not quite sure I completely captured what you\u2019re going for. But let me throw out some thoughts, and I think that will help. The consumer elasticity and pricing power, yes, I think a lot of people have noted, it\u2019s been relatively inelastic in recent times. It\u2019s certainly our historical experience that when multiple categories go off at the same time, there is less elasticity. But it is also our experience that often that it\u2019s in an environment of a crisis where there\u2019s a support of a lot of injection of money into the economy, which I think is what has been happening over the last couple of years. Eventually, it moves to another phase where there\u2019s inflation and a squeeze on the income. And so, we are very attuned to the need to be -- burn our pricing as we go forward. And earnings, whether it\u2019s with the marketing that really engages with the consumers, whether it\u2019s with the innovation that, again, engages with the consumers and gives our customers the opportunity to do different things and more interesting things in the stores or whether we earn it through the excellence in execution and the in-store presence that our bottling partners are so good at. Because the next phase is much harder than the previous phase. It\u2019s easier to do pricing in a stimulus environment where everyone else is going up. It\u2019s much harder when there\u2019s a real squeeze on income. So we\u2019re very focused on winning in the next phase. It\u2019s something that we and our bottling partners have a lot of experience with, and it will certainly be an opportunity and a necessity to deploy the whole toolkit from marketing innovation through execution to continue winning as we go forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: I guess, it kind of builds on that theme. I\u2019m thinking about it in the context of the \u201822 outlook. And I missed all the cost pressures that we\u2019ve spoken about and your plans to drive forward operating leverage and continued progress on operating profit. I guess, can you just talk a little bit more about the invented flexibility you have and your plans around strategic investments in \u201822 specifically? Where those are targeted? What level of strategic investment, whether it\u2019s A&P or capabilities building? Just to give us a little bit more context about your ability to support the volume momentum, justify pricing, not only in \u201822, but to set yourself up for \u201823 and beyond. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. I mean, we have a kind of approach where we\u2019ve come. We switched during the crisis and leaning into growth or a bias to invest. As you can see through the course of the crisis and into 2021, we steadily increased our level of investment on marketing, restarted the engines on innovation. And similarly, the bottlers will do so on execution and actually investments in supply chain. So that\u2019s our bias going into the year. We\u2019re going to invest for growth. We\u2019ve got a lot of ability drive not just the market innovation, but also underline the advances in the digitization of the business, whether it\u2019s the connection with the consumer, whether it\u2019s the connection with the retailers and what the bottlers are doing to digitize that part of the business. So, we are leaning into growth. But what we have achieved over the last few years is to increase our degree of flexibility or adaptability. Better said, it\u2019s not that everyone is sitting out there with talks of flexibility, it\u2019s more that we can adapt as circumstances change. We doubled down on our ability to make quicker, clearer decisions coming in to the crisis. And with the reorganization that we did recently -- have a more networked organization, we feel good about our ability to prioritize and redirect resources as and when needed during the year, whether that\u2019s to move from one part of the world to the other or one brand to another, or even to pull back where the growth is not there. So, we feel we\u2019ve got the levers, the hand, and we feel we\u2019ve become more agile in using them.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities.\nBill Chappell: I just wanted -- a quick question on Costa -- or not quick, but a question on Costa and kind of how you\u2019re viewing it going forward. I guess, two, three years ago, when it was purchased, there was kind of a thought there was going to be a big splash or a bigger splash into coffee for the system. And obviously, the pandemic showed up. But at the same point, you\u2019ve kind of moved more aggressively into alcohol and to BODYARMOR and to other things. And so, I didn\u2019t know if the thought process has changed or evolved in terms of wanting to move forward and expand that kind of worldwide, or if it\u2019s another kind of arrow in the quiver, which was always part of the plan. Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Sure. I think the short answer first, it was always intended to be one of the arrows in the quiver. The longer version of that answer is clearly COVID impacted, not just our total business, but it impacted the cost of business, which is an almost entirely away-from-home business. And so, it was very much a bit like our fountain business in the U.S. It was very much in the crosshairs of the COVID impact, particularly in 2020 at the beginning when the lockdowns were very severe. And in fact, most of those coffee shops are all closed in 2020. So, it was very hard on the Costa business. The 2021 made a lot of progress, reopenings, not back to where we were yet, so the coffee stores are bouncing back, but not back to where they were yet. The vision we have for coffee included a number of other components. One was the Express machines, the digital kind of barista. Obviously, 2020 was hard to install new machines, but the performance of the existing machines was extraordinary and very positive, and that last year, we began to install thousands of new machines. And then, we\u2019ve launched, partnered with our bottlers to have Proud to Serve, where they provide the beans and machines to the HORECA channel. And we\u2019ve launched a ready-to-drink, where it\u2019s done really well in certain parts of the world. So, the vision is still there. We see it as one of the arrows in the quiver. Clearly, we\u2019ve lost a couple of years. I mean, there\u2019s no beating around the bush, and we\u2019re going to have to bounce back from it. But the learnings we had and the experience was where we were able to do things give us some confidence and belief that we need -- that we have an opportunity to execute against the vision, which, of course, we still need to do.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Question for John on share repurchases. And I\u2019d also like to tie it into the bottling divestitures and potential proceeds there because the topic is related. So again, to echo sentiment earlier, great job on improving free cash flow conversion. That\u2019s outstanding. As you sit here now at $10 billion in share buybacks, in addition to the fact that you have the CCBA offering coming up later this year, you\u2019ve been very clear about your intent to divest the remaining bottling assets. So, kind of tying this together, number one, what are thoughts? What\u2019s embedded on repurchases? When can you get back to that? The Company has been fairly inactive for reasons that we understand. And then, relatedly, with the proceeds from CCBA and what potentially may come in the near to intermediate term around further bottling divestitures, does it seem likely that you would put that -- put those proceeds towards buybacks? So, thanks for your comments there.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Kevin. Yes, there was a -- the reason we used the word sort of a more vigorous pursuit in the script because as you said, the -- our situation today is very different to where it was and not that long ago with our free cash conversion gone from 70% to over 100%. Our net debt leverage has gone from outside of our range to at the low end of it. Dividend conversion is now at 70%, more or less. And as I mentioned on the call, the restructuring of the debt portfolio has been a very robust piece of work. So, as we look through the future, I think at your question, we need to touch it in the context of the broader capital allocation agenda. We continue to prioritize growth of the business. We touched upon some of that in the earlier questions, both in terms of the capital that we need to drive some of the businesses that we\u2019re in and the marketing that we need to support the brands. Secondly, we don\u2019t waver from our ongoing support and objective to continue to grow the dividend. And then, we\u2019re left with the two more dynamic areas, the M&A agenda and share repo. So, on both of those, we -- I think M&A will be opportunistic. There\u2019s not a lot of obvious candidates out there, but we will continue to be very open to that whole area. And not on this call on the whole topic of share repurchases, but it\u2019s certainly an area that with excess cash that as we have communicated in the past, we will love to leverage. So, more to come on those topics as we go through the year. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet from Guggenheim.\nLaurent Grandet: Hey. Good morning, James, John. I\u2019d like to forgive this morning on BODYARMOR. So, if I\u2019m correct, BODYARMOR manufacturing is not expected to migrate to the concentrate model this year in the U.S., but wherever you are launching it internationally and the brand will be in the concentrate model. So, if I\u2019m correct, and please correct me if I\u2019m not, when are you planning to migrate the U.S. manufacturing to the concentrate model? And obviously it has a significant impact on top line margins. And also any indication of your launch plan outside of the U.S. would be great. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Thanks, Laurent. I mean, as you say, it\u2019s -- and as John has noted, it\u2019s a finished product business that we are integrating into our company and have had some mechanical effects. And as you say, we have not chosen to change it to a concentrate model. In fact, to be more specific, we\u2019re keeping the current operating model where the manufacturing of the product is largely done with co-packers. And that is what has been driving the momentum, and we have no plans to change the model with using the co-packers at this stage. They\u2019re doing a great job. And then obviously, the distribution of the product is done through the Coke bottling system here in the U.S. If we were to try and change the concentrate model, that we would let you know in due course. We have no immediate plans to do so. Again, it would be a mechanical effect on the revenue and the gross margin because it wouldn\u2019t be changing the profit coming from BODYARMOR. It would be more of a mechanical effect on the top -- on the gross margin for operating model reasons. But as I said, our intention is to operate it very broadly as we do at the moment, connected but not integrated, so that we can continue to drive the growth at what has been a very successful brand. They tripled sales in the last 3 years, gained a lot of share in the sports drink category, actually expanded the category and has done a really good job. So, we\u2019re going to kind of keep focused on driving that into more success in the current year. Then, as we expand internationally, we have not decided where and when as of yet. We will be doing that work this year. And then, as we get there, we will, of course, in that process, look at the appropriate operating model, whether there\u2019s any -- whether it should be finished product or concentrate. Clearly, our preferred route to market is to the bottlers, and it will certainly seem to make more sense to organize it as a concentrate model, whether that\u2019s then co-packed or produced by the bottlers is very situational and capacity-driven. But, see the concentrate versus finished product as a mechanical effect on top line rather than an impact on the bottom line. But our focus is driving the growth of the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore.\nRob Ottenstein: James, you\u2019ve done a lot over the last couple of years in terms of the organization and the culture to drive more agility, accountability, leaner, reward risk-taking. So, wondering if you maybe can talk about how that has played out in your mind. Maybe kind of benchmark or kind of give yourself a report card on that. And any new moves or further evolution of that this year? And then, more specifically, one of the actions that you took was the brand and SKU rationalization. Can you quantify the impact of that on results in \u201821? And any potential results in \u201822? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I\u2019m going to go with the back half of -- or we\u2019ll call it one question. I\u2019ll go with the back half of the expanded question firstly and then come back to it. The rationalization of the brands and SKUs -- and remember that that rationalization, some of the brands we stopped. Some of them, we transitioned into other brand names. And some of them -- actually a couple of them, we either discontinue to solve. My take is the impact in 2021 was minimal, and the impact in 2022 is going to be negligible. And the reason I say that is, firstly, the sum of all these brands was a relatively small, low-single-digit percent of sales and contribution, but was a high -- a much higher number in terms of occupation of SKUs and mind space and supply chain. And so, we\u2019ve removed the slower growing or declining brands with the least long-term potential to be leaders in their categories to free up more space or the brands that really are moving and for future innovations and future brands. So actually, I\u2019m entirely comfortable making the argument that even just stopping them actually could have been positive to sales and profit, but it freed up space for those brands and those SKUs that are doing much better. So, I think it was -- if you\u2019d like to say it was pruning the garden to let the better plants grow. And so I actually see it as positive to the business, even though you\u2019re cutting off something that in theory has some sales and profits. And we are largely complete with that process. We\u2019ve -- the brand eliminations is about 75%, and we\u2019re not quite halfway with the brand transition. So, we\u2019re in good shape, but I wouldn\u2019t -- if you\u2019re thinking about it from a modeling point of view, I would just like assume it\u2019s negligible. In terms of the culture in the organization, clearly, we made a lot of moves. We\u2019re very-focused on driving agility of the organization in terms of the culture and the growth behaviors and staying constructively discontent about the future and looking for the opportunities. I think we still have another year to bet down what we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years, big changes in the marketing model. We\u2019ve got some campaigns coming out already. They\u2019re doing very well in the marketplace. We\u2019re pleased with consumer impact and the effectiveness of them. We\u2019ve obviously got our platform services that are up and running. But there\u2019s like, you have to do X before you can do Y before you can do Z. And so, we still have things left to do to bring that to the kind of level of performance that we\u2019re looking for, similarly in terms of some of the supply chain stuff. So, I think we should see 2022 as a year of really fine-tuning and optimizing the work that we\u2019ve done in terms of the organization over the last couple of years and continue to really focus the culture on a growth mindset.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Great. Thanks very much, everyone. To summarize, as we move to 2022, our flywheels for growth are really working in unison, propelling the organization. We\u2019re going to drive topline growth, maximize returns. And again, it\u2019s an attractive and growing industry. Our innovation pipeline is robust and scale for impact. Our marketing agenda is designed to deliver the most effective consumer engagement with agility and speed. Our bottlers are engaged and executing the marketplace. And we\u2019re bringing this vision to life. So, thank you for your interest, your investment in the company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to reflect on the past year and how we've emerged stronger from the pandemic, including positive performance in the fourth quarter. I'll also highlight the broader macro environment and how we're executing in the marketplace. Finally, I'll touch briefly on the accelerators for growth that give us confidence we can achieve the 2022 guidance we've provided today, with more on them to come at CAGNY next, this month. John will then discuss financial results for the quarter and our outlook in more detail. Before I get to it, I'd like to acknowledge that our ability to emerge stronger would not have been possible without the efforts of our dedicated employees and system partners around the world, and I'd like to thank them for their hard work, their contribution not only to our results, but to our curious, empowered, inclusive and agile culture. In 2021, the operating environment remained dynamic as the pandemic continued to evolve, and factors like inflation and supply chain disruptions brought additional challenges. But over the year, our organization and system continued to manage through these circumstances with focus and flexibility. We are pleased with the results, which were above 2019 across key metrics, and we remain focused on building a stronger total beverage company. Now, looking more closely at our fourth quarter results. We saw another quarter of sequential improvement versus 2019, and we ended the year with volume ahead of 2019. Notably, it was the first quarter in which away-from-home volume was also ahead of 2019, while at-home channels remained strong. So, recapping the quarter four performance around the world, starting with Asia Pacific. China delivered strong performance in the quarter by capturing a growing trend among consumers of zero-calorie offerings, we doubled our Zero Sugar sparkling portfolio in terms of volume compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. We leveraged RGM strategies and targeting investments to gain share in e-commerce, thus driving growth for the overall business. In India, initiatives to build omnichannel presence and marketing campaigns around key occasions by leveraging festivals and passion points through occasion-led marketing and integrated execution drove a sequential increase in market share and nearly 30% growth in transactions for the quarter. Additionally, our local Thums Up brand became $1 billion brand in India, driven by focused marketing and execution plans. In Japan, while our system was faced with a very challenging year, we gained value share and consumers driven by successful innovation and commercial strategies. In ASEAN and South Pacific, there were strict restrictions and limited reopenings in many markets for a large part of the year. In Q4, acceleration of vaccine efforts and strong results from the Fanta Colorful People and Sprite Make it Clear campaigns helped drive our recovery. In EMEA, volume in Europe in the quarter surpassed 2019 despite mobility restrictions, particularly in Western Europe. Despite the recovery remaining asynchronous in the region, increased investments behind our brands in the marketplace resulted in our system driving the highest incremental retail value among FMCG players in the region. In Africa, volume continued to be ahead of 2019 in the fourth quarter, driven by our key markets with strong double-digit growth in Nigeria and Egypt. Additionally, increased investments behind our affordability and multi-serve packages drove value share for the full year above 2019 in the region. In Eurasia and Middle East, the top line continued to expand faster than the macro environment, driven by strong revenue growth management, execution and digital capabilities. Turkey, one of our key markets, grew 7 points of value share for the year in digital as total digital commerce expanded by close to 90%. In North America, despite COVID cases leading to business closings and some mobility restrictions, value share growth was strong in the quarter, driven by pricing, revenue growth management and strong execution in the market. The new Coca-Cola Zero Sugar continued to deliver strong results, outpacing category growth, while Sprite and smartwater grew drinker base and buy rates. Innovations also delivered strong performances, led by Coke with Coffee and Simply Almond. Latin America delivered another quarter of strong performance with mid-single-digit volume growth versus 2019. This resilience of the system has been driven by years of experience navigating volatile environments through strong and effective execution. Within Global Ventures, Costa continued to recover through the year but was impacted in Q4 due to COVID-related restrictions. Costa Express continued its strong performance in the UK, delivering results ahead of expectations. In China, the Costa ready-to-drink expansion continued its availability now in more than 300,000 outlets, continuing to drive a share position ahead of our key competitor. Finally, our Bottling Investments Group continued to focus on productivity and transformation initiatives, delivering strong operating margin expansion for full year 2021. Due to improved mobility throughout the year, our industry is growing in both, volume and value. Gaining share was a key objective in our emerging stronger agenda. And this year, we gained value share in both, at-home and away-from-home channels. Our NARTD market share is above 2019 levels at a global level and in both at-home and away-from-home channels. We will continue to identify and address opportunities to further improve our value share, driven by data-backed insights. As we close the chapter on 2021, we emerged stronger by delivering both top line and EPS ahead of 2019, and we gained share in a growing industry. The actions we took during the pandemic have resulted in an agile and focused organization that is poised to capture the sizable opportunities that exist, and we continue to look to the future to build on our momentum and drive growth. As we turn to 2022, while it is impossible for us to know whether this variant will be the last, what is clear is that our consumers, our customers and our business are learning and adapting with great resilience. For example, while we have seen some impacts from the Omicron variant through the first few weeks of the year, we are not seeing the same level of disruption as previous waves, and our system is better equipped. Further recovery in 2022 will be determined by macro factors, including overall consumer sentiment as well as supply chain challenges; labor shortages; and of course, the inflationary pressures in interest rates. We are confident we are well equipped to navigate this environment and deliver on the guidance we provided today. Now, I'll touch on some of the capabilities we've built to unlock the next stage of growth and will elaborate more at our virtual CAGNY presentation later this month. We're excited about where we are today and the substantial initiatives we have in place for 2022. The consumer continues to be at the center of our strategy. And through our total beverage company agenda, we are adapting to the macro and micro trends, which are shaping consumer habits. We advanced our total beverage company agenda last year by streamlining our portfolio, focusing on the core and investing behind a portfolio of brands that allows us to meet the evolving needs of consumers. We completed much of this work on brand eliminations while being deliberate with brand transitions. This optimized portfolio will ensure we follow the consumer and win in emerging and fast-growing categories, and is complemented by the recent strategic acquisition of BODYARMOR as well as relationships like the new agreement with Constellation Brands, which will launch Fresca Mixed, and the extended relationship with Molson Coors, which will launch Simply Spiked Lemonade in the U.S. Our network marketing model, with global category teams and local operating units, is allowing us to focus on end-to-end consumer experiences that are data-driven and always on. Our announcement of WPP as our global marketing network partner is a foundational component of our new marketing model. This new agency approach gives us access to the best created lines, regardless of source, and is underpinned by leading-edge data and technology capabilities. The Real Magic campaign is the first campaign, which was cocreated internally, leveraging this new end-to-end approach, and the campaign is showing strong results with the consumers. We have good visibility into the benefits of the new marketing model. The approach will allow us to deliver best-in-class consumer-centric marketing experiences across our categories and around the world. We also built more discipline into our innovation process in 2021 with a key focus on scalable bets that can build momentum year-over-year. It's still early, but the approach is working. Revenue per launch and gross profit per launch were up 30% and 25%, respectively, versus prior year. And we took intelligent local experiments and move more rapidly to scale them across geographies. Sustainable packaging like refillables and labelless bottles, along with brands like Coke with Coffee, fairlife, AHA, Costa ready-to-drink and Lemon-Dou are all examples of local winners that have been extended to more markets. For 2022, our innovation process is increasingly supported by data, and our pipeline is robust with built-in agility and consists of big bets along with many shots on goal. The system has stepped up its RGM and execution capabilities, which is helping us navigate an inflationary environment, driving value growth in a segmented way. Due to the strength of our bottling partners and the stronger net alignment of the system, we are prepared to address opportunities as well as challenges may lie ahead. Our networked organizational structure is designed to better connect functions and operating units to help our system scale ideas faster. As we've emerged stronger, we kept moving forward on integrating sustainability work into our business as it is a key driver of future growth. During the quarter, we were recognized for our commitment to transparency, an action to address environmental risks by earning an A score in CDP's assessment for water, an improvement over last year. We improved or maintained our score in CDP's assessments on other important areas like climate and forests. Additionally, to complement our World Without Waste goals, we announced a new global goal to reach 25% reusable packaging by 2030. Increasing refillable and reusable packaging options responds to consumer affordability and our sustainability aspirations, and it helps create a circular economy, and refillable packages have extremely high levels of collection and our low-carbon footprint beverage containers. Before I turn over to John, I want to say a big thank you and recognize our associates from both the Company and our bottling partners, who work with great dedication and unwavering commitment throughout another challenging year. We expect the recovery will remain asynchronous, but we are encouraged by our growing industry, our own parallel system strength, and a strategic transformation that enables us to be agile and to adapt. Our actions drove strong results in 2021. And we have confidence in our ability to deliver another year of strong performance in 2022 and over the long term. Now, John will provide more details on our results and our 2020 guidance. Sure. Good morning, Dara. Firstly, we're coming out of 2021 with good strong momentum. We've seen an improvement on the growth rate relative to 2019, both in the at-home channels and the away-from-home channels. So, we're coming into the year with good momentum, notwithstanding some ups and downs due to Omicron in certain parts of the world in December and January. And I'm going to answer the second part first. The above algorithm growth in 2022 is more primarily due to the factors of COVID and inflation, but I'll come back to that. And so, as you look out into the long-term, it is much more likely we will move back into the long-term algorithm. Just to refresh, we're in a robust industry that has been growing historically. It's coming back to growth. And if that's an industry that's growing at 4% or 5%, and we have a long-term track record of gaining share in the industry, you can see why we focus attention on being in the top half of the revenue growth rate in the algorithm we put out that allows us to then drive the business into the future. So, we still think that is a sound long-term perspective in terms of both the industry growth rate and our ability, not just to be the leader but to be the winner in terms of share and to drive in the top half of the algorithm. Coming back to the near-term and 2022, in particular, a couple of things that support an above algorithm number. Firstly, there are a number of countries that are not yet back at their 2019 levels of revenue or indeed, even volume. And whilst we are not expecting everything to be rosy in 2022, we do expect to see ongoing improvements around the world in terms of reopening, in terms of reactivation. And so, we think there are additional tailwinds in 2022 from a reopening perspective that will support the volume side. And then, in terms of pricing, clearly, it's a slightly more inflationary environment than normal. And we, as we have talked on previous calls with our bottling partners, very much look to price in the marketplace. We do have a view that we have to have brands that earn the right to take pricing. And secondly, we very much are not looking to just pass through in price but to do it intelligently because, whilst it's easy to respond to inflation by putting up the prices, there is clearly, as there is broad-based inflation, going to be a squeeze on real incomes in a number of countries. And so, we -- with very long experience in the system of managing inflationary moments when you get a squeeze on real incomes, we very much want to, yes, the company opportunities on premiumization, leverage our strong marketing, leverage our strong innovation. But we do not want to lose consumers out of the industry, so we also will have a foot in affordability. And this is a scenario where we have a lot of experience. The system has a lot of experience, and we intend to push it forward. The net of all that is likely to mean that we see a balance between volume and price/mix within the overall revenue guidance that we've given you. Yes, sure. So, I think the system in the U.S. has done an exceptional job in trying to manage through all the different needles that needed to be threaded in terms of the supply chain to provide the brands for our consumers and our customers and have availability of the product. Was it perfect last year? No. Is it likely to be perfect this year? No. But, we are doing the maximum we can to optimize our full availability. And there are issues across a number of dimensions. I would say two things on the line - underlie this, and we can take some examples. There is two effects going on. One, which I've talked about on previous calls, which is the kind of the temporal supply shock. When you have a crisis, things whip around. You suddenly sell less fountain and want to sell more cans, and the system is not set up for that. And so, you get these kind of big swings, a bit like the famous case study of the video game business school. And there you get the shock waves of like in earthquake that continue to ripple through the system. And so, we saw that last year, and we will see some of that again in 2022. But they're temporal. But also there, I believe, were a set of underlying structural squeezes going on in the supply chain that perhaps had not been fully addressed by ourselves or by the industries involved, pre-COVID. And the advent of COVID just doubled down the pressure on them. So, examples of that would be trucking and freight in the U.S. There's been a long-term squeeze on the availability of trucking, whether it be the hours, regulations, the aging out of the drivers. You had COVID where people didn't take the test. And so, some of these structural problems are coming home to roost. Everyone, including ourselves, are very involved in fixing them. Similarly, for example, on cans, can capacity, manufacturing accounts have been flat for a decade, but really can use and attraction that have been creeping up. And that just got squeezed as the away-from-home closed and the at-home spiked up in COVID. People are building new canning plants. New capacity is coming online. So, I think what you're going to see play out through 2022 is the reduction in the kind of temporal amplitudes from the swings from COVID and the steady fixing of some of these structural issues that will still take some time through 2022. Obviously, we are going to do the maximum possible to leverage our portfolio of brands, our portfolio of packaging options to maximize our ability to put the drinks into the hands where the people want them and the customers want to sell them. Well, clearly, we've been gaining market share. And my favorite metric is market share versus 2019, both in the away-from-home and at-home channels we've gained overall. We've gained in the away-from-home and we've gained in the at-home. And we are -- in terms of consumer business, we are assuming a greater degree of reopening. We can certainly begin to see that in Europe as the Omicron variant has moved through. The U.S., just this week, mask mandates are coming down. So, there is going to be an improvement in mobility across the world. It's not going to be back to 2019 fully in 2022. And I think that's going to be true, both in terms of domestic mobility and international mobility, I don't know if you meant per country or people moving around the world. But anyway, the answer is basically the same, which is we are assuming an improvement in mobility, but we're not assuming a return yet to the full 2019 levels. Let me separate the businesses into the vast majority of the business, which goes through the bottling system, and then some businesses that go in parallel. When we're talking about pricing needs of the concentrate business a bit that goes through the bottler, in the almost all cases, we have a system whereby we operate what's called incidence pricing. So, we have agreements with the bottlers where our revenue will be a percent of the revenues that they achieve in the marketplace. So therefore, we are both incentivized to work diligently to increase the total size of the pie in a much more aligned way in terms of both trying to drive the same outcome. So, in that sense, the bottlers -- we work together and the bottlers take the pricing in the marketplace, whether it's rate pricing or working on the mix between the brands and the packages and the channels, and then we take a percentage of that. And of course, we're both looking at the various input cost challenges that we have, and we work through and come up with a pricing plan, and the bottlers take that to the marketplace and get it done. We do have a few businesses where we sell the finished goods, whether that be some of the, for example, the chilled juice businesses here in the U.S. or in Europe or the Costa business or the BIG business. Clearly, there, we're operating the vertically integrated businesses, and we're doing very much what we do with the bottlers we do our own for those businesses, and we work it all through. So, I think you can take it as we work very much in alignment working back from the consumer, trying to drive value for the customers. And we manage the portfolio of all the different input costs, including our needs to kind of invest in marketing, invest in innovation and invest in execution capacity as the bottlers would do. Sure. So, yes, clearly by saying we're expecting a balance between volume and price in our overall revenue guidance, there is an implicit volume growth that is broad based geographically, obviously more tends to be faster -- rather tends to be in the emerging markets and slower in the developed markets. Yes, it predicated on improvements in away-from-home, particularly in those countries, which are not yet back to 2019 levels. We have -- whilst we have emerged stronger and our total business is bigger than it was in 2019, whether that be volume, revenue or profits, that is not true in every country. And so, -- and actually, in total, away-from-home is not back to where it was in 2019. So, there's clearly more or less to come back, which is why effectively implicitly, there's a little more volume into 2022 guidance than in the normal long-term algorithm. And similarly, with price/mix, as I commented earlier, it's going to be implicitly a little more than usual. And I think you'll have to kind of look at -- I would encourage everyone to look at some of the two-year stack rates in terms of volume and price to look at how it's been moving by group and by business segment, as you think about your modeling going into 2022. Thanks, Chris. And just to confirm, you're talking about sequential improvement in gross margins? Right. Yes. Okay. Clearly, as we talked about on the last question, we are expecting some extra improvement in the away-from-home going into 2022. As I said, it's not yet back to the 2019 levels, and that is a plus from a gross margin point of view. I would not want to characterize that as the biggest thing happening next year. There's a lot more moving pieces going on. So, I think it is a factor. It's probably more important, the overall growth of the business and the reopenings in the different geographies. But I think that's the key. I think, John, do you want to add anything? Well, thank you for calling out the reusable goal, Carlos. Clearly, achieving it will mean using much less of virgin PET and make it easier to achieve our objectives of a World Without Waste, where we intend to collect back a bottle or can for every one we sell by 2030. In terms of the marketing and the innovation question, I'm not quite sure I completely captured what you're going for. But let me throw out some thoughts, and I think that will help. The consumer elasticity and pricing power, yes, I think a lot of people have noted, it's been relatively inelastic in recent times. It's certainly our historical experience that when multiple categories go off at the same time, there is less elasticity. But it is also our experience that often that it's in an environment of a crisis where there's a support of a lot of injection of money into the economy, which I think is what has been happening over the last couple of years. Eventually, it moves to another phase where there's inflation and a squeeze on the income. And so, we are very attuned to the need to be -- burn our pricing as we go forward. And earnings, whether it's with the marketing that really engages with the consumers, whether it's with the innovation that, again, engages with the consumers and gives our customers the opportunity to do different things and more interesting things in the stores or whether we earn it through the excellence in execution and the in-store presence that our bottling partners are so good at. Because the next phase is much harder than the previous phase. It's easier to do pricing in a stimulus environment where everyone else is going up. It's much harder when there's a real squeeze on income. So we're very focused on winning in the next phase. It's something that we and our bottling partners have a lot of experience with, and it will certainly be an opportunity and a necessity to deploy the whole toolkit from marketing innovation through execution to continue winning as we go forward. Yes, sure. I mean, we have a kind of approach where we've come. We switched during the crisis and leaning into growth or a bias to invest. As you can see through the course of the crisis and into 2021, we steadily increased our level of investment on marketing, restarted the engines on innovation. And similarly, the bottlers will do so on execution and actually investments in supply chain. So that's our bias going into the year. We're going to invest for growth. We've got a lot of ability drive not just the market innovation, but also underline the advances in the digitization of the business, whether it's the connection with the consumer, whether it's the connection with the retailers and what the bottlers are doing to digitize that part of the business. So, we are leaning into growth. But what we have achieved over the last few years is to increase our degree of flexibility or adaptability. Better said, it's not that everyone is sitting out there with talks of flexibility, it's more that we can adapt as circumstances change. We doubled down on our ability to make quicker, clearer decisions coming in to the crisis. And with the reorganization that we did recently -- have a more networked organization, we feel good about our ability to prioritize and redirect resources as and when needed during the year, whether that's to move from one part of the world to the other or one brand to another, or even to pull back where the growth is not there. So, we feel we've got the levers, the hand, and we feel we've become more agile in using them. Yes. Thanks, Laurent. I mean, as you say, it's -- and as John has noted, it's a finished product business that we are integrating into our company and have had some mechanical effects. And as you say, we have not chosen to change it to a concentrate model. In fact, to be more specific, we're keeping the current operating model where the manufacturing of the product is largely done with co-packers. And that is what has been driving the momentum, and we have no plans to change the model with using the co-packers at this stage. They're doing a great job. And then obviously, the distribution of the product is done through the Coke bottling system here in the U.S. If we were to try and change the concentrate model, that we would let you know in due course. We have no immediate plans to do so. Again, it would be a mechanical effect on the revenue and the gross margin because it wouldn't be changing the profit coming from BODYARMOR. It would be more of a mechanical effect on the top -- on the gross margin for operating model reasons. But as I said, our intention is to operate it very broadly as we do at the moment, connected but not integrated, so that we can continue to drive the growth at what has been a very successful brand. They tripled sales in the last 3 years, gained a lot of share in the sports drink category, actually expanded the category and has done a really good job. So, we're going to kind of keep focused on driving that into more success in the current year. Then, as we expand internationally, we have not decided where and when as of yet. We will be doing that work this year. And then, as we get there, we will, of course, in that process, look at the appropriate operating model, whether there's any -- whether it should be finished product or concentrate. Clearly, our preferred route to market is to the bottlers, and it will certainly seem to make more sense to organize it as a concentrate model, whether that's then co-packed or produced by the bottlers is very situational and capacity-driven. But, see the concentrate versus finished product as a mechanical effect on top line rather than an impact on the bottom line. But our focus is driving the growth of the business. Sure. I'm going to go with the back half of -- or we'll call it one question. I'll go with the back half of the expanded question firstly and then come back to it. The rationalization of the brands and SKUs -- and remember that that rationalization, some of the brands we stopped. Some of them, we transitioned into other brand names. And some of them -- actually a couple of them, we either discontinue to solve. My take is the impact in 2021 was minimal, and the impact in 2022 is going to be negligible. And the reason I say that is, firstly, the sum of all these brands was a relatively small, low-single-digit percent of sales and contribution, but was a high -- a much higher number in terms of occupation of SKUs and mind space and supply chain. And so, we've removed the slower growing or declining brands with the least long-term potential to be leaders in their categories to free up more space or the brands that really are moving and for future innovations and future brands. So actually, I'm entirely comfortable making the argument that even just stopping them actually could have been positive to sales and profit, but it freed up space for those brands and those SKUs that are doing much better. So, I think it was -- if you'd like to say it was pruning the garden to let the better plants grow. And so I actually see it as positive to the business, even though you're cutting off something that in theory has some sales and profits. And we are largely complete with that process. We've -- the brand eliminations is about 75%, and we're not quite halfway with the brand transition. So, we're in good shape, but I wouldn't -- if you're thinking about it from a modeling point of view, I would just like assume it's negligible. In terms of the culture in the organization, clearly, we made a lot of moves. We're very-focused on driving agility of the organization in terms of the culture and the growth behaviors and staying constructively discontent about the future and looking for the opportunities. I think we still have another year to bet down what we've done over the last couple of years, big changes in the marketing model. We've got some campaigns coming out already. They're doing very well in the marketplace. We're pleased with consumer impact and the effectiveness of them. We've obviously got our platform services that are up and running. But there's like, you have to do X before you can do Y before you can do Z. And so, we still have things left to do to bring that to the kind of level of performance that we're looking for, similarly in terms of some of the supply chain stuff. So, I think we should see 2022 as a year of really fine-tuning and optimizing the work that we've done in terms of the organization over the last couple of years and continue to really focus the culture on a growth mindset. Great. Thanks very much, everyone. To summarize, as we move to 2022, our flywheels for growth are really working in unison, propelling the organization. We're going to drive topline growth, maximize returns. And again, it's an attractive and growing industry. Our innovation pipeline is robust and scale for impact. Our marketing agenda is designed to deliver the most effective consumer engagement with agility and speed. Our bottlers are engaged and executing the marketplace. And we're bringing this vision to life. So, thank you for your interest, your investment in the company and for joining us this morning."

            "name": "John Murphy",
            "content": "Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we closed the year with strong results, despite the impact of the Omicron variant across many parts of the world. Our Q4 organic revenue growth was 9%. Our price/mix of 10% was driven by a combination of factors, including targeted pricing, revenue growth management initiatives as well as further improvement in away-from-home channels in many markets. Unit case growth showed further sequential improvement on a two-year basis and concentrate sales like unit cases by 10 points in the quarter, primarily due to six fewer days in the quarter. Despite commodity market inflation and the dynamic supply chain environment, comparable gross margin for the quarter was relatively flat versus prior year. Pricing initiatives and favorable channel and package mix were offset by the impact of consolidating the fast-growing finished goods, BODYARMOR business, along with incremental investments to sustain momentum in the overall business for 2022. We continued to invest in markets as they recovered and stepped up year-over-year marketing dollars again in Q4, spending in a targeted way to maximize returns. This increase in marketing investments, along with some top line pressure from six fewer days in the quarter, resulted in comparable operating margin compression of approximately 500 basis points for the quarter. For the full year, comparable operating margin was down approximately 100 basis points versus prior year as improved comparable gross margin was offset by the significant step-up in marketing. Importantly, versus 2019, a key measure we have focused on, comparable operating margin was up approximately 100 basis points. Putting it all together, fourth quarter comparable earnings per share of $0.45 was a decline of 5% year-over-year, resulting in full year comparable earnings per share of $2.32, an increase of 19% versus the prior year, as a strong resurgence in the business also benefited from a 3-point tailwind from currency and tax. We delivered strong free cash flow of $11.3 billion in 2021, with free cash flow conversion of approximately 115% and a dividend payout ratio well below our long-term target of 75%. With these results, we exceeded guidance on every metric for full year 2021. We have done tremendous work to emerge ahead of 2019 and set the stage to drive our growth agenda for years to come. We are spinning the strategy flywheels faster and more effectively. Our organization is focused on execution and enhancing our capabilities to fuel growth. As James mentioned, the pandemic will be one of the many factors, along with the dynamic macro backdrop that we face in the coming year. But our local businesses are ready to adapt and execute for growth. With that in mind, this morning, we provided guidance for 2022 that builds on momentum from 2021. We expect organic revenue growth of approximately 7% to 8%, and we expect comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 8% to 10% versus 2021. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate 3-point currency headwind to comparable revenue and an approximate 3 to 4 points currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. Additionally, due to a certain change in recent regulations, we estimate an effective tax rate increase from 18.6% in 2021 to 20% for 2022, which is an estimated 2 percentage points headwind to EPS. Therefore, all-in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus 2021, including the combined 5- to 6-point headwind from currency and tax. We expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow of 2022 through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. This implies the fourth consecutive year of free cash flow conversion above our long-term range of 90% to 95%. We continue to raise the performance bar across the organization and are confident in delivering on this 2022 guidance. In summary, we expect to deliver another year of strong topline-driven growth, along with maximized returns, driven by the strategic changes we have made in our business. There are several considerations to keep in mind for 2022. Overall, inflationary and supply chain pressures continue to impact costs across several fronts in the business, including input costs, transportation, marketing and operating expenses. With regards to commodity costs, after benefiting from our hedging strategy in 2021, we remain well hedged in 2022, but at higher levels. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect commodity price inflation to have a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2022. However, we are taking actions in the marketplace using multiple levers, including RGM in its many forms, along with our productivity initiatives, to help offset much of the impact. As a reminder, for your modeling, the consolidation of the recently acquired fast-growing BODYARMOR finished goods business will have a mechanical effect on margins. When it comes to capital allocation, our balance sheet remains strong, and our improving cash flow position is allowing us to be even more vigorous in pursuit of priorities that balance financial flexibility with efficient capital structure, first and foremost, to invest in our business; secondly, continuing our track record to grow our dividend; thirdly, to seek opportune M&A and to repurchase shares with excess cash. And finally, due to the calendar shift, there will be one less day in the first quarter and one additional day in the fourth quarter. Despite another year of uncertainty, in 2021, we came together as a system to emerge stronger and position ourselves to drive sustainable growth. We are encouraged by the momentum in our business and are clear on the direction we're headed. As we look to 2022, we feel confident in our ability to deliver on the commitments we outlined today. Thanks, Bryan. Yes, on the -- as you walk down through the P&L, currency neutral, I think on the first point is top line is very robust. We have done a really nice job, I think, going into \u201822 on optimizing to our RGM efforts and the innovation pipeline that we have at play. And then, secondly, coming out of the reorg work that we've done over the last couple of years, we are doing I think a much tighter job on overall resource allocation, finding a good balance between investing as we need to for -- to support the top line, but also taking into account the opportunities that we have driven in the efficiency work that we have done. So, I feel confident that we have some flex from the gross margin line down in the currency neutral basis. And below the operating line are actually our net interest expense, given the tremendous work we've done to completely restructure our debt portfolio, is actually a net benefit for us in 2022. Yes. No, I think it's a good juncture maybe to just say a little bit about gross margins, because I know there will be questions on what we expect. And I think I'd like to just emphasize there's really several factors that are playing into the 2022 picture. We do have the mechanical effect of the BODYARMOR acquisition that, I think, is important to take into account we had a slight currency tailwind in \u201821, and that's going to be kind of negated with a similar expected headwind in 2022. I think it's important to keep in mind what we discussed on the impact of the commodity pressures. There will be, I think offsetting against that, the benefit of some of the pricing power and brand leadership that we have that James has mentioned. And that will, I think, also be complemented by an improving channel mix outlook. But I think it's important to take into account all of the factors and hence, -- that feeds into the guidance that we provided this morning. Sure. I think the short answer first, it was always intended to be one of the arrows in the quiver. The longer version of that answer is clearly COVID impacted, not just our total business, but it impacted the cost of business, which is an almost entirely away-from-home business. And so, it was very much a bit like our fountain business in the U.S. It was very much in the crosshairs of the COVID impact, particularly in 2020 at the beginning when the lockdowns were very severe. And in fact, most of those coffee shops are all closed in 2020. So, it was very hard on the Costa business. The 2021 made a lot of progress, reopenings, not back to where we were yet, so the coffee stores are bouncing back, but not back to where they were yet. The vision we have for coffee included a number of other components. One was the Express machines, the digital kind of barista. Obviously, 2020 was hard to install new machines, but the performance of the existing machines was extraordinary and very positive, and that last year, we began to install thousands of new machines. And then, we've launched, partnered with our bottlers to have Proud to Serve, where they provide the beans and machines to the HORECA channel. And we've launched a ready-to-drink, where it's done really well in certain parts of the world. So, the vision is still there. We see it as one of the arrows in the quiver. Clearly, we've lost a couple of years. I mean, there's no beating around the bush, and we're going to have to bounce back from it. But the learnings we had and the experience was where we were able to do things give us some confidence and belief that we need -- that we have an opportunity to execute against the vision, which, of course, we still need to do. Thanks, Kevin. Yes, there was a -- the reason we used the word sort of a more vigorous pursuit in the script because as you said, the -- our situation today is very different to where it was and not that long ago with our free cash conversion gone from 70% to over 100%. Our net debt leverage has gone from outside of our range to at the low end of it. Dividend conversion is now at 70%, more or less. And as I mentioned on the call, the restructuring of the debt portfolio has been a very robust piece of work. So, as we look through the future, I think at your question, we need to touch it in the context of the broader capital allocation agenda. We continue to prioritize growth of the business. We touched upon some of that in the earlier questions, both in terms of the capital that we need to drive some of the businesses that we're in and the marketing that we need to support the brands. Secondly, we don't waver from our ongoing support and objective to continue to grow the dividend. And then, we're left with the two more dynamic areas, the M&A agenda and share repo. So, on both of those, we -- I think M&A will be opportunistic. There's not a lot of obvious candidates out there, but we will continue to be very open to that whole area. And not on this call on the whole topic of share repurchases, but it's certainly an area that with excess cash that as we have communicated in the past, we will love to leverage. So, more to come on those topics as we go through the year. Thank you."

After a strong first half of the year, we saw continued momentum in our business in the third quarter. While the global recovery remains asynchronous, our people and our system are leveraging the learning that deliver good results and emerge stronger. And while markets are at different stages of reopening around the world, our local businesses have been increasingly resilient through restrictions and lock-downs. As a result, our underlying volumes have accelerated on a two-year basis with quarterly growth versus 2019 for the first time since the pandemic began. This improvement has been supported by our transformation agenda, which set us on a path to more efficient and effective marketing, as well as more disciplined and intelligent innovation. We are investing accordingly behind our portfolio of loved brands and are seeing signs of early traction. Given strong results year-to-date, and increased visibility into the rest of the year, we expect to deliver organic revenue at the high end of our previously provided range and are raising bottom line and cash flow guidance for the full year. This morning, I'll provide a business update and discuss how our network organization is executing well in this dynamic environment. Then John will discuss our financials and raised guidance and some early considerations for 2022.  In the first half of 2021, mobility and business levels improved in many markets, as lock-downs eased and vaccinations increased. The recovery has not been a straight-line, and continues to be uneven around the world. But despite the asynchronous recovery, in the third quarter, our volumes surpassed 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic began. Although not yet back to 2019 levels as a percent of our business, we saw sequential improvement in away from home volumes on a two-year basis, as consumers return to many of their former routines. At-home volumes also showed ongoing strength even as away-from-home channels improved. The quarter was off to a promising start in July, but the Delta variant impacted several markets, resulting in a softer August, followed by improvement in September, as the variant began to lessen in some of our key markets. The pandemic continues to be a key factor across our operating environment, in addition to the ongoing pressure points in our supply chain. However, our network system is leveraging the learning's from the past 18 months, sharing best practices and skillfully executing by applying Revenue Growth Management, and working our supply chain leavers to capitalize on the strength of our brands and mitigate disruptions. The industry is growing and we continue to gain shares. Our overall value share improved year-on-year, and remains above 2019 levels. We're pleased to report gains across categories, as well as both within at home and away from home channels. Our operating units are combining the power of scale with a deep knowledge required to win locally in an environment that remains dynamic. So diving a little into the key drivers across geographies, starting with Asia-Pacific. In China, media investments across categories are yielding promising signs. Results in the quarter reflect strict COVID lockdowns and some weather-related disruption in August, while September marked sequential improvements. Japan state of emergency was lifted at the end of the quarter after consumers spent the majority of 2021 in lock-down. Strengthened execution across our teams and innovation has helped lessen impacts, and our consumer base has grown beyond 2019 levels. In India, we participated strongly in the recovery by focusing on affordability and omni -channel growth through e-B2B. We grew both trademark coke and local icon Thums-up using effective marketing activations. We had share gains in ASEAN and the South Pacific Operating Unit, despite pandemic-related restrictions in all of its top markets.  Our investments behind Sparkling flavors and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, will continue to create value when lock-downs are lifted.  In EMEA, in Europe, we gained value share across nearly all categories as restrictions eased, while weather, a slower recovery in tourism, and the delta surge had an impact on global campaigns to key brands including Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Sprite, and Fanta helped drive sparkling share. As vaccinations accelerated in Eurasia and the Middle East, we maintained momentum through effective revenue growth management initiatives, resulting in top-line that expanded faster than the macro environment in those top markets. Our results in Africa were balanced across regions and categories during this quarter, despite a third wave of the pandemic that resulted in targeted lockdowns. Vaccination rates remained on the low side relative to the rest of the world. And our focus remains on affordability and single-serve packs as mobility increases in countries like Egypt and Nigeria. We maintained strong momentum in North America despite the COVID resurgence in many states leading to stalling consumer sentiment and supply chain challenges that resulted in both missed opportunities and incremental costs. The at-home channel remains healthy, and although away-from-home growth accelerated early in the quarter, labor shortages have constrained capacity with some on-premise customers. Recent price actions to offset higher input costs have been effective with lower-than-expected price elasticities to date, and promotional levels remain below 2019.  In Latin America, successful commercial initiatives, including affordability packs, increased availability of our key products, and strong customer execution in both modern and traditional trade, drove volume growth across all major markets amidst an improving COVID environment. Improvement in single-serve mix, some pricing actions, and connecting brands strategies to on-premise customers to drive further recovery in the away-from-home channel all contributed to strong price mix. Within Global Ventures, Costa benefited from retail store recovery as the UK re-opens. With improved reach and frequency from its enhanced loyalty program Costa continues to expand across platforms into new markets in partnership with our bottlers, resulting in growing brand awareness. Our Bottling Investments Group performance was driven by India and the Philippines. BIG saw strict lockdowns in several markets, as well as rising inflation, but has continued to see share gains year-to-date in South Africa. Adverse impacts have been well-managed through package and category mix improvements along with cost controls preserving progress on our operating margins during the pandemic. Global category teams are working with our operating units to build an engine to drive effective marketing scale and innovation, which we amplified across the world. Highlights from this quarter include Coca-Cola Zero Sugar\u2019s new recipe has rolled out in more than 50 countries and has had accelerated growth in the last 3 months. In September, trademark Coca-Cola\u2019s new global brand philosophy Real Magic was unveiled featuring a refreshed look for our iconic logo, the Hug. The Real Magic platform takes a digital first approach and our executions feature a range of experiences that are tailored to Gen Z and leverage passion points like gaming and music to attract a new generation of drinkers. Sparkling flavors gained share in the quarter driven by investments in targeted brand country combinations with a focus on occasions and Zero Sugar offerings. In China, Sprite volume growth was accelerated by leveraging the global Let\u2019s Be Clear campaign during summer music festivals. Similarly, the 'What The Fanta' campaign focuses on snacking, and is driving growth across all key metrics in Europe. The hydration, sports, tea and coffee categories are seeing a good return on spend behind global brands. AHA\u2019s expansion into new markets this year, has shown flexibility to adapt to local customer and consumer needs. In Advanced hydration, functional benefits have helped to stretch brand power and drive share for Aquarius, as it becomes more of a global brand. Tea and coffee have had success with FUZE tea in Europe on both Ayataka and Costa, ready-to-drink in Japan. There is an opportunity to recover share in Georgia coffee as the at work occasion returns. Our juice portfolio gained share this quarter helped by Minute Maid Pulpy performance in China, Del Valle via growth in Latin America, and strong results across brands in Africa. In dairy, Fairlife is set to become the first billion dollar brand in our dairy portfolio and has recently launched its joint venture in China. Our experimentation with Topo Chico Hard Seltzer is expanding and we're gathering valuable insights globally, including the importance of building the category in regions where it is nascent. We are seeing encouraging performance where the flavored alcoholic beverage category is growing rapidly, and we have on-shelf presence. Molson Coors recently announced the national roll out of Topo Chico Hard Seltzer in the U.S. with new Margarita flavors. We also recently announced an expansion of our relationship with Molson Coors to bring the brand into Canada. As the pandemic recovery has progressed, we've seen challenges and disruptions in many parts of the world, in addition to inflationary forces that could persist. We have years of experience in dealing with these types of environments, and are enhancing our strong capabilities that enable us to do so. We are using the crucial tool of Revenue Growth Management in its many forms, and are executing in collaboration with our bottling partners. We continue to refine our ability to optimize price and package offerings, according to occasions, brands, and channels, striking the right balance between premiumization and affordability. In addition to streamlining our portfolio, targeting more disciplined innovation, intelligent experimentation, and transforming our marketing model, we're also building strong digital capabilities. We have taken an enterprise approach and are progressing on the roll out of multi-category Ebb3 platforms with our bottlers globally. As an example [Indiscernible] is seeing strong growth outside home market of Latin America, and that's more than 50 categories contributing meaningfully to it's sales on the platform. Additionally, we are delivering outsized growth with powerful, and growing omni -channel presence across regions. We're driving incremental instance with partners like foodservice aggregators. North America, for example, has grown attachment rates by mid single-digits with third-party and restaurant owned platforms. And we're gaining share in e-commerce, with significant wins in Eurasia and hitting record levels in Latin America this quarter. I'll also like to reiterate the sustainability is an integral part of our business strategy and it's a key driver of future growth. For 2018 when we launched World Without Waste to today, we've made much progress against our pillars to design, collect, and partner to deliver against our goals. Our commitment to reduce waste globally is also closely connected to our climate ambitions, collecting more empty packages, using more recycled material, light-weighting our bottles, and using plant-based materials always we are embracing the collective efforts to decarbonize the global economy. We strive to provide stakeholders with clear progress against our goals through our annual business in ESG report and World Without Waste report, including using the Global Reporting Initiative, SASB, and TCFD reporting frameworks, as well as disclosures through other publicly available avenues like CDP and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. We continuously revisit our ESG reporting and disclosures to ensure our leadership position. We do not take our responsibility lightly, and we carefully and thoroughly [Indiscernible] long-term objectives with our system partners, and only commit to new goals with a clear, actionable plan. To ensure we remain transparent on responses to this evolving landscape, we'd like to invite you to join us for our virtual ESG event on November the 3rd, where key business and sustainability leaders will provide an update on our initiatives, and answer your questions. As we look at our year-to-date performances in the system, it's clear that we are emerging stronger from the pandemic, delivering solid results under more network structure. Now, I'll turn the call to John, to discuss our third quarter results, our updated outlook, and some initial thoughts about 2022.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you [Indiscernible]. in the third quarter, we delivered another set of strong results, building on the momentum we've seen this year. Our Q3 organic revenue was up 14% with concentrate shipments up 8% on price mix of 6%, price mix was led by strong pricing in North America and Latin America and further improvement in away-from-home channels in many markets. Unit case growth was 6%, with absolute unit cases ahead of 2019 levels for the first time this year, and a sequential improvement versus the second quarter on a 2 year basis. Concentrate shipments outpaced unit cases in the quarter due to inventory builds by some of our bottling partners to manage through near-term disruption. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 160 basis points versus prior year, driven by pricing in the market, positive mix, and timing of shipments. Despite some pressure points in the supply chain, we're successfully pulling the levers at our disposal to mitigate impacts to the best of our ability. We continue to invest as many markets reopen during the quarter and significantly stepped up our marketing dollar versus prior year. As a result, our comparable operating margin compressed by 40 basis points year-over-year more than offsetting the flow through from the strong top line. Below operating income, we saw some leverage come through from the other income line and a lower tax rate for the quarter that was driven by our updated effective tax rate for the full year to 18.6% from 19.1% previously. Putting all this together, third quarter comparable earnings per share of $0.65 was an increase of 18% year-over-year, including a 3 point benefit from currency. We also delivered strong year-to-date free cash flow of $8.5 billion. Given our strong results and with 1 quarter remaining, we have good visibility and are raising guidance for the full year. We now expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 13% to 14%, which is at the high end of our previously provided range, and comparable EPS growth of 15% to 17% in 2021. Our updated guidance for free cash flow of approximately $10.5 billion represents significant progress over the past few years, and particularly during the COVID era. This progress is further dimensionalize as follows: We expect to achieve this year a dividend payout ratio below our long-term target of 75% of free cash flow for the first time since 2015. We anticipate delivering another year of free cash flow conversion above 100%. And finally, our expected free cash flow has almost doubled since 2017. Our improving cash flow position will allow us to be even more vigorous in pursuit of our capital allocation priorities. First and foremost, to invest in our business, secondly, continuing our track record to grow our dividend, thirdly, to seek opportune M&A, and finally, with excess cash to repurchase our shares. So as we think about Q4, a few things to keep in mind. 1, the recovery phase looks different around the world and we expect that to continue. 2, we continue to see a minimal commodity impact due to hedges we have in place for the remainder of the year. 3, from a marketing perspective, we expect to increase consumer-facing marketing spend toward levels similar to 2019 while improving the quality of that spend and allocating it in a more targeted manner. 4, our currency outlook continues to contemplate a tailwind of 1% to 2% to the top line, and approximately 2% to 3% to comparable EPS in 2021 based on current spot rates and our hedge positions. Last, but not least, our current full-year guidance has built in the leveling of our concentrate shipments that are running ahead year-to-date due to timing considering that we have 6 fewer days in the fourth quarter. It's not typical for us to provide commentary on the year ahead at this stage but I would like to highlight a few points regarding 2022 given the dynamics we are already seeing. While there are puts and takes to consider from the pandemic looking into next year, we're confident in the underlying top line trajectory supported by our transformation work, our innovation agenda, and a more efficient and effective approach to marketing. Along with this ongoing momentum in revenues, we also expect to see some higher costs. We are not immune to the commodity inflation that has been impacting the world for the better part of 2021 nor the rapidly changing environment. We've been successful with hedges that were put in place to mitigate the impact of input cost inflation and those will begin to roll off in 2022. Based on current rates and hedge position, we'd expect commodity inflation having mid-single-digit impact on our cost of goods sold in 2022. We've been proactively accelerating our revenue growth management, and productivity levers to offset some of this pressure as we look out to next year. And we're closely monitoring the moving parts in the supply chain to ensure we are well-positioned to meet demand. Moving to marketing dollars, we'll continue to invest purposefully in our brands and markets to support top-line growth, with spend more heavily weighted towards consumer-facing activities. Regarding currency, if we were to assume current rates and our hedge position, there would be an approximate 2 to 3 points currency headwind to revenue, and a 2 to 3 point headwind to earnings for the full year 2022. Of course, volatility remain and several factors could have an impact on our currency outlook between now and February. Overall, as vaccinations continue to progress globally, we are in a better position today to navigate this environment and we feel good about the potential for our business. We look forward to coming back with more specific guidance after the fourth quarter. In closing, I'd like to acknowledge the more than 700,000 men and women of the Coca-Cola system, whose tremendous dedication and hard work have been instrumental to delivering the strong results in the first nine months of the year. The alignment of our system and it's deft navigation through a challenging supply environment and an asynchronous pandemic recovery has been key enablers to emerging stronger. We're confident in our updated guidance and our ability to further leverage our strong capability to drive sustainable top-line growth and maximize returns. With that, Operator, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, to ask a question, [Operator Instructions]. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit your questions to 1 question. If you have any additional questions, you may rejoin the queue. Your first question is from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I appreciate the commentary on the cadence through the quarter and even giving us a little bit of some pieces to look at '22. But if we can just -- I think one of the questions we're getting now is just -- kind of the business momentum, maybe how it's come -- progressed as we move into the fourth quarter. So maybe if you could give a little bit more color on just, you know, how you're seeing the business currently. And also just some perspective on how you see that momentum going into '22 given, not just the pandemic, but also inflation and pricing -- just some context about how the businesses is going so far this quarter. But also just your perspective on that going into '22\nJames Quincey : Sure. Good morning, Bryan. Firstly, we clearly have been executing [Indiscernible] emerging stronger strategy. And you can see that coming through, we've called out that the third quarter was the first quarter to be growing versus -- in a full quarter versus 2019. So a sequential improvement, as we've been going through this year from the first half, which was below 2019 to the third quarter, which was above it. So it's clearly sequential improvement coming through as we have adapted our ability to cope with the ups and downs of the lockdowns and the re-openings. Now, in the quarter as you say, we called out that July started well, and then August was softer as there were more lock downs and then September was better. When you think about where that's going in the fourth quarter and into next year, clearly the fact that we have raised or clarified guidance on revenue to be the top end of the range should lead you to feel confident that we see visibility in the downhill of the rest of this year. October has started strong and in line with expectations so we feel good. The momentum is there. I've made the caveat, as many other people have done through COVID, that who knows what could happen in the downhill with variants and with lock downs. But at the moment what we see is the momentum is there, we feel good about our top-line guidance for the year and October backs up that statement. And then as it goes through 2022, obviously too early to call the full year next year, and we will do so in February. But again, in the comments, in the press release, in John's comments, we said we feel that we think we have momentum in the business. Again, the caveats of who knows what will happen with variance and potential lock downs but we do see the world emerging from the crisis a bit like an earthquake. You get more aftershocks, but the consequent aftershocks tend to be smaller than the early ones. And that's how we see '22. We feel there's good momentum and the strategy is working and it's getting us back on track.\nBryan Spillane: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks, Good morning. I wanted to just talk a little bit more maybe about supply chain. Last quarter, you talked about isolated pressure points and definitely offered commentary to say that you're able to tap into supplier relationships and so on. But I was just curious I guess, what's the thought that bottlers continue to try to build inventory, not just in advance of 4Q, but even looking into '22, that you kind of maintain this disconnect between them and concentrate shipments and unit case volume, but also to talk a little bit on the packaging side of things and what the system is able to do to have better access to the range of packaging options. Because I know things have been tight all year, but it sounds like they're getting worse. And so just curious what you could offer us on what you guys are doing to be able to manage through that so well, thanks.\nJames Quincey : I'm not sure I used with the word isolated last quarter, but I know what you mean. Look, firstly, we have a lot of capability of managing through crises. This may be a unique and global one, but most managers and leaders at Coke have, sometime in their career, managed a part of the world or a country that's gone through severe dislocation. And so we have built capability over the years to manage through this. And in the mean -- in particular, in the supply chains, organizations of the Company, and with the bottlers, And so we have strong capabilities, we look for long-term partnerships with the ecosystem of the supply chains, whether that's imports, materials, or logistics. We also act as a system in a number of regards. We have something called the Cross Enterprise Procurement Group, which buys key commodities on behalf of the Company and the bottlers, so there's a great deal of coordination between ourselves and the bottlers. In terms of the problems it's a bit like whack-a-mole, things pop up. We've talked previously about can pressure in the U.S. self-evidently, there's issues in shipping and freight and availability of labor in places, then you get one that pops up. The price of gas spikes in Europe, and the availability of CO2 comes under pressure. There's a PET plant went offline because it burst into flames in Brazil, etc. So there is a heightened degree of sporadic problems appearing, as well as kind of structural shortages of certain ingredients. But we have global scale, we have global coordination, and we have long-term relationships with many of our ecosystem partners that are allowing us to manage and offset what's going on.  Now, as regards the bottler inventory towards the end of the year, clearly we are working with the bottlers and obviously they can have the comfort and the assurance that they don't necessarily need to hold it in their hands for us to be certain of having it as a system. We obviously ourselves, being the key player in providing the contract, make sure we have enough buffered availability of ingredients and concentrate to make sure the bottlers are going to be in a good position, and we manage that accordingly with them in every year and particularly this one.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. The thoughts around top line and volume recovery, you mentioned earlier for 2022 were helpful. Can you spend a bit more time discussing the pricing environment that you're seeing also in the U.S., other developed markets, and then in the developing markets? Obviously we're seeing a pretty unique spike in commodity costs in terms of the magnitude. So how is your system approaching pricing in this environment given that unique level of increase? And specifically for Coca-Cola itself, is the expectation that pricing can generally fully offset commodity increases on a dollar - for -dollar basis ex any demand elasticity secondary impact given you don't have as much commodity exposure as the entire system but share in the retail pricing moves. And then also maybe can you just detail the competitive pricing environment you're seeing from your key competitors. Thanks.\nJames Quincey : I'm pretty sure that adds up to more than one question, but I'll give it a go, Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: Multipart?\nJames Quincey : Yes, multipart. First point, we, as a matter of course, I mean, there's inflation every year. But we approach it from the point-of-view going. Our brands need to earn the right to adjust their prices each year, whether that be because of the marketing, the innovation, the execution, the investment in the marketplace, or the pressure on COGS, or the pressure on labor inflation. So as you can see from our numbers, I mean, we are pulling all the levers of price, mix, and marketing innovation each and every year. And so that is the starting point as we think forward into 2022.  Secondly, we see the environment of pricing, example the U.S. and largely everywhere else as pretty rational whether that'd be what competitors are doing or what the retailers are doing with their own label brands. And so we see our approach as earning the rights to take the price that creates value for ourselves, the system, and creates value for the retailers and creates value for the consumers. And that's our starting point. Yes, we did take an off-cycle increase in the U.S. Obviously slightly different by brand and by pack, but certainly in the high-single-digits, starting in August, the elasticity is perhaps a little better than they were last time. You may remember that whatever it was, 4 or 5 years ago, we took an off-cycle price increase in the U.S. when there was a very strong adjustments in the logistics market in the U.S. that caused everyone a great deal of problems. And so we passed that through this time, and we will be looking exactly what level our pricing needs to be for 2022. But again, the COGS input -- the COGS push through is a piece of the puzzle. And we certainly intend to earn the right to take the pricing for the brands and the packaging [Indiscernible]. That is true in other parts of the world. Obviously depending -- in the emerging markets on the level inflation in the marketplace, you got some double-digit inflation places where there might be more than one price increase during the year. But in the other developed markets, again, you see this approach of earning the right to take the price based on the brand, the pack, the occasion, the channel, and really driving that through.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Steve Powers with the Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Hey, thanks and good morning. Maybe pivoting back to the volume for a minute. You mentioned obviously that 3 volumes finished ahead of 19 for the first time since the pandemic started which is obviously a happy achievement. I guess what I'm wondering is there's a way to frame where 3Q volumes finished index to 19 in terms of at-home versus away from home or future consumption versus the media consumption. I guess I'm trying to get a better sense conceptually of how much further runway there may be in the away-from-home --. I mean, the consumption side of the business recovering, which obviously has both volume implications but also beneficial price mix implications. Is there a right way to frame -- a right way to think about that from your perspective?\nJames Quincey : Yeah, sure. I'd say look, Q3 is above 2019 in volume. If I look at the mix of the business between away-from-home, and at-home, the at -- the away-from-home has not yet recovered to the same share of mix that it was in 2019. And so of course, implicit in your question is that a tailwind going forward as more of the away-from-home recovers because of either the package or the brand or the occasion that is related to and then -- excuse me. The answer in some extensive is yes. Now, worth bearing in mind, but it's not a snap back, which is what you are seeing. It's not just a function of lock down and when the lock down ends the away from home comes back. I think we are seeing an evolution of the landscape. You're going to see some -- of course, away-from-home is a series of a whole set of sub-channels. You're going to see some of those sub-channels -- well actually, over the last two years -- almost two years now, there's been a reduction in the number of outlets. And so our hypothesis is it will take time to see those outlets re-expand, reappear. And so, just because the lockdown end doesn't mean the outlet reappears. So we will see some of that. But of course there will be some channels that are not yet fully opened. Much of travel and kind of hospitality, there are whole series of sub-channels that are still running far below their 2019 levels. So yes, it's a headwind -- it's a tailwind going into the future, but it's not dependent just on the end of lock-downs. And I think -- well if you imagine a curve, we've got -- the snap-back has happened, and now it's going to be a little more of a smoothing of the curve to recover the rest of the away-from-home, because in part people's habits have changed. Like I said, it's an evolving landscape, I mean, what degree of more permanent at homework here are we going to see. Not quite clear. So I think we've got a big piece of it, let's say half of it back, of the mix, and there's another half to come, but it won't come overnight, it will come over time.\nSteve Powers: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Market.\nNik Modi: Good morning, everyone. James, I was hoping you can give us an update on the [Indiscernible] and all the changes that were made. Do you have all the right people in the right seats now? And how is the organization adjusting to the new decision-making matrix if you could just provide us an update there? Just some of the feedback that I've gotten is that you are still in bulk being worked out, so I'm just trying to get a better understanding of timing on when you think you'll be optimally running under this new network structure.\nJames Quincey : I'm not sure I would ever call it arriving at the destination off to be optimally running because by the time we get there, something else will have changed in the world and we'll need to make some tweaks and evolve. Certainly we stood up the organization in the first quarter and then it was off to a good start. It's very much on track with our expectations. As you say, one would expect that the recent bumps and some kings that need to be worked out and that is what we're going through at the moment. And it's not that all of the change has happened yet. We've been running [Indiscernible] and the marketing team have been running a big agency review through this year. We're coming up on the final decisions on that in the fourth quarter, which will start bringing a structural amount of change next year in the way we interact in our marketing the enabling spend ecosystem. They'll be more change and we will continue to that. So we are focused on working out the bumps and the bits we've already listed up. We'll be bringing more change in terms of how we get the marketing sorted out next year. And I'm sure things will happen in the marketplace that will cause us to want to make further revolutions. But we certainly see that the early signs of how the new organizational model could help us both deal and manage through the crisis, whether it's what we've done on the supply chain or the procurement, but also set us up Ultimately, this is all about being an enabler to give us confidence in driving and delivering on our long-term growth algorithm.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was actually hoping you guys could talk about whether or not you have a competitive advantage during a period of rising input and transportation costs relative to your peers, given your asset-light or asset-right, refranchise model. I guess I'm thinking about this in context of your preliminary outlook for FY '22 as it relates to COGS pressures and then, curious to hear, I guess, how you're working with your bottlers who really are experiencing pretty sharp cost pressures to essentially help them navigate through this tough environment. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Let me start with the system and then work back towards the Company. Obviously, we're working with the bottlers on a collective basis, and an individual and country basis. And I draw the distinction because, on a collective basis, as I mentioned earlier, we have a unit called the Cross Enterprise Procurement Group, which works on behalf the system globally and also the major bottles to procure the key input costs, whether it be resin, aluminum, sweetness, whatever it would happen to be. And that's not just about buying, it's about the hedges, and the pricing and the security of supply. So there is a tremendous activity in coordination with the bottlers on the principal input costs. Then, of course, we work locally with the bottlers is in the countries taking into account all the other factors that go into how we might want to approach pricing whether that's the other costs, the more local costs, logistics, labor, etc. and our agenda for marketing and innovation and execution in our GM and come up with a plan to make sure that we drive that into the marketplace and into the brands or in the right for the pricing that keeps them attractive to the retailers, attractive to the consumers, and drives the business for us. And then obviously within that, the Company itself has a skew to certain ingredients. Because we are asset-light, we are more certain businesses, like the juice business, vertically integrated in the U.S. and with [Indiscernible] in Europe, than necessarily aluminum. So we do have an exposure for costs, which is why we pulled out what we pulled out. I think that competitive advantage is not whether the Company necessarily is asset-light or not, or how only certain commodities we -- ultimately, we're a system with our bottlers where the pricing is taken by the bottler, and then the Company follows that along. I think the advantage is the global scale, the experience in managing through these environments, and the ability to work with the supply ecosystem and create value for the retailers and the consumers.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. That makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hey, everybody, good morning. Can I please follow up on Bonnie's question as it relates to the incidence pricing model and maybe some of the new models that we're putting in recent years? How does it work in this environment? Because the pricing is, of course, still taken by the bottlers, but I guess the relative price inflation -- the relative cost inflation is much higher at the bottler than it might be for yourselves. I understand that you take it as a system, but how does that work from an incidence pricing perspective? Does it still hold in that you were able to follow on wherever the bottler does in the marketplace or are there tweaks being made for what right now seems to be a bit of an abnormal situation?\nJames Quincey : No, the incidence model works as the incidence model, which to be clear is generally speaking, that the Company's revenue on any particular brand or package is a percent of what the bottler is getting, it's not the same percent necessarily on every brand or even every package. But it is a percent. And then all the time this has proven to be a great way of maintaining alignment and shared interest in driving value for the Company and the bottlers local management. When a brand or a package or a channel or occasion grows, it's good for both the bottler and the Company, and if we decide to push on something that's more affordable, it delivers less for the bottler and the Company. So the incidence is proven to be a tremendous vehicle of getting the franchise system to focus on creating value in the marketplace. Overtime in certain environments it puts -- the rest of the cost structure puts a little more pressure on the bottler or a little more pressure on the Company depending on what's going on. But we don't course -- micro course correct the incidence for small problems or in potentially medium problems. We look at a holistic view of making sure the bottling system is structurally sound, is -- has got the right capabilities, the right ownership, and the right capacity to invest in the marketplace. So it's something completely pushes the thing on -- off track. We're in a different situation. Otherwise, we and the bottlers don't manage for the short term. We do manage the short-term, but we think about it in the context of where we're going long term and manage through short-term effects.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Andrea Teixeira with the J.P. Morgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. James, I wanted to go back to your pricing commentary. If you can talk to your ability to continue to take pricing, or if the actions you took so far, including the one you alluded to in North America in August, will suffice to mitigate the additional mid-single-digit cost pressures in 2022. And how do you see the balance in between bringing back promotions to historical levels into 2022 for the at-home consumption. Thank you.\nJames Quincey : Thanks for that. Obviously, we're not at the stage of providing an outlook on pricing and promotion levels in 2022. We'll do that when we get to February. Certainly what we did in North America address the immediate 2021 issues in North America as we did in other parts of the world. Wherever it was in the world, we would have addressed the cost issues and the brand pricing issues wherever we were. Again, I think the important thing -- the pricing approach is to own the rights, to take the pricing for the brand. They own that -- their equity owns the right of pricing and that's the combination of bearing in mind the cost inflation -- the input cost inflation, the labor costs, the logistics costs, what we need to invest in marketing, what we need to invest in innovation, what we need to invest in execution, and what we need to invest in Cola's and routes-to-market are not all goals in to the equation of taking the pricing that we have earned to take. And that is the same balancing equation that we will look at for 2022.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Carlos Laboy with HSBC.\nCarlos Laboy: Yes. Good morning, everyone. James, you mentioned strong U.S. pricing several times and in our southwestern and in U.S. markets more recently, we also saw a major step-up in revenue management execution from pre -pandemic levels. It's really sophisticated price pack structures that we're seeing. Can you give us a more broad-based North American assessment of how you see the market development capability of the U.S. system improving over the next couple of years? I guess, what does the system going to be doing differently to keep driving this market development capability forward?\nJames Quincey : Yeah, sure. Well, thank you for those observations, Carlos, on the -- resuming taxes or something like that. As you as you well know, as a long-term reserve of Latin America, we certainly have been trying to fuse together what the best of what the U.S. system does with some important thinking from Latin America on our GM, and on the ground up and down the street execution. As we look forward into the U.S. clearly we're trying to bring a combination of more investment in the marketing of brands, more innovation targeted to the marketplace. That with the increasing use of RGM to be more sophisticated in the price and the mix opportunity, but also back with ongoing improvements in the execution capability, not just in the larger stores or with the larger away-from-home partners, but also up and down the street with the small stores. And really being within an arm's reach desire not just, perhaps, an arm's reach of job, but within a clicks reach of desire, and I think the system is continuing to backdrop as we go forward.\nCarlos Laboy: Thank you.\nJames Quincey : Sure.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.\nRob Ottenstein: Yes. Thank you very much. First, just a quick point of clarification. If you could give the breakout of price mix in LATAM how much was price mix and channel. And then my more substantive question, some really great progress on the free cash flow side, significantly higher than your initial guidance. Can you talk about some of the drivers there? Are you where you need to be in terms of cash conversion at this point? And are these levels sustainable? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I'll do the free -- I'll do the price mix, and then John can take the flowers and the lowers on doubling the free cash flow in the last few years. Price mix in Latin America, clearly there is a big component of rate in the third quarter, and part of that is driven by inflationary pricing in Argentina. But in the quarter channel and price mix -- sorry. Channel and package were both positive to mix as was the timing of some of the deductions. And so yes, it is, Rob, normally. I think particularly in the [Indiscernible] -- I mean, it is generally true for the Company that don't over-rotate the quarterly pricing, particularly in emerging markets, where they can be a tremendous amount of volatility because obviously, we're quite far back in supply chain. So I would encourage looking at places like Latin America on a more multi-quarter basis, given the volatility that one can get in terms of a price for mix, given where we are in terms of what ships where, but generally speaking, there's a mainly operational price mix and then there's a little piece that's inflation in Argentina. John?\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, James. On the free cash flow, clearly pleased with the progress we've made, looking forward a couple of observations on our free cash flow conversion. Our long-term algorithm has free cash flow conversion of 90% to 95% range. And I still believe that's the right level for us to be pitching us. This year is better than that. And due to some specific items through the year, our marketing accruals in '21 were much higher than '20 as the marketing spend returns to 2019 levels. Our incentive compensation was down for obvious reasons in 2020 due to the pandemic impact. We -- as I mentioned on the call earlier, we anticipate some headwinds on Forex going into '22. Taking all that into account, I would expect us to be still able to deliver against the range that we've outlined in the long-term algorithm. Some of the drivers, Robert, in the last couple of years, we've made a lot of progress on working capital. We've talked about that in the past. We continue to do so in a strange way, the one area that we are below how I would like to be is on inventory, but in a paradoxical where that's been actually a good thing to have more buffer around the world. And so in the immediate short-term, I like it that way. But it's an area that we will continue to attack over time. In a number of areas.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Sean King with UBS.\nSean King: Thanks for the question. I'd like to get your thoughts and some of the puts and takes to your bottling systems, DSD capabilities in the context of some of the pressure points that other CPGs are having and keeping store shelves stocked, particularly around the coming holiday season. Is it safe to say you maybe absorbing some higher costs, or the potential for share gains?\nJames Quincey : Clearly there's some pressure in the marketplace in terms of logistical capacity. And obviously with the holiday season tending to see demand go up, that's going to come into shop or focus as we go into the next few months. We are well set up, I think we are advantaged competitively. I would like to see us, as you say, make gains in not just the share of the visible inventory, but in the share of the sell-out as well. We will see some of that is limited by some of the supply constraints. If we want to talk about the U.S., it's still tight on cans, it's still tight on hot-filled resin. And so there is some limitations to what's coming out there but clearly, as we sell lots of different brands in lots of different packages, we have the opportunity to make sure we can get the shelves full, if not with absolutely everything we'd love to see on the shelves, at least the shelves will be full with the vast majority of the things we would like to see on the shelves and we can manage through it. If there's tremendous demand and shortage in supply across, one logically starts to wonder whether you need all the promotions that one can think of. So there is a balancing of if it costs slightly more to get stuff there because there are shortages, then you don't need as much promotion. So I think there is a lot -- there are a set of puts and takes here which will allow us -- the system to have a good holiday season.\nSean King: Great. Thank you.\nJames Quincey : Sure.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. I just want to follow up on this outlook for mid-single digit inflation going into next year. Conceptually spot prices are decidedly higher than mid-single-digits. Perhaps I'm reading that dynamic wrong. But if I'm not, is it simply a function of your global scale, your ability to source [Indiscernible] better rates prevailing? You just noted that inventory has been training on free cash flow, but that's actually a buffer, which has helped you actually in this tight inventory position. I guess any perspective around that would be helpful because this is a dynamic we've been seeing where spot is actually quite a bit worse than how companies are looking at the go-forward and I'm just curious on perhaps why that is the case and why you might stand out in this regard. Thanks so much.\nJames Quincey : Yeah, 2 things to bear in mind. Let me start with the Company and talk about the total system. We the Company obviously skew, as I mentioned earlier, in terms of the commodities that flow through our P&L most directly. And bear in mind, the biggest commodity that flows through the Company's P&L is actually juice -- the cost of buying of juice, whose spot price has not shot up. It was not projected to shoot up as much next year as this year. That has obviously increased in '21 over '20. But it's looking more in the range that we've talked about going into 2022. So from the Company's perspective, our biggest commodity is not what the spot price of it for next year. It's not wildly projected to be out of line with what we're talking about in terms of increases. Then obviously we bought -- we buy a whole set of other things, which are expected to go up. So I do want to also encourage you to remember that we don't buy heavily on spot. That is not our objective. As I told earlier, we given our scale in most commodities, especially the system, we look to buy on a long-term basis, not just hedging on a long-term basis or a multi-quarter basis, but buying with partners and making commitments on a long-term basis too. And so we don't go up and down with the stock market on a day-to-day basis. And that means that the system also has the ability to lock-in while still inflation rate in 2022, whether we're talking about PET or metals, or sugars, or corn syrup. They're all going up in 2022, but if not, the sky is falling.\nChris Carey: Okay. Thanks so much.\nJames Quincey: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question or final question is from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone and congratulations on further progress in the quarter. James, I want to pivot to the energy drink category and your broader strategy there as performance energy brands have accelerated industry growth and taking share from brands like Monster. Clearly your stake in Monster underpins the Company's broader strategy though you've also obviously rolled out Coke Energy, AHA with caffeine, you're rolling out Costa RTD coffees in certain markets. I'd like to get your updated thoughts on, 1, how the category is evolving, and, 2, your overall level of satisfaction with your energy drink strategy, particularly some of the niche and upcoming brands that are gaining market share from brands like Monster. Thank you.\nJames Quincey : Yes, sure. Let me distinguish clearly between the energy drink category and the energy or recharge need stake, as you mentioned the series of other brands as well. As it relates to the energy drink category, obviously, we have a very successful partnership with Monster that has created tremendous value for us, for the bottlers, and in particular, for Monster. And I think that's driven the losses. Yes, there have been in the U.S. some recent competitive entries, which seem to be both expanding the category and taking some share. Obviously, you can -- you see in their numbers, I know they haven't announced it this quarter, but at least for the numbers they've announced for the first half so far this year, you can see they continue to grow strongly this year on top of growing last year, so there's a lot of success and I'm sure they will talk about on their call how they're responding to marketplace dynamics. And obviously, we, the system, look forward to continuing to drive success with that partnership. As it relates to the broader energy needs state or recharge needs state of consumers, Clearly, that's growing. It has been growing pre - Covid, and it's still growing whether that be, as you say, ready-to-drink coffees or some of the caffeinated waters, we see a lot of focus and an opportunity for growth there. Ready -- Costa Ready-to-Drink has done well where we've launched it. AHA has done well in the launch in China. Certainly there's caffeine being introduced to a number of different beverages here in the U.S. And so we do see ultimately the recharge needs [Indiscernible]. Whether that's satisfied with an energy drink or Coke Classic or AHA with caffeine or a Fair like chocolate milk shake that has been a long-term driver of growth in the beverage industry and we expect it to remain so.\nKevin Grundy: Very good. Thank you.\nJames Quincey : You're welcome. Okay. I think that was the last question. So to summarize, we're confident that as the world begins to move beyond the pandemic, we'll deliver against our long-term growth model consistently and sustainably over time. And I'm putting our new marketing model interaction to shaping a strong and enduring innovation pipeline from our digital initiatives to our important sustainability agenda. We are working in alignment with our bottling partners, with the power of our people and we're poised to drive growth at scale for the entire system for years to come. So thank you for your interest, your investment in our Company, and for joining us this morning. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Quincey",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. And good morning, everyone. After a strong first half of the year, we saw continued momentum in our business in the third quarter. While the global recovery remains asynchronous, our people and our system are leveraging the learning that deliver good results and emerge stronger. And while markets are at different stages of reopening around the world, our local businesses have been increasingly resilient through restrictions and lock-downs. As a result, our underlying volumes have accelerated on a two-year basis with quarterly growth versus 2019 for the first time since the pandemic began. This improvement has been supported by our transformation agenda, which set us on a path to more efficient and effective marketing, as well as more disciplined and intelligent innovation. We are investing accordingly behind our portfolio of loved brands and are seeing signs of early traction. Given strong results year-to-date, and increased visibility into the rest of the year, we expect to deliver organic revenue at the high end of our previously provided range and are raising bottom line and cash flow guidance for the full year. This morning, I'll provide a business update and discuss how our network organization is executing well in this dynamic environment. Then John will discuss our financials and raised guidance and some early considerations for 2022.  In the first half of 2021, mobility and business levels improved in many markets, as lock-downs eased and vaccinations increased. The recovery has not been a straight-line, and continues to be uneven around the world. But despite the asynchronous recovery, in the third quarter, our volumes surpassed 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic began. Although not yet back to 2019 levels as a percent of our business, we saw sequential improvement in away from home volumes on a two-year basis, as consumers return to many of their former routines. At-home volumes also showed ongoing strength even as away-from-home channels improved. The quarter was off to a promising start in July, but the Delta variant impacted several markets, resulting in a softer August, followed by improvement in September, as the variant began to lessen in some of our key markets. The pandemic continues to be a key factor across our operating environment, in addition to the ongoing pressure points in our supply chain. However, our network system is leveraging the learning's from the past 18 months, sharing best practices and skillfully executing by applying Revenue Growth Management, and working our supply chain leavers to capitalize on the strength of our brands and mitigate disruptions. The industry is growing and we continue to gain shares. Our overall value share improved year-on-year, and remains above 2019 levels. We're pleased to report gains across categories, as well as both within at home and away from home channels. Our operating units are combining the power of scale with a deep knowledge required to win locally in an environment that remains dynamic. So diving a little into the key drivers across geographies, starting with Asia-Pacific. In China, media investments across categories are yielding promising signs. Results in the quarter reflect strict COVID lockdowns and some weather-related disruption in August, while September marked sequential improvements. Japan state of emergency was lifted at the end of the quarter after consumers spent the majority of 2021 in lock-down. Strengthened execution across our teams and innovation has helped lessen impacts, and our consumer base has grown beyond 2019 levels. In India, we participated strongly in the recovery by focusing on affordability and omni -channel growth through e-B2B. We grew both trademark coke and local icon Thums-up using effective marketing activations. We had share gains in ASEAN and the South Pacific Operating Unit, despite pandemic-related restrictions in all of its top markets.  Our investments behind Sparkling flavors and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, will continue to create value when lock-downs are lifted.  In EMEA, in Europe, we gained value share across nearly all categories as restrictions eased, while weather, a slower recovery in tourism, and the delta surge had an impact on global campaigns to key brands including Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Sprite, and Fanta helped drive sparkling share. As vaccinations accelerated in Eurasia and the Middle East, we maintained momentum through effective revenue growth management initiatives, resulting in top-line that expanded faster than the macro environment in those top markets. Our results in Africa were balanced across regions and categories during this quarter, despite a third wave of the pandemic that resulted in targeted lockdowns. Vaccination rates remained on the low side relative to the rest of the world. And our focus remains on affordability and single-serve packs as mobility increases in countries like Egypt and Nigeria. We maintained strong momentum in North America despite the COVID resurgence in many states leading to stalling consumer sentiment and supply chain challenges that resulted in both missed opportunities and incremental costs. The at-home channel remains healthy, and although away-from-home growth accelerated early in the quarter, labor shortages have constrained capacity with some on-premise customers. Recent price actions to offset higher input costs have been effective with lower-than-expected price elasticities to date, and promotional levels remain below 2019.  In Latin America, successful commercial initiatives, including affordability packs, increased availability of our key products, and strong customer execution in both modern and traditional trade, drove volume growth across all major markets amidst an improving COVID environment. Improvement in single-serve mix, some pricing actions, and connecting brands strategies to on-premise customers to drive further recovery in the away-from-home channel all contributed to strong price mix. Within Global Ventures, Costa benefited from retail store recovery as the UK re-opens. With improved reach and frequency from its enhanced loyalty program Costa continues to expand across platforms into new markets in partnership with our bottlers, resulting in growing brand awareness. Our Bottling Investments Group performance was driven by India and the Philippines. BIG saw strict lockdowns in several markets, as well as rising inflation, but has continued to see share gains year-to-date in South Africa. Adverse impacts have been well-managed through package and category mix improvements along with cost controls preserving progress on our operating margins during the pandemic. Global category teams are working with our operating units to build an engine to drive effective marketing scale and innovation, which we amplified across the world. Highlights from this quarter include Coca-Cola Zero Sugar's new recipe has rolled out in more than 50 countries and has had accelerated growth in the last 3 months. In September, trademark Coca-Cola's new global brand philosophy Real Magic was unveiled featuring a refreshed look for our iconic logo, the Hug. The Real Magic platform takes a digital first approach and our executions feature a range of experiences that are tailored to Gen Z and leverage passion points like gaming and music to attract a new generation of drinkers. Sparkling flavors gained share in the quarter driven by investments in targeted brand country combinations with a focus on occasions and Zero Sugar offerings. In China, Sprite volume growth was accelerated by leveraging the global Let's Be Clear campaign during summer music festivals. Similarly, the 'What The Fanta' campaign focuses on snacking, and is driving growth across all key metrics in Europe. The hydration, sports, tea and coffee categories are seeing a good return on spend behind global brands. AHA's expansion into new markets this year, has shown flexibility to adapt to local customer and consumer needs. In Advanced hydration, functional benefits have helped to stretch brand power and drive share for Aquarius, as it becomes more of a global brand. Tea and coffee have had success with FUZE tea in Europe on both Ayataka and Costa, ready-to-drink in Japan. There is an opportunity to recover share in Georgia coffee as the at work occasion returns. Our juice portfolio gained share this quarter helped by Minute Maid Pulpy performance in China, Del Valle via growth in Latin America, and strong results across brands in Africa. In dairy, Fairlife is set to become the first billion dollar brand in our dairy portfolio and has recently launched its joint venture in China. Our experimentation with Topo Chico Hard Seltzer is expanding and we're gathering valuable insights globally, including the importance of building the category in regions where it is nascent. We are seeing encouraging performance where the flavored alcoholic beverage category is growing rapidly, and we have on-shelf presence. Molson Coors recently announced the national roll out of Topo Chico Hard Seltzer in the U.S. with new Margarita flavors. We also recently announced an expansion of our relationship with Molson Coors to bring the brand into Canada. As the pandemic recovery has progressed, we've seen challenges and disruptions in many parts of the world, in addition to inflationary forces that could persist. We have years of experience in dealing with these types of environments, and are enhancing our strong capabilities that enable us to do so. We are using the crucial tool of Revenue Growth Management in its many forms, and are executing in collaboration with our bottling partners. We continue to refine our ability to optimize price and package offerings, according to occasions, brands, and channels, striking the right balance between premiumization and affordability. In addition to streamlining our portfolio, targeting more disciplined innovation, intelligent experimentation, and transforming our marketing model, we're also building strong digital capabilities. We have taken an enterprise approach and are progressing on the roll out of multi-category Ebb3 platforms with our bottlers globally. As an example [Indiscernible] is seeing strong growth outside home market of Latin America, and that's more than 50 categories contributing meaningfully to it's sales on the platform. Additionally, we are delivering outsized growth with powerful, and growing omni -channel presence across regions. We're driving incremental instance with partners like foodservice aggregators. North America, for example, has grown attachment rates by mid single-digits with third-party and restaurant owned platforms. And we're gaining share in e-commerce, with significant wins in Eurasia and hitting record levels in Latin America this quarter. I'll also like to reiterate the sustainability is an integral part of our business strategy and it's a key driver of future growth. For 2018 when we launched World Without Waste to today, we've made much progress against our pillars to design, collect, and partner to deliver against our goals. Our commitment to reduce waste globally is also closely connected to our climate ambitions, collecting more empty packages, using more recycled material, light-weighting our bottles, and using plant-based materials always we are embracing the collective efforts to decarbonize the global economy. We strive to provide stakeholders with clear progress against our goals through our annual business in ESG report and World Without Waste report, including using the Global Reporting Initiative, SASB, and TCFD reporting frameworks, as well as disclosures through other publicly available avenues like CDP and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. We continuously revisit our ESG reporting and disclosures to ensure our leadership position. We do not take our responsibility lightly, and we carefully and thoroughly [Indiscernible] long-term objectives with our system partners, and only commit to new goals with a clear, actionable plan. To ensure we remain transparent on responses to this evolving landscape, we'd like to invite you to join us for our virtual ESG event on November the 3rd, where key business and sustainability leaders will provide an update on our initiatives, and answer your questions. As we look at our year-to-date performances in the system, it's clear that we are emerging stronger from the pandemic, delivering solid results under more network structure. Now, I'll turn the call to John, to discuss our third quarter results, our updated outlook, and some initial thoughts about 2022. Sure. Good morning, Bryan. Firstly, we clearly have been executing [Indiscernible] emerging stronger strategy. And you can see that coming through, we've called out that the third quarter was the first quarter to be growing versus -- in a full quarter versus 2019. So a sequential improvement, as we've been going through this year from the first half, which was below 2019 to the third quarter, which was above it. So it's clearly sequential improvement coming through as we have adapted our ability to cope with the ups and downs of the lockdowns and the re-openings. Now, in the quarter as you say, we called out that July started well, and then August was softer as there were more lock downs and then September was better. When you think about where that's going in the fourth quarter and into next year, clearly the fact that we have raised or clarified guidance on revenue to be the top end of the range should lead you to feel confident that we see visibility in the downhill of the rest of this year. October has started strong and in line with expectations so we feel good. The momentum is there. I've made the caveat, as many other people have done through COVID, that who knows what could happen in the downhill with variants and with lock downs. But at the moment what we see is the momentum is there, we feel good about our top-line guidance for the year and October backs up that statement. And then as it goes through 2022, obviously too early to call the full year next year, and we will do so in February. But again, in the comments, in the press release, in John's comments, we said we feel that we think we have momentum in the business. Again, the caveats of who knows what will happen with variance and potential lock downs but we do see the world emerging from the crisis a bit like an earthquake. You get more aftershocks, but the consequent aftershocks tend to be smaller than the early ones. And that's how we see '22. We feel there's good momentum and the strategy is working and it's getting us back on track. I'm not sure I used with the word isolated last quarter, but I know what you mean. Look, firstly, we have a lot of capability of managing through crises. This may be a unique and global one, but most managers and leaders at Coke have, sometime in their career, managed a part of the world or a country that's gone through severe dislocation. And so we have built capability over the years to manage through this. And in the mean -- in particular, in the supply chains, organizations of the Company, and with the bottlers, And so we have strong capabilities, we look for long-term partnerships with the ecosystem of the supply chains, whether that's imports, materials, or logistics. We also act as a system in a number of regards. We have something called the Cross Enterprise Procurement Group, which buys key commodities on behalf of the Company and the bottlers, so there's a great deal of coordination between ourselves and the bottlers. In terms of the problems it's a bit like whack-a-mole, things pop up. We've talked previously about can pressure in the U.S. self-evidently, there's issues in shipping and freight and availability of labor in places, then you get one that pops up. The price of gas spikes in Europe, and the availability of CO2 comes under pressure. There's a PET plant went offline because it burst into flames in Brazil, etc. So there is a heightened degree of sporadic problems appearing, as well as kind of structural shortages of certain ingredients. But we have global scale, we have global coordination, and we have long-term relationships with many of our ecosystem partners that are allowing us to manage and offset what's going on.  Now, as regards the bottler inventory towards the end of the year, clearly we are working with the bottlers and obviously they can have the comfort and the assurance that they don't necessarily need to hold it in their hands for us to be certain of having it as a system. We obviously ourselves, being the key player in providing the contract, make sure we have enough buffered availability of ingredients and concentrate to make sure the bottlers are going to be in a good position, and we manage that accordingly with them in every year and particularly this one. I'm pretty sure that adds up to more than one question, but I'll give it a go, Dara. Yes, multipart. First point, we, as a matter of course, I mean, there's inflation every year. But we approach it from the point-of-view going. Our brands need to earn the right to adjust their prices each year, whether that be because of the marketing, the innovation, the execution, the investment in the marketplace, or the pressure on COGS, or the pressure on labor inflation. So as you can see from our numbers, I mean, we are pulling all the levers of price, mix, and marketing innovation each and every year. And so that is the starting point as we think forward into 2022.  Secondly, we see the environment of pricing, example the U.S. and largely everywhere else as pretty rational whether that'd be what competitors are doing or what the retailers are doing with their own label brands. And so we see our approach as earning the rights to take the price that creates value for ourselves, the system, and creates value for the retailers and creates value for the consumers. And that's our starting point. Yes, we did take an off-cycle increase in the U.S. Obviously slightly different by brand and by pack, but certainly in the high-single-digits, starting in August, the elasticity is perhaps a little better than they were last time. You may remember that whatever it was, 4 or 5 years ago, we took an off-cycle price increase in the U.S. when there was a very strong adjustments in the logistics market in the U.S. that caused everyone a great deal of problems. And so we passed that through this time, and we will be looking exactly what level our pricing needs to be for 2022. But again, the COGS input -- the COGS push through is a piece of the puzzle. And we certainly intend to earn the right to take the pricing for the brands and the packaging [Indiscernible]. That is true in other parts of the world. Obviously depending -- in the emerging markets on the level inflation in the marketplace, you got some double-digit inflation places where there might be more than one price increase during the year. But in the other developed markets, again, you see this approach of earning the right to take the price based on the brand, the pack, the occasion, the channel, and really driving that through. Yeah, sure. I'd say look, Q3 is above 2019 in volume. If I look at the mix of the business between away-from-home, and at-home, the at -- the away-from-home has not yet recovered to the same share of mix that it was in 2019. And so of course, implicit in your question is that a tailwind going forward as more of the away-from-home recovers because of either the package or the brand or the occasion that is related to and then -- excuse me. The answer in some extensive is yes. Now, worth bearing in mind, but it's not a snap back, which is what you are seeing. It's not just a function of lock down and when the lock down ends the away from home comes back. I think we are seeing an evolution of the landscape. You're going to see some -- of course, away-from-home is a series of a whole set of sub-channels. You're going to see some of those sub-channels -- well actually, over the last two years -- almost two years now, there's been a reduction in the number of outlets. And so our hypothesis is it will take time to see those outlets re-expand, reappear. And so, just because the lockdown end doesn't mean the outlet reappears. So we will see some of that. But of course there will be some channels that are not yet fully opened. Much of travel and kind of hospitality, there are whole series of sub-channels that are still running far below their 2019 levels. So yes, it's a headwind -- it's a tailwind going into the future, but it's not dependent just on the end of lock-downs. And I think -- well if you imagine a curve, we've got -- the snap-back has happened, and now it's going to be a little more of a smoothing of the curve to recover the rest of the away-from-home, because in part people's habits have changed. Like I said, it's an evolving landscape, I mean, what degree of more permanent at homework here are we going to see. Not quite clear. So I think we've got a big piece of it, let's say half of it back, of the mix, and there's another half to come, but it won't come overnight, it will come over time. I'm not sure I would ever call it arriving at the destination off to be optimally running because by the time we get there, something else will have changed in the world and we'll need to make some tweaks and evolve. Certainly we stood up the organization in the first quarter and then it was off to a good start. It's very much on track with our expectations. As you say, one would expect that the recent bumps and some kings that need to be worked out and that is what we're going through at the moment. And it's not that all of the change has happened yet. We've been running [Indiscernible] and the marketing team have been running a big agency review through this year. We're coming up on the final decisions on that in the fourth quarter, which will start bringing a structural amount of change next year in the way we interact in our marketing the enabling spend ecosystem. They'll be more change and we will continue to that. So we are focused on working out the bumps and the bits we've already listed up. We'll be bringing more change in terms of how we get the marketing sorted out next year. And I'm sure things will happen in the marketplace that will cause us to want to make further revolutions. But we certainly see that the early signs of how the new organizational model could help us both deal and manage through the crisis, whether it's what we've done on the supply chain or the procurement, but also set us up Ultimately, this is all about being an enabler to give us confidence in driving and delivering on our long-term growth algorithm. Yeah. Let me start with the system and then work back towards the Company. Obviously, we're working with the bottlers on a collective basis, and an individual and country basis. And I draw the distinction because, on a collective basis, as I mentioned earlier, we have a unit called the Cross Enterprise Procurement Group, which works on behalf the system globally and also the major bottles to procure the key input costs, whether it be resin, aluminum, sweetness, whatever it would happen to be. And that's not just about buying, it's about the hedges, and the pricing and the security of supply. So there is a tremendous activity in coordination with the bottlers on the principal input costs. Then, of course, we work locally with the bottlers is in the countries taking into account all the other factors that go into how we might want to approach pricing whether that's the other costs, the more local costs, logistics, labor, etc. and our agenda for marketing and innovation and execution in our GM and come up with a plan to make sure that we drive that into the marketplace and into the brands or in the right for the pricing that keeps them attractive to the retailers, attractive to the consumers, and drives the business for us. And then obviously within that, the Company itself has a skew to certain ingredients. Because we are asset-light, we are more certain businesses, like the juice business, vertically integrated in the U.S. and with [Indiscernible] in Europe, than necessarily aluminum. So we do have an exposure for costs, which is why we pulled out what we pulled out. I think that competitive advantage is not whether the Company necessarily is asset-light or not, or how only certain commodities we -- ultimately, we're a system with our bottlers where the pricing is taken by the bottler, and then the Company follows that along. I think the advantage is the global scale, the experience in managing through these environments, and the ability to work with the supply ecosystem and create value for the retailers and the consumers. No, the incidence model works as the incidence model, which to be clear is generally speaking, that the Company's revenue on any particular brand or package is a percent of what the bottler is getting, it's not the same percent necessarily on every brand or even every package. But it is a percent. And then all the time this has proven to be a great way of maintaining alignment and shared interest in driving value for the Company and the bottlers local management. When a brand or a package or a channel or occasion grows, it's good for both the bottler and the Company, and if we decide to push on something that's more affordable, it delivers less for the bottler and the Company. So the incidence is proven to be a tremendous vehicle of getting the franchise system to focus on creating value in the marketplace. Overtime in certain environments it puts -- the rest of the cost structure puts a little more pressure on the bottler or a little more pressure on the Company depending on what's going on. But we don't course -- micro course correct the incidence for small problems or in potentially medium problems. We look at a holistic view of making sure the bottling system is structurally sound, is -- has got the right capabilities, the right ownership, and the right capacity to invest in the marketplace. So it's something completely pushes the thing on -- off track. We're in a different situation. Otherwise, we and the bottlers don't manage for the short term. We do manage the short-term, but we think about it in the context of where we're going long term and manage through short-term effects. Thanks for that. Obviously, we're not at the stage of providing an outlook on pricing and promotion levels in 2022. We'll do that when we get to February. Certainly what we did in North America address the immediate 2021 issues in North America as we did in other parts of the world. Wherever it was in the world, we would have addressed the cost issues and the brand pricing issues wherever we were. Again, I think the important thing -- the pricing approach is to own the rights, to take the pricing for the brand. They own that -- their equity owns the right of pricing and that's the combination of bearing in mind the cost inflation -- the input cost inflation, the labor costs, the logistics costs, what we need to invest in marketing, what we need to invest in innovation, what we need to invest in execution, and what we need to invest in Cola's and routes-to-market are not all goals in to the equation of taking the pricing that we have earned to take. And that is the same balancing equation that we will look at for 2022. Sure. Yeah, sure. Well, thank you for those observations, Carlos, on the -- resuming taxes or something like that. As you as you well know, as a long-term reserve of Latin America, we certainly have been trying to fuse together what the best of what the U.S. system does with some important thinking from Latin America on our GM, and on the ground up and down the street execution. As we look forward into the U.S. clearly we're trying to bring a combination of more investment in the marketing of brands, more innovation targeted to the marketplace. That with the increasing use of RGM to be more sophisticated in the price and the mix opportunity, but also back with ongoing improvements in the execution capability, not just in the larger stores or with the larger away-from-home partners, but also up and down the street with the small stores. And really being within an arm's reach desire not just, perhaps, an arm's reach of job, but within a clicks reach of desire, and I think the system is continuing to backdrop as we go forward. Sure. Sure. I'll do the free -- I'll do the price mix, and then John can take the flowers and the lowers on doubling the free cash flow in the last few years. Price mix in Latin America, clearly there is a big component of rate in the third quarter, and part of that is driven by inflationary pricing in Argentina. But in the quarter channel and price mix -- sorry. Channel and package were both positive to mix as was the timing of some of the deductions. And so yes, it is, Rob, normally. I think particularly in the [Indiscernible] -- I mean, it is generally true for the Company that don't over-rotate the quarterly pricing, particularly in emerging markets, where they can be a tremendous amount of volatility because obviously, we're quite far back in supply chain. So I would encourage looking at places like Latin America on a more multi-quarter basis, given the volatility that one can get in terms of a price for mix, given where we are in terms of what ships where, but generally speaking, there's a mainly operational price mix and then there's a little piece that's inflation in Argentina. John? Clearly there's some pressure in the marketplace in terms of logistical capacity. And obviously with the holiday season tending to see demand go up, that's going to come into shop or focus as we go into the next few months. We are well set up, I think we are advantaged competitively. I would like to see us, as you say, make gains in not just the share of the visible inventory, but in the share of the sell-out as well. We will see some of that is limited by some of the supply constraints. If we want to talk about the U.S., it's still tight on cans, it's still tight on hot-filled resin. And so there is some limitations to what's coming out there but clearly, as we sell lots of different brands in lots of different packages, we have the opportunity to make sure we can get the shelves full, if not with absolutely everything we'd love to see on the shelves, at least the shelves will be full with the vast majority of the things we would like to see on the shelves and we can manage through it. If there's tremendous demand and shortage in supply across, one logically starts to wonder whether you need all the promotions that one can think of. So there is a balancing of if it costs slightly more to get stuff there because there are shortages, then you don't need as much promotion. So I think there is a lot -- there are a set of puts and takes here which will allow us -- the system to have a good holiday season. Sure. Yeah, 2 things to bear in mind. Let me start with the Company and talk about the total system. We the Company obviously skew, as I mentioned earlier, in terms of the commodities that flow through our P&L most directly. And bear in mind, the biggest commodity that flows through the Company's P&L is actually juice -- the cost of buying of juice, whose spot price has not shot up. It was not projected to shoot up as much next year as this year. That has obviously increased in '21 over '20. But it's looking more in the range that we've talked about going into 2022. So from the Company's perspective, our biggest commodity is not what the spot price of it for next year. It's not wildly projected to be out of line with what we're talking about in terms of increases. Then obviously we bought -- we buy a whole set of other things, which are expected to go up. So I do want to also encourage you to remember that we don't buy heavily on spot. That is not our objective. As I told earlier, we given our scale in most commodities, especially the system, we look to buy on a long-term basis, not just hedging on a long-term basis or a multi-quarter basis, but buying with partners and making commitments on a long-term basis too. And so we don't go up and down with the stock market on a day-to-day basis. And that means that the system also has the ability to lock-in while still inflation rate in 2022, whether we're talking about PET or metals, or sugars, or corn syrup. They're all going up in 2022, but if not, the sky is falling. Sure. Yes, sure. Let me distinguish clearly between the energy drink category and the energy or recharge need stake, as you mentioned the series of other brands as well. As it relates to the energy drink category, obviously, we have a very successful partnership with Monster that has created tremendous value for us, for the bottlers, and in particular, for Monster. And I think that's driven the losses. Yes, there have been in the U.S. some recent competitive entries, which seem to be both expanding the category and taking some share. Obviously, you can -- you see in their numbers, I know they haven't announced it this quarter, but at least for the numbers they've announced for the first half so far this year, you can see they continue to grow strongly this year on top of growing last year, so there's a lot of success and I'm sure they will talk about on their call how they're responding to marketplace dynamics. And obviously, we, the system, look forward to continuing to drive success with that partnership. As it relates to the broader energy needs state or recharge needs state of consumers, Clearly, that's growing. It has been growing pre - Covid, and it's still growing whether that be, as you say, ready-to-drink coffees or some of the caffeinated waters, we see a lot of focus and an opportunity for growth there. Ready -- Costa Ready-to-Drink has done well where we've launched it. AHA has done well in the launch in China. Certainly there's caffeine being introduced to a number of different beverages here in the U.S. And so we do see ultimately the recharge needs [Indiscernible]. Whether that's satisfied with an energy drink or Coke Classic or AHA with caffeine or a Fair like chocolate milk shake that has been a long-term driver of growth in the beverage industry and we expect it to remain so. You're welcome. Okay. I think that was the last question. So to summarize, we're confident that as the world begins to move beyond the pandemic, we'll deliver against our long-term growth model consistently and sustainably over time. And I'm putting our new marketing model interaction to shaping a strong and enduring innovation pipeline from our digital initiatives to our important sustainability agenda. We are working in alignment with our bottling partners, with the power of our people and we're poised to drive growth at scale for the entire system for years to come. So thank you for your interest, your investment in our Company, and for joining us this morning. Thank you."

            "name": "John Murphy",
            "content": "Thank you [Indiscernible]. in the third quarter, we delivered another set of strong results, building on the momentum we've seen this year. Our Q3 organic revenue was up 14% with concentrate shipments up 8% on price mix of 6%, price mix was led by strong pricing in North America and Latin America and further improvement in away-from-home channels in many markets. Unit case growth was 6%, with absolute unit cases ahead of 2019 levels for the first time this year, and a sequential improvement versus the second quarter on a 2 year basis. Concentrate shipments outpaced unit cases in the quarter due to inventory builds by some of our bottling partners to manage through near-term disruption. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 160 basis points versus prior year, driven by pricing in the market, positive mix, and timing of shipments. Despite some pressure points in the supply chain, we're successfully pulling the levers at our disposal to mitigate impacts to the best of our ability. We continue to invest as many markets reopen during the quarter and significantly stepped up our marketing dollar versus prior year. As a result, our comparable operating margin compressed by 40 basis points year-over-year more than offsetting the flow through from the strong top line. Below operating income, we saw some leverage come through from the other income line and a lower tax rate for the quarter that was driven by our updated effective tax rate for the full year to 18.6% from 19.1% previously. Putting all this together, third quarter comparable earnings per share of $0.65 was an increase of 18% year-over-year, including a 3 point benefit from currency. We also delivered strong year-to-date free cash flow of $8.5 billion. Given our strong results and with 1 quarter remaining, we have good visibility and are raising guidance for the full year. We now expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 13% to 14%, which is at the high end of our previously provided range, and comparable EPS growth of 15% to 17% in 2021. Our updated guidance for free cash flow of approximately $10.5 billion represents significant progress over the past few years, and particularly during the COVID era. This progress is further dimensionalize as follows: We expect to achieve this year a dividend payout ratio below our long-term target of 75% of free cash flow for the first time since 2015. We anticipate delivering another year of free cash flow conversion above 100%. And finally, our expected free cash flow has almost doubled since 2017. Our improving cash flow position will allow us to be even more vigorous in pursuit of our capital allocation priorities. First and foremost, to invest in our business, secondly, continuing our track record to grow our dividend, thirdly, to seek opportune M&A, and finally, with excess cash to repurchase our shares. So as we think about Q4, a few things to keep in mind. 1, the recovery phase looks different around the world and we expect that to continue. 2, we continue to see a minimal commodity impact due to hedges we have in place for the remainder of the year. 3, from a marketing perspective, we expect to increase consumer-facing marketing spend toward levels similar to 2019 while improving the quality of that spend and allocating it in a more targeted manner. 4, our currency outlook continues to contemplate a tailwind of 1% to 2% to the top line, and approximately 2% to 3% to comparable EPS in 2021 based on current spot rates and our hedge positions. Last, but not least, our current full-year guidance has built in the leveling of our concentrate shipments that are running ahead year-to-date due to timing considering that we have 6 fewer days in the fourth quarter. It's not typical for us to provide commentary on the year ahead at this stage but I would like to highlight a few points regarding 2022 given the dynamics we are already seeing. While there are puts and takes to consider from the pandemic looking into next year, we're confident in the underlying top line trajectory supported by our transformation work, our innovation agenda, and a more efficient and effective approach to marketing. Along with this ongoing momentum in revenues, we also expect to see some higher costs. We are not immune to the commodity inflation that has been impacting the world for the better part of 2021 nor the rapidly changing environment. We've been successful with hedges that were put in place to mitigate the impact of input cost inflation and those will begin to roll off in 2022. Based on current rates and hedge position, we'd expect commodity inflation having mid-single-digit impact on our cost of goods sold in 2022. We've been proactively accelerating our revenue growth management, and productivity levers to offset some of this pressure as we look out to next year. And we're closely monitoring the moving parts in the supply chain to ensure we are well-positioned to meet demand. Moving to marketing dollars, we'll continue to invest purposefully in our brands and markets to support top-line growth, with spend more heavily weighted towards consumer-facing activities. Regarding currency, if we were to assume current rates and our hedge position, there would be an approximate 2 to 3 points currency headwind to revenue, and a 2 to 3 point headwind to earnings for the full year 2022. Of course, volatility remain and several factors could have an impact on our currency outlook between now and February. Overall, as vaccinations continue to progress globally, we are in a better position today to navigate this environment and we feel good about the potential for our business. We look forward to coming back with more specific guidance after the fourth quarter. In closing, I'd like to acknowledge the more than 700,000 men and women of the Coca-Cola system, whose tremendous dedication and hard work have been instrumental to delivering the strong results in the first nine months of the year. The alignment of our system and it's deft navigation through a challenging supply environment and an asynchronous pandemic recovery has been key enablers to emerging stronger. We're confident in our updated guidance and our ability to further leverage our strong capability to drive sustainable top-line growth and maximize returns. With that, Operator, we're ready to take questions. Thanks, James. On the free cash flow, clearly pleased with the progress we've made, looking forward a couple of observations on our free cash flow conversion. Our long-term algorithm has free cash flow conversion of 90% to 95% range. And I still believe that's the right level for us to be pitching us. This year is better than that. And due to some specific items through the year, our marketing accruals in '21 were much higher than '20 as the marketing spend returns to 2019 levels. Our incentive compensation was down for obvious reasons in 2020 due to the pandemic impact. We -- as I mentioned on the call earlier, we anticipate some headwinds on Forex going into '22. Taking all that into account, I would expect us to be still able to deliver against the range that we've outlined in the long-term algorithm. Some of the drivers, Robert, in the last couple of years, we've made a lot of progress on working capital. We've talked about that in the past. We continue to do so in a strange way, the one area that we are below how I would like to be is on inventory, but in a paradoxical where that's been actually a good thing to have more buffer around the world. And so in the immediate short-term, I like it that way. But it's an area that we will continue to attack over time. In a number of areas."

In the second quarter, thanks to the tremendous efforts by our associates and our bottling partners, we executed on our key emerging stronger priorities, as many parts of the world gradually reopened. As we continued to deliver on our transformation, we are encouraged by our results and are raising our top line, bottom line and cash flow guidance, even as we are accelerating investments for the future. At the same time, we also recognize the trajectory may be dynamic and understand that we must remain flexible to respond to changes in the environment. This morning, I\u2019ll provide a business update and discuss how disciplined innovation and more effective and efficient marketing are driving broad-based share gains and are delivering enhanced value for our system. Then I will hand the call over to John to discuss our financial update, including our improved outlook for the year. Last year, in the face of a global pandemic, we laid out a path to emerge stronger across five strategic priorities. We are delivering against those priorities and this quarter demonstrates the power of our system. We started 2021 with promising results. Mobility and business levels improved in the first quarter and this trend continued in the second. Consumer mobility increased in markets where vaccination rates are reaching meaningful levels and our business has recovered as we\u2019re lapping last year\u2019s biggest lockdown impacts and see our strategies in motion. Consumers have started to return to many prior routine. And as a result, our away-from-home volumes steadily improved as a percent of our business this quarter, driving strong price/mix and margin acceleration across the enterprise. However, the recovery remains asynchronous and several parts of the world have dealt with further wave of infections leading to delayed openings, and in some cases, tightened restrictions. India and Southeast Asia were our only areas that did not see sequential volume acceleration on a two-year basis this quarter. Despite the asynchronous recovery, our revenues and earnings in the second quarter surpassed our 2019 results. We also made progress on share this quarter. We said many times that gaining share is a key objective in our emerging stronger agenda. And I am pleased to report that we have achieved that objective with broad-based share gains across categories, as well as in both our at-home and away-from-home channels in the quarter. And importantly, despite away-from-home channels not having fully recovered, our value share today is higher than the 2019 levels, confirming that our effective brand building and innovation, along with our advanced revenue growth management and market execution capabilities, are working. So let me dive a bit deeper into the key drivers across our geographies. In Asia-Pacific, China saw continued momentum across categories, driven by both volume and improved mix with Trademark Coca-Cola. We outpaced the overall macroeconomic recovery, led by strong performance in away-from-home channels and business-to-consumer e-commerce. Australia and New Zealand were bright spots, performing at or close to 2019 levels, but they are currently seeing renewed lockdowns. While Japan is struggling to come out of lockdown, there have been tangible successes with consumer-led innovation, small pack initiatives and improved customer execution of key initiatives. As I mentioned earlier, in India and across much of Southeast Asia, resurgence in the virus impacted further recovery. As India\u2019s restrictions have eased a bit, we are encouraged by the level of resilience in both the business, as well as our system associates as they have navigated this resurgence. In EMEA, Europe is still being impacted by some level of restriction, but vaccination rates and consumer confidence are improving. Because of this and our strong bottle alignment and marketing investment, we are seeing a much improved away-from-home mix even as at-home volumes continue to grow. Great Britain and Russia, where mobility was at the highest, show noticeable volume outperformance relative to 2019, and sparkling soft drinks gained or maintained share in most of the top 10 markets in Europe. Eurasia and the Middle East are performing well despite a diverse recovery landscape. In Turkey and Pakistan, strong execution during the key Ramadan holiday and emphasis on snacking and meal occasions drove new consumers to the Coke brands. Africa delivered a strong first half performance with affordability packages delivering good results, despite tightened restrictions heading into the winter season and vaccination rates that are behind the rest of the world. In North America, the consumer environment improved through the quarter as many states lifted restrictions and consumer mobility increased. More frequent social gatherings and rising travel and event activity drove significantly higher demand for our brands in away-from-home channels, while at-home volumes remained robust, leading to broad-based share gains in the quarter. Within away-from-home, eating and drinking was the strongest performing channel, with travel, hospitality and at-work trailing. In Latin America, lockdowns eased as vaccination programs rolled out in countries such as Mexico and Argentina, and stimulus programs in Brazil and Chile also helped drive recovery. Our results and year-to-date share gains in the region continued to be driven by commercial initiatives to improve execution, as well as a focus on affordable packs like refillables. Costa\u2019s UK Coffee Shop revenues recovered almost entirely to 2019 levels through the reopening phase, despite ongoing capacity restrictions. Increased consumer traffic and digital momentum are also supporting recovery as restrictions eased in other countries where we have a retail presence. Our Bottling Investment Group faced pandemic-related challenges, particularly in India and Southeast Asia, but managed to sequentially improve or gain share in India, Vietnam, the Philippines and South Africa. BIG also made great progress against this growth and productivity agenda, increasing year-to-date comparable operating margin approximately 300 basis points from the 2019 levels. Our category teams are collaborating with a global lens, enabling us to move even faster towards our Beverages for Life ambition. By continuously engaging consumers around their passion points and testing ideas in a coordinated and increasingly digital way, we are getting even better at what we\u2019ve always done best, building loved brands around the world. For a few examples, the Coke trademark portfolio is experiencing robust growth, led by brand Coke and driven in part by Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, which has contributed double-digit growth in value and volume year-to-date. The new Coca-Cola Zero Sugar recipe has already launched in nearly 50 markets across six of our operating units, including last week\u2019s announcement in the U.S., with more to come this year. Early results indicate that the recipe and simplified packaging design are resonating strongly with consumers. In sparkling flavors, we are accelerating our Zero Sugar offerings and executing global campaigns to focus on key occasions. Sprite has done well globally, benefiting from the Let\u2019s Be Clear campaign, which has led to improved share gains. Likewise, I Want The Fanta Mystery Flavor campaign in Europe drove accelerated growth and improved share. Dairy remains an opportunity for the overall portfolio, with premium offerings in key brands like Hollandia drinkable yogurt and Fanta Cladius [ph] flavored milk showing healthy growth. We continue to leverage fairlife\u2019s great success in the U.S. with a recent expansion in Canada. There are many bright spots in hydration, sports, tea and coffee. We see momentum across brands in the U.S., including good results from our renewed focus on smartwater, a new brand bundle from Gold Peak tea, exciting flavor innovations in Dunkin Coffee and continued growth from expanded distribution of Topo Chico sparkling mineral water. We had early success with Costa ready-to-drink launches in Asia, with meaningful share gains in key markets in China and has already voted a hit product in Japan. The rapid consumer traction and attractive proposition of healthy indulgence AHA, which began as an intelligent local experiment in the U.S. led us to believe we can transition to be a bigger bet and travel internationally. The recent launch in China with the local name of Little Universe has been encouraging, with meaningful value share gains in a short period of time. We continued to build our momentum with the launch of AHA\u2019s first 360-degree marketing campaign with a significant digital emphasis titled Can I get an AHA? Finally, last summer we announced more exploration in the dynamic flavored alcoholic beverage category with the launch of Topo Chico Hard Seltzer. Topo Chico Hard Seltzer is now in 17 markets worldwide and we have authorized Molson Coors the right to produce and sell Topo Chico Hard Seltzer in the United States. Launching a global brand in markets where the categories are at different stages of development comes with many learning and our local knowledge allows us to adapt with speed-to-win or in some cases develop this new category. From strong performance in Europe where available, to top two position in Mexico, to the U.S. where velocity is robust and the products has enjoyed positive consumer reaction, we are encouraged by recent trends and are gaining valuable insights along the way. We continued to make progress with our consumer-facing digital propositions. Internally, we are building out our platform services organization to support the enterprise as we have a sizable opportunity to become a holistic digital leader. Digital is of the utmost importance and we are also building an integrated ecosystem of platforms that create value across the digital and physical worlds. We are partnering with our bottlers to leverage the power of systems\u2019 physical footprints online, creating enhanced value for customers across the globe for a best-in-class e-B2B platform. With pockets of excellence in many regions, we are working with our bottling partners to evolve and streamline our approach. Working together as a system allows us to improve distribution economics, solve unmet needs of outlet owners and opens new revenue streams by providing other CPG brands access to our deep customer relationships and global distribution network. We are building a digital one-stop shop for customers, seamlessly offering most of the products they need to stock their shelves and operate their daily business. We are also ensuring consumers get the frictionless experience they demand, with more availability and assortment of the products they need and love. On top of the initiatives discussed today, we also continued to work with our bottlers to embed RGM principles and integrate execution capabilities into our processes to continue driving basket value and incidents as the world reopens. Through enhanced execution, we have an opportunity to win with more consumers and grow share by having the right products, in the right channel, at the right price, supported by the right activations. We also continue with our sustainability agenda to create shared value for our stakeholders and communities we serve. In addition to integrating ESG considerations into our daily business decisions, during the second quarter, we released our business and ESG report, highlighting progress across all our goals, as well as our World Without Waste report, which focuses exclusively on our work to create a circular economy for our packaging materials. Highlights include the continued rollout of 100% recycled PET with 30 markets representing approximately 30% of our total sales offering at least one brand in 100% rPET packaging. We have continued the expansion of refillables and dispense packaging and ultra-light weighting technologies, and we delivered a 60% global collection rate for packaging in 2020. We are proud of these achievements and we know there is more work to be done. Recently, we announced we have become a global implementation partner for the Ocean Cleanup\u2019s River Project supporting the deployment of clean-up systems across 15 rivers across the world. We will embed our marketing capabilities into this partnership to create consumer awareness of the issues and the actions we are all taking. Putting it all together, we realize there\u2019s a range of possible outcomes when it comes to the pandemic in the second half of the year given the asynchronous recovery. While we over-delivered relative to our expectations in the first half and have raised guidance for 2021, we are biased towards a growth mentality and will invest behind this momentum going into the rest of the year. Our networked organization is beginning to help us move faster to capture opportunities and create value for our stakeholders. As a system, we are increasingly equipped to win, and we are excited about the future.  Now, I will turn the call over to John to discuss our second quarter results and the drivers of our updated outlook.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James. This morning, I will highlight the drivers of our second quarter performance, as well as our revised guidance. In the second quarter, we built on the momentum from the beginning of the year and our business mix improved as consumer mobility increased across many markets. Our Q2 organic revenue was up 37% comprised of concentrate shipments up 26% and price/mix improvement of 11% as we lapped the biggest pandemic impacts of 2020. Unit case growth was 18%. Our shipments outpaced unit cases in the quarter and year-to-date due to cycling the destocking we experienced last year and certain timing impacts this year, including five additional days in the first quarter. Improvement in the away-from-home channels and positive segment mix from higher growth in our finished goods businesses positively impacted our price/mix. Channel and package mix also affected comparable gross margin, which showed significant improvement relative to last year, even with certain inflationary costs like transportation coming through. As we have said throughout the pandemic, our goal is to emerge stronger and we are investing ahead of recovery as markets reopen. As a result, we have doubled our marketing dollars year-over-year, cycling the significant pullback from the same period last year. Even with a step-up in those investments, we delivered a 170-basis-point improvement in comparable operating margins driven by the strong topline. Below operating income, we saw a benefit from improvement in our equity income, as our bottling partners also emerged stronger, as well as reduced interest expense on a comparable basis. As a result, second quarter comparable EPS of $0.68 was an increase of 61% year-over-year. We also delivered strong year-to-date free cash flow of approximately $5 billion, double last year\u2019s results. Our cash flow performance has also driven the return of our leverage to within the targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times. Since we reiterated guidance last quarter, the operating environment and our business have clearly improved. Given the improvement year-to-date and the increased visibility, we are raising our outlook for the full year. We now expect to deliver year-over-year organic revenue growth of 12% to 14% and comparable EPS growth of 13% to 15% in 2021. Our steady focus on cash generation continues to yield progress and our updated guidance for free cash flow of at least $9 billion implies a dividend payout ratio significantly improved from where we began the year and is edging closer to our targeted level of 75% over the long-term. So as we think about the remainder of the year a few things to keep in mind. The recovery phase continues to be asynchronous creating a dynamic demand environment in addition to causing many parts of the supply chain to experience tightness as a result. While experiencing some isolated pressure points, our team is navigating the challenges well through supplier diversification and inventory management. Despite recent upward pressures in many commodities driven by pandemic related disruption, we feel good about the rest of the year and as we anticipate hedges rolling off in 2022, we are working with our system to take appropriate action in the back half of this year to manage the ongoing volatility using revenue growth management capabilities and supply chain productivity levers. With regard to marketing investment, we have three priorities, increase consumer-facing marketing spend toward levels similar to 2019, improve the quality of that spend, and allocate the spend in a more targeted manner. Our currency outlook continues to contemplate a tailwind of 1% to 2% to the topline and approximately 2% to 3% to comparable EPS in 2021, based on current spot rates and our hedge positions. That said, the currency markets remain volatile and dependent on recovery from the pandemic, as well as macroeconomic factors. We will also have some additional timing considerations with the leveling out of our concentrate shipments that are running a bit ahead year-to-date, as well as six fewer days in the fourth quarter. To summarize, our company and our system have tackled many challenges through the pandemic, but we are emerging stronger, thanks to the hard work of our people and the focus on our strategic priorities. With our networked organization up and running, we are on a path to operate more efficiently and effectively, and to unlock the enormous potential we have in our brand and across our markets. As James mentioned earlier, we remain clear eyed as we look at the rest of the year, with many markets continuing to face obstacles, such as the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, but others continue to see the benefits of reopening. Overall, we are pleased with our progress in the first half of the year and we are grateful for the commitment from the stakeholders across our ecosystem that contributed to our results. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. So, on the revenue front, in markets like the U.S., where COVID concerns have now dissipated, can you just discuss how quickly consumer behavior is coming back? How that compares versus what you originally expected, presumably it\u2019s better than expected with the raised full year top line guidance? But how that impacts your strategy going forward and maybe also what you see is the lasting changes in consumer behavior in some of those markets?\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Sure, Dara. Well, firstly, I am not sure I would characterize the U.S. as past COVID. It\u2019s certainly moved to a phase like lot of the other markets where there\u2019s high levels of vaccination where the COVID, the most serious parts of the COVID are affecting, mainly the unvaccinated, as well as some of the vulnerable. So it\u2019s not over and we can see that in the numbers. If you just take a look for a second at what\u2019s happened in the U.S., a couple of interesting things as it\u2019s moved into this reopening phase. Firstly, consumers, as we\u2019ve talked before on these calls, we\u2019ve always believed that humans are social creatures. And that once the restrictions come down and the panorama of the virus allows people with confidence to go out that they will go back out all of the away-from-home channels. They want to be social and they will go after the experiences and this you can see very much beginning to happen in the second quarter. So if we look at our away-from-home channels, you can obviously see large rebounds compared to the second quarter last year, which is obviously logical given how much they fell last year. But they have not yet all reached the levels of 2019. You can take a couple of channels like QSR, which was one of the ones that went down least last year as they pushed delivery, as they pushed pickup and closed the in-room dining. Those channels -- even though many QSRs have still not yet fully reopened in restaurant dining, they have bounced back and are back kind of at or above 2019 levels. So Q -- for example, QSR did well and they are doing very well now, whereas if you take channels like bars and taverns, they went down by about three quarters last -- Q2 last year. Now, of course, they have reopened, people have flocked back and they have gone up by 200-odd percent, but that still means they are not back to 2019 levels and you can go through the various away-from-home channels. You \u2013 obviously, travel and transportation are very like about. So people who had a good second quarter last have generally held on or expanded on those gains in this 2021. And some which have bounced back are still not there, in part because COVID restrictions are still not fully gone and confidence is still not fully back. But interestingly, and I think, positively, from the Coca-Cola Company\u2019s point of view, if you look at the at-home channels, those that -- those gains or those -- that extra consumer interaction with brands and products at-home over the last 15 months has created some new behaviors and engagement with brands that may well be enduring. So it\u2019s quite possible that over time, we will both regain the away-from-home business that we had before and hang on to some of the gains in the at-home. And you can look at e-commerce, which was the poster child for growth in Q2 last year, which grew exponentially. That has basically stabilized, grown a little bit this year. So they\u2019ve held on to a step-up. But you can also see that in some of the large stores, which obviously did well last year. They continued to grow this year, so you are getting growth-on-growth and even the small stores that were impacted last year are bouncing back. So, net-net, if you look at the U.S., you see an enduring resilience in the step-up of the at-home business and a rebound in the away-from-home business that is in-progress but not yet complete, and I think, that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the business. And that pattern I think is very visible if you look around other countries at like stages of development in the COVID trajectory. In other words, restrictions are coming down and there\u2019s a high percentage of the population vaccinated, and therefore, reopening whether it\u2019s the UK or other places going into Europe.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. John, you offered definitely some perspective on the bigger picture profitability, and I know this quarter was kind of a new high watermark on operating margins. But I was curious if you think about the full year, and frankly, even into 2022, how you are thinking about the ability to better leverage your sales growth as a result of some of the restructuring work that you\u2019ve been doing, but also in the vein of this come out stronger and what you\u2019ve been able to achieve already and think you will still be able to achieve in terms of changing package mix and premiumization. And so, again, it\u2019s sort of a longer-term margin question with the awareness that perhaps this quarter is more timing than something directly related to my question? Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Yeah. Thanks, Lauren. And you are right, it would take the rest of the call to explain all that happened before, so I will spare you. But let\u2019s take a step back and I think it\u2019s the first part to your question or the first part of the answer is, let\u2019s think about the two-year picture. In 2020, we saw -- at the gross margin line, we saw expansion, driven primarily by a significant scale-back of our operating costs and marketing investments, even despite there being also some gross margin compression in the same period. In 2021, we are pleased with the progress year-to-date on getting gross margins back to where we would like them to be, and I think, we will continue to see us get back close to 2019 levels by the end of the year. But we are also -- as James highlighted in his \u2013 in the script, we are also very focused on investing in our brands and our key markets for the future. We\u2019ve seen a good step-up already year-to-date and we continue to have that as a major priority for the second half of the year. So, in a nutshell, if you take a two-year picture, you are going to see -- on the operating margin front, you will see 2021 is -- there will be some compression versus 2020, just given the nature of, what I just said, gross margins getting back, not quite there, significant focus on reinvesting back into the business for the mid- to long-term. But the good news, I think, by the end of this year 2021 will be better than 2019. So that\u2019s first part one. Part two is if you look at 2022 onwards, we\u2019ve talked about our flywheel driving the business from the top line through a much stronger marketing and innovation agenda to support the streamlined portfolio of brands that we now are focused on. We\u2019ve talked about innovation as being a continued driver of growth in the future and that all wraps into execution in the marketplace with our bottling partners and through a variety of levers and not the least of which is our RGM lever. So going into 2022, 2023, 2024, the goal is the same as it has been. It\u2019s to continue to be hyper-focused on improving our overall margin equation and Q2 was a good shot in the arm for us to continue on that path.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC.\nNik Modi: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I was -- James, I was hoping you can talk a little bit about WABI and the fact that you are rolling out to more countries. Maybe if you could just give us some topics on where exactly you are rolling it out? And what have you seen from that initiative from a data standpoint, because I know you can get direct access to that whereas maybe some other direct-to-consumer platforms you won\u2019t get that data and if it\u2019s something that you think could work in the U.S. market.\nJames Quincey: Sure. WABI is a set of features in a digital ecosystem that allow us to both do direct-to-consumer and I will come back to it specifically how, and to do B2B both or either for just the beverages or for multi-category orders. Now predominantly where we are using WABI in partnership with our bottlers is more in the B2B space. We have done some experiments doing B2C, but in the case of WABI, the model that was used which is very appropriate in Latin America, where you have a very high density of mom-and-pop stores, essentially the consumer uses the WABI app to place an order. If they want to have a whole set of Cokes and Fantas and Sprites or whatever, that order goes into the app. And the app then shops the order to the mom-and-pops that are nearest to the consumer and they can accept that order much like a ride hailing service and given that they are likely to be 50, 100, 200 meters from the consumer in these high density cities, they will just run around the product and deliver it in a very short space of time, 15 minutes or 20 minutes or less. And so it is very interesting and we have actually also used that platform with some of the QSR restaurants in places like Argentina to do the same thing. So it\u2019s an interesting experiment. We are getting a lot of insights and data. We have also expanded on the B2C place to actually add other categories of other FMCG partners so now you can place an order at the mom-and-pop for a whole series of categories not just beverages, so getting lots of interesting data and insights on that. The other thing that we are doing with B2B with a number of the bottlers is using it to accelerate the digitization of one part of the relationship particularly with the fragmented trade, whether it be the mom-and-pops or restaurants and cafes around the world, which is of course, now that the rollout of smartphones and smart devices everywhere is expanding, you don\u2019t necessarily need the salesperson to turn up at the store in order to capture an order. And so we are blending the use of the sales force to drive account development and drive all of the in-store activations that we know create impulse purchases and give us advantaged execution, but leverage the platforms to drive order taking. And again, we are getting a lot of learnings with the bottler on how that improves not just efficiency, but just as importantly, the effectiveness of the selling and the execution process. Again, there are, depending on where you are in the world, sometimes that\u2019s just a beverage approach, but we have also got some experiments where it\u2019s a multi-category approach through the platform and links to either wholesalers who deliver either all or the non-beverage categories, et cetera. Anyway, standing back, the net of it is, we continue to see the ongoing digitization of the interaction both at the consumer with the retailer and the retailer with the suppliers. And we think that the Coke system globally with our bottling partners is in a tremendous position to expand the depth of our relationship with the retailers and we are being open minded as to exactly what format takes and working with them to drive a whole set of experiments to see what works, more to come.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: Hey. Good morning. So I think just a follow-up to Lauren\u2019s question earlier around margins and then just two items, John, if you can provide. One is just in terms of marketing for this year, I think, I heard, the way I read it was that you have actually increased the spend or plan to increase the spend now more versus, I guess, what was in your original plan? And then the second, if I don\u2019t know if I missed it, but just can you give us kind of where we stand today in terms of how much of the savings from the reorganization have been captured and how much more there is to go?\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Bryan. Yeah. On the first part, I think, again, looking at the year-to-date, I think, we saw a big rebound in the second quarter. We are doubling our spend on consumer facing activities and for the rest of the year with an eye to both delivering the year, but also being well-prepared for 2022, we have a very robust investment agenda that will see us getting back to 2019 levels and that\u2019s just comparing dollars. When you look under the hood though, I think, one of the big changes we have made in recent months is to improve the quality of that spend. And so my working with Manolo, our objective is to be able to actually generate more with the same and we are pleased with the progress that we are making in that space, particularly as you think about some of the newer areas, digital media, et cetera. Regarding the savings, it\u2019s a piece of the overall equation, and I think, for me, rather than provide hard numbers, it gives us a degree of flexibility to invest behind some of the bigger bets to think about our ongoing ability to pivot as market conditions dictate. And so it\u2019s really less around taking those savings to the bottomline and much more around having to flex to be well-positioned to go after opportunities as we see them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Thanks and good morning. James, maybe John wants to answer too, but following up on where you started with Dara and panning out globally, the updated guidance from today seems to call for a further acceleration in underlying growth on a two-year basis in the back half versus 2019, especially at the top end of the range? And I guess, I am curious where you see that most being sourced from a segment perspective, but also whether you have a bias as to that acceleration and sequential improvement being more volume led versus 2019 or price/mix led as the system fights through inflation or whether you see a bit of both, just how you are thinking about the mix of revenue in the back half? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Sure. So our expectations for the year, obviously, we said we wanted to get back to 2019 levels and we made good progress and we believe we are emerging stronger, and we are obviously raising the guidance. As we look into the back half of the year, as John said, we are being clear eyed about the puts and takes that exist out there. I think the first thing I would suggest to you is really take a look at the 2021, whether it\u2019s whichever quarter you want to look at and have it on a two-year stack basis, whether that be the volume or the price/mix. Obviously, you have got to look through the stocking and destocking of the gallons, because obviously, this time last year, we were de-stocking gallons rapidly and then notwithstanding the extra days in the first quarter, we have been restocking gallons in this second quarter. But if you look at volume and price/mix on a two-year basis, what we are expecting to see is, yes, some continued improvement into the back half of the year on a two-year stacked volume basis as more countries get more vaccinations done and more restrictions come off. Clearly, there\u2019s plenty of room for different things to happen, the famous asynchronization because markets go up and markets go down. But generally speaking, we expect to see steady -- some steady, although, very moderate, sequential improvements on a two-year basis.  And similarly on a price/mix basis, we are looking, actually, we start looking at price/mix on a two-year basis in Q2. You see it in the sort of ballpark we have always talked about. We have always talked about in the long-term growth model that we are kind of expecting two to three on price on any average year and when you start looking on an annual, on a two-year basis and taking the annual increase, you start to see that in the second quarter. And so our expectations of price/mix are not to see something radically different, notwithstanding the 11 you saw in the second quarter. Clearly it\u2019s not going to continue at 11 because it\u2019s cycling a much more negative number in Q2 last year, which is heavily driven by package and channel mix. But once you look through all of that, we -- in underlying terms essentially maintaining the same approach that we have had historically pre-COVID during this kind of re-opening.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning. I actually had a question on your guidance. You raised your full year outlook given the strength you saw in the quarter, but you didn\u2019t flow through the entire beat especially on the bottomline, given your new guidance now suggests EPS growth in the second half will be negative. So I was really hoping to understand the drivers behind this, is it cost pressures that might have gotten worse in the last few months versus the planned stepped up investments that you called out ahead of the recovery? Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Bonnie. A couple of comments, one is, the first half of the year, we saw gallons ahead of cases, which we would expect to normalize in the second half of the year. So I think you have got to factor that into account. Secondly, in the first quarter we had a few extra days and they would come off in the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s a big piece of the equation that we have designed for the full year. And then secondly, as we have already discussed, in the investment space too, we look to sort of end the full year with our marketing investments continuing to step up and margins back to better than 2019, but not as strong as 2020. So that\u2019s all factored in.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi. Can you -- just maybe oversimplifying it, but can you maybe help us, your business has changed a bit in recent years? And maybe if you could just help us with what operating leverage looks like, does a 5% revenue mean a 7% profit growth, does 6% revenue mean 10%? Can you just give us an idea where leverage lives down the P&L?\nJohn Murphy: Yeah. I\u2019d say that refer us back to our long-term algorithm. We are managing to as we have been discussing a very interesting period. We still think that the, when you take all of the puts and takes with the businesses that we have at the moment that the long-term algorithm is still one that best reflects what we can deliver over the coming years. Now, clearly, as the business mix changes, we would need to review that. But I think the -- I\u2019d just refer you back to the algorithm and we don\u2019t see that changing in the foreseeable future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Hi. Thank you so much. So I just wanted to go back to the how the on-premise has been tracking as you exit the quarter. So I was hoping to see if you can, it sounds, James, is sounds that you are confident that we are seeing that lapping, and obviously, looking at the U.S. as an example, as you mentioned, you were quite confident that worldwide we are going to see that adding to the recovery and adding to the at-home consumption. So I was hoping to see how you exit the quarter in places where infections have come back on a global basis and how can you quantify how volume sits relative to 2019 levels? I think you called out in developed coming back to the same levels, but -- and how your mix in terms of finished goods and single serve is relative to the 2019?\nJames Quincey: Sure. I will try and offer a few thoughts there that might help. Clearly, when countries have gone, when infections go up and greater restrictions have come back in during the course of the second quarter, you do see negative impacts on the business. Now over the last 15 months, we have worked very hard to make our business more adaptable and more agile and able to pivot in the restrictions to help the consumers get the beverages they love, but often in the very short-term it impacts the business. So if you look at places where infections have spiked up recently in the second quarter, so Vietnam went into some restrictions. They have done a good job of avoiding large restrictions and so they were doing fine the first few months of the year and then all of a sudden they have had some restrictions and they were negative in June. Similarly, India, earlier in the quarter, brought in a strong set of restrictions and the business went negative, but then when they reopened, they bounced back. So clearly, while we have adapted the business and made it more resilient to levels of lockdown, when these do occur, wherever they do occur around the world, it\u2019s going to impact the business. We are going to bounce back quicker and we are going to suffer less, but it is going to impact the business. And so as you think about the outlook, clearly, the direction of travel of COVID, its variants, the levels of infections and the levels of restrictions are going to make a difference to the business.  And then as it relates to immediate consumption and future consumption, if I look on a worldwide basis and I look on a two-year stack rate, what you can see is that now we have steadily improved through the course of the pandemic such that the immediate consumption of volumes are now slightly ahead of 2019 levels as we exited the second quarter in June. So and as I said in the opening or in the reflections on that first question from Dara on the U.S., that has not been followed by a mirror image decline in the at-home. Clearly, some of the at-home on a two-year stack basis goes down because people are now out and about and at work, and so you now see the two of them tracking, you see the at-home tracking at the 2019 levels as well. So that\u2019s why we feel that there\u2019s some sequential improvement coming in the downhill, moderate but some.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. Can you please talk maybe a little bit more about headline pricing and promo intensity? I think I heard you say that in Q2, your pricing was sort of at historical levels of 2% to 3%. I also heard you say that in the second half of the year you would look to address higher input costs with revenue growth management initiatives. So maybe kind of talk about your thoughts on pricing in an environment where we have seen more inflation than we have in many years and how able the consumer is in your key geographies to be able to take additional prices? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yeah. So, clearly, obviously, the comments I made about pricing are on the two-year stack basis and we kind of see when one takes out the effects of channel and geography, what you would see if you had all of the data, but what I am saying is that over the course of the pandemic, we have taken a steady approach to pricing to continue to price for our brand strength and RGM, and then of course, we manage input costs increases over time. And we use our hedging strategies to not have to try and minimize the amount of sudden bumps, because our overall belief is that, if we focus on creating the growth of the beverage category for our retail customers ahead of their overall business then that will be good for them and then we will do and gain share within that overall strategy and that is best executed through steady investment in brands, steady investment in execution, and the use of RGM to meet the consumer with the pack size and the price point that they want. And that includes, then, managing through the increases in input costs in a rational and staged way and we obviously leverage hedging to make that easier for us to do. And so we do believe that categories, well, those people who have brands that have strong consumer resonance will be able to pass through costs, as we have done historically. We have -- whilst in the U.S. inflation has been very moderate for an extended period of time as it has been in Europe, we have plenty of other country in the world which experience high or double-digit levels of inflation. And so the strategy on how to manage through that and stay engaged with the consumer to keep the momentum in the business and keep the margin structure steady or improving is a capability of the system.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Carlos Laboy with HSBC.\nCarlos Laboy: Yes. Good morning, everyone. James, about three years to four years ago you said you wanted more robust experimentation and small experiments become big experiments, drive collaboration and revenues, and we see this thriving in America. But might you share with us perhaps in some developed markets where we don\u2019t have as clear line of sight, how this is coming along and maybe are there some wins that really stand out in this area?\nJames Quincey: Sure. Thanks, Carlos. I mean, we continue to drive the collaborations and the innovations. If I just pick up a few of the ones that we have sort of elliptically connected to today. WABI, which started in Latin America both as B2C and B2B. We have used the platform to work with our bottlers in other parts of the world, whether that be Europe or beyond, on helping us work together to improve the digitization and the B2B capability beyond that. So you are seeing expansions of those experiments out of Latin America. You will see expansions of experiments in the U.S., whether it be AHA, which has continued to perform very well in the U.S. so far this year. We have launched that in China or in fairlife, which has done very well in the U.S. We are taking that to China as well. And so there\u2019s some kind of moving from the west to the east. You have got experiments that were taking place on Topo Chico Hard Seltzer which kind of started in a way as a global idea. It\u2019s now in each of the continents and we have continued to expand it. There are some things going on in Asia in the kind of non-black tea segments where we experimented in some of the ASEAN countries and is expanding round. So there really are some great experiments out there. You could even go to some of the packaging ones like the use of rPET, 100% recycled PET, which is really a key factor in driving a circular economy around packaging materials, started really in Europe, coming to the U.S. recently with the 13-ounce bottle that we have put into the market. So we are never satisfied as a kind of philosophical starting point, but they are certainly starting to see more experiments happen out there and more discipline in working, which aren\u2019t working and stopping them and which have legs to be taken to the next place. And interestingly, you are starting to see those experiments move in all directions. It\u2019s not just developed -- to developing or west to east or any one direction. It\u2019s actually really starting to be ideas coming from all around the world and really having to go through and work out, which ones deserve the shot at expanding globally.\nJohn Murphy: And if I may, James, I think, in the supply chain also there\u2019s over the last 12 months to 18 months it\u2019s a tremendous amount of partnership collaboration that is delivering results in the individual entities across the world that I think will continue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning. A question for James, just picking up on the last line of questioning there around innovation, my question specifically for hard seltzers and some of the early success that you have had there. So, James, you mentioned some of the early learnings. I was hoping you could perhaps share those with us, particularly as it pertains to the seltzer category? And then more broadly, James, whether the success that you have had in the alcohol space emboldens the company a bit for further exploration in alcohol sort of outside non-alcohol? Your comments there would be helpful. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Sure. So we are still very much in the learning phase. It\u2019s not a category we are familiar with, particularly with the alcohol. It\u2019s got a number of important characteristics and regulatory characteristics and business characteristics that we need to learn about. So we have not got to a stage of concluding anything more strategic or coming to the point of view that there is a bigger vision for us out there in the flavored alcoholic beverage space. We want to learn and understand more before we decide anything one direction or the other. As it relates to some of the learnings so far, I mean, clearly, what we have discovered is obviously it makes a difference if the category exists or doesn\u2019t exist in any particular country. I mean, we are in 17 markets to-date. We are on track to be in 28 markets around the world by the end of the year. We are learning what it takes to compete where the category exists. We are learning what it takes to help grow the category where it doesn\u2019t exist. So we are pleased, for example, in Latin America, where for example, in Mexico, we are the number two hard seltzer and getting some good traction and good velocity in Brazil, where it\u2019s more of an undeveloped category. There\u2019s more kind of development needed as we are trying to work out how that happens. Similarly in Europe, it\u2019s the number one or two performer in terms of rates and velocity in Europe and so I think it\u2019s very interesting what\u2019s happening there. And obviously in the U.S., it\u2019s got a lot of good traction, while it\u2019s still of course relatively small overall nationally, it\u2019s done particularly well where we have focused or where Molson is focused to launch, which is in Texas and it\u2019s done very well in Texas, looking good in kind of the southern states, California, in Florida too. Retail customers, we understand they are very bullish, lots of display activity and activity. So we are looking to see that continue to expand. Of course, we are conscious that the overall hard seltzer category has come down in terms of its overall growth rates in the U.S. That\u2019s not ultimately that big of a surprise to us, because it is a category that has been predominantly an at-home channel category, much less bars and restaurants category. And so as people have gone back out, clearly, some of those occasions have moved from at-home to away-from-home. So it\u2019s not too surprising that some of the strong tailwinds the category got in the lockdowns have lessened. But we still think it\u2019s very interesting. It\u2019s got some long-term potential in the U.S. It\u2019s very on-trend for a lot of consumers. And so we are continuing to look at that and push on that and invest to see where we can go.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sean King with UBS.\nSean King: Great. Thanks for the question. How do you stand to benefit from the Olympics starting later this week, really given a pandemic driven disruption around the world? Can you shed any light on any marketing activation plans or just a general outlook on this opportunity given the pent-up sort of excitement for this type of event?\nJames Quincey: Yeah. I mean, in terms of kind of two ways of looking at it, one, those countries where the Olympics are broadcast too and then the actual activation in Japan itself. I mean, clearly, in Japan, given the restrictions, we have dialed back all the physical activations and are supporting appropriately, keeping supply of beverages to the athletes, et cetera. But the physical activation is essentially not going to happen. And then -- and so really it\u2019s as much as anything, it\u2019s about leveraging the airtime that the Olympics are going to get in places like the U.S. to market our programs. But very specific marketing activation at a large galley isn\u2019t going to happen in part because of the slight uncertainty of whether they were going to happen or not led us to move away from having any large extra fixed cost investment in activating the market, the Olympics for this year and so we will leverage the airtime to market our brands. You can still note even today the deputy, one of the people in Tokyo said that, who knows what\u2019s going to happen whether it will actually start. So we very much are taking the approach of take away the physical activation, take away any fixed cost that can only be used in the event of the Olympics and use any rights and times we have for the general marketing of our brands.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.\nLaurent Grandet: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in. Got a question on Coca-Cola Zero, please, you had the market to re-launch Coca-Cola Zero with new packaging and recipe both for Coke Regular, so in countries where it has already been launched, is the value you are seeing coming from Regular actually or Diet or competition. So any color would help. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Laurent, I mean, we are -- obviously, the answer is it depends in a way, because each country has a slightly different mix from the starting point of Zero or depending if you are in a country that still has got Diet or Light and the size of Classic. So the starting point matters. Two, clearly it\u2019s a mix of everything. What we like most about driving Coke Zero Sugar is we get a lot of business that is not self-cannibalization. If it was all just coming from Coke and Coke Light, it would be perhaps necessary, but not very exciting. What\u2019s exciting about it is that we are helping expand the Coke franchise. So, in other words, if you start standing back and looking at it globally, you can see both the growth of Coke Original, the very fast Coke growth of Coke Zero, only some of which is coming from the cannibalization of Coke Light or Diet Coke depending on where you are in the world. So it\u2019s a net accretion to the Coke franchise.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Thanks very much everyone. As we said at the beginning, look we are delivering on the priorities we set out for ourselves to emerge stronger. Hopefully, you could see that in both the results and our guidance. And we just want to take the opportunity to thank once again the extraordinary effort of our associates, of our bottling partners and all our partners that have allowed us to deliver these results and to raise our guidance for the outlook. Our system is strong. Our bottling partners are strong. We continue to invest behind momentum and the huge growth opportunity ahead of us. Thanks for your interest, your investment and for joining us today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Quincey",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, thanks to the tremendous efforts by our associates and our bottling partners, we executed on our key emerging stronger priorities, as many parts of the world gradually reopened. As we continued to deliver on our transformation, we are encouraged by our results and are raising our top line, bottom line and cash flow guidance, even as we are accelerating investments for the future. At the same time, we also recognize the trajectory may be dynamic and understand that we must remain flexible to respond to changes in the environment. This morning, I'll provide a business update and discuss how disciplined innovation and more effective and efficient marketing are driving broad-based share gains and are delivering enhanced value for our system. Then I will hand the call over to John to discuss our financial update, including our improved outlook for the year. Last year, in the face of a global pandemic, we laid out a path to emerge stronger across five strategic priorities. We are delivering against those priorities and this quarter demonstrates the power of our system. We started 2021 with promising results. Mobility and business levels improved in the first quarter and this trend continued in the second. Consumer mobility increased in markets where vaccination rates are reaching meaningful levels and our business has recovered as we're lapping last year's biggest lockdown impacts and see our strategies in motion. Consumers have started to return to many prior routine. And as a result, our away-from-home volumes steadily improved as a percent of our business this quarter, driving strong price/mix and margin acceleration across the enterprise. However, the recovery remains asynchronous and several parts of the world have dealt with further wave of infections leading to delayed openings, and in some cases, tightened restrictions. India and Southeast Asia were our only areas that did not see sequential volume acceleration on a two-year basis this quarter. Despite the asynchronous recovery, our revenues and earnings in the second quarter surpassed our 2019 results. We also made progress on share this quarter. We said many times that gaining share is a key objective in our emerging stronger agenda. And I am pleased to report that we have achieved that objective with broad-based share gains across categories, as well as in both our at-home and away-from-home channels in the quarter. And importantly, despite away-from-home channels not having fully recovered, our value share today is higher than the 2019 levels, confirming that our effective brand building and innovation, along with our advanced revenue growth management and market execution capabilities, are working. So let me dive a bit deeper into the key drivers across our geographies. In Asia-Pacific, China saw continued momentum across categories, driven by both volume and improved mix with Trademark Coca-Cola. We outpaced the overall macroeconomic recovery, led by strong performance in away-from-home channels and business-to-consumer e-commerce. Australia and New Zealand were bright spots, performing at or close to 2019 levels, but they are currently seeing renewed lockdowns. While Japan is struggling to come out of lockdown, there have been tangible successes with consumer-led innovation, small pack initiatives and improved customer execution of key initiatives. As I mentioned earlier, in India and across much of Southeast Asia, resurgence in the virus impacted further recovery. As India's restrictions have eased a bit, we are encouraged by the level of resilience in both the business, as well as our system associates as they have navigated this resurgence. In EMEA, Europe is still being impacted by some level of restriction, but vaccination rates and consumer confidence are improving. Because of this and our strong bottle alignment and marketing investment, we are seeing a much improved away-from-home mix even as at-home volumes continue to grow. Great Britain and Russia, where mobility was at the highest, show noticeable volume outperformance relative to 2019, and sparkling soft drinks gained or maintained share in most of the top 10 markets in Europe. Eurasia and the Middle East are performing well despite a diverse recovery landscape. In Turkey and Pakistan, strong execution during the key Ramadan holiday and emphasis on snacking and meal occasions drove new consumers to the Coke brands. Africa delivered a strong first half performance with affordability packages delivering good results, despite tightened restrictions heading into the winter season and vaccination rates that are behind the rest of the world. In North America, the consumer environment improved through the quarter as many states lifted restrictions and consumer mobility increased. More frequent social gatherings and rising travel and event activity drove significantly higher demand for our brands in away-from-home channels, while at-home volumes remained robust, leading to broad-based share gains in the quarter. Within away-from-home, eating and drinking was the strongest performing channel, with travel, hospitality and at-work trailing. In Latin America, lockdowns eased as vaccination programs rolled out in countries such as Mexico and Argentina, and stimulus programs in Brazil and Chile also helped drive recovery. Our results and year-to-date share gains in the region continued to be driven by commercial initiatives to improve execution, as well as a focus on affordable packs like refillables. Costa's UK Coffee Shop revenues recovered almost entirely to 2019 levels through the reopening phase, despite ongoing capacity restrictions. Increased consumer traffic and digital momentum are also supporting recovery as restrictions eased in other countries where we have a retail presence. Our Bottling Investment Group faced pandemic-related challenges, particularly in India and Southeast Asia, but managed to sequentially improve or gain share in India, Vietnam, the Philippines and South Africa. BIG also made great progress against this growth and productivity agenda, increasing year-to-date comparable operating margin approximately 300 basis points from the 2019 levels. Our category teams are collaborating with a global lens, enabling us to move even faster towards our Beverages for Life ambition. By continuously engaging consumers around their passion points and testing ideas in a coordinated and increasingly digital way, we are getting even better at what we've always done best, building loved brands around the world. For a few examples, the Coke trademark portfolio is experiencing robust growth, led by brand Coke and driven in part by Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, which has contributed double-digit growth in value and volume year-to-date. The new Coca-Cola Zero Sugar recipe has already launched in nearly 50 markets across six of our operating units, including last week's announcement in the U.S., with more to come this year. Early results indicate that the recipe and simplified packaging design are resonating strongly with consumers. In sparkling flavors, we are accelerating our Zero Sugar offerings and executing global campaigns to focus on key occasions. Sprite has done well globally, benefiting from the Let's Be Clear campaign, which has led to improved share gains. Likewise, I Want The Fanta Mystery Flavor campaign in Europe drove accelerated growth and improved share. Dairy remains an opportunity for the overall portfolio, with premium offerings in key brands like Hollandia drinkable yogurt and Fanta Cladius [ph] flavored milk showing healthy growth. We continue to leverage fairlife's great success in the U.S. with a recent expansion in Canada. There are many bright spots in hydration, sports, tea and coffee. We see momentum across brands in the U.S., including good results from our renewed focus on smartwater, a new brand bundle from Gold Peak tea, exciting flavor innovations in Dunkin Coffee and continued growth from expanded distribution of Topo Chico sparkling mineral water. We had early success with Costa ready-to-drink launches in Asia, with meaningful share gains in key markets in China and has already voted a hit product in Japan. The rapid consumer traction and attractive proposition of healthy indulgence AHA, which began as an intelligent local experiment in the U.S. led us to believe we can transition to be a bigger bet and travel internationally. The recent launch in China with the local name of Little Universe has been encouraging, with meaningful value share gains in a short period of time. We continued to build our momentum with the launch of AHA's first 360-degree marketing campaign with a significant digital emphasis titled Can I get an AHA? Finally, last summer we announced more exploration in the dynamic flavored alcoholic beverage category with the launch of Topo Chico Hard Seltzer. Topo Chico Hard Seltzer is now in 17 markets worldwide and we have authorized Molson Coors the right to produce and sell Topo Chico Hard Seltzer in the United States. Launching a global brand in markets where the categories are at different stages of development comes with many learning and our local knowledge allows us to adapt with speed-to-win or in some cases develop this new category. From strong performance in Europe where available, to top two position in Mexico, to the U.S. where velocity is robust and the products has enjoyed positive consumer reaction, we are encouraged by recent trends and are gaining valuable insights along the way. We continued to make progress with our consumer-facing digital propositions. Internally, we are building out our platform services organization to support the enterprise as we have a sizable opportunity to become a holistic digital leader. Digital is of the utmost importance and we are also building an integrated ecosystem of platforms that create value across the digital and physical worlds. We are partnering with our bottlers to leverage the power of systems' physical footprints online, creating enhanced value for customers across the globe for a best-in-class e-B2B platform. With pockets of excellence in many regions, we are working with our bottling partners to evolve and streamline our approach. Working together as a system allows us to improve distribution economics, solve unmet needs of outlet owners and opens new revenue streams by providing other CPG brands access to our deep customer relationships and global distribution network. We are building a digital one-stop shop for customers, seamlessly offering most of the products they need to stock their shelves and operate their daily business. We are also ensuring consumers get the frictionless experience they demand, with more availability and assortment of the products they need and love. On top of the initiatives discussed today, we also continued to work with our bottlers to embed RGM principles and integrate execution capabilities into our processes to continue driving basket value and incidents as the world reopens. Through enhanced execution, we have an opportunity to win with more consumers and grow share by having the right products, in the right channel, at the right price, supported by the right activations. We also continue with our sustainability agenda to create shared value for our stakeholders and communities we serve. In addition to integrating ESG considerations into our daily business decisions, during the second quarter, we released our business and ESG report, highlighting progress across all our goals, as well as our World Without Waste report, which focuses exclusively on our work to create a circular economy for our packaging materials. Highlights include the continued rollout of 100% recycled PET with 30 markets representing approximately 30% of our total sales offering at least one brand in 100% rPET packaging. We have continued the expansion of refillables and dispense packaging and ultra-light weighting technologies, and we delivered a 60% global collection rate for packaging in 2020. We are proud of these achievements and we know there is more work to be done. Recently, we announced we have become a global implementation partner for the Ocean Cleanup's River Project supporting the deployment of clean-up systems across 15 rivers across the world. We will embed our marketing capabilities into this partnership to create consumer awareness of the issues and the actions we are all taking. Putting it all together, we realize there's a range of possible outcomes when it comes to the pandemic in the second half of the year given the asynchronous recovery. While we over-delivered relative to our expectations in the first half and have raised guidance for 2021, we are biased towards a growth mentality and will invest behind this momentum going into the rest of the year. Our networked organization is beginning to help us move faster to capture opportunities and create value for our stakeholders. As a system, we are increasingly equipped to win, and we are excited about the future.  Now, I will turn the call over to John to discuss our second quarter results and the drivers of our updated outlook. Yeah. Sure, Dara. Well, firstly, I am not sure I would characterize the U.S. as past COVID. It's certainly moved to a phase like lot of the other markets where there's high levels of vaccination where the COVID, the most serious parts of the COVID are affecting, mainly the unvaccinated, as well as some of the vulnerable. So it's not over and we can see that in the numbers. If you just take a look for a second at what's happened in the U.S., a couple of interesting things as it's moved into this reopening phase. Firstly, consumers, as we've talked before on these calls, we've always believed that humans are social creatures. And that once the restrictions come down and the panorama of the virus allows people with confidence to go out that they will go back out all of the away-from-home channels. They want to be social and they will go after the experiences and this you can see very much beginning to happen in the second quarter. So if we look at our away-from-home channels, you can obviously see large rebounds compared to the second quarter last year, which is obviously logical given how much they fell last year. But they have not yet all reached the levels of 2019. You can take a couple of channels like QSR, which was one of the ones that went down least last year as they pushed delivery, as they pushed pickup and closed the in-room dining. Those channels -- even though many QSRs have still not yet fully reopened in restaurant dining, they have bounced back and are back kind of at or above 2019 levels. So Q -- for example, QSR did well and they are doing very well now, whereas if you take channels like bars and taverns, they went down by about three quarters last -- Q2 last year. Now, of course, they have reopened, people have flocked back and they have gone up by 200-odd percent, but that still means they are not back to 2019 levels and you can go through the various away-from-home channels. You \u2013 obviously, travel and transportation are very like about. So people who had a good second quarter last have generally held on or expanded on those gains in this 2021. And some which have bounced back are still not there, in part because COVID restrictions are still not fully gone and confidence is still not fully back. But interestingly, and I think, positively, from the Coca-Cola Company's point of view, if you look at the at-home channels, those that -- those gains or those -- that extra consumer interaction with brands and products at-home over the last 15 months has created some new behaviors and engagement with brands that may well be enduring. So it's quite possible that over time, we will both regain the away-from-home business that we had before and hang on to some of the gains in the at-home. And you can look at e-commerce, which was the poster child for growth in Q2 last year, which grew exponentially. That has basically stabilized, grown a little bit this year. So they've held on to a step-up. But you can also see that in some of the large stores, which obviously did well last year. They continued to grow this year, so you are getting growth-on-growth and even the small stores that were impacted last year are bouncing back. So, net-net, if you look at the U.S., you see an enduring resilience in the step-up of the at-home business and a rebound in the away-from-home business that is in-progress but not yet complete, and I think, that's what's driving the business. And that pattern I think is very visible if you look around other countries at like stages of development in the COVID trajectory. In other words, restrictions are coming down and there's a high percentage of the population vaccinated, and therefore, reopening whether it's the UK or other places going into Europe. Sure. WABI is a set of features in a digital ecosystem that allow us to both do direct-to-consumer and I will come back to it specifically how, and to do B2B both or either for just the beverages or for multi-category orders. Now predominantly where we are using WABI in partnership with our bottlers is more in the B2B space. We have done some experiments doing B2C, but in the case of WABI, the model that was used which is very appropriate in Latin America, where you have a very high density of mom-and-pop stores, essentially the consumer uses the WABI app to place an order. If they want to have a whole set of Cokes and Fantas and Sprites or whatever, that order goes into the app. And the app then shops the order to the mom-and-pops that are nearest to the consumer and they can accept that order much like a ride hailing service and given that they are likely to be 50, 100, 200 meters from the consumer in these high density cities, they will just run around the product and deliver it in a very short space of time, 15 minutes or 20 minutes or less. And so it is very interesting and we have actually also used that platform with some of the QSR restaurants in places like Argentina to do the same thing. So it's an interesting experiment. We are getting a lot of insights and data. We have also expanded on the B2C place to actually add other categories of other FMCG partners so now you can place an order at the mom-and-pop for a whole series of categories not just beverages, so getting lots of interesting data and insights on that. The other thing that we are doing with B2B with a number of the bottlers is using it to accelerate the digitization of one part of the relationship particularly with the fragmented trade, whether it be the mom-and-pops or restaurants and cafes around the world, which is of course, now that the rollout of smartphones and smart devices everywhere is expanding, you don't necessarily need the salesperson to turn up at the store in order to capture an order. And so we are blending the use of the sales force to drive account development and drive all of the in-store activations that we know create impulse purchases and give us advantaged execution, but leverage the platforms to drive order taking. And again, we are getting a lot of learnings with the bottler on how that improves not just efficiency, but just as importantly, the effectiveness of the selling and the execution process. Again, there are, depending on where you are in the world, sometimes that's just a beverage approach, but we have also got some experiments where it's a multi-category approach through the platform and links to either wholesalers who deliver either all or the non-beverage categories, et cetera. Anyway, standing back, the net of it is, we continue to see the ongoing digitization of the interaction both at the consumer with the retailer and the retailer with the suppliers. And we think that the Coke system globally with our bottling partners is in a tremendous position to expand the depth of our relationship with the retailers and we are being open minded as to exactly what format takes and working with them to drive a whole set of experiments to see what works, more to come. Yeah. Sure. So our expectations for the year, obviously, we said we wanted to get back to 2019 levels and we made good progress and we believe we are emerging stronger, and we are obviously raising the guidance. As we look into the back half of the year, as John said, we are being clear eyed about the puts and takes that exist out there. I think the first thing I would suggest to you is really take a look at the 2021, whether it's whichever quarter you want to look at and have it on a two-year stack basis, whether that be the volume or the price/mix. Obviously, you have got to look through the stocking and destocking of the gallons, because obviously, this time last year, we were de-stocking gallons rapidly and then notwithstanding the extra days in the first quarter, we have been restocking gallons in this second quarter. But if you look at volume and price/mix on a two-year basis, what we are expecting to see is, yes, some continued improvement into the back half of the year on a two-year stacked volume basis as more countries get more vaccinations done and more restrictions come off. Clearly, there's plenty of room for different things to happen, the famous asynchronization because markets go up and markets go down. But generally speaking, we expect to see steady -- some steady, although, very moderate, sequential improvements on a two-year basis.  And similarly on a price/mix basis, we are looking, actually, we start looking at price/mix on a two-year basis in Q2. You see it in the sort of ballpark we have always talked about. We have always talked about in the long-term growth model that we are kind of expecting two to three on price on any average year and when you start looking on an annual, on a two-year basis and taking the annual increase, you start to see that in the second quarter. And so our expectations of price/mix are not to see something radically different, notwithstanding the 11 you saw in the second quarter. Clearly it's not going to continue at 11 because it's cycling a much more negative number in Q2 last year, which is heavily driven by package and channel mix. But once you look through all of that, we -- in underlying terms essentially maintaining the same approach that we have had historically pre-COVID during this kind of re-opening. Sure. I will try and offer a few thoughts there that might help. Clearly, when countries have gone, when infections go up and greater restrictions have come back in during the course of the second quarter, you do see negative impacts on the business. Now over the last 15 months, we have worked very hard to make our business more adaptable and more agile and able to pivot in the restrictions to help the consumers get the beverages they love, but often in the very short-term it impacts the business. So if you look at places where infections have spiked up recently in the second quarter, so Vietnam went into some restrictions. They have done a good job of avoiding large restrictions and so they were doing fine the first few months of the year and then all of a sudden they have had some restrictions and they were negative in June. Similarly, India, earlier in the quarter, brought in a strong set of restrictions and the business went negative, but then when they reopened, they bounced back. So clearly, while we have adapted the business and made it more resilient to levels of lockdown, when these do occur, wherever they do occur around the world, it's going to impact the business. We are going to bounce back quicker and we are going to suffer less, but it is going to impact the business. And so as you think about the outlook, clearly, the direction of travel of COVID, its variants, the levels of infections and the levels of restrictions are going to make a difference to the business.  And then as it relates to immediate consumption and future consumption, if I look on a worldwide basis and I look on a two-year stack rate, what you can see is that now we have steadily improved through the course of the pandemic such that the immediate consumption of volumes are now slightly ahead of 2019 levels as we exited the second quarter in June. So and as I said in the opening or in the reflections on that first question from Dara on the U.S., that has not been followed by a mirror image decline in the at-home. Clearly, some of the at-home on a two-year stack basis goes down because people are now out and about and at work, and so you now see the two of them tracking, you see the at-home tracking at the 2019 levels as well. So that's why we feel that there's some sequential improvement coming in the downhill, moderate but some. Yeah. So, clearly, obviously, the comments I made about pricing are on the two-year stack basis and we kind of see when one takes out the effects of channel and geography, what you would see if you had all of the data, but what I am saying is that over the course of the pandemic, we have taken a steady approach to pricing to continue to price for our brand strength and RGM, and then of course, we manage input costs increases over time. And we use our hedging strategies to not have to try and minimize the amount of sudden bumps, because our overall belief is that, if we focus on creating the growth of the beverage category for our retail customers ahead of their overall business then that will be good for them and then we will do and gain share within that overall strategy and that is best executed through steady investment in brands, steady investment in execution, and the use of RGM to meet the consumer with the pack size and the price point that they want. And that includes, then, managing through the increases in input costs in a rational and staged way and we obviously leverage hedging to make that easier for us to do. And so we do believe that categories, well, those people who have brands that have strong consumer resonance will be able to pass through costs, as we have done historically. We have -- whilst in the U.S. inflation has been very moderate for an extended period of time as it has been in Europe, we have plenty of other country in the world which experience high or double-digit levels of inflation. And so the strategy on how to manage through that and stay engaged with the consumer to keep the momentum in the business and keep the margin structure steady or improving is a capability of the system. Sure. Thanks, Carlos. I mean, we continue to drive the collaborations and the innovations. If I just pick up a few of the ones that we have sort of elliptically connected to today. WABI, which started in Latin America both as B2C and B2B. We have used the platform to work with our bottlers in other parts of the world, whether that be Europe or beyond, on helping us work together to improve the digitization and the B2B capability beyond that. So you are seeing expansions of those experiments out of Latin America. You will see expansions of experiments in the U.S., whether it be AHA, which has continued to perform very well in the U.S. so far this year. We have launched that in China or in fairlife, which has done very well in the U.S. We are taking that to China as well. And so there's some kind of moving from the west to the east. You have got experiments that were taking place on Topo Chico Hard Seltzer which kind of started in a way as a global idea. It's now in each of the continents and we have continued to expand it. There are some things going on in Asia in the kind of non-black tea segments where we experimented in some of the ASEAN countries and is expanding round. So there really are some great experiments out there. You could even go to some of the packaging ones like the use of rPET, 100% recycled PET, which is really a key factor in driving a circular economy around packaging materials, started really in Europe, coming to the U.S. recently with the 13-ounce bottle that we have put into the market. So we are never satisfied as a kind of philosophical starting point, but they are certainly starting to see more experiments happen out there and more discipline in working, which aren't working and stopping them and which have legs to be taken to the next place. And interestingly, you are starting to see those experiments move in all directions. It's not just developed -- to developing or west to east or any one direction. It's actually really starting to be ideas coming from all around the world and really having to go through and work out, which ones deserve the shot at expanding globally. Yeah. Sure. So we are still very much in the learning phase. It's not a category we are familiar with, particularly with the alcohol. It's got a number of important characteristics and regulatory characteristics and business characteristics that we need to learn about. So we have not got to a stage of concluding anything more strategic or coming to the point of view that there is a bigger vision for us out there in the flavored alcoholic beverage space. We want to learn and understand more before we decide anything one direction or the other. As it relates to some of the learnings so far, I mean, clearly, what we have discovered is obviously it makes a difference if the category exists or doesn't exist in any particular country. I mean, we are in 17 markets to-date. We are on track to be in 28 markets around the world by the end of the year. We are learning what it takes to compete where the category exists. We are learning what it takes to help grow the category where it doesn't exist. So we are pleased, for example, in Latin America, where for example, in Mexico, we are the number two hard seltzer and getting some good traction and good velocity in Brazil, where it's more of an undeveloped category. There's more kind of development needed as we are trying to work out how that happens. Similarly in Europe, it's the number one or two performer in terms of rates and velocity in Europe and so I think it's very interesting what's happening there. And obviously in the U.S., it's got a lot of good traction, while it's still of course relatively small overall nationally, it's done particularly well where we have focused or where Molson is focused to launch, which is in Texas and it's done very well in Texas, looking good in kind of the southern states, California, in Florida too. Retail customers, we understand they are very bullish, lots of display activity and activity. So we are looking to see that continue to expand. Of course, we are conscious that the overall hard seltzer category has come down in terms of its overall growth rates in the U.S. That's not ultimately that big of a surprise to us, because it is a category that has been predominantly an at-home channel category, much less bars and restaurants category. And so as people have gone back out, clearly, some of those occasions have moved from at-home to away-from-home. So it's not too surprising that some of the strong tailwinds the category got in the lockdowns have lessened. But we still think it's very interesting. It's got some long-term potential in the U.S. It's very on-trend for a lot of consumers. And so we are continuing to look at that and push on that and invest to see where we can go. Yeah. I mean, in terms of kind of two ways of looking at it, one, those countries where the Olympics are broadcast too and then the actual activation in Japan itself. I mean, clearly, in Japan, given the restrictions, we have dialed back all the physical activations and are supporting appropriately, keeping supply of beverages to the athletes, et cetera. But the physical activation is essentially not going to happen. And then -- and so really it's as much as anything, it's about leveraging the airtime that the Olympics are going to get in places like the U.S. to market our programs. But very specific marketing activation at a large galley isn't going to happen in part because of the slight uncertainty of whether they were going to happen or not led us to move away from having any large extra fixed cost investment in activating the market, the Olympics for this year and so we will leverage the airtime to market our brands. You can still note even today the deputy, one of the people in Tokyo said that, who knows what's going to happen whether it will actually start. So we very much are taking the approach of take away the physical activation, take away any fixed cost that can only be used in the event of the Olympics and use any rights and times we have for the general marketing of our brands. Yeah. Laurent, I mean, we are -- obviously, the answer is it depends in a way, because each country has a slightly different mix from the starting point of Zero or depending if you are in a country that still has got Diet or Light and the size of Classic. So the starting point matters. Two, clearly it's a mix of everything. What we like most about driving Coke Zero Sugar is we get a lot of business that is not self-cannibalization. If it was all just coming from Coke and Coke Light, it would be perhaps necessary, but not very exciting. What's exciting about it is that we are helping expand the Coke franchise. So, in other words, if you start standing back and looking at it globally, you can see both the growth of Coke Original, the very fast Coke growth of Coke Zero, only some of which is coming from the cannibalization of Coke Light or Diet Coke depending on where you are in the world. So it's a net accretion to the Coke franchise. Thanks very much everyone. As we said at the beginning, look we are delivering on the priorities we set out for ourselves to emerge stronger. Hopefully, you could see that in both the results and our guidance. And we just want to take the opportunity to thank once again the extraordinary effort of our associates, of our bottling partners and all our partners that have allowed us to deliver these results and to raise our guidance for the outlook. Our system is strong. Our bottling partners are strong. We continue to invest behind momentum and the huge growth opportunity ahead of us. Thanks for your interest, your investment and for joining us today."

            "name": "John Murphy",
            "content": "Thank you, James. This morning, I will highlight the drivers of our second quarter performance, as well as our revised guidance. In the second quarter, we built on the momentum from the beginning of the year and our business mix improved as consumer mobility increased across many markets. Our Q2 organic revenue was up 37% comprised of concentrate shipments up 26% and price/mix improvement of 11% as we lapped the biggest pandemic impacts of 2020. Unit case growth was 18%. Our shipments outpaced unit cases in the quarter and year-to-date due to cycling the destocking we experienced last year and certain timing impacts this year, including five additional days in the first quarter. Improvement in the away-from-home channels and positive segment mix from higher growth in our finished goods businesses positively impacted our price/mix. Channel and package mix also affected comparable gross margin, which showed significant improvement relative to last year, even with certain inflationary costs like transportation coming through. As we have said throughout the pandemic, our goal is to emerge stronger and we are investing ahead of recovery as markets reopen. As a result, we have doubled our marketing dollars year-over-year, cycling the significant pullback from the same period last year. Even with a step-up in those investments, we delivered a 170-basis-point improvement in comparable operating margins driven by the strong topline. Below operating income, we saw a benefit from improvement in our equity income, as our bottling partners also emerged stronger, as well as reduced interest expense on a comparable basis. As a result, second quarter comparable EPS of $0.68 was an increase of 61% year-over-year. We also delivered strong year-to-date free cash flow of approximately $5 billion, double last year's results. Our cash flow performance has also driven the return of our leverage to within the targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times. Since we reiterated guidance last quarter, the operating environment and our business have clearly improved. Given the improvement year-to-date and the increased visibility, we are raising our outlook for the full year. We now expect to deliver year-over-year organic revenue growth of 12% to 14% and comparable EPS growth of 13% to 15% in 2021. Our steady focus on cash generation continues to yield progress and our updated guidance for free cash flow of at least $9 billion implies a dividend payout ratio significantly improved from where we began the year and is edging closer to our targeted level of 75% over the long-term. So as we think about the remainder of the year a few things to keep in mind. The recovery phase continues to be asynchronous creating a dynamic demand environment in addition to causing many parts of the supply chain to experience tightness as a result. While experiencing some isolated pressure points, our team is navigating the challenges well through supplier diversification and inventory management. Despite recent upward pressures in many commodities driven by pandemic related disruption, we feel good about the rest of the year and as we anticipate hedges rolling off in 2022, we are working with our system to take appropriate action in the back half of this year to manage the ongoing volatility using revenue growth management capabilities and supply chain productivity levers. With regard to marketing investment, we have three priorities, increase consumer-facing marketing spend toward levels similar to 2019, improve the quality of that spend, and allocate the spend in a more targeted manner. Our currency outlook continues to contemplate a tailwind of 1% to 2% to the topline and approximately 2% to 3% to comparable EPS in 2021, based on current spot rates and our hedge positions. That said, the currency markets remain volatile and dependent on recovery from the pandemic, as well as macroeconomic factors. We will also have some additional timing considerations with the leveling out of our concentrate shipments that are running a bit ahead year-to-date, as well as six fewer days in the fourth quarter. To summarize, our company and our system have tackled many challenges through the pandemic, but we are emerging stronger, thanks to the hard work of our people and the focus on our strategic priorities. With our networked organization up and running, we are on a path to operate more efficiently and effectively, and to unlock the enormous potential we have in our brand and across our markets. As James mentioned earlier, we remain clear eyed as we look at the rest of the year, with many markets continuing to face obstacles, such as the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, but others continue to see the benefits of reopening. Overall, we are pleased with our progress in the first half of the year and we are grateful for the commitment from the stakeholders across our ecosystem that contributed to our results. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions. Yeah. Thanks, Lauren. And you are right, it would take the rest of the call to explain all that happened before, so I will spare you. But let's take a step back and I think it's the first part to your question or the first part of the answer is, let's think about the two-year picture. In 2020, we saw -- at the gross margin line, we saw expansion, driven primarily by a significant scale-back of our operating costs and marketing investments, even despite there being also some gross margin compression in the same period. In 2021, we are pleased with the progress year-to-date on getting gross margins back to where we would like them to be, and I think, we will continue to see us get back close to 2019 levels by the end of the year. But we are also -- as James highlighted in his \u2013 in the script, we are also very focused on investing in our brands and our key markets for the future. We've seen a good step-up already year-to-date and we continue to have that as a major priority for the second half of the year. So, in a nutshell, if you take a two-year picture, you are going to see -- on the operating margin front, you will see 2021 is -- there will be some compression versus 2020, just given the nature of, what I just said, gross margins getting back, not quite there, significant focus on reinvesting back into the business for the mid- to long-term. But the good news, I think, by the end of this year 2021 will be better than 2019. So that's first part one. Part two is if you look at 2022 onwards, we've talked about our flywheel driving the business from the top line through a much stronger marketing and innovation agenda to support the streamlined portfolio of brands that we now are focused on. We've talked about innovation as being a continued driver of growth in the future and that all wraps into execution in the marketplace with our bottling partners and through a variety of levers and not the least of which is our RGM lever. So going into 2022, 2023, 2024, the goal is the same as it has been. It's to continue to be hyper-focused on improving our overall margin equation and Q2 was a good shot in the arm for us to continue on that path. Thanks, Bryan. Yeah. On the first part, I think, again, looking at the year-to-date, I think, we saw a big rebound in the second quarter. We are doubling our spend on consumer facing activities and for the rest of the year with an eye to both delivering the year, but also being well-prepared for 2022, we have a very robust investment agenda that will see us getting back to 2019 levels and that's just comparing dollars. When you look under the hood though, I think, one of the big changes we have made in recent months is to improve the quality of that spend. And so my working with Manolo, our objective is to be able to actually generate more with the same and we are pleased with the progress that we are making in that space, particularly as you think about some of the newer areas, digital media, et cetera. Regarding the savings, it's a piece of the overall equation, and I think, for me, rather than provide hard numbers, it gives us a degree of flexibility to invest behind some of the bigger bets to think about our ongoing ability to pivot as market conditions dictate. And so it's really less around taking those savings to the bottomline and much more around having to flex to be well-positioned to go after opportunities as we see them. Thanks, Bonnie. A couple of comments, one is, the first half of the year, we saw gallons ahead of cases, which we would expect to normalize in the second half of the year. So I think you have got to factor that into account. Secondly, in the first quarter we had a few extra days and they would come off in the fourth quarter. So that's a big piece of the equation that we have designed for the full year. And then secondly, as we have already discussed, in the investment space too, we look to sort of end the full year with our marketing investments continuing to step up and margins back to better than 2019, but not as strong as 2020. So that's all factored in. Yeah. I'd say that refer us back to our long-term algorithm. We are managing to as we have been discussing a very interesting period. We still think that the, when you take all of the puts and takes with the businesses that we have at the moment that the long-term algorithm is still one that best reflects what we can deliver over the coming years. Now, clearly, as the business mix changes, we would need to review that. But I think the -- I'd just refer you back to the algorithm and we don't see that changing in the foreseeable future. And if I may, James, I think, in the supply chain also there's over the last 12 months to 18 months it's a tremendous amount of partnership collaboration that is delivering results in the individual entities across the world that I think will continue."

[Operator instructions] I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's media relations department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President of Investor Relations, Financial Planning, and Analysis. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. I apologize, but there will be a slight delay in today\u2019s conference. Please hold and the conference will resume momentarily. Thank you for your patience.\nTim Leveridge: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our Chief Financial officer.  Before we begin, please note that we posted schedules under the Financial Information tab in the investors section of our company website at www.coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion, to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles.

If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then re-enter the queue. Now I'd like to turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In what remains a highly dynamic environment, our first quarter results show promising signs that a broader recovery is on the horizon. We're encouraged by early results in markets where mobility is on the rise. This morning, I'll share what we're seeing around the world and provide an update on the actions we've taken to accelerate our transformation, including improvements in our portfolio, innovation, and marketing approaches enabled by the evolution of our culture and our network organization. Then, I'll hand over the call to John to discuss the financial details of the quarter, and how we'll continue to deliver on our objectives over the course of the year. In the first quarter, we positioned our business to recovery while executing against our emerging stronger agenda, equipping our system to win. At the start of the year, pandemic-related lockdowns were still impacting many markets. We moved quickly as conditions changed, improving along the way and getting better at managing each wave and its resulting lockdowns. During the quarter, we saw mobility increase in some parts of the world where lockdowns eased and vaccinations accelerated. Leveraging our learnings, we drove sequential improvement in our business throughout the quarter. And while we saw mid-single-digit volume declines through mid February, trends have improved since then. We're pleased to say that March marked a return to volume levels seen in March 2019 prior to the pandemic.  We continue to see ongoing strength in at-home channels offset by away from home trends, which have improved sequentially, but remain pressured relative to pre pandemic levels. We're working with our customers and bottling partners to sustain at-home momentum and capture improving away-from-home demand. For example, in Latin America, our Prospera program with our bottlers helps the traditional trade thrive through assistance with their marketing efforts, resulting in outperformance in this critical channel. In Great Britain, we launched Open, a business accelerator program to support pubs, bars, and cafes. In North America, our use of meal bundles is driving incidence in pickup and delivery transactions with foodservice customers. In 2020, we gained underlying share in both at-home and away-from-home channels offset by negative channel mix. This continues to be the dynamic affecting our share year-to-date. Through our ongoing initiatives and as away-from-home demand improves over the course of the year, we will seek to build on these wins in 2021. There are clear opportunities to reaccelerate share positions as the recovery plays out and we will invest to drive momentum with focus on flexibility. In markets at the forefront of the recovery, we've seen early signs that our actions taken during the pandemic are helping us outpace recovery. It's important to note that the path to a full recovery remains asynchronous around the world. Many markets haven't yet turned a corner and are still managing through the restrictions. Looking around the world in Asia Pacific, China continues to lead the recovery with volume in the first quarter ahead of 2019 results and foot traffic almost back to pre-pandemic levels. Strong performance in India and Southwest Asia was driven by effective marketing across brands, affordable solutions and distribution expansion with 250,000 new outlets and 45% more new coolers. Despite the unexpected state of emergency earlier in the year, Japan expanded its successful RGM initiatives geographically and across brands to help drive improvements later in the quarter. In EMEA, vaccine rollout in Europe has been slower than anticipated, and many countries have been impacted by ongoing lockdowns. In Eurasia and Middle East, brand Coke recruited 4.4 million consumers through affordability packages and a focus on at-home occasions. New marketing campaigns drove improvement in flavored sparkling soft drinks and FUZE TEA registered an all-time high value share in Turkey. In Africa, mass vaccination is expected to take longer than the developed markets; and despite ongoing volatility, Africa worked closely with our bottlers to deliver volume growth led by stepped-up execution through cooler placement and affordability packs like returnable glass bottles. In North America, the year is off to a good start. Ongoing strength in at-home channels was driven by core brands in our Sparkling portfolio as well as Simply, fairlife, and Gold Peak, all with encouraging results. Away from home began to improve in March as vaccinations and mobility picked up. In Latin America, we leveraged our core brands, digital initiatives, and refillable packages to recover ahead of the economy and our industry despite ongoing restrictions. While from away from home continues to be impacted by lockdowns, we're expanding the at-home consumption opportunity leveraging consumer dynamics like indulgence of single-serve multi-packs. Global Ventures continue to be impacted by lockdowns in the UK. But as restrictions loosen, we're focusing on driving digital engagement and traffic back to the cost of stores. Cost of express machines continued to deliver strong performance. Turning to our transformation, our operating units are up and running and off to a very good start in the rollout of our new model. Across markets, our newly networked organization has us working more collaboratively with the overall enterprise in mind. Our operating unit and category leadership teams are working together to identify the most promising combinations across the industry based on economic outlook, consumer trends, channel dynamics, and execution imperatives. We're using more disciplined resource allocation to capture the biggest opportunities while making ongoing portfolio decisions faster and at scale. We're focused on our streamlined growth portfolio actively and thoughtfully transitioning brands to more powerful trademarks using a phased approach to bring the consumer with us on the journey. And we're maximizing shelf space and new product launches and higher velocity products to drive higher-quality growth. As we discussed at CAGNY, we're focusing on what we do best, marketing our loved brands in more efficient and effective ways. As Sprite Let's Be Clear campaign kicked off in markets from Asia to Africa to Latin America, the message is resonating with consumers with impressions, views, and engagement levels above last year, and intent-to-purchase metrics showing promising signs. This campaign aligns with our transition to a more sustainable clear bottle, which is important in helping us achieve our world without waste goals. Our media and creative agency reviews are progressing and we're also executing more targeted opportunities in addition to the big strategic shifts. For instance, we've taken a scaled, digitized approach to buying trade materials, resulting in up to 15% cost reduction and improved user experience, all while offering more consistent, better quality, and sustainable alternatives. We've extended this pool buying opportunity to our bottlers, many of whom are already on board to share the benefits systemwide. And our more disciplined innovation approach is yielding results as we balance big bets with intelligent experimentation. Using our network approach, we're scaling our best innovations quickly and effectively, while being disciplined with those that don't get the traction required for further investment. Local experiments like Aquarius with functional benefits and Ayataka Cafe Matcha Latte in Japan Fanta's exciting mystery flavor innovation in Europe. And package innovations like a 13.2 ounce recycled PT bottle in North America could all be lifted and shifted globally over time, similar to what we're doing this year with a half flavored sparkling water. Our big bets for 2021 include ongoing work to scale our coffee platform on the Costa. We're expanding ready to drink coffee in China and taking portfolio approach to complement our powerful Georgia coffee brand in Japan. We're also rolling out an enhanced formula and package designed for Coca Cola Zero Sugar this month in Europe and Latin America and across markets globally later this year. The improved recipe brings its taste even close to that of the iconic Coca Cola original taste. These were influenced by consumer insights and are focused on constant improvement. And despite its enormous success, Coca Cola Zero Sugar still represents a relatively small percentage of the trademark. And we continue to respond to consumer desires for lower sugar options, and the rollout will be supported by a global occasion based marketing campaign. Finally, it's early days. But we're excited to come back and report on an expanded experimentation in flavored alcoholic beverages with Topo Chico Hard Seltzer in Latin America, Europe, and most recently the US. We also continue to rapidly digitize our ecosystem. For example, our Chatbot in South Africa engages with consumers on social media to increase away from home transactions. In China, we've used digital campaigns to harness consumer data to drive traffic, and incidents leading to incremental growth. We're using machine learning and AI tools to stay on top of a rapidly evolving consumer trends and identify emerging needs. Our dedicated digital transformation structure leading to strong online to offline growth. We've seen ecommerce share gains in key advanced markets like North America, Japan and Great Britain. And in markets like Turkey, where the channel is still developing with more than tripled sales, and gained almost 10 points per share versus last year. As always, we're supporting these initiatives with strong revenue growth management and execution. Through RGM, we continue to capture at-home occasions with multi-pack options in both premium and affordable segments, while expanding distribution of smaller packaging like our sleek cans in China. And we have affordability plays like a successful refillables in Latin America to Philippines and now Africa. As part of our new organization, we're dedicating more resources to RGM continuing to raise the bar to even higher standards. In many markets, we're working with our bottling partners to optimize cooler placement, driving incremental volume through outstanding customer service, higher cooler productivity and innovation. Our bottling partners are executing strongly. And together, we are working on initiatives across the enterprise to identify more efficiency. We're operating in a networked way, leveraging our platform services organization to scale our collected data, marketing, digital and supply chain capabilities. Our system continues to evolve, as shown by the pending combination of Coca Cola, European partners, and Coca Cola Amatil. And just this morning, we announced our intent to list Coca Cola beverages Africa as an independent African bottler through an initial public offering. I'm especially proud of how we're delivering on our purpose as a company. Every action is guided by our ambition to create a more sustainable business and better shared future that makes a difference in people's lives, our communities and the planet. Throughout the pandemic, we focus on helping communities through relief funds from the company and the Coca Cola Foundation. In this next phase, we are supporting vaccination efforts in regions where distribution has been slower. For instance, in Brazil, our system has partnered with the country's Ministry of Health to co create a vaccine awareness campaign. We're using our network to deliver 700,000 posters with vaccine information to more than 350,000 mom and pop stores. Tomorrow we will release our 2020 business and ESG report where we will highlight last year's progress. While 2020 was a milestone year in terms of meeting and exceeding some previous goals, by women's empowerment and Global Water replenishment, we continue to work toward an even more ambitious agenda. This includes our 2025 and 2030 packaging goals, our 2030 climate goal and our new 2030 water security strategy, with more details to come later this year. In conclusion, we're optimistic about the future and bullish about our ability to continue to deliver on the objectives we laid out at the height of the crisis. More consumers, more share, better system economics and a positive stakeholder impact. Now I'll turn the call to John to discuss how we're delivering results through a continued dynamic environment.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James. And good morning to everybody on the call. Today, I will highlight our first quarter performance and go over our top line and earnings guidance which we are reiterating. Then I'll provide a progress update on working capital, our ability to manage through the current commodity environment, and other factors that may impact our outlook. 2021 is off to a good start with the quarter showing steady sequential monthly improvement. We're leveraging our learnings and strategic initiatives from 2020 and leaning into growth in a thoughtful way. Our Q1 organic revenue was up 6% driven by concentrates shipments of 5%. And price mix improvement of 1%. By shipments benefit from certain timing impacts and the five additional days this quarter versus last year. Unit case volume was flat versus the toughest quarterly compare of 2020. And March volume was in line with 2019 levels, largely driven by strength in Asia Pacific. Comparable gross margins although still down year-over-year improved sequentially driven by less pressure from channel and package mix. And while currency was still somewhat of a drag, it was less of a headwind than prior quarters.  Comparable operating margin expanded through ongoing discipline cost management. We continue to reintroduce marketing spend in a targeted way, particularly as we ramp up investments in markets that are seeing recovery. First quarter comparable EPS of $0.55 is an increase of 8% year-over-year and was driven by top line growth, margin improvement and some contribution from equity income offset by currency headwinds. Regarding our ongoing tax case with the IRS, there are no material updates since our last report. Our decisions and actions from last year certainly were not easy. But we are seeing the results of our efforts start to come through. And our organization is embracing the changes as we move forward into the recovery phase. We stayed very focused on driving a healthy top line. And we remain on a journey to maximize returns, including strong cash flow generation. We never relented on our cash flow goals, and indeed have had an even sharper focus on managing capital spend and working capital. Since we embarked on a journey toward best-in-class working capital performance, we've made great strides in extending our payment terms, generating a working capital improvement of more than a $1 billion over two years. In the same vein, we are implementing accounts receivables factoring programs, which are rolling out across a number of markets, and also looking at initiatives to better manage inventory days. At the center of these efforts, is a robust digitization, and automation agenda. In addition, and you've heard us talk conceptually about the network model. This is a great example of the network in action. When you put the right people from different parts of the organization against key initiatives, it delivers a step change in performance. Last quarter, we said that despite rising commodity environments, we expected a relatively benign impact in 2021, given our hedged positions. While this continues to be the case, we're closely monitoring upward pressure in some inputs, such as high fructose corn syrup, PT, metals, and other packaging materials that impact us as well as our bottling partners. Given the environment we will continue to benefit from revenue growth management initiatives through intelligently diverse price tag architecture, we can produce a range of options that meet the needs of consumers across the income spectrum, while also capturing value for customers. 2020 provided great learnings on how to be more surgical and data driven in our promotions, and we will continue to be purposeful in our approach, driven by the consumer and the strength of our brands. We will also continue to pursue productivity across the supply chain pushing all levers at our disposal. Since we last provided guidance, the US dollar has strengthened. And as we noted in our release, we now expect currency to be a tailwind of approximately 1% to 2% to the top line, and approximately 2% to 3% to comparable EPS in 2021 based on current spot rates and our hedged positions. For the full year, we now expect an underlying effective tax rate of 19.1%. Putting it all together, our quarterly performance and the momentum we saw in March give us confidence in our ability to achieve our 2021 guidance. We expect high single digit organic revenue growth and high single digit to low double digit growth in comparable earnings per share. We still expect recovery to be a synchronous and to see signs of return to normal in more markets later in 2021. We are preparing our end-to-end supply chain for stronger demand and will fuel the momentum in recovering markets as they emerge from the pandemic by accelerating investments in our brands. There's no doubt that uncertainty remains. Europe continues to see challenges, many countries and regions like Latin America and Africa, expect further waves and slower vaccine distribution. And India is seeing a surge in cases and responding with localized lockdowns. But as we begin to lap the most difficult periods from last year, we feel good about our position, and our ability to navigate the environment, as a company, and as a system. Based on the lessons we've learned, and the agility provided by our new networked organization. We remain confident that our actions and the progress we've made will enable us to deliver 2021 earnings at or above 2019 levels. With that operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDaraMohsenian: Hey, guys. So clearly top line growth in Q1, and it recovered to a greater extent than the market expected. You guys mentioned a good start to the year with sequential improvement. So, I guess, a, can you just discuss volume trends in March in markets where restrictions have loosened and mobility has picked up such as the US, maybe contrast that with the markets where restrictions are still in place and what that portends going forward? And then, b, totally understand it's a very fluid environment. But with March volume already back to 2019 levels with the topline upside in the quarter, can you just help me understand the unchanged full-year topline outlook? And is it just that it's early given the volatility and we only have one quarter in the books to become more positive on the full year? Just sort of trying to understand your mindset on the full year revenue guidance relative to the Q1 upside. Thanks.\nJamesQuincey: Sure. Thanks Dara. So firstly, the first quarter was strong. Absolutely, we gained momentum and we achieved that good momentum in the first quarter, which is really the fruition of the emerging stronger plan we set out a year ago, saying we wanted to get back to 2019 levels well ahead of the economy by gaining more share, more customers, better system economics. And I think that's what you're starting to see happen in the first quarter. And obviously, we've been driving that by focusing on the brands and on the innovation. And the bottlers have been executing in the marketplace, and it's certainly heartening to see us get back to 2019 volume levels in March. And we did all of that whilst doing -- finishing the implementation of the reorganization, sothe employees on the company side were able to both deliver the results and stand up the new organization with the operating units and platform services and really hit the ground running. So, I think it is actually a super creditable performance in the first quarter. Secondly, the downhill and the question about guidance. I mean, ultimately, it's early and it's not early, just in a normal sense, it\u2019s early in the context of the pandemic. Also, breaking the news today is that weekly new cases of COVID have hit an all-time peak.  So while vaccinations are rising in many countries, US, UK, et cetera, the flipside is there's actually a new high in terms of cases, obviously a number of developing markets but also Europe as well continental Europe as well. So, the visibility into the downhill is very much linked to the trajectory of the pandemic, and as it relates to our business, the trajectory of the lockdowns, very clearly as we've talked on previous quarters, lockdowns because we have half our business in away from home are impacted directly by the degree of lockdown, and though there are still lockdowns coming on, a number in Europe, some of the developing markets, conversely as markets start to open, it's worth remembering. It's not an on/off switch. There\u2019s a phasing of how markets tend to reopen. And that's true to the US, so for example in the US, the fountain volumes were still negative in March because whilst people are going out to restaurants and there's more mobility, it's not back to what it was. The occupancy levels of offices are nowhere near a 100%, and so reopening is not an on/off switch.  There's a rebuilding and there's a series of phases of reopening. And so, that's a very important factor and it's somewhat unpredictable with the downhill. So it's too early to call not in a business sense, but in a lockdown and reopening sense. And the reality is that there are more cases now than they were a while ago. So, we still feel very confident in our guidance on the top and the bottom line, but there's a lot of managing left to do and we\u2019re certainly focused on giving ourselves the flexibility and agility to be able to do that. And which leads me to my third point, which I think is worth making. Unlike normal times, one should not automatically assume that more revenue is always going to flow straight down to the bottom line. Much as we did in 2020, we are going to be very judicious and focused on investing where we believe reopening and demand is coming back and not investing, if we don't think the response in the marketplace is there. So you're going to see as we go through 2021, we will be looking at both levers. If we see that demand is coming in at the kind of the higher end, there's more reopenings happen more quickly for whatever reason, and revenue start to accelerate, we\u2019re also likely to reaccelerate the restitution of the marketing spend. Conversely, if for whatever reason revenue starts to look a little weaker, then we are likely to hold back on some of the marketing. So, I think it's important as you think about the rest of the year that you don't think of it as normal times one has to think about how we are using the resources judiciously and wanting to invest to drive growth and get back to normal. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryanSpillane: Hey, thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. John, I wanted to pick up on some of the comments you made relative to inflation, and I guess kind of thinking about it past '21 and into '22, just given the recent trends, which have elevated pretty meaningfully across a lot of inputs really across our whole coverage universe. If that stays in effect for '22, can you talk a little bit about what you can do working with the system with the bottlers to try to manage that inflation, and really beyond revenue management? So just how much, what type of actions can you take in terms of procurement, maybe finding inefficiencies that exist between the Coca-Cola company and the bottling systems, just really trying to understand, in a scenario where inflation stays meaningfully elevated in a way that we haven't seen in a real long time, just what types of things you can contemplate to try to help the system manage that inflation.\nJohnMurphy: Thank you, Bryan. Good morning. Good topic. And one that with our bottling partners around the world, we're looking as a very holistic manner, managing inflation is not new to the system. And it's one it's an area that needs to be looked us locally and working closely in partnership with our bottlers. As you're saying the inflationary pressures, particularly surrounding some of our key commodities, looks like it is going to be more of a headwind in '22, '21 we are, as we said, in the release pretty well covered and in good shape. And so when you think about the actions we take, first and foremost, I think it is important to highlight that as an over arching principle around the world, we typically look to take pricing in line with inflation. And I would expect that principle will continue to be adhere to as we move into the back half of '21, and even then into '22. Secondly, while, I know you mentioned beyond RGM, I do think it's important to reinforce the value that RGM brings to being able to execute a pricing strategy in the most relevant and meaningful fashion locally. And so that will continue to be a key priority. Thirdly, on the things that we can do on the productivity area, I would point to our supply chain particularly with our bottling partners in the last 6 to 12 months coming through the pandemic and indeed coming out of us that the level of engagement we've had with our -- within the system unlocking value in the supply chain through greater efficiencies, has been phenomenal. And I would expect that momentum to continue into the rest of this year and into 2022. We have had over the last number of years, the benefits of leveraging our cross enterprise procurement group, a group of people that work on behalf of the entire system around the world that are able to leverage the global scale of the system. And I think arrive us some of the most competitive pricing that we can get that anybody can get when it comes to key inputs. So when you take a sort of an overarching holistic view of us, we've got a, I think, a tried- and-true practice of being able to take pricing enlightenment and inflation leverage RGM to do it in the most intelligent fashion, and increasingly operate as a global system to leverage our scale, taking into account some of the sort of the historic groups we have like cross enterprise procurement, but also new opportunities abounding as a result of the overall strategy we've been pursuing during and after the pandemic.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.\nNikModi: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. James, I was hoping you could provide some tangible examples of how the company's new decision making infrastructure is manifested in better outcomes, generally, and maybe just kind of contrast that to what those decisions would have looked like under the older model. Thank you.\nJamesQuincey: Sure, Nik, a few examples. One, I think John's already mentioned, the cash flow, we struggle for many years to get up into best-in-class cash conversion, or working capital. And the work that has been done by the finance network has produced a great result. And that's clearly flowing through not just in terms of the kind of theoretical, amount of days working capital, but the actual cash coming into the company in the first quarter, which was a really strong result, and then something that we have struggled to do in the past. Another example with -- we have been rolling out a global campaign on Sprite, which has got excellent early traction, in terms of consumer engagement, in terms of purchase intent. And that was developed by the category leads and the key operating units, and has been rolled out across the world, something that we were unable to do or unable to convince ourselves to do historically. And so we believe that is making some cut through. The supply chain optimization working with the bottlers and really focusing on reducing the unit cost of what we do and looking at across all the metrics, and increasing data transparency is happening. And then you go to some of the platform services, where we're really starting to be able to implement, especially in those areas, where one single global solution makes total sense. We've had examples from, buying trade materials, through global platforms driving significant savings for ourselves and the system. And then hopefully, later this month, we'll turn on our latest SAP update, which will go from the one that was done 20 years ago, which was probably one of the world's most complicated and therefore most expensive to a much more effective solution. So I think across the company, from the front end of marketing, and engaging with consumers, through our operations through to the bottlers we're able to make the contact points and get faster, better solutions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLaurenLieberman: Great, thanks so much. Good morning. And this is probably a good lead in from all three of the last questions. But I want to talk a little bit about profitability because it was interesting to me that I think margins in almost every division outside of EMEA were comfortably ahead of where they were in the first quarter of 2019. And knowing that COVID comps weren't necessarily a dynamic for all regions in the first quarter of last year, if I still benchmark back to '19, the profitability improvements are significant. And so I was curious, how much knowing James your comments and wanting to invest to support recovery is a very important dynamic. But how much do you think of that margin improvement that we're seeing. So, at this point is tied to these broad range of cost management initiatives across the board and RGM, inclusive, versus timing of marketing, the need to put back in and continue funding the business, and it may be different region to region, of course, as well. Thanks.\nJamesQuincey: Yes. Thanks, Laura, look, clearly, the reinvestment of marketing is going to vary somewhat by region in 2021 for the reasons I outlined in that answer to the first question. So I think it's important as you think about margins to recognize that 2021 is also going to be a somewhat a typical year, there will be markets around the world where we judge the situation such that we don't have a normal level of marketing. And so that does tend to favor margins, operating margins at that point in time. And so it is important to break it apart and look at it by the different regions. We certainly are not coming out with some numerical margin target for many of the same reasons that we remove the previous target. And we are focused ultimately on growing the business. And embedded in our long-term growth model is an implicit assumption that we can slowly or steadily perhaps better said, improve margins over time, because there is a lot of efficiency work going on within the cost of goods sold, within the DME, particularly the non working part of the DME, we've got a lot of focus on the agency roster and how we spend the money we spend before we even gets to see the consumer. And obviously, we've done the network organization, which was about making us better able to support the growth aspirations, but it is also more efficient organization. And so all those things will go into the mix. And it would be remiss of me to not include the impact of RGM. Because to the extent that we can leverage RGM, that also helps on a gross margin, and ultimately operating income margins. So we will be pulling all those levers as we go through 2021. But again, it won't be a fully normal year in every region. And so you will see some of these strange effects.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlos Laboy with HSBC.\nCarlosLaboy: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Could you give us a sense of where you are seeing some notable progress this past year on digital transformation perhaps tied into this inflation end margin question, right, by commenting on how digital tools are perhaps helping you mitigate or stay ahead of inflationary pressure in some markets that might be getting ahead of the curve here.\nJamesQuincey: I mean, the digital transformation is much above and beyond coping with inflation, although, of course, some of the tools will help us manage if there's an inflationary spike. Clearly, you can look at the digital transformation in terms of our engagement with consumers. And there are some, good examples of progress, China, which is started the year very strongly not just compared to 2020 but compared to 2019. It's been a much bigger shift into digital engagement with consumers or even in Japan with our own Coke On apps that we use to connect people to the vending machines and the cashless options and a large uptick in monthly active consumers. So there is a great deal of progress being made in terms of how we engage through digital media, how we engage directly with consumers in a digital relationship that's helping there, the system I used, I talked about the example of buying materials with digital platforms. But clearly there's a huge piece of what needs to happen, which is the backbone of both the company and the bottlers and the interoperability of all the data, where we're making excellent progress. And ultimately all those insights and all those efficiencies help us manage the inflationary pressures out there whether we use the insights to engage more consumers or use the insight to drive the RGM thinking, an implementation or to identify efficiencies, I mean, in a way digital is becoming just the way business is done. And it's just like saying, I turn up and have to manage the business and use all these tools to do all the things I got to do.\nJohnMurphy: Maybe I just add one comment there, James. If you think about the emerging stronger program that we've outlined over the last six to nine months, it would not have been possible to do three years ago, and the degree to which we have been able to operate in a fast and efficient manner across the globe to deliver this program is all due to the fact that we have essentially become digitized in how we work and how we operate, just to support what James about your last comment there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nStevePowers: Thank you. Maybe pivoting back to the top line. So March volumes back to even with 2019 is just very key and promising milestone. And we've seen sequential progress over the last few quarters. But I guess I'm curious whether that trend back to 2019 levels have been relatively smooth on a global basis, or there's been more volatility underneath the service than we may appreciate looking at the headline numbers. So maybe if you could just frame for us how performance versus 2019 has trend over the past few months. And if you expect those trends to, and how you expect those trends to evolve over the course of the year in terms of whether it would be relatively smooth and even or lumpy with case counter vaccinations, and like I guess, ultimately, do you expect to be back to growth versus '19 when the dust settled on April? Or is that is that too ambitious?\nJamesQuincey: So the progress when you stand back and look at the numbers in aggregate, clearly, April was the deepest hole that we fell into in 2020. And then as we adapted the business, and really drove what we were doing, then, we sequentially got better. So kind of we fell into the hole, I think it was like minus 25 or something in April last year, and then it was negative teens, and then negative single digits, slowly improving through the rest of 2020 and then coming into 2021. Obviously, we then cycling the bad year, but if we compared to 2019, it got better as we went from January in February, which was still below the '19 levels. And obviously March was above, I mean, April has started well. It's obviously they are going to be the weirdest month because recycling something very low. I think most importantly, I would refer you back to the comment I made the second thing I said relative in the first answer, which is just because March has gone back to the level and just because April has started well, one week, there's no guarantee that that is then some kind of trend that is in the bank.  The principal uncertainty remains the risk of additional lockdowns. Much as 2020's numbers were heavily impacted by the degree of lockdown that will remain true this year. So whilst we've got back above the line of flotation in March, there's no guarantee there won't be some extra degree of lockdowns in May or September or December that then, puts pressure back on the business. So, I don't think I know I keep hitting this point, we had a superstar to the year, and the momentum is building. But this very unusual factor of the pandemic and the lockdowns continues to be an uncertainty factor that one can't draw a straight line through the historic data. Now, once you get under the surface of the overall global numbers, which kind of look like the kind of the tick mark if you like going down and then kind of steadily improving. Clearly, you get much more variability at a country level. Again, heavily influenced by the degree of lockdown. So in a sense, April last year was the worst because you had the most number of countries, most, the highest degree of synchronization of lockdowns globally and I think this idea of saying the recovery will be asynchronous, is we already see that in the first half, you've got countries where the vaccine levels are going up. And the reopening is occurring, US, UK, China for examples. And yet you've got countries going in exactly the opposite direction with cases shooting up, and more levels of lockdown. And that's what we're trying to highlight with this asynchronous. It may be that as a total company, it all looks smoothed out somewhat. But this asynchronous feature will be very important in 2021.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnieHerzog: All right, thank you, and good morning, everyone. I was just hoping to switch gears a little bit and maybe hear a little bit more color behind your decision to IPO Africa. I know you guys have explored a sale in the past. But why do you think, this is the right decision for that business? And then how do you expect this will impact the performance of the business going forward maybe potential benefits you might see? Thanks.\nJamesQuincey: Sure, thanks Bonnie. It means certainly, it's always been our intention to reduce our ownership in CCBA in line with our strategy, as John puts it, to become the world's smallest coke bottler. And so we were always contemplating how we would re-franchise CCBA. I mean, the CCBA, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa is a strong, well structured, capable bottler, and we have always considered as one of the options whether to have it be a free standing entity in Africa. And we have reached in inclusion that if one thinks about the future potential of the African market and the African continent, and how much long growth there is there. I mean, it is the youngest billion people are in Africa, we think it would -- we've ultimately contemplated it would be right for the development of the business in Africa to have an African headquartered African bottler that is operating on the continent. And so the read through is we believe in the future of Africa, as a continent as an economy, we think we've got a great, capable bottler that can help lead our ability to grow there. And then an IPO will allow us to set that up to be a source of growth for many years to come.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan.\nAndreaTeixeira: Thank you, operator and good morning. And so can you quantify how much the impact of the winter storms had in your volumes in Q1? And as a follow up on your comments before, can you please give us an idea how you're trending in Q2, the same way you did, it helped us in the first quarter. And just because just a quick one on US tax dispute. What is your base case in terms of the timing for the appeal at this point, and your impact on the cash flow?\nJohnMurphy: Yes. I'll take it. Maybe start with the tax question. Andrea thank you for the questions. But let's start with the tax question. In terms of to say on timing, it's -- we do not have a picture at the moment. We are dependent on the outcome of another case. Before any further developments take place with our own case. And we have no visibility into that outcome. So we'll keep you apprised as we know more. On the storms in the US, not a material impact to our business. And with regard to volumes in Q2, we're still early in the quarter and not lot to, we, not a lot to say at the moment. I think the key highlights really as we look at the downhill is the fact that March was significantly improved in a number of markets where mobility is improving and will continue I think to see a close relationship between mobility and our performance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse.\nKaumilGajrawala: Hi. Good morning, everybody. And fantastic pronunciation, operator. I don't get that frequently. Thank you. If I may ask James and John about competition and maybe particularly in the United States, looks like Pepsi is getting some momentum. We obviously just heard from them on Friday. Here, it seems, of course, that pricing remains rational. But perhaps from competitiveness, x-pricing, maybe that's increasing. So if you could just talk about what you're seeing there would be useful. Thanks.\nJamesQuincey: Well, certainly that we're always happy to see other companies invest into the beverage industry, because that tends to create more consumer engagement. And obviously, we pay attention to what they're doing, because hopefully we can learn from them. There are a lot of very capable competitors out there. So we like to learn from them. But in the end, we focus on what we can do. And in the US in particular, channel mix aside, we gain share, we gain share going forward in beverages in the US business. And we feel confident that as the channel trends and the reopening bring back the away from home businesses, which of course they started to do in March, then we will be able to capitalize on those trends, as well. And as it relates to promotional activity, I mean, ultimately, we are seeing a kind of rational pricing and promotional environment in the US. And we'll certainly be looking to build on that with our RGM capabilities and with the bottling system to really drive and leverage the investments we're collectively making as a system in the marketing and the execution to drive the business forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.\nRobOttenstein: Great, thank you very much. Couple of questions on Topo Chico, looks like a very strong start in the US with about a 3% market share. But you started even earlier, I think in October in Mexico and Brazil, and now rolling out in Europe. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you feel about the execution of the bottling network with an adult beverage? Any signs of trends in terms of repeat and some of the earlier markets and any general learning that you've gotten so far, as you evaluate what could be a new growth engine for the company? Thank you.\nJamesQuincey: Thanks Robert. So in the markets where it's been in longer say, Latin America, and Europe, about 40 markets between them. A couple of things we're seeing, obviously, the degree of resonances is depending on the degree of category development that might already exist or not exist in some of those markets. And so we've seen different levels of engagement depending on whether the categories there or not. Secondly, I mean, we're clearly in the mode of learning how to compete in this category, both from a branding point of view and from an execution point of view. But we're definitely starting to see improving trends and good repeats in the context of the different markets where it's been launched, whether that be Latin America, or in Europe, we're still building out distribution in Mexico, for example. But we've done a good start in Europe a little easier, as I said, because the categories a bit more developed in the West versus the East. And so our focus is maximizing the amount of learning that we're doing and as it relates to the US, whilst our overall share is three and I would double underline that, Topo Chico, as a brand is well known in the US, and therefore, driving or creating trial on a well known brand with an innovation is actually relatively straightforward. The key is to repeat. And we have not yet got to the point of having good repeat data in the US having opened big caveat umbrella, I would comment that, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer might have 3% overall in the US, but actually in Texas, where we've kind of concentrated some of the launch. It's almost hit a 20 share in the first two weeks of launch. So we are encouraged by the early results, but it's all going to come down to repeat and nothing's worth anything without repeat.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevinGrundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And congratulations on a nice progress this quarter. James, I wanted to come back to your Asia Pacific business, specifically China, obviously a really strong result this comes on the heels of PepsiCo strong results in China as well. China, obviously earlier to the pandemic than other countries, and then you're seeing nice strong consumer demand here. So a few questions, please. One, can you talk about what you're seeing by channels, both at-home and away from home, maybe comment briefly on the trends in April relative to the strong results in the first quarter? And then lastly, just how the strong demand in China may be informing your view with respect to recovery in other markets? Thank you.\nJamesQuincey: Sure. Yes, clearly good results in China. We're definitely I mean, obviously, we're laughing, and we're beginning to laugh to the kind of the worst part of 2020. But ahead of 2019, we've lengthened to the reopening and the reenergizing of China with the consumer marketing with a big push into digital engagement with the consumer with a big push into e-commerce. And we are benefiting from that. It is worth noting that in terms of the channels, almost what we see, and this is true, when you look at not just China, but if you start looking at Australia or even the US you see kind of phases or waves of the reopening. And so as the reopening occurs actually get a lot of people going out to restaurants and the kind of the full service eating away. And that goes up, bearing in mind that the universe of mom and pop stores and the universe of small restaurants has shrunk people that the number of people running those sorts of businesses has shrunk.  And I think we're gonna see that all across the world. So there is a consolidation factors. And as the reopening occurs, you see a lot of going out in the evenings. So all the channels related to that come back first. The second kind of wave of improvements in channels is loosely in the bucket of office and commuting. Because as reopening happens, people go out, yet the offices aren't back at 100% capacity. So you've not got that ecosystem of commuting and lunchtime in the big city centers at full. And that's the kind of the second business coming back in China. And actually, you don't see that back yet in the US in March, you see the restaurants kind of bouncing back. But you don't see the kind of the ecosystem of commuting and offices having bounced back anywhere near the same degree. And then there's a third phase, which hasn't really happened yet. Which is kind of the large gatherings kind of phase of channels, whether that be cinemas, concerts, sporting events, et cetera, et cetera? And that's only very partial coming back. So I think, think of this kind of a set of waves of reopening as the economy normalizes. And we thought about that. And we're kind of investing both in the consumer and the bottlers are doing a great job of investing for the customers and retailers. And we're seeing a very nice result.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sean King with UBS.\nSeanKing: Hey, thanks. This happens to a number of regions, but the APAC concentrate sales came in 11 points ahead of the unit case volume. But what drove that gap besides I guess the calendar shifts? And should we expect like a reversal in this dynamic or is it something that is sort of is going to continue as we see markets reopen?\nJamesQuincey: So for APAC, just specifically on your question, yes. APAC has run ahead, mainly due to the extra days in the quarter. And we also had a timing impact with regard to Chinese New Year in China, obviously. And so but for the quarter overall you saw gallons running ahead, mainly due to the extra days in the quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.\nLaurentGrandet: Yes, very nice pronunciation as well. So good morning, everyone. Yes, so I'd like to focus on emerging markets. So you said in your prepared remark that the volume case is correlated to the consumer mobility driven by vaccination rates. So, as I call into the video show, I mean, vaccination rates should be about 70% by the end of the year in developed market, but sadly, just about 20% in emerging markets. So should we consider then that emerging markets would be slower to recover? And really, probably, if you can provide some significant thought there, and maybe some granularity between that between regions? Thank you.\nJamesQuincey: Sure. So, I think, as you say, clearly, the vaccination rates in the developed markets are going to be ahead of the developing markets for the duration of this year. The critical factor to add to that is the market response to the level of cases or the low vaccination rates in the developing markets, because the thing that impacts our business most directly is the degree of lockdown. And so it's the response to the level of cases of the COVID and the resulting lockdowns, rather than necessarily directly the level of vaccination, because there are countries where the level of vaccination is low, because they had a strong lockdown, and then kind of lock the country up, say, Australia, whatever, then they've started to reopen. So the key factor to look for is the degree of lockdown and think through for that market, what's likely to happen, connected, of course, to the level of vaccinations, but also to the level of cases and what the policy response in the country is likely to be. And there'll be countries where I think, frankly, and unfortunately, they don't have the wherewithal and the fiscal capacity to implement large lockdowns, even if they not got all the vaccines that they want. And the markets remain open. And of course, we will look for ways to adapt the business to support the people, support the retailers and continue to engage with consumers as that goes on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with Truist Securities.\nBillChappell: Thanks, good morning. Hey, just want to follow up. And this is fairly near term and acute to the US, but I'm just trying to understand kind of the commentary of how you're looking at the business in that. I mean, it seems that the US will be different in kind of the reopening of everywhere else. So high majority of the population will be inoculated in the next 30 days, just as schools are getting out just as the weather's getting good. You have kind of sporting events talking about full capacity in June. I mean, are you -- is that a scenario you're prepared for and the bottling network is prepared for if the business, the on-premise business just explodes? And or do you really think that this is just going to be kind of go from phase two to phase three in May in phase four in June and slowly going to open up over the summer?\nJamesQuincey: What I think the phases are going to exist, Bill, there are just going to happen very quickly in the US. So if I look at what's already happening I put eating and drinking in the evening in kind of phase one. I mean, those that bit of the away from home was trending negative, in volume strongly negative in volume in January and February. And as the reopening happened, it jumps up in March. And as you say, as school, as education and at work opens, both of which are still running negative in March, I think they're going to jump up again. So what I think we're going to see, as the US completes its kind of rapid vaccination is a quick succession of the phases rather than a drawn out set of the phases. Other parts of the world where the vaccination programs are slower, then I think you'll see a more gradual phasing of what happens. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Okay, so thanks very much, everyone. It's certainly been great talking to you all. We had an excellent first quarter very encouraging. Still many of the parts of the world yet to emerge from the pandemic. But as we navigate this kind of dynamic environment, we will continue to evolve and do better. And we are well positioned to the recovery as it plays out both as an organization and as a system. And as always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company, and for joining us today. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "James Quincey",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In what remains a highly dynamic environment, our first quarter results show promising signs that a broader recovery is on the horizon. We're encouraged by early results in markets where mobility is on the rise. This morning, I'll share what we're seeing around the world and provide an update on the actions we've taken to accelerate our transformation, including improvements in our portfolio, innovation, and marketing approaches enabled by the evolution of our culture and our network organization. Then, I'll hand over the call to John to discuss the financial details of the quarter, and how we'll continue to deliver on our objectives over the course of the year. In the first quarter, we positioned our business to recovery while executing against our emerging stronger agenda, equipping our system to win. At the start of the year, pandemic-related lockdowns were still impacting many markets. We moved quickly as conditions changed, improving along the way and getting better at managing each wave and its resulting lockdowns. During the quarter, we saw mobility increase in some parts of the world where lockdowns eased and vaccinations accelerated. Leveraging our learnings, we drove sequential improvement in our business throughout the quarter. And while we saw mid-single-digit volume declines through mid February, trends have improved since then. We're pleased to say that March marked a return to volume levels seen in March 2019 prior to the pandemic.  We continue to see ongoing strength in at-home channels offset by away from home trends, which have improved sequentially, but remain pressured relative to pre pandemic levels. We're working with our customers and bottling partners to sustain at-home momentum and capture improving away-from-home demand. For example, in Latin America, our Prospera program with our bottlers helps the traditional trade thrive through assistance with their marketing efforts, resulting in outperformance in this critical channel. In Great Britain, we launched Open, a business accelerator program to support pubs, bars, and cafes. In North America, our use of meal bundles is driving incidence in pickup and delivery transactions with foodservice customers. In 2020, we gained underlying share in both at-home and away-from-home channels offset by negative channel mix. This continues to be the dynamic affecting our share year-to-date. Through our ongoing initiatives and as away-from-home demand improves over the course of the year, we will seek to build on these wins in 2021. There are clear opportunities to reaccelerate share positions as the recovery plays out and we will invest to drive momentum with focus on flexibility. In markets at the forefront of the recovery, we've seen early signs that our actions taken during the pandemic are helping us outpace recovery. It's important to note that the path to a full recovery remains asynchronous around the world. Many markets haven't yet turned a corner and are still managing through the restrictions. Looking around the world in Asia Pacific, China continues to lead the recovery with volume in the first quarter ahead of 2019 results and foot traffic almost back to pre-pandemic levels. Strong performance in India and Southwest Asia was driven by effective marketing across brands, affordable solutions and distribution expansion with 250,000 new outlets and 45% more new coolers. Despite the unexpected state of emergency earlier in the year, Japan expanded its successful RGM initiatives geographically and across brands to help drive improvements later in the quarter. In EMEA, vaccine rollout in Europe has been slower than anticipated, and many countries have been impacted by ongoing lockdowns. In Eurasia and Middle East, brand Coke recruited 4.4 million consumers through affordability packages and a focus on at-home occasions. New marketing campaigns drove improvement in flavored sparkling soft drinks and FUZE TEA registered an all-time high value share in Turkey. In Africa, mass vaccination is expected to take longer than the developed markets; and despite ongoing volatility, Africa worked closely with our bottlers to deliver volume growth led by stepped-up execution through cooler placement and affordability packs like returnable glass bottles. In North America, the year is off to a good start. Ongoing strength in at-home channels was driven by core brands in our Sparkling portfolio as well as Simply, fairlife, and Gold Peak, all with encouraging results. Away from home began to improve in March as vaccinations and mobility picked up. In Latin America, we leveraged our core brands, digital initiatives, and refillable packages to recover ahead of the economy and our industry despite ongoing restrictions. While from away from home continues to be impacted by lockdowns, we're expanding the at-home consumption opportunity leveraging consumer dynamics like indulgence of single-serve multi-packs. Global Ventures continue to be impacted by lockdowns in the UK. But as restrictions loosen, we're focusing on driving digital engagement and traffic back to the cost of stores. Cost of express machines continued to deliver strong performance. Turning to our transformation, our operating units are up and running and off to a very good start in the rollout of our new model. Across markets, our newly networked organization has us working more collaboratively with the overall enterprise in mind. Our operating unit and category leadership teams are working together to identify the most promising combinations across the industry based on economic outlook, consumer trends, channel dynamics, and execution imperatives. We're using more disciplined resource allocation to capture the biggest opportunities while making ongoing portfolio decisions faster and at scale. We're focused on our streamlined growth portfolio actively and thoughtfully transitioning brands to more powerful trademarks using a phased approach to bring the consumer with us on the journey. And we're maximizing shelf space and new product launches and higher velocity products to drive higher-quality growth. As we discussed at CAGNY, we're focusing on what we do best, marketing our loved brands in more efficient and effective ways. As Sprite Let's Be Clear campaign kicked off in markets from Asia to Africa to Latin America, the message is resonating with consumers with impressions, views, and engagement levels above last year, and intent-to-purchase metrics showing promising signs. This campaign aligns with our transition to a more sustainable clear bottle, which is important in helping us achieve our world without waste goals. Our media and creative agency reviews are progressing and we're also executing more targeted opportunities in addition to the big strategic shifts. For instance, we've taken a scaled, digitized approach to buying trade materials, resulting in up to 15% cost reduction and improved user experience, all while offering more consistent, better quality, and sustainable alternatives. We've extended this pool buying opportunity to our bottlers, many of whom are already on board to share the benefits systemwide. And our more disciplined innovation approach is yielding results as we balance big bets with intelligent experimentation. Using our network approach, we're scaling our best innovations quickly and effectively, while being disciplined with those that don't get the traction required for further investment. Local experiments like Aquarius with functional benefits and Ayataka Cafe Matcha Latte in Japan Fanta's exciting mystery flavor innovation in Europe. And package innovations like a 13.2 ounce recycled PT bottle in North America could all be lifted and shifted globally over time, similar to what we're doing this year with a half flavored sparkling water. Our big bets for 2021 include ongoing work to scale our coffee platform on the Costa. We're expanding ready to drink coffee in China and taking portfolio approach to complement our powerful Georgia coffee brand in Japan. We're also rolling out an enhanced formula and package designed for Coca Cola Zero Sugar this month in Europe and Latin America and across markets globally later this year. The improved recipe brings its taste even close to that of the iconic Coca Cola original taste. These were influenced by consumer insights and are focused on constant improvement. And despite its enormous success, Coca Cola Zero Sugar still represents a relatively small percentage of the trademark. And we continue to respond to consumer desires for lower sugar options, and the rollout will be supported by a global occasion based marketing campaign. Finally, it's early days. But we're excited to come back and report on an expanded experimentation in flavored alcoholic beverages with Topo Chico Hard Seltzer in Latin America, Europe, and most recently the US. We also continue to rapidly digitize our ecosystem. For example, our Chatbot in South Africa engages with consumers on social media to increase away from home transactions. In China, we've used digital campaigns to harness consumer data to drive traffic, and incidents leading to incremental growth. We're using machine learning and AI tools to stay on top of a rapidly evolving consumer trends and identify emerging needs. Our dedicated digital transformation structure leading to strong online to offline growth. We've seen ecommerce share gains in key advanced markets like North America, Japan and Great Britain. And in markets like Turkey, where the channel is still developing with more than tripled sales, and gained almost 10 points per share versus last year. As always, we're supporting these initiatives with strong revenue growth management and execution. Through RGM, we continue to capture at-home occasions with multi-pack options in both premium and affordable segments, while expanding distribution of smaller packaging like our sleek cans in China. And we have affordability plays like a successful refillables in Latin America to Philippines and now Africa. As part of our new organization, we're dedicating more resources to RGM continuing to raise the bar to even higher standards. In many markets, we're working with our bottling partners to optimize cooler placement, driving incremental volume through outstanding customer service, higher cooler productivity and innovation. Our bottling partners are executing strongly. And together, we are working on initiatives across the enterprise to identify more efficiency. We're operating in a networked way, leveraging our platform services organization to scale our collected data, marketing, digital and supply chain capabilities. Our system continues to evolve, as shown by the pending combination of Coca Cola, European partners, and Coca Cola Amatil. And just this morning, we announced our intent to list Coca Cola beverages Africa as an independent African bottler through an initial public offering. I'm especially proud of how we're delivering on our purpose as a company. Every action is guided by our ambition to create a more sustainable business and better shared future that makes a difference in people's lives, our communities and the planet. Throughout the pandemic, we focus on helping communities through relief funds from the company and the Coca Cola Foundation. In this next phase, we are supporting vaccination efforts in regions where distribution has been slower. For instance, in Brazil, our system has partnered with the country's Ministry of Health to co create a vaccine awareness campaign. We're using our network to deliver 700,000 posters with vaccine information to more than 350,000 mom and pop stores. Tomorrow we will release our 2020 business and ESG report where we will highlight last year's progress. While 2020 was a milestone year in terms of meeting and exceeding some previous goals, by women's empowerment and Global Water replenishment, we continue to work toward an even more ambitious agenda. This includes our 2025 and 2030 packaging goals, our 2030 climate goal and our new 2030 water security strategy, with more details to come later this year. In conclusion, we're optimistic about the future and bullish about our ability to continue to deliver on the objectives we laid out at the height of the crisis. More consumers, more share, better system economics and a positive stakeholder impact. Now I'll turn the call to John to discuss how we're delivering results through a continued dynamic environment. Sure. Thanks Dara. So firstly, the first quarter was strong. Absolutely, we gained momentum and we achieved that good momentum in the first quarter, which is really the fruition of the emerging stronger plan we set out a year ago, saying we wanted to get back to 2019 levels well ahead of the economy by gaining more share, more customers, better system economics. And I think that's what you're starting to see happen in the first quarter. And obviously, we've been driving that by focusing on the brands and on the innovation. And the bottlers have been executing in the marketplace, and it's certainly heartening to see us get back to 2019 volume levels in March. And we did all of that whilst doing -- finishing the implementation of the reorganization, sothe employees on the company side were able to both deliver the results and stand up the new organization with the operating units and platform services and really hit the ground running. So, I think it is actually a super creditable performance in the first quarter. Secondly, the downhill and the question about guidance. I mean, ultimately, it's early and it's not early, just in a normal sense, it's early in the context of the pandemic. Also, breaking the news today is that weekly new cases of COVID have hit an all-time peak.  So while vaccinations are rising in many countries, US, UK, et cetera, the flipside is there's actually a new high in terms of cases, obviously a number of developing markets but also Europe as well continental Europe as well. So, the visibility into the downhill is very much linked to the trajectory of the pandemic, and as it relates to our business, the trajectory of the lockdowns, very clearly as we've talked on previous quarters, lockdowns because we have half our business in away from home are impacted directly by the degree of lockdown, and though there are still lockdowns coming on, a number in Europe, some of the developing markets, conversely as markets start to open, it's worth remembering. It's not an on/off switch. There's a phasing of how markets tend to reopen. And that's true to the US, so for example in the US, the fountain volumes were still negative in March because whilst people are going out to restaurants and there's more mobility, it's not back to what it was. The occupancy levels of offices are nowhere near a 100%, and so reopening is not an on/off switch.  There's a rebuilding and there's a series of phases of reopening. And so, that's a very important factor and it's somewhat unpredictable with the downhill. So it's too early to call not in a business sense, but in a lockdown and reopening sense. And the reality is that there are more cases now than they were a while ago. So, we still feel very confident in our guidance on the top and the bottom line, but there's a lot of managing left to do and we're certainly focused on giving ourselves the flexibility and agility to be able to do that. And which leads me to my third point, which I think is worth making. Unlike normal times, one should not automatically assume that more revenue is always going to flow straight down to the bottom line. Much as we did in 2020, we are going to be very judicious and focused on investing where we believe reopening and demand is coming back and not investing, if we don't think the response in the marketplace is there. So you're going to see as we go through 2021, we will be looking at both levers. If we see that demand is coming in at the kind of the higher end, there's more reopenings happen more quickly for whatever reason, and revenue start to accelerate, we're also likely to reaccelerate the restitution of the marketing spend. Conversely, if for whatever reason revenue starts to look a little weaker, then we are likely to hold back on some of the marketing. So, I think it's important as you think about the rest of the year that you don't think of it as normal times one has to think about how we are using the resources judiciously and wanting to invest to drive growth and get back to normal. Sure, Nik, a few examples. One, I think John's already mentioned, the cash flow, we struggle for many years to get up into best-in-class cash conversion, or working capital. And the work that has been done by the finance network has produced a great result. And that's clearly flowing through not just in terms of the kind of theoretical, amount of days working capital, but the actual cash coming into the company in the first quarter, which was a really strong result, and then something that we have struggled to do in the past. Another example with -- we have been rolling out a global campaign on Sprite, which has got excellent early traction, in terms of consumer engagement, in terms of purchase intent. And that was developed by the category leads and the key operating units, and has been rolled out across the world, something that we were unable to do or unable to convince ourselves to do historically. And so we believe that is making some cut through. The supply chain optimization working with the bottlers and really focusing on reducing the unit cost of what we do and looking at across all the metrics, and increasing data transparency is happening. And then you go to some of the platform services, where we're really starting to be able to implement, especially in those areas, where one single global solution makes total sense. We've had examples from, buying trade materials, through global platforms driving significant savings for ourselves and the system. And then hopefully, later this month, we'll turn on our latest SAP update, which will go from the one that was done 20 years ago, which was probably one of the world's most complicated and therefore most expensive to a much more effective solution. So I think across the company, from the front end of marketing, and engaging with consumers, through our operations through to the bottlers we're able to make the contact points and get faster, better solutions. Yes. Thanks, Laura, look, clearly, the reinvestment of marketing is going to vary somewhat by region in 2021 for the reasons I outlined in that answer to the first question. So I think it's important as you think about margins to recognize that 2021 is also going to be a somewhat a typical year, there will be markets around the world where we judge the situation such that we don't have a normal level of marketing. And so that does tend to favor margins, operating margins at that point in time. And so it is important to break it apart and look at it by the different regions. We certainly are not coming out with some numerical margin target for many of the same reasons that we remove the previous target. And we are focused ultimately on growing the business. And embedded in our long-term growth model is an implicit assumption that we can slowly or steadily perhaps better said, improve margins over time, because there is a lot of efficiency work going on within the cost of goods sold, within the DME, particularly the non working part of the DME, we've got a lot of focus on the agency roster and how we spend the money we spend before we even gets to see the consumer. And obviously, we've done the network organization, which was about making us better able to support the growth aspirations, but it is also more efficient organization. And so all those things will go into the mix. And it would be remiss of me to not include the impact of RGM. Because to the extent that we can leverage RGM, that also helps on a gross margin, and ultimately operating income margins. So we will be pulling all those levers as we go through 2021. But again, it won't be a fully normal year in every region. And so you will see some of these strange effects. I mean, the digital transformation is much above and beyond coping with inflation, although, of course, some of the tools will help us manage if there's an inflationary spike. Clearly, you can look at the digital transformation in terms of our engagement with consumers. And there are some, good examples of progress, China, which is started the year very strongly not just compared to 2020 but compared to 2019. It's been a much bigger shift into digital engagement with consumers or even in Japan with our own Coke On apps that we use to connect people to the vending machines and the cashless options and a large uptick in monthly active consumers. So there is a great deal of progress being made in terms of how we engage through digital media, how we engage directly with consumers in a digital relationship that's helping there, the system I used, I talked about the example of buying materials with digital platforms. But clearly there's a huge piece of what needs to happen, which is the backbone of both the company and the bottlers and the interoperability of all the data, where we're making excellent progress. And ultimately all those insights and all those efficiencies help us manage the inflationary pressures out there whether we use the insights to engage more consumers or use the insight to drive the RGM thinking, an implementation or to identify efficiencies, I mean, in a way digital is becoming just the way business is done. And it's just like saying, I turn up and have to manage the business and use all these tools to do all the things I got to do. So the progress when you stand back and look at the numbers in aggregate, clearly, April was the deepest hole that we fell into in 2020. And then as we adapted the business, and really drove what we were doing, then, we sequentially got better. So kind of we fell into the hole, I think it was like minus 25 or something in April last year, and then it was negative teens, and then negative single digits, slowly improving through the rest of 2020 and then coming into 2021. Obviously, we then cycling the bad year, but if we compared to 2019, it got better as we went from January in February, which was still below the '19 levels. And obviously March was above, I mean, April has started well. It's obviously they are going to be the weirdest month because recycling something very low. I think most importantly, I would refer you back to the comment I made the second thing I said relative in the first answer, which is just because March has gone back to the level and just because April has started well, one week, there's no guarantee that that is then some kind of trend that is in the bank.  The principal uncertainty remains the risk of additional lockdowns. Much as 2020's numbers were heavily impacted by the degree of lockdown that will remain true this year. So whilst we've got back above the line of flotation in March, there's no guarantee there won't be some extra degree of lockdowns in May or September or December that then, puts pressure back on the business. So, I don't think I know I keep hitting this point, we had a superstar to the year, and the momentum is building. But this very unusual factor of the pandemic and the lockdowns continues to be an uncertainty factor that one can't draw a straight line through the historic data. Now, once you get under the surface of the overall global numbers, which kind of look like the kind of the tick mark if you like going down and then kind of steadily improving. Clearly, you get much more variability at a country level. Again, heavily influenced by the degree of lockdown. So in a sense, April last year was the worst because you had the most number of countries, most, the highest degree of synchronization of lockdowns globally and I think this idea of saying the recovery will be asynchronous, is we already see that in the first half, you've got countries where the vaccine levels are going up. And the reopening is occurring, US, UK, China for examples. And yet you've got countries going in exactly the opposite direction with cases shooting up, and more levels of lockdown. And that's what we're trying to highlight with this asynchronous. It may be that as a total company, it all looks smoothed out somewhat. But this asynchronous feature will be very important in 2021. Sure, thanks Bonnie. It means certainly, it's always been our intention to reduce our ownership in CCBA in line with our strategy, as John puts it, to become the world's smallest coke bottler. And so we were always contemplating how we would re-franchise CCBA. I mean, the CCBA, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa is a strong, well structured, capable bottler, and we have always considered as one of the options whether to have it be a free standing entity in Africa. And we have reached in inclusion that if one thinks about the future potential of the African market and the African continent, and how much long growth there is there. I mean, it is the youngest billion people are in Africa, we think it would -- we've ultimately contemplated it would be right for the development of the business in Africa to have an African headquartered African bottler that is operating on the continent. And so the read through is we believe in the future of Africa, as a continent as an economy, we think we've got a great, capable bottler that can help lead our ability to grow there. And then an IPO will allow us to set that up to be a source of growth for many years to come. Well, certainly that we're always happy to see other companies invest into the beverage industry, because that tends to create more consumer engagement. And obviously, we pay attention to what they're doing, because hopefully we can learn from them. There are a lot of very capable competitors out there. So we like to learn from them. But in the end, we focus on what we can do. And in the US in particular, channel mix aside, we gain share, we gain share going forward in beverages in the US business. And we feel confident that as the channel trends and the reopening bring back the away from home businesses, which of course they started to do in March, then we will be able to capitalize on those trends, as well. And as it relates to promotional activity, I mean, ultimately, we are seeing a kind of rational pricing and promotional environment in the US. And we'll certainly be looking to build on that with our RGM capabilities and with the bottling system to really drive and leverage the investments we're collectively making as a system in the marketing and the execution to drive the business forward. Thanks Robert. So in the markets where it's been in longer say, Latin America, and Europe, about 40 markets between them. A couple of things we're seeing, obviously, the degree of resonances is depending on the degree of category development that might already exist or not exist in some of those markets. And so we've seen different levels of engagement depending on whether the categories there or not. Secondly, I mean, we're clearly in the mode of learning how to compete in this category, both from a branding point of view and from an execution point of view. But we're definitely starting to see improving trends and good repeats in the context of the different markets where it's been launched, whether that be Latin America, or in Europe, we're still building out distribution in Mexico, for example. But we've done a good start in Europe a little easier, as I said, because the categories a bit more developed in the West versus the East. And so our focus is maximizing the amount of learning that we're doing and as it relates to the US, whilst our overall share is three and I would double underline that, Topo Chico, as a brand is well known in the US, and therefore, driving or creating trial on a well known brand with an innovation is actually relatively straightforward. The key is to repeat. And we have not yet got to the point of having good repeat data in the US having opened big caveat umbrella, I would comment that, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer might have 3% overall in the US, but actually in Texas, where we've kind of concentrated some of the launch. It's almost hit a 20 share in the first two weeks of launch. So we are encouraged by the early results, but it's all going to come down to repeat and nothing's worth anything without repeat. Sure. Yes, clearly good results in China. We're definitely I mean, obviously, we're laughing, and we're beginning to laugh to the kind of the worst part of 2020. But ahead of 2019, we've lengthened to the reopening and the reenergizing of China with the consumer marketing with a big push into digital engagement with the consumer with a big push into e-commerce. And we are benefiting from that. It is worth noting that in terms of the channels, almost what we see, and this is true, when you look at not just China, but if you start looking at Australia or even the US you see kind of phases or waves of the reopening. And so as the reopening occurs actually get a lot of people going out to restaurants and the kind of the full service eating away. And that goes up, bearing in mind that the universe of mom and pop stores and the universe of small restaurants has shrunk people that the number of people running those sorts of businesses has shrunk.  And I think we're gonna see that all across the world. So there is a consolidation factors. And as the reopening occurs, you see a lot of going out in the evenings. So all the channels related to that come back first. The second kind of wave of improvements in channels is loosely in the bucket of office and commuting. Because as reopening happens, people go out, yet the offices aren't back at 100% capacity. So you've not got that ecosystem of commuting and lunchtime in the big city centers at full. And that's the kind of the second business coming back in China. And actually, you don't see that back yet in the US in March, you see the restaurants kind of bouncing back. But you don't see the kind of the ecosystem of commuting and offices having bounced back anywhere near the same degree. And then there's a third phase, which hasn't really happened yet. Which is kind of the large gatherings kind of phase of channels, whether that be cinemas, concerts, sporting events, et cetera, et cetera? And that's only very partial coming back. So I think, think of this kind of a set of waves of reopening as the economy normalizes. And we thought about that. And we're kind of investing both in the consumer and the bottlers are doing a great job of investing for the customers and retailers. And we're seeing a very nice result. So for APAC, just specifically on your question, yes. APAC has run ahead, mainly due to the extra days in the quarter. And we also had a timing impact with regard to Chinese New Year in China, obviously. And so but for the quarter overall you saw gallons running ahead, mainly due to the extra days in the quarter. Sure. So, I think, as you say, clearly, the vaccination rates in the developed markets are going to be ahead of the developing markets for the duration of this year. The critical factor to add to that is the market response to the level of cases or the low vaccination rates in the developing markets, because the thing that impacts our business most directly is the degree of lockdown. And so it's the response to the level of cases of the COVID and the resulting lockdowns, rather than necessarily directly the level of vaccination, because there are countries where the level of vaccination is low, because they had a strong lockdown, and then kind of lock the country up, say, Australia, whatever, then they've started to reopen. So the key factor to look for is the degree of lockdown and think through for that market, what's likely to happen, connected, of course, to the level of vaccinations, but also to the level of cases and what the policy response in the country is likely to be. And there'll be countries where I think, frankly, and unfortunately, they don't have the wherewithal and the fiscal capacity to implement large lockdowns, even if they not got all the vaccines that they want. And the markets remain open. And of course, we will look for ways to adapt the business to support the people, support the retailers and continue to engage with consumers as that goes on. What I think the phases are going to exist, Bill, there are just going to happen very quickly in the US. So if I look at what's already happening I put eating and drinking in the evening in kind of phase one. I mean, those that bit of the away from home was trending negative, in volume strongly negative in volume in January and February. And as the reopening happened, it jumps up in March. And as you say, as school, as education and at work opens, both of which are still running negative in March, I think they're going to jump up again. So what I think we're going to see, as the US completes its kind of rapid vaccination is a quick succession of the phases rather than a drawn out set of the phases. Other parts of the world where the vaccination programs are slower, then I think you'll see a more gradual phasing of what happens. Okay, so thanks very much, everyone. It's certainly been great talking to you all. We had an excellent first quarter very encouraging. Still many of the parts of the world yet to emerge from the pandemic. But as we navigate this kind of dynamic environment, we will continue to evolve and do better. And we are well positioned to the recovery as it plays out both as an organization and as a system. And as always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company, and for joining us today. Thank you."

            "name": "John Murphy",
            "content": "Thank you, James. And good morning to everybody on the call. Today, I will highlight our first quarter performance and go over our top line and earnings guidance which we are reiterating. Then I'll provide a progress update on working capital, our ability to manage through the current commodity environment, and other factors that may impact our outlook. 2021 is off to a good start with the quarter showing steady sequential monthly improvement. We're leveraging our learnings and strategic initiatives from 2020 and leaning into growth in a thoughtful way. Our Q1 organic revenue was up 6% driven by concentrates shipments of 5%. And price mix improvement of 1%. By shipments benefit from certain timing impacts and the five additional days this quarter versus last year. Unit case volume was flat versus the toughest quarterly compare of 2020. And March volume was in line with 2019 levels, largely driven by strength in Asia Pacific. Comparable gross margins although still down year-over-year improved sequentially driven by less pressure from channel and package mix. And while currency was still somewhat of a drag, it was less of a headwind than prior quarters.  Comparable operating margin expanded through ongoing discipline cost management. We continue to reintroduce marketing spend in a targeted way, particularly as we ramp up investments in markets that are seeing recovery. First quarter comparable EPS of $0.55 is an increase of 8% year-over-year and was driven by top line growth, margin improvement and some contribution from equity income offset by currency headwinds. Regarding our ongoing tax case with the IRS, there are no material updates since our last report. Our decisions and actions from last year certainly were not easy. But we are seeing the results of our efforts start to come through. And our organization is embracing the changes as we move forward into the recovery phase. We stayed very focused on driving a healthy top line. And we remain on a journey to maximize returns, including strong cash flow generation. We never relented on our cash flow goals, and indeed have had an even sharper focus on managing capital spend and working capital. Since we embarked on a journey toward best-in-class working capital performance, we've made great strides in extending our payment terms, generating a working capital improvement of more than a $1 billion over two years. In the same vein, we are implementing accounts receivables factoring programs, which are rolling out across a number of markets, and also looking at initiatives to better manage inventory days. At the center of these efforts, is a robust digitization, and automation agenda. In addition, and you've heard us talk conceptually about the network model. This is a great example of the network in action. When you put the right people from different parts of the organization against key initiatives, it delivers a step change in performance. Last quarter, we said that despite rising commodity environments, we expected a relatively benign impact in 2021, given our hedged positions. While this continues to be the case, we're closely monitoring upward pressure in some inputs, such as high fructose corn syrup, PT, metals, and other packaging materials that impact us as well as our bottling partners. Given the environment we will continue to benefit from revenue growth management initiatives through intelligently diverse price tag architecture, we can produce a range of options that meet the needs of consumers across the income spectrum, while also capturing value for customers. 2020 provided great learnings on how to be more surgical and data driven in our promotions, and we will continue to be purposeful in our approach, driven by the consumer and the strength of our brands. We will also continue to pursue productivity across the supply chain pushing all levers at our disposal. Since we last provided guidance, the US dollar has strengthened. And as we noted in our release, we now expect currency to be a tailwind of approximately 1% to 2% to the top line, and approximately 2% to 3% to comparable EPS in 2021 based on current spot rates and our hedged positions. For the full year, we now expect an underlying effective tax rate of 19.1%. Putting it all together, our quarterly performance and the momentum we saw in March give us confidence in our ability to achieve our 2021 guidance. We expect high single digit organic revenue growth and high single digit to low double digit growth in comparable earnings per share. We still expect recovery to be a synchronous and to see signs of return to normal in more markets later in 2021. We are preparing our end-to-end supply chain for stronger demand and will fuel the momentum in recovering markets as they emerge from the pandemic by accelerating investments in our brands. There's no doubt that uncertainty remains. Europe continues to see challenges, many countries and regions like Latin America and Africa, expect further waves and slower vaccine distribution. And India is seeing a surge in cases and responding with localized lockdowns. But as we begin to lap the most difficult periods from last year, we feel good about our position, and our ability to navigate the environment, as a company, and as a system. Based on the lessons we've learned, and the agility provided by our new networked organization. We remain confident that our actions and the progress we've made will enable us to deliver 2021 earnings at or above 2019 levels. With that operator, we are ready to take questions. Thank you, Bryan. Good morning. Good topic. And one that with our bottling partners around the world, we're looking as a very holistic manner, managing inflation is not new to the system. And it's one it's an area that needs to be looked us locally and working closely in partnership with our bottlers. As you're saying the inflationary pressures, particularly surrounding some of our key commodities, looks like it is going to be more of a headwind in '22, '21 we are, as we said, in the release pretty well covered and in good shape. And so when you think about the actions we take, first and foremost, I think it is important to highlight that as an over arching principle around the world, we typically look to take pricing in line with inflation. And I would expect that principle will continue to be adhere to as we move into the back half of '21, and even then into '22. Secondly, while, I know you mentioned beyond RGM, I do think it's important to reinforce the value that RGM brings to being able to execute a pricing strategy in the most relevant and meaningful fashion locally. And so that will continue to be a key priority. Thirdly, on the things that we can do on the productivity area, I would point to our supply chain particularly with our bottling partners in the last 6 to 12 months coming through the pandemic and indeed coming out of us that the level of engagement we've had with our -- within the system unlocking value in the supply chain through greater efficiencies, has been phenomenal. And I would expect that momentum to continue into the rest of this year and into 2022. We have had over the last number of years, the benefits of leveraging our cross enterprise procurement group, a group of people that work on behalf of the entire system around the world that are able to leverage the global scale of the system. And I think arrive us some of the most competitive pricing that we can get that anybody can get when it comes to key inputs. So when you take a sort of an overarching holistic view of us, we've got a, I think, a tried- and-true practice of being able to take pricing enlightenment and inflation leverage RGM to do it in the most intelligent fashion, and increasingly operate as a global system to leverage our scale, taking into account some of the sort of the historic groups we have like cross enterprise procurement, but also new opportunities abounding as a result of the overall strategy we've been pursuing during and after the pandemic. Maybe I just add one comment there, James. If you think about the emerging stronger program that we've outlined over the last six to nine months, it would not have been possible to do three years ago, and the degree to which we have been able to operate in a fast and efficient manner across the globe to deliver this program is all due to the fact that we have essentially become digitized in how we work and how we operate, just to support what James about your last comment there. Yes. I'll take it. Maybe start with the tax question. Andrea thank you for the questions. But let's start with the tax question. In terms of to say on timing, it's -- we do not have a picture at the moment. We are dependent on the outcome of another case. Before any further developments take place with our own case. And we have no visibility into that outcome. So we'll keep you apprised as we know more. On the storms in the US, not a material impact to our business. And with regard to volumes in Q2, we're still early in the quarter and not lot to, we, not a lot to say at the moment. I think the key highlights really as we look at the downhill is the fact that March was significantly improved in a number of markets where mobility is improving and will continue I think to see a close relationship between mobility and our performance."

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be on listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department, if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President of IR and FP&A. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.\nTim Leveridge: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website at coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins. In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks, we will turn the call over for questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing first, and then reenter the queue. Now, let me turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. 2022 was a strong year for us. We executed well and grew amidst a challenging macro environment. We did this in part by focusing on expanding the sphere of what we can control. We delivered on our top line and bottom line guidance, and we continue to create value by investing in our loved brands, even as we faced a very dynamic backdrop. Today, I'll reflect on our fourth quarter and the year's performance and set the stage for 2023. I'll also share how we're operating differently today, which makes us confident in our ability to deliver our 2023 guidance, and well equipped for a future that continues to be volatile and uncertain. John will then discuss our results and our 2023 outlook in more detail. During the fourth quarter, the environment remained dynamic as inflation, geopolitical tensions, pandemic-related mobility restrictions and currency volatility persisted. Despite this range of factors, consumer demand held up relatively well, and our industry remains strong. In the fourth quarter, we remain focused on our growth strategy and continued to create value for our consumers and customers. We maintained agility to navigate this challenging environment and delivered 15% organic revenue growth in the quarter, with strong growth across operating segments. This was driven by pricing actions across markets and revenue growth management initiatives to retain and add consumers. While we saw robust volume growth across many markets, this was more than offset by the suspension of our business in Russia and the impact on consumption, driven by varying levels of pandemic-related mobility restrictions and the surge in COVID cases in China. Overall, throughout 2022, we have maintained consistent volume growth relative to 2019. We've gained both volume and value share for the consolidated business for both the quarter and the year. So far, in 2023, the volume growth trends versus 2019 are in line with last year, and we are laser-focused on executing on our growth plans. Our streamlined portfolio of global and local brands and stepped-up consumer-facing investments continue to fuel the competitive edge of the Coca-Cola system to deliver value in any environment. Our network organizational structure enables this strategy. We've connected our operating units, our functions and our platform services organization for strong end-to-end coordination, which helps us identify key opportunities for meaningful long-term growth. And on top of this, we remain well aligned with our bottling partners, which further builds on our strength as a network system. As we look to 2023, many uncertainties remain in the macro economy, whether from economic policies, consumer demand, inflation, supply chain, war and geopolitics. Instead of trying to forecast and predict the many directions things could move, we are focused on delivering on our key objectives: firstly, pursuing excellence globally and winning locally through relentless consumer centricity to continue the top line momentum; secondly, investing for the long-term health of the business and raising the bar across all elements of our strategic flywheel; thirdly, generating US dollar EPS growth to deliver value for our shareowners. We continue to build the right capabilities and strengthen the system alignment to deliver in a dynamic world, and we continue to invest to raise the bar. We are executing more efficiently and effectively on a local level while maintaining flexibility on a global level. Throughout 2022, we saw many examples of harnessing our enhanced capabilities to win locally. Our new marketing model is working. We've linked occasions and passion points to drive engagement. We're experimenting to optimize marketing. This is driving deeper connections with consumers, reaching them in unique and new ways. We are tying our beverages to consumption occasions and engaging consumers through local experiences. For example, in Vietnam, to support the reopening of away-from-home accounts, we launched the pilot of Coke is Cooking campaign in October. In this month-long campaign to help drive traffic back to stores, we partner with more than 700 food shops. We created thousands of food and Coke combo deals that consumers purchased at these food shops, along with Coke is Cooking merchandising and digital support by our local influencers. This was the first time we used an on-ground event as a commercial asset, creating a social and digital content generator. The campaign resulted in more than 1 million combo transactions and 20% uplift for participating merchants. We're leveraging passion points locally to create immersive experiences and drive consumption. For example, in Latin America, our live music strategy created memorable in-person and digital experiences, elevating consumer engagement. We partnered with Rock in Rio, one of the biggest music festivals in the world, and created new opportunities for consumers to access content through live streams and in the metaverse. As a result, we boosted our reach from approximately 700,000 attendees to more than 45 million consumers across the region, and our sales inside the festival increased 23% versus the last festival. In India, the Thums Up, Stump Cam was a never before seen activation for cricket fans where consumers could scan a QR code on product label and get access to exclusive match moments of the ICC T20 Cricket World Cup through a camera installed on one of the wickets. Throughout the 45-day tournament, we use first-party data and artificial intelligence to send personalized content to consumers based on their favorite matches, and we amplified the experience through sports influencers. This campaign showed strong results with Thums Up growing volume ahead of our total sparkling portfolio in India during the activation period, contributing to strong volume growth for Thums Up for the full year. This drove about 1/4 of India's total volume growth for the year. Thums Up also experienced its highest monthly market share jump during the activation period. We are driving consumer interest and action through digital experiences using the power of partnerships across platforms. For example, in Germany, we partnered with our key online customer and created voice-based branded experiences with its voice assistant to drive engagement and grow positive brand perception. This allowed consumers to learn more about Coca-Cola products and shop on voice assistant-enabled devices using only their voice. The campaign delivered strong results with a reach of 11 million impressions. Additionally, consumers that engaged with its voice-based experience had a 25% add-to-cart rate. And lastly, we're delivering new and unexpected innovation by leveraging Gen Z insights. In the US, we launched Minute Maid Aguas Frescas. The product is made with real fruit juices, is noncarbonated and comes in three exciting flavors. It was originally available as a limited launch in 16-ounce ready-to-drink cans. A disruptive end-to-end digital media marketing campaign created early momentum, which led us to quickly scale this experiment to our Freestyle platform and other fountain offerings. In 2022, the product had a 60% repeat rate and won the Best New Product award from Convenience Store News. We have been building our revenue growth management and execution capabilities for many years, and we've made good progress, as shown by our ability to offset much of the inflation we saw in 2022 and delivered strong volume and transaction growth. There is still much work to be done to maximize revenue by further segmenting our markets and consumers based on additional variables. We are leveraging digital and data-backed insights to better understand our consumers. This will help drive affordable propositions for basket incidence growth and recruit new drinkers. It will also lead to premiumization to drive price and mix. For example, in Europe, we grew both volume and value share for the last year. We partnered with key customers to drive growth through affordability and premiumization initiatives that tapped into the key consumption occasions of meals and breaks. This end-to-end execution resulted in higher basket incidents and buying households across all key channels in Europe. Globally, this strong system execution focus generated 80 million additional shopping trips for our products and added 17 million households to our base. Through our stepped-up capabilities, we are getting better at synchronizing demand creation and demand fulfillment, driving top-tier value creation for our customers. We measure success by the value we create for our stakeholders and by how we are creating a better shared future for people, communities and the planet. During 2022, we made progress across these sustainability priorities. We leveraged our marketing power to drive growth of our low- and no-calorie beverages and continue to provide smaller package choices to enable consumers to manage sugar intake. Approximately two-thirds of the products in our portfolio have less than 100 calories per 12-ounce serving. On packaging, we've set a new industry-leading goal to have 25% of our volume globally being refillable or reusable packaging by 2030. Additionally, we are continuing to increase cooler energy efficiency and the use of HFC free coolers to make progress on our science-based targets, while creating a clear road map with our system and suppliers to achieve our carbon emissions reduction ambition. On water, as part of our 2030 water security strategy, we stepped up investments in nature-based water solutions exemplified by the work we're doing with the Nature Conservancy and other partners. Globally, we are working to strengthen the links between replenishment projects and nature-based solutions. We further embedded sustainability into our strategy by linking diversity equity inclusion performance measures to our executive annual incentive program and by linking water and our PET packaging measures to our executives' long-term incentive program. Overall, we continue to focus on using our leadership and scale to drive change while delivering results and building resilience. Finally, before I hand it over to John, I want to acknowledge that our strong results in 2022 reflect the collective efforts of our system partners and the growth mindset of our system employees. Guided by our purpose, we are investing behind our capabilities and further cultivating our growth mindset to be well positioned to create value and deliver on our objectives. While we have momentum in our business, we know uncertainty remains as we turn the page to a new year. We will continue to focus on expanding the sphere of what we can control to drive growth in 2023 and beyond. We'll talk about this in more detail when we return to CAGNY in person next Tuesday and would encourage all of you to listen in. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we continued to drive strong top line-led results as we execute for growth in a dynamic operating environment. We grew organic revenues 15%. Unit cases declined 1% as broad-based growth across most markets and investments in the marketplace were more than offset by the suspension of business in Russia and the decline in China. Concentrate sales were 3 points ahead of unit cases for the quarter, primarily driven by one additional day and the timing of concentrate shipments. Our price/mix growth of 12% was driven by pricing actions across operating segments along with revenue growth management initiatives and favorable channel and package mix. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 90 basis points versus the prior year, mainly driven by currency headwinds in a volatile macro backdrop and the mechanical effect of consolidating the BODYARMOR finished goods business. Underlying gross margin was in line with the prior year, driven by strong organic revenue growth offset by higher commodity costs. We continued to significantly accelerate our marketing investments to engage and retain existing consumers as well as, again, new consumers. Despite higher costs across the P&L, increased marketing and currency headwinds, comparable operating margin expanded 65 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by underlying operating margin expansion due to robust top line growth across operating segments. Importantly, this resulted in full year comparable operating margin be in line with the prior year despite significant currency acquisition and cost headwinds. Below the line, we were impacted by higher net interest expense, along with lower other income due to cycling higher pension income from the prior year. Therefore, fourth quarter comparable EPS of $0.45 was in line with last year despite higher-than-expected currency headwinds. This resulted in full year comparable EPS of $2.48, an increase of 7% versus the prior year, driven by strong underlying business performance, partially offset by 10 points of currency headwinds. For the year, we delivered free cash flow of $9.5 billion, a decline of 15% versus the prior year. Much of the decline versus our expectations occurred due to the deliberate buildup of inventory in the face of a volatile commodity environment and higher-than-anticipated tax payments. Additionally, cash flow was impacted by cycling working capital benefits from the prior year and higher incentive payments in 2022. Even with these items, our underlying cash flow generation remains strong, and we continue to make progress on our cash flow agenda. Our three-year average free cash flow conversion ratio is above 100%, ahead of our long-term target. Our balance sheet remains strong with our net debt leverage of 1.8 times EBITDA as of the end of 2022, which is below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same, and we continue to prioritize investing in the business to drive long-term growth, as well as delivering dividend growth for our shareowners. At the same time, we remain mindful of maintaining our financial flexibility amidst the ongoing tax dispute with the IRS and are learning from the last few years of how important it is to build resilience in all of our plans. As James mentioned, in 2023, we expect the operating environment to remain dynamic. We have the right portfolio, a very focused strategy, a flexible and adaptable structure and a system with the ability to reinvest in the business. This gives us the confidence that we will continue to deliver on our three key objectives, pursuing excellence globally, and winning locally; investing for the long-term health of the business; generating US dollar EPS growth. With that in mind, this morning, we provided guidance for 2023 that builds on our strong results in 2022. We expect organic revenue growth of 7% to 8%, primarily led by price/mix amidst the ongoing inflationary environment. And we expect comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 7% to 9% versus 2022. Since we provided our initial outlook on currency in October, the currency environment has improved, but remains volatile. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate two to three-point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate three to four-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we expect per-case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023. We continue to expect our underlying effective tax rate to be 19.5% for 2023. And all in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5% versus $2.48 in 2022. We expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations less approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments. I would like to highlight that included in the $11.4 billion of cash from operations are two discrete items: transition tax payments of approximately $720 million; a scheduled increase of $335 million versus 2022; payments associated with various M&A transactions of approximately $350 million. Excluding these, our implied free cash flow conversion would be within our long-term guidance. This guidance does not include any payments related to our ongoing US income tax dispute with the IRS. Recently, the tax court issued an opinion on a case involving a separate company. The tax court will now apply this opinion to our case and ultimately render a final decision in our case, allowing us to move forward with the appeals process. As previously discussed, we intend to assert our claims on appeal, vigorously defend our position and believe we will ultimately prevail. Overall, we don't expect this to have a bearing on our ability to deliver on our capital allocation agenda and drive long-term business growth. There are some considerations to keep in mind for 2023. We expect price mix to moderate through the year as we cycle our pricing initiatives from the prior year. While the inflationary environment appears to be cooling, we are still expecting to see elevated inflation, across our operating costs. We have stepped up our marketing investments for the last few years and we will continue to invest to support momentum. And given the ongoing backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see higher net interest expense given our effective exposure to floating rate debt. Finally, due to our reporting calendar, there will be one less day in the first quarter and one additional day in the fourth quarter. Having delivered strong results in 2022, we are focused on driving a top line-led growth equation in many types of environments. We are well positioned to deliver on guidance for 2023, thanks to the incredible people we have around the world, the strong alignment we have with our bottling partners and the great plans we have for the coming year. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks, good morning. I guess in light of John's comment, just have a top line led growth equation. I was hoping you could talk a little bit through the outlook for 2023 on top line just kind of puts and takes how you think about that 7 to 8 relative to the mid-teens put up in the fourth quarter and just kind of more color overall on that revenue outlook for this year would be great? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yeah, sure. Good morning, Lauren. Firstly, as John said, we feel confident about our outlook to drive the year from the top line. Let me connect that perhaps starting to 2022. As we commented, we saw steady volume growth through the year, including the fourth quarter. I know we reported a headline number of minus one. But if you accommodate the suspension of Russia and the COVID restrictions in China and take a three-year CAGR of volume growth, you see a pretty constant growth momentum through the year. And we would also comment that, that growth momentum has continued into the beginning of 2023. So we see strong underlying volume momentum or ongoing volume momentum that we have been able to achieve by our focus on the marketing innovation, the RGM and the execution to accommodate the need for affordability and premiumization in the face of inflation. And as John commented, we do see both inflation moderating as we go through 2023 and of course, our own pricing PMO beginning to moderate as we go through '23 in part because, the input costs inflation is moderating, but also because we begin to cycle some of the price increases from 2022. And what that's likely to net out as obviously, we've given a seven to eight for the full year. And what we're likely to see is the beginning of the Q1, we're likely to see revenue growth more close to what -- the sort of levels we were achieving coming out of last year. And that then logically, the organic growth rate moderates as we get towards the end of the year, looking to close out on a more normalized level of revenue growth. And then when you average that out, you get to the seven to eight. So, I think we're going to see good momentum through the year, moderating revenue growth rate as a function of moderating inflation ultimately. And what will remain is a good, strong underlying momentum of our business that has been powering the last five years, and we are confident we'll continue to power the years ahead at the sort of level of top line relative to the long-term growth model that we have previously talked about.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Okay. Just a quick -- just clarifying point on that, I apologize. So, just to think about volumes and whether you want to talk about it in terms of concentrate sales or unit case volume, do you still expect growth in the second half of the year from a volume standpoint, or do you expect, not still, do you expect?\nJames Quincey: Yes. So look, the long-term -- firstly, we had good growth last year, and we started the year with growth in unit case growth, obviously with PMO. As we look forward, what's normal on our revenue growth rate, we have called out, we expect to get a balance of the growth between unit cases and price/ mix on an ongoing basis. Exactly how that turns out in the second half will depend on the environment or the dynamics and whether inflation does moderate, how much pressure the consumer does come under. Our central view is we will continue to see unit case growth in the second half, combined with price/mix moderating, as I talked about, as the organic -- overall organic trend. But our focus remains executing against our plan. And obviously, that involves not just a focus on the marketing and the innovation. But within the RGM, we have, as one of our objectives, to maintain consumers within our franchise by leveraging our pricing and packaging strategies to support affordability around the world to keep the lower -- perhaps lower-income consumers in the franchise, which, of course, is to some extent an underpinning on volume. We prefer that as a strategy than to have more price and less volume. So again, our central view is to see continued level of unit case growth in the second half with obviously a moderating price mix to get to the overall revenue. But we're going to manage the business. In the end, we don't know exactly what's going to happen. There are lots of scenarios as to how this might play out, but we're confident we can drive the momentum of the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning, guys. So just a follow-up on that, James, can you give us a little bit of detail regionally on expectations for 2023? I know you're not going to quantify it, but just how you're thinking about the business conceptually relative to the results you delivered in Q4 here and take us around the world regionally? And then I guess just, secondly, if I can slip a clarification in, you're obviously starting off the year with top line guidance higher than you typically do, higher than long-term algorithm, higher than you started 2022 at despite delivering great results in 2022. It's a less visible world in theory externally. So I guess it sounded more like a good start so far this year. You have a lot of visibility given that, and that's what's driving some of that confidence, but I'd love to hear from your vantage point what sort of gives you the confidence there? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I'll take that in reverse order, Dara. We'll count that as two halves of a question rather than two questions. Let me give you another way of thinking about 2023 because I agree, there is a good deal of uncertainty on how this might play out. But there's been a tremendous amount of volatility and uncertainty over the last five years or four years. If you were to take a compound annual growth rate of unit cases and price/mix over the last, I don't know, four or five years and look at that number, I think you'd end up with something around two on volume and four or five on price. So you could look back and say, wow, we were on a crazy ride there. But in the end, we've got a good number. And so I look at 2023, so yes, something unexpected is bound to happen. But as we have expanded our ability to influence our own business, we have been adaptable in the face of all sorts of circumstances and being able to deliver the results we want, which is winning locally and turning that into our US dollar EPS growth. And so that's what gives us the confidence. We don't know what's going to happen, but we do know we've generated a lot of momentum, a lot of flexibility and a lot of agility to be able to manage through what's going to come at us. And so that's really the source of the confidence rather than being able to say we know what the future holds entirely. And as we look around the world, taking the various different pieces, starting in Europe perhaps or in EMEA, clearly, Europe is under some more pressure. The impacts of the conflict drove a much greater spike in -- short-term spike in inflation. That's playing itself through. It looks like the European economies are going to avoid a technical recession, but clearly, consumer demand is softening, and I think that's likely to continue into the rest of the year. And looking at the other markets in EMEA, if you're a resource seller, you're doing well. If you're a resource buyer, you're under more pressure. Obviously, Turkey, tragic situation with the earthquake, but also the economy has been under pressure already. So the emerging markets there are a full range. And similarly, in Africa, South Africa is important to us. They've got a very big problem in terms of energy, which is hampering the economic growth. So, there's more pressure in EMEA. The US continues to be strong. We've got momentum in the business on the top line, doing well. The situation seems to be moderating without causing a hard landing. As of yet, we expect to see the pressure to continue to moderate, but the economy and the consumption, at least of beverages, continues to be good. Latin America, similarly, there's been -- obviously, there's some places which continue to have very high inflation and the economic problems like the Argentinas of the world. But Latin America is doing well. And then out to Asia, obviously, the reopening of China is going to be a positive for the business, certainly on a cycle basis. India is flying. ASEAN, we expect come back up as those two large economies do well, and we think that will also do well for Japan. So we see both a continued acceleration or continued growth in a number of markets, some doing really well, but the general context being a moderation of the inflation. And then the zillion dollar question always comes back to is the process of bringing inflation down going to be hard, soft or perfect landing, and that we will see.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning. Just a question for John. I guess two -- just related to cash flow and interest expense. I know you talked about net interest expense being up for the year in '23. Can you just give us a little bit more detail in terms of -- I think consensus is sitting at like $600 million for net interest. So just, if you could give us a little more help in terms of where we should be on net interest expense. And then on free cash flow, you talked about the drivers that knock it down in '23. Would we expect that, as we kind of go into '24, '25, like that should normalize? So is this more kind of contained within this year and then you expect to normalize going forward? Thank you.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Bryan. Let me start the second question. The key drivers for '23, we have on top of underlying -- strong underlying performance, we'll have two significant buckets. One is we are stepping up our capital investments to support the growth agenda in a number of our operations around the world. And so that's a $400 million increase in '23. And then we have approximately $700 million related to an uptick in the transition tax and some M&A-related initiatives. So for 2024, we'll continue to invest in the business as the business needs, especially when it comes to providing capital for our growth plans. The transition tax goes up a couple of hundred million in 2024. That will be the second last year of the transition tax date that ends in 2025. So you can do the math on the variance that's gone in from 2023 to 2024. We expect the underlying performance to continue. We'll invest as we need to in the business to support the growth agenda. And we do have, I'd say, a couple of hundred million extra in 2024 million under transition tax. And then with regard to interest, yeah, as we've highlighted, we -- with our current debt portfolio, we will see an uptick in 2023 in interest charges and interest -- sorry, interest expense. And I'm not going to go into the specific numbers, but you can expect a couple of points of deleverage primarily driven by interest expense as we navigate through this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Hey, good morning. Thank you. James, maybe going back to the top line. For a while, you've been making simultaneous efforts to drive both affordability, on the one hand, and then premiumization on the other hand, and I think doing a good job along the way, balancing those, in some ways, competing efforts to net out in a way that ends up in both positive volume and positive price/mix territory. I guess the question is, as you as you look at 2023, do you see more opportunity in your efforts to optimize revenue growth on the value side and the affordability side, or is it on the premiumization side? And to the extent that there's a leaning, how does that impact where you prioritize incremental investments?\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Thanks, Steve. Absolutely, we see opportunities in 2023 and, frankly, beyond to continue to leverage the capability around RGM to both use affordability to keep typically lower income consumers enacted and engaged with our brand franchises whilst also pursuing premiumization. And then it's going to be dynamic implementation as we go forward. We're going to see continuations into 2023 of different sorts of packaging options, whether they be drives around returnables, whether they be drives, which obviously tend, given the economics of returnables to have lower price points, whether you see, for example, in emerging markets, the greater use of 1-liter packaging instead of larger packaging for at-home occasions, we're going to continue to see a lot of opportunity to push forward right across the world with affordability options. And given that they tend to be dilutive to margins, we also look for all those consumer opportunities for premiumization, whether it be directly a brand launch. I mean things like the Jack and Coke will be accretive to revenue, or directly within some of our brands to use the sleek cans and the smaller cans to kind of put more premium packaging into the marketplace. It will be an ongoing -- ongoing effort, and we don't see the runway of that running out anytime soon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNik Modi: Thanks. Good morning everyone. I just -- James, I just wanted to follow up on the last question regarding all the affordability packaging. Just based on the historical kind of observations across the world, how does it work with retail? I mean are these incremental phasings you're getting, or is it replacing older pack sizes that might have a lot more type sensitivity?\nJames Quincey: It can be both, Nik. And obviously, it depends whether we're talking about supermarkets, convenience stores or small mom-and-pops. The more we're talking about smaller stores or convenience or the mom-and-pops, the more it is replacement. Obviously, we make a big focus even in those smaller formats to gain incremental space, whether it'd be in the coal vaults or on the floor with our own coolers and our own racks. That absolutely does increase the beverage category phasings. But there's nothing wrong in any given store with looking at the SKU layout and saying, look, I'm going to take some of these SKUs and make them -- replace them with more affordable SKUs. And I'm going to take some of them and put more premium options in such that the total mix works not just for us, but also for the customer and, ultimately, for the consumer. It's got to work for the consumer. Otherwise, it's not going to rotate faster than the setup that's already in there because in the end, the customer is going to support these strategies because it works for them, because it works for the consumer, and everyone is better off with the implementation. So, yes, a mix of incremental versus cannibalized phasings, ultimately, by focusing on the consumer, you get a better answer for them, that creates a better answer for the customer, that creates a better answer for the coke system.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping you could provide a little more color on your plans for reinvestments this year and then maybe frame for us whether it will be stepped up versus last year. Also, how are you thinking about your marketing spend this year? Do you also have plans for that to accelerate? I guess, I'm ultimately trying to understand, how much flexibility you have to balance the momentum. You're certainly seeing in your business with reinvesting, while at the same time, letting some of the strength flow to the bottom line. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. We're clearly going to, as we have in 2021 and 2022, have a bias to invest for growth. That's our starting point. And as we demonstrated in the early years of the pandemic, if we see overall or in any specific countries that, that allocation towards driving growth is inappropriate at some sort of level, we've demonstrated the ability to act quickly to redirect the money either somewhere else or to let it go to the bottom line. So we're going to use all the data we get in from the field to be very dynamic in our resource allocation. We largely feel, we have achieved an appropriate level of marketing. Yes, that's going to increase in 2023 because we're growing the business in the same way, as John mentioned, we're going to increase our CapEx to support the bits of the business where CapEx needs to flow. But we are going to manage all of this with an agile hand depending on the circumstances. We talked in the answer -- the answers to the other questions that we don't know what the year will hold. We have a central view that it's growth-orientated, the balances, volume and price that accommodates different pressures around the world and different speeds of moderation of inflation, but it's a bias towards growth, and we will be fast and adaptable in the face of anything different.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hey, good morning, everybody. Can you maybe touch on briefly what you're seeing from the retail environment? We're seeing more and more articles on retailers pushing back on price increases across really all of CPG. If you could maybe just give us a sense of what you're seeing in your categories?\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean, first, one has to kind of break down the, global dynamic because each major region or each country is a different place. But let me start with the central idea that we pursue, which is we need to earn the right pay price. It's not our strategy to think of our business as commoditized where prices just flow up and down in a kind of mechanical way. We need to own our pricing by delivering for the consumers value that they appreciate through the marketing, through the innovation, through the RGM, the pricing and packaging work, through the execution such that they see value in our brands that can sustain the pricing that the input costs are driving us towards. And that ultimately then has to work for the customers. And because it has to work for the consumers, it then flows down the customers. So we've earned the right to price with the consumers. Then we can go to our customer partners and say, 'Look, we think that we can lead the beverage category to grow faster than your business.' Yes, we believe we're going to be more competitive because we understand the consumers and we're going to gain share, but we can lead the beverage category, deliver more growth for you and be a disproportionate share of your rate revenue growth relative to other categories,' which is what, for example, was demonstrated last year in Europe, where I think we led -- we added more revenue growth than any other system for retailers in Europe last year. And that is the platform on which we then fold in the conversations around pricing and packaging for any given year. So yes, of course, there's pressure in the marketplace. But in the end, we have an approach we believe, is consumer-centric and that drives growth for the customers because they also want to keep the consumers too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Carey: Hi. Good morning. So clearly, the past several years have had big variability in your channel and package mix within the overall price/mix equation with mobility constraints and sharp recoveries thereafter. Just taking John's commentary on a price-driven year for next year, James talking about still \u2013 volume will still be a factor, I guess, what I'm wondering is just underlying what's in that price/mix, whether you think channel and package mix have normalized, right? Said another way, there's \u2013 we're not really talking about recoveries in those line items and what's going forward will be kind of more offensive or growing from a normalized base. And so do you think you're back to that normalized base on \u2013 from a channel and package mix from which to grow? And then in 2023, do you have any thoughts on what the contribution is from price relative to channel or package mix? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: So firstly, in any given country, channel mix has largely recovered 2019 levels. Yes, there are some exceptions like China, which is only just now reopening, and a couple of other countries. And when I say, largely normalized, if you take something like the US, clearly, there are a number of away-from-home outlets that have dropped out of the marketplace. So there's a tail or there's a last piece of the recovery channel that is not going to happen overnight and may not happen for some time to come. But in headline terms, other than a little bit of positive channel effect perhaps in the first half, I think we can put a line on the channel mix being \u2013 or the recovery of the channel mix relative to the pandemic being a major driver of price/mix going forward. Yes, package mix will continue to be a factor, as it has been in previous years and prior to the pandemic, Clearly, as we pursue a dual strategy of keeping consumers in this franchise with affordability and looking for premiumization opportunities, the two can somewhat offset each other, one's dilutive, one's accretive, but they're both valuable strategies that need to taken forward. So I think predominantly, what you're going to see in 2023 is the ongoing moderation of rate pricing, both as we cycle rate increases or price increases from 2022 and as inflation in general and inflation specifically to us, whether it be in SG&A, or in commodities begins to moderate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos Laboy from HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nCarlos Laboy: Yes. Good morning, everyone. The Latin American bottlers keep guiding for stepped-up investments in traditional trade DSD capabilities to fully exploit this new cooperation framework they have with your firm. Do you think, this is already kicking into the systems financial performance and the model, in your view, adaptable to other parts of the world where the promise of maybe higher ROIC and stepped-up bottling CapEx, can drive system growth?\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Let me take that in parts. The features that we have in the long-term relationship model in Latin America, we're rolling those out in a number of other places. And clearly, the more we can intensify whatever the framework gets called, the degree of alignment towards investing to capture the opportunities in the marketplace, the better off we're going to be, us and our bottling partners, in any given geography. So absolutely, we continue to see opportunities to work even closer together to capture opportunities in the marketplace. The nature of those investments, the nature of the opportunity are not exactly the same as Latin America. Clearly, the trade structure differs around the world. Latin America has a number of particular features that not necessarily replicated in the US or Europe or Japan, for example. But the overall concept of a tighter longer term investment focus on the opportunities is really going to drive -- continue to drive performance into the future years. And I think, in Latin America, we've got a great business there collectively as a system because we focused on investing into the marketplace and into the traditional trade for a very long time, along with all the other customers in Latin America. But there are still plenty of opportunities to go both from the top line and from the point of view of improving returns. So I think you'll find or everyone will find that the Latin American bottlers, as bottlers around the world are -- that we see a lot -- collectively, we see a lot of opportunities ahead of us to drive the top line and to continue to improve returns on the bottling assets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, operator, and good morning. James, as we think about the 7% to 8% organic sales growth guidance, what is the price/mix carryover into 2023? You said it, obviously, will moderate, but what is -- are you embedding any additional pricing that is not in the trade yet? And how are you planning for China volumes in 2023? What is the benefit from there, or any mix dynamics we should be aware of? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yeah. So we're certainly planning for China to become more normalized, reopening ala the US and Europe. And so we will see a more normal level of volume in China and a recovery to the 2019 or growth on the 2019 numbers as time come through as we go through the year in China. And then in terms of the carryover, clearly, there's some carryover, particularly in the first half from 2022. But we will be taking pricing in 2023. Now having said we will be taking pricing, the world is very different. I mean, there are countries where inflation is well over 50%. So pricing is taken multiple times a year. Argentina is an obvious example. So in the developed markets, it's likely we'll trend more back towards more standard cycles of pricing, but there will be price increases across the world in 2023 to reflect both the continuing inflation in import and SG&A costs. Obviously, we need to, as I talked about in the previous answer, earn the right to that pricing, but there will be pricing in 2023.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much and congratulations on a terrific year. So over the last few years, James, you and your team have made significant cultural changes, organizational changes, changes to the product portfolio. As you look at 2023, what are the key initiatives that you're looking to drive to set up for continued strong growth over the next decade or so longer-term and perhaps weaved into that answer, where things are on Costa, on BODYARMOR and on any other new initiatives that you think would be helpful to discuss? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Great. Thanks, Rob. And certainly, we will unpack a little more of this at the CAGNY presentation and the CAGNY conversation. So I'm sure I won't do full justice to the question in this session.  In terms of the initiatives in the marketplace, we have an aspiration of being a total beverage company everywhere. That's not going to happen overnight. And so we need to make progress in a disciplined way in different category, country combinations, as we've talked about, to establish leadership positions, preferably quality leadership positions, in the next set of country category combinations on our journey to the total aspiration. And within that, there are ones that are off to the races and flying away. And there are ones where we still need to demonstrate to ourselves we can execute against the vision. If I take the two you called out, Costa, BODYARMOR, to start with, the essential thesis behind coffee remains the same. It's a huge market. It's growing. There's lots of money in it. If we can find a path, there's a tremendous growth opportunity for the Coke system there. We've got a vision. The reality is timing was very unfortunate getting it just before the pandemic. In strategic terms, despite all the experimentation, despite all the learning, despite all the initial steps, in big strategic terms, we haven't advanced because, essentially, COVID put it on hold for three years. We now need to get the execution ramped up for cost against the vision and in the coming years demonstrate that, that holds water. BODYARMOR, great job. We obviously incorporated that into the company last year. And I think we -- whilst we always expect some level of disruption as we move a business that has been grown quickly and prepared for sale by the founders into the Coke system, there's often some disruption in the short-term. But frankly, I think there was more in 2022 than we would -- than we expected or would have liked. But we have a good plan going forward in 2023 that will kind of reset BODYARMOR on a good path and in a complementary way to Powerade. Other initiatives, which we're looking very interested in the degree of traction in some of the alcohol experiments, particularly looking to see Jack and Coke do well. Early data in Mexico launched at the end of last year was encouraging ahead of expectations. The US launch will be very interesting at the end of March. And all of that will be backed up by the continued work on the culture and organization, whilst it will never -- nothing ever settles. It never ends. But I think, really, it's about continuing to stand up and execute against the internal initiatives we've already launched. The organization is coming together. We made a few tweaks in North America coming into the year, but the organization is getting up and running and starting to harm. The marketing model change is starting to show good results and promise. So, I think, it's a question of seeing through the things we've launched to really up our game in the coming years.\nOperator: Our last question today will come from Charlie Higgs from Redburn. Please, go ahead. Your line is open.\nCharlie Higgs: Hi, James, John. I hope you\u2019re both well. My final question is just on India, where it looks like it's had just a record year. Could you maybe just expand a little bit more on India? Is it still being driven by the affordable price point strategy? Are you adding distribution that means, maybe this volume growth is actually sustainable over the long term? And then, James, maybe you could just give us some color on your long-term view on India. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes. India had a cracking year last year and is off to a strong start this year. I think, the -- our overall backdrop to this is, firstly, that the Indian economy and the Indian consumer base is approaching, in highest level terms, a level of GDP per head, at which historically, the beverage industry has tended to accelerate its development. And so, we are very encouraged by the potential in India to develop a fantastic beverage industry and beverage opportunity. I mean, ultimately, the development of industry is very nascent in India, and there's a huge potential to build the industry over many decades. And so, that's being driven, not just by the affordable entry price points, although they are growing. Really, it's a question of actually everything. It's growing on all dimensions. It's growing in terms of the depth of the different brands. It's growing in distribution. It's growing in number of packages. And so, I think, there's a huge long potential in India. It won't, in all likelihood, be a straight line, but there is huge potential in India. And really in a way, India exemplifies the very long-term opportunity of a whole set of emerging markets, India, Africa, parts of Eurasia, parts of ASEAN to actually -- they themselves have 80% of the world's population. And the development of the beverage industry is a-third of what it is in the developed market. They only pay for about I think 3 in 10 of the commercial beverages, which is -- or 2 in 10 of the commercial beverage, whereas 7 in 10 in the developed ones. So India typifies the long-term potential of the beverage industry to keep growing. And I think it's a market that is set to take off.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Thank you, operator. So to summarize, we have momentum in our business. We're winning in the marketplace, sustainability embedded in our strategies and strong alignment with our bottling partners. We are pursuing excellence in brand building, innovation, revenue growth management and execution to add and retain consumers and drive long-term value for our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning. Thank you.\nOperator: Gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Quincey",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. 2022 was a strong year for us. We executed well and grew amidst a challenging macro environment. We did this in part by focusing on expanding the sphere of what we can control. We delivered on our top line and bottom line guidance, and we continue to create value by investing in our loved brands, even as we faced a very dynamic backdrop. Today, I'll reflect on our fourth quarter and the year's performance and set the stage for 2023. I'll also share how we're operating differently today, which makes us confident in our ability to deliver our 2023 guidance, and well equipped for a future that continues to be volatile and uncertain. John will then discuss our results and our 2023 outlook in more detail. During the fourth quarter, the environment remained dynamic as inflation, geopolitical tensions, pandemic-related mobility restrictions and currency volatility persisted. Despite this range of factors, consumer demand held up relatively well, and our industry remains strong. In the fourth quarter, we remain focused on our growth strategy and continued to create value for our consumers and customers. We maintained agility to navigate this challenging environment and delivered 15% organic revenue growth in the quarter, with strong growth across operating segments. This was driven by pricing actions across markets and revenue growth management initiatives to retain and add consumers. While we saw robust volume growth across many markets, this was more than offset by the suspension of our business in Russia and the impact on consumption, driven by varying levels of pandemic-related mobility restrictions and the surge in COVID cases in China. Overall, throughout 2022, we have maintained consistent volume growth relative to 2019. We've gained both volume and value share for the consolidated business for both the quarter and the year. So far, in 2023, the volume growth trends versus 2019 are in line with last year, and we are laser-focused on executing on our growth plans. Our streamlined portfolio of global and local brands and stepped-up consumer-facing investments continue to fuel the competitive edge of the Coca-Cola system to deliver value in any environment. Our network organizational structure enables this strategy. We've connected our operating units, our functions and our platform services organization for strong end-to-end coordination, which helps us identify key opportunities for meaningful long-term growth. And on top of this, we remain well aligned with our bottling partners, which further builds on our strength as a network system. As we look to 2023, many uncertainties remain in the macro economy, whether from economic policies, consumer demand, inflation, supply chain, war and geopolitics. Instead of trying to forecast and predict the many directions things could move, we are focused on delivering on our key objectives: firstly, pursuing excellence globally and winning locally through relentless consumer centricity to continue the top line momentum; secondly, investing for the long-term health of the business and raising the bar across all elements of our strategic flywheel; thirdly, generating US dollar EPS growth to deliver value for our shareowners. We continue to build the right capabilities and strengthen the system alignment to deliver in a dynamic world, and we continue to invest to raise the bar. We are executing more efficiently and effectively on a local level while maintaining flexibility on a global level. Throughout 2022, we saw many examples of harnessing our enhanced capabilities to win locally. Our new marketing model is working. We've linked occasions and passion points to drive engagement. We're experimenting to optimize marketing. This is driving deeper connections with consumers, reaching them in unique and new ways. We are tying our beverages to consumption occasions and engaging consumers through local experiences. For example, in Vietnam, to support the reopening of away-from-home accounts, we launched the pilot of Coke is Cooking campaign in October. In this month-long campaign to help drive traffic back to stores, we partner with more than 700 food shops. We created thousands of food and Coke combo deals that consumers purchased at these food shops, along with Coke is Cooking merchandising and digital support by our local influencers. This was the first time we used an on-ground event as a commercial asset, creating a social and digital content generator. The campaign resulted in more than 1 million combo transactions and 20% uplift for participating merchants. We're leveraging passion points locally to create immersive experiences and drive consumption. For example, in Latin America, our live music strategy created memorable in-person and digital experiences, elevating consumer engagement. We partnered with Rock in Rio, one of the biggest music festivals in the world, and created new opportunities for consumers to access content through live streams and in the metaverse. As a result, we boosted our reach from approximately 700,000 attendees to more than 45 million consumers across the region, and our sales inside the festival increased 23% versus the last festival. In India, the Thums Up, Stump Cam was a never before seen activation for cricket fans where consumers could scan a QR code on product label and get access to exclusive match moments of the ICC T20 Cricket World Cup through a camera installed on one of the wickets. Throughout the 45-day tournament, we use first-party data and artificial intelligence to send personalized content to consumers based on their favorite matches, and we amplified the experience through sports influencers. This campaign showed strong results with Thums Up growing volume ahead of our total sparkling portfolio in India during the activation period, contributing to strong volume growth for Thums Up for the full year. This drove about 1/4 of India's total volume growth for the year. Thums Up also experienced its highest monthly market share jump during the activation period. We are driving consumer interest and action through digital experiences using the power of partnerships across platforms. For example, in Germany, we partnered with our key online customer and created voice-based branded experiences with its voice assistant to drive engagement and grow positive brand perception. This allowed consumers to learn more about Coca-Cola products and shop on voice assistant-enabled devices using only their voice. The campaign delivered strong results with a reach of 11 million impressions. Additionally, consumers that engaged with its voice-based experience had a 25% add-to-cart rate. And lastly, we're delivering new and unexpected innovation by leveraging Gen Z insights. In the US, we launched Minute Maid Aguas Frescas. The product is made with real fruit juices, is noncarbonated and comes in three exciting flavors. It was originally available as a limited launch in 16-ounce ready-to-drink cans. A disruptive end-to-end digital media marketing campaign created early momentum, which led us to quickly scale this experiment to our Freestyle platform and other fountain offerings. In 2022, the product had a 60% repeat rate and won the Best New Product award from Convenience Store News. We have been building our revenue growth management and execution capabilities for many years, and we've made good progress, as shown by our ability to offset much of the inflation we saw in 2022 and delivered strong volume and transaction growth. There is still much work to be done to maximize revenue by further segmenting our markets and consumers based on additional variables. We are leveraging digital and data-backed insights to better understand our consumers. This will help drive affordable propositions for basket incidence growth and recruit new drinkers. It will also lead to premiumization to drive price and mix. For example, in Europe, we grew both volume and value share for the last year. We partnered with key customers to drive growth through affordability and premiumization initiatives that tapped into the key consumption occasions of meals and breaks. This end-to-end execution resulted in higher basket incidents and buying households across all key channels in Europe. Globally, this strong system execution focus generated 80 million additional shopping trips for our products and added 17 million households to our base. Through our stepped-up capabilities, we are getting better at synchronizing demand creation and demand fulfillment, driving top-tier value creation for our customers. We measure success by the value we create for our stakeholders and by how we are creating a better shared future for people, communities and the planet. During 2022, we made progress across these sustainability priorities. We leveraged our marketing power to drive growth of our low- and no-calorie beverages and continue to provide smaller package choices to enable consumers to manage sugar intake. Approximately two-thirds of the products in our portfolio have less than 100 calories per 12-ounce serving. On packaging, we've set a new industry-leading goal to have 25% of our volume globally being refillable or reusable packaging by 2030. Additionally, we are continuing to increase cooler energy efficiency and the use of HFC free coolers to make progress on our science-based targets, while creating a clear road map with our system and suppliers to achieve our carbon emissions reduction ambition. On water, as part of our 2030 water security strategy, we stepped up investments in nature-based water solutions exemplified by the work we're doing with the Nature Conservancy and other partners. Globally, we are working to strengthen the links between replenishment projects and nature-based solutions. We further embedded sustainability into our strategy by linking diversity equity inclusion performance measures to our executive annual incentive program and by linking water and our PET packaging measures to our executives' long-term incentive program. Overall, we continue to focus on using our leadership and scale to drive change while delivering results and building resilience. Finally, before I hand it over to John, I want to acknowledge that our strong results in 2022 reflect the collective efforts of our system partners and the growth mindset of our system employees. Guided by our purpose, we are investing behind our capabilities and further cultivating our growth mindset to be well positioned to create value and deliver on our objectives. While we have momentum in our business, we know uncertainty remains as we turn the page to a new year. We will continue to focus on expanding the sphere of what we can control to drive growth in 2023 and beyond. We'll talk about this in more detail when we return to CAGNY in person next Tuesday and would encourage all of you to listen in. With that, I'll turn the call over to John. Yeah, sure. Good morning, Lauren. Firstly, as John said, we feel confident about our outlook to drive the year from the top line. Let me connect that perhaps starting to 2022. As we commented, we saw steady volume growth through the year, including the fourth quarter. I know we reported a headline number of minus one. But if you accommodate the suspension of Russia and the COVID restrictions in China and take a three-year CAGR of volume growth, you see a pretty constant growth momentum through the year. And we would also comment that, that growth momentum has continued into the beginning of 2023. So we see strong underlying volume momentum or ongoing volume momentum that we have been able to achieve by our focus on the marketing innovation, the RGM and the execution to accommodate the need for affordability and premiumization in the face of inflation. And as John commented, we do see both inflation moderating as we go through 2023 and of course, our own pricing PMO beginning to moderate as we go through '23 in part because, the input costs inflation is moderating, but also because we begin to cycle some of the price increases from 2022. And what that's likely to net out as obviously, we've given a seven to eight for the full year. And what we're likely to see is the beginning of the Q1, we're likely to see revenue growth more close to what -- the sort of levels we were achieving coming out of last year. And that then logically, the organic growth rate moderates as we get towards the end of the year, looking to close out on a more normalized level of revenue growth. And then when you average that out, you get to the seven to eight. So, I think we're going to see good momentum through the year, moderating revenue growth rate as a function of moderating inflation ultimately. And what will remain is a good, strong underlying momentum of our business that has been powering the last five years, and we are confident we'll continue to power the years ahead at the sort of level of top line relative to the long-term growth model that we have previously talked about. Yes. So look, the long-term -- firstly, we had good growth last year, and we started the year with growth in unit case growth, obviously with PMO. As we look forward, what's normal on our revenue growth rate, we have called out, we expect to get a balance of the growth between unit cases and price/ mix on an ongoing basis. Exactly how that turns out in the second half will depend on the environment or the dynamics and whether inflation does moderate, how much pressure the consumer does come under. Our central view is we will continue to see unit case growth in the second half, combined with price/mix moderating, as I talked about, as the organic -- overall organic trend. But our focus remains executing against our plan. And obviously, that involves not just a focus on the marketing and the innovation. But within the RGM, we have, as one of our objectives, to maintain consumers within our franchise by leveraging our pricing and packaging strategies to support affordability around the world to keep the lower -- perhaps lower-income consumers in the franchise, which, of course, is to some extent an underpinning on volume. We prefer that as a strategy than to have more price and less volume. So again, our central view is to see continued level of unit case growth in the second half with obviously a moderating price mix to get to the overall revenue. But we're going to manage the business. In the end, we don't know exactly what's going to happen. There are lots of scenarios as to how this might play out, but we're confident we can drive the momentum of the business. Sure. I'll take that in reverse order, Dara. We'll count that as two halves of a question rather than two questions. Let me give you another way of thinking about 2023 because I agree, there is a good deal of uncertainty on how this might play out. But there's been a tremendous amount of volatility and uncertainty over the last five years or four years. If you were to take a compound annual growth rate of unit cases and price/mix over the last, I don't know, four or five years and look at that number, I think you'd end up with something around two on volume and four or five on price. So you could look back and say, wow, we were on a crazy ride there. But in the end, we've got a good number. And so I look at 2023, so yes, something unexpected is bound to happen. But as we have expanded our ability to influence our own business, we have been adaptable in the face of all sorts of circumstances and being able to deliver the results we want, which is winning locally and turning that into our US dollar EPS growth. And so that's what gives us the confidence. We don't know what's going to happen, but we do know we've generated a lot of momentum, a lot of flexibility and a lot of agility to be able to manage through what's going to come at us. And so that's really the source of the confidence rather than being able to say we know what the future holds entirely. And as we look around the world, taking the various different pieces, starting in Europe perhaps or in EMEA, clearly, Europe is under some more pressure. The impacts of the conflict drove a much greater spike in -- short-term spike in inflation. That's playing itself through. It looks like the European economies are going to avoid a technical recession, but clearly, consumer demand is softening, and I think that's likely to continue into the rest of the year. And looking at the other markets in EMEA, if you're a resource seller, you're doing well. If you're a resource buyer, you're under more pressure. Obviously, Turkey, tragic situation with the earthquake, but also the economy has been under pressure already. So the emerging markets there are a full range. And similarly, in Africa, South Africa is important to us. They've got a very big problem in terms of energy, which is hampering the economic growth. So, there's more pressure in EMEA. The US continues to be strong. We've got momentum in the business on the top line, doing well. The situation seems to be moderating without causing a hard landing. As of yet, we expect to see the pressure to continue to moderate, but the economy and the consumption, at least of beverages, continues to be good. Latin America, similarly, there's been -- obviously, there's some places which continue to have very high inflation and the economic problems like the Argentinas of the world. But Latin America is doing well. And then out to Asia, obviously, the reopening of China is going to be a positive for the business, certainly on a cycle basis. India is flying. ASEAN, we expect come back up as those two large economies do well, and we think that will also do well for Japan. So we see both a continued acceleration or continued growth in a number of markets, some doing really well, but the general context being a moderation of the inflation. And then the zillion dollar question always comes back to is the process of bringing inflation down going to be hard, soft or perfect landing, and that we will see. Yeah. Thanks, Steve. Absolutely, we see opportunities in 2023 and, frankly, beyond to continue to leverage the capability around RGM to both use affordability to keep typically lower income consumers enacted and engaged with our brand franchises whilst also pursuing premiumization. And then it's going to be dynamic implementation as we go forward. We're going to see continuations into 2023 of different sorts of packaging options, whether they be drives around returnables, whether they be drives, which obviously tend, given the economics of returnables to have lower price points, whether you see, for example, in emerging markets, the greater use of 1-liter packaging instead of larger packaging for at-home occasions, we're going to continue to see a lot of opportunity to push forward right across the world with affordability options. And given that they tend to be dilutive to margins, we also look for all those consumer opportunities for premiumization, whether it be directly a brand launch. I mean things like the Jack and Coke will be accretive to revenue, or directly within some of our brands to use the sleek cans and the smaller cans to kind of put more premium packaging into the marketplace. It will be an ongoing -- ongoing effort, and we don't see the runway of that running out anytime soon. It can be both, Nik. And obviously, it depends whether we're talking about supermarkets, convenience stores or small mom-and-pops. The more we're talking about smaller stores or convenience or the mom-and-pops, the more it is replacement. Obviously, we make a big focus even in those smaller formats to gain incremental space, whether it'd be in the coal vaults or on the floor with our own coolers and our own racks. That absolutely does increase the beverage category phasings. But there's nothing wrong in any given store with looking at the SKU layout and saying, look, I'm going to take some of these SKUs and make them -- replace them with more affordable SKUs. And I'm going to take some of them and put more premium options in such that the total mix works not just for us, but also for the customer and, ultimately, for the consumer. It's got to work for the consumer. Otherwise, it's not going to rotate faster than the setup that's already in there because in the end, the customer is going to support these strategies because it works for them, because it works for the consumer, and everyone is better off with the implementation. So, yes, a mix of incremental versus cannibalized phasings, ultimately, by focusing on the consumer, you get a better answer for them, that creates a better answer for the customer, that creates a better answer for the coke system. Yes, sure. We're clearly going to, as we have in 2021 and 2022, have a bias to invest for growth. That's our starting point. And as we demonstrated in the early years of the pandemic, if we see overall or in any specific countries that, that allocation towards driving growth is inappropriate at some sort of level, we've demonstrated the ability to act quickly to redirect the money either somewhere else or to let it go to the bottom line. So we're going to use all the data we get in from the field to be very dynamic in our resource allocation. We largely feel, we have achieved an appropriate level of marketing. Yes, that's going to increase in 2023 because we're growing the business in the same way, as John mentioned, we're going to increase our CapEx to support the bits of the business where CapEx needs to flow. But we are going to manage all of this with an agile hand depending on the circumstances. We talked in the answer -- the answers to the other questions that we don't know what the year will hold. We have a central view that it's growth-orientated, the balances, volume and price that accommodates different pressures around the world and different speeds of moderation of inflation, but it's a bias towards growth, and we will be fast and adaptable in the face of anything different. Sure. I mean, first, one has to kind of break down the, global dynamic because each major region or each country is a different place. But let me start with the central idea that we pursue, which is we need to earn the right pay price. It's not our strategy to think of our business as commoditized where prices just flow up and down in a kind of mechanical way. We need to own our pricing by delivering for the consumers value that they appreciate through the marketing, through the innovation, through the RGM, the pricing and packaging work, through the execution such that they see value in our brands that can sustain the pricing that the input costs are driving us towards. And that ultimately then has to work for the customers. And because it has to work for the consumers, it then flows down the customers. So we've earned the right to price with the consumers. Then we can go to our customer partners and say, 'Look, we think that we can lead the beverage category to grow faster than your business.' Yes, we believe we're going to be more competitive because we understand the consumers and we're going to gain share, but we can lead the beverage category, deliver more growth for you and be a disproportionate share of your rate revenue growth relative to other categories,' which is what, for example, was demonstrated last year in Europe, where I think we led -- we added more revenue growth than any other system for retailers in Europe last year. And that is the platform on which we then fold in the conversations around pricing and packaging for any given year. So yes, of course, there's pressure in the marketplace. But in the end, we have an approach we believe, is consumer-centric and that drives growth for the customers because they also want to keep the consumers too. So firstly, in any given country, channel mix has largely recovered 2019 levels. Yes, there are some exceptions like China, which is only just now reopening, and a couple of other countries. And when I say, largely normalized, if you take something like the US, clearly, there are a number of away-from-home outlets that have dropped out of the marketplace. So there's a tail or there's a last piece of the recovery channel that is not going to happen overnight and may not happen for some time to come. But in headline terms, other than a little bit of positive channel effect perhaps in the first half, I think we can put a line on the channel mix being \u2013 or the recovery of the channel mix relative to the pandemic being a major driver of price/mix going forward. Yes, package mix will continue to be a factor, as it has been in previous years and prior to the pandemic, Clearly, as we pursue a dual strategy of keeping consumers in this franchise with affordability and looking for premiumization opportunities, the two can somewhat offset each other, one's dilutive, one's accretive, but they're both valuable strategies that need to taken forward. So I think predominantly, what you're going to see in 2023 is the ongoing moderation of rate pricing, both as we cycle rate increases or price increases from 2022 and as inflation in general and inflation specifically to us, whether it be in SG&A, or in commodities begins to moderate. Yeah. Let me take that in parts. The features that we have in the long-term relationship model in Latin America, we're rolling those out in a number of other places. And clearly, the more we can intensify whatever the framework gets called, the degree of alignment towards investing to capture the opportunities in the marketplace, the better off we're going to be, us and our bottling partners, in any given geography. So absolutely, we continue to see opportunities to work even closer together to capture opportunities in the marketplace. The nature of those investments, the nature of the opportunity are not exactly the same as Latin America. Clearly, the trade structure differs around the world. Latin America has a number of particular features that not necessarily replicated in the US or Europe or Japan, for example. But the overall concept of a tighter longer term investment focus on the opportunities is really going to drive -- continue to drive performance into the future years. And I think, in Latin America, we've got a great business there collectively as a system because we focused on investing into the marketplace and into the traditional trade for a very long time, along with all the other customers in Latin America. But there are still plenty of opportunities to go both from the top line and from the point of view of improving returns. So I think you'll find or everyone will find that the Latin American bottlers, as bottlers around the world are -- that we see a lot -- collectively, we see a lot of opportunities ahead of us to drive the top line and to continue to improve returns on the bottling assets. Yeah. So we're certainly planning for China to become more normalized, reopening ala the US and Europe. And so we will see a more normal level of volume in China and a recovery to the 2019 or growth on the 2019 numbers as time come through as we go through the year in China. And then in terms of the carryover, clearly, there's some carryover, particularly in the first half from 2022. But we will be taking pricing in 2023. Now having said we will be taking pricing, the world is very different. I mean, there are countries where inflation is well over 50%. So pricing is taken multiple times a year. Argentina is an obvious example. So in the developed markets, it's likely we'll trend more back towards more standard cycles of pricing, but there will be price increases across the world in 2023 to reflect both the continuing inflation in import and SG&A costs. Obviously, we need to, as I talked about in the previous answer, earn the right to that pricing, but there will be pricing in 2023. Yes. Great. Thanks, Rob. And certainly, we will unpack a little more of this at the CAGNY presentation and the CAGNY conversation. So I'm sure I won't do full justice to the question in this session.  In terms of the initiatives in the marketplace, we have an aspiration of being a total beverage company everywhere. That's not going to happen overnight. And so we need to make progress in a disciplined way in different category, country combinations, as we've talked about, to establish leadership positions, preferably quality leadership positions, in the next set of country category combinations on our journey to the total aspiration. And within that, there are ones that are off to the races and flying away. And there are ones where we still need to demonstrate to ourselves we can execute against the vision. If I take the two you called out, Costa, BODYARMOR, to start with, the essential thesis behind coffee remains the same. It's a huge market. It's growing. There's lots of money in it. If we can find a path, there's a tremendous growth opportunity for the Coke system there. We've got a vision. The reality is timing was very unfortunate getting it just before the pandemic. In strategic terms, despite all the experimentation, despite all the learning, despite all the initial steps, in big strategic terms, we haven't advanced because, essentially, COVID put it on hold for three years. We now need to get the execution ramped up for cost against the vision and in the coming years demonstrate that, that holds water. BODYARMOR, great job. We obviously incorporated that into the company last year. And I think we -- whilst we always expect some level of disruption as we move a business that has been grown quickly and prepared for sale by the founders into the Coke system, there's often some disruption in the short-term. But frankly, I think there was more in 2022 than we would -- than we expected or would have liked. But we have a good plan going forward in 2023 that will kind of reset BODYARMOR on a good path and in a complementary way to Powerade. Other initiatives, which we're looking very interested in the degree of traction in some of the alcohol experiments, particularly looking to see Jack and Coke do well. Early data in Mexico launched at the end of last year was encouraging ahead of expectations. The US launch will be very interesting at the end of March. And all of that will be backed up by the continued work on the culture and organization, whilst it will never -- nothing ever settles. It never ends. But I think, really, it's about continuing to stand up and execute against the internal initiatives we've already launched. The organization is coming together. We made a few tweaks in North America coming into the year, but the organization is getting up and running and starting to harm. The marketing model change is starting to show good results and promise. So, I think, it's a question of seeing through the things we've launched to really up our game in the coming years. Yes. India had a cracking year last year and is off to a strong start this year. I think, the -- our overall backdrop to this is, firstly, that the Indian economy and the Indian consumer base is approaching, in highest level terms, a level of GDP per head, at which historically, the beverage industry has tended to accelerate its development. And so, we are very encouraged by the potential in India to develop a fantastic beverage industry and beverage opportunity. I mean, ultimately, the development of industry is very nascent in India, and there's a huge potential to build the industry over many decades. And so, that's being driven, not just by the affordable entry price points, although they are growing. Really, it's a question of actually everything. It's growing on all dimensions. It's growing in terms of the depth of the different brands. It's growing in distribution. It's growing in number of packages. And so, I think, there's a huge long potential in India. It won't, in all likelihood, be a straight line, but there is huge potential in India. And really in a way, India exemplifies the very long-term opportunity of a whole set of emerging markets, India, Africa, parts of Eurasia, parts of ASEAN to actually -- they themselves have 80% of the world's population. And the development of the beverage industry is a-third of what it is in the developed market. They only pay for about I think 3 in 10 of the commercial beverages, which is -- or 2 in 10 of the commercial beverage, whereas 7 in 10 in the developed ones. So India typifies the long-term potential of the beverage industry to keep growing. And I think it's a market that is set to take off. Thank you, operator. So to summarize, we have momentum in our business. We're winning in the marketplace, sustainability embedded in our strategies and strong alignment with our bottling partners. We are pursuing excellence in brand building, innovation, revenue growth management and execution to add and retain consumers and drive long-term value for our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning. Thank you."

            "name": "John Murphy",
            "content": "Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we continued to drive strong top line-led results as we execute for growth in a dynamic operating environment. We grew organic revenues 15%. Unit cases declined 1% as broad-based growth across most markets and investments in the marketplace were more than offset by the suspension of business in Russia and the decline in China. Concentrate sales were 3 points ahead of unit cases for the quarter, primarily driven by one additional day and the timing of concentrate shipments. Our price/mix growth of 12% was driven by pricing actions across operating segments along with revenue growth management initiatives and favorable channel and package mix. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 90 basis points versus the prior year, mainly driven by currency headwinds in a volatile macro backdrop and the mechanical effect of consolidating the BODYARMOR finished goods business. Underlying gross margin was in line with the prior year, driven by strong organic revenue growth offset by higher commodity costs. We continued to significantly accelerate our marketing investments to engage and retain existing consumers as well as, again, new consumers. Despite higher costs across the P&L, increased marketing and currency headwinds, comparable operating margin expanded 65 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by underlying operating margin expansion due to robust top line growth across operating segments. Importantly, this resulted in full year comparable operating margin be in line with the prior year despite significant currency acquisition and cost headwinds. Below the line, we were impacted by higher net interest expense, along with lower other income due to cycling higher pension income from the prior year. Therefore, fourth quarter comparable EPS of $0.45 was in line with last year despite higher-than-expected currency headwinds. This resulted in full year comparable EPS of $2.48, an increase of 7% versus the prior year, driven by strong underlying business performance, partially offset by 10 points of currency headwinds. For the year, we delivered free cash flow of $9.5 billion, a decline of 15% versus the prior year. Much of the decline versus our expectations occurred due to the deliberate buildup of inventory in the face of a volatile commodity environment and higher-than-anticipated tax payments. Additionally, cash flow was impacted by cycling working capital benefits from the prior year and higher incentive payments in 2022. Even with these items, our underlying cash flow generation remains strong, and we continue to make progress on our cash flow agenda. Our three-year average free cash flow conversion ratio is above 100%, ahead of our long-term target. Our balance sheet remains strong with our net debt leverage of 1.8 times EBITDA as of the end of 2022, which is below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same, and we continue to prioritize investing in the business to drive long-term growth, as well as delivering dividend growth for our shareowners. At the same time, we remain mindful of maintaining our financial flexibility amidst the ongoing tax dispute with the IRS and are learning from the last few years of how important it is to build resilience in all of our plans. As James mentioned, in 2023, we expect the operating environment to remain dynamic. We have the right portfolio, a very focused strategy, a flexible and adaptable structure and a system with the ability to reinvest in the business. This gives us the confidence that we will continue to deliver on our three key objectives, pursuing excellence globally, and winning locally; investing for the long-term health of the business; generating US dollar EPS growth. With that in mind, this morning, we provided guidance for 2023 that builds on our strong results in 2022. We expect organic revenue growth of 7% to 8%, primarily led by price/mix amidst the ongoing inflationary environment. And we expect comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 7% to 9% versus 2022. Since we provided our initial outlook on currency in October, the currency environment has improved, but remains volatile. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate two to three-point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate three to four-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we expect per-case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023. We continue to expect our underlying effective tax rate to be 19.5% for 2023. And all in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5% versus $2.48 in 2022. We expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations less approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments. I would like to highlight that included in the $11.4 billion of cash from operations are two discrete items: transition tax payments of approximately $720 million; a scheduled increase of $335 million versus 2022; payments associated with various M&A transactions of approximately $350 million. Excluding these, our implied free cash flow conversion would be within our long-term guidance. This guidance does not include any payments related to our ongoing US income tax dispute with the IRS. Recently, the tax court issued an opinion on a case involving a separate company. The tax court will now apply this opinion to our case and ultimately render a final decision in our case, allowing us to move forward with the appeals process. As previously discussed, we intend to assert our claims on appeal, vigorously defend our position and believe we will ultimately prevail. Overall, we don't expect this to have a bearing on our ability to deliver on our capital allocation agenda and drive long-term business growth. There are some considerations to keep in mind for 2023. We expect price mix to moderate through the year as we cycle our pricing initiatives from the prior year. While the inflationary environment appears to be cooling, we are still expecting to see elevated inflation, across our operating costs. We have stepped up our marketing investments for the last few years and we will continue to invest to support momentum. And given the ongoing backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see higher net interest expense given our effective exposure to floating rate debt. Finally, due to our reporting calendar, there will be one less day in the first quarter and one additional day in the fourth quarter. Having delivered strong results in 2022, we are focused on driving a top line-led growth equation in many types of environments. We are well positioned to deliver on guidance for 2023, thanks to the incredible people we have around the world, the strong alignment we have with our bottling partners and the great plans we have for the coming year. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions. Thanks, Bryan. Let me start the second question. The key drivers for '23, we have on top of underlying -- strong underlying performance, we'll have two significant buckets. One is we are stepping up our capital investments to support the growth agenda in a number of our operations around the world. And so that's a $400 million increase in '23. And then we have approximately $700 million related to an uptick in the transition tax and some M&A-related initiatives. So for 2024, we'll continue to invest in the business as the business needs, especially when it comes to providing capital for our growth plans. The transition tax goes up a couple of hundred million in 2024. That will be the second last year of the transition tax date that ends in 2025. So you can do the math on the variance that's gone in from 2023 to 2024. We expect the underlying performance to continue. We'll invest as we need to in the business to support the growth agenda. And we do have, I'd say, a couple of hundred million extra in 2024 million under transition tax. And then with regard to interest, yeah, as we've highlighted, we -- with our current debt portfolio, we will see an uptick in 2023 in interest charges and interest -- sorry, interest expense. And I'm not going to go into the specific numbers, but you can expect a couple of points of deleverage primarily driven by interest expense as we navigate through this year."

Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.\nTim Leveridge: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website at coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins. In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC reports.  Following prepared remarks, we will turn the call over for questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing first, and then reenter the queue. Now, let me turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey : Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. After a strong first half of the year, we continued our momentum in the third quarter with effective execution across our global system despite a macro backdrop that remains challenging. In the face of these pressures, consumers stayed resilient, and we continue to invest behind our loved brands to drive value in the marketplace and growth in our business. Given our strong results year-to-date, and increased visibility into the rest of the year, we are raising our top line and bottom line guidance, while continuing to invest strategically. So this morning, I'll provide a business update and discuss how we are expanding the circumference of what we can control. Then I'll pass to John, and he will discuss financial details for the quarter, our revised guidance for the full year 2022 and some early considerations for 2023. During the third quarter, macroeconomic crosscurrents continued to impact the operating environment. The conflict in Ukraine is ongoing, which creates challenges in that country and beyond. And we saw renewed pandemic-related mobility restrictions in China. Inflationary forces are driving costs, pricing and interest rates higher, resulting in currency volatility in many parts of the world. Against this backdrop, our industry remains healthy and is growing both in value and volume, which continues to include some benefit from cycling COVID-related impacts from the prior year. In the third quarter, we delivered strong organic revenue growth across all operating segments. This was driven by pricing actions and robust volume growth. We had share gains overall and across most categories, as well as within both at-home and away-from-home channels. We accomplished this by investing in our business and providing the right portfolio of brands and packages to retain and add consumers. Notably, we drove revenue growth ahead of transactions growth, which is also ahead of volume growth in the quarter, reflecting the strength of our revenue growth management capabilities. Consumer elasticities in core categories have continued to hold up well. We are leveraging our consumer-centric marketing model and increasingly using digital engagement to link consumption occasions with passion points. Our system has never been stronger, and our global network model is allowing us to leverage the vast experiences of the systems' leaders from various parts of the world. We are increasingly sharing learnings and generating faster responses to a changing environment through the right mix of local relevance and scale. Now recapping the third quarter performance across the world, starting with Asia Pacific. In India, we continued to strengthen in the first half of the year as we gained share in sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coke delivered strong growth through effective execution and occasion-based marketing. Year-to-date, we drove approximately 2.5 billion transactions at affordable price points through the expansion of returnable glass bottles and single-serve PET packages. Sprite has grown to become a $1 billion brand in the market, driven by the success of locally adapted occasion-based global marketing campaigns like Heat Happens and Screentime. In Japan, we continue to strengthen our business amidst an inflationary environment in the country for the first time in many years, we took price increases in large PET packages. Through intelligent innovation on small packs, we've gained value share, transactions and household penetration year-to-date. Additionally, we continued our strong share gains in vending in the quarter, and we expanded our leadership position in e-commerce. In China, we grew volume in the quarter and achieved strong growth in sparkling soft drinks during the summer selling season, amidst varying levels of pandemic-related mobility restrictions. We focused on digital to unlock new opportunities. We deployed Fans Festival, a drink-scan-win pilot at scale, which drove widespread brand exposure and connected consumer traffic to more than 30,000 outlets. We remain focused on executing RGM strategies to drive outlet expansion and increase key SKU availability. In ASEAN and South Pacific, we saw strong volume and transaction growth across most markets, driven by new product launches and continued recovery in away-from-home channels. We saw significant top line improvement in sparkling flavors for most markets, driven by our Sprite Lemon+ and Schweppes Soda Zero Sugar innovations. In EMEA, European consumers continue to experience inflationary costs. We leveraged our RGM strategies to drive away-from-home single-serve mix and retain consumers, and delivered value share gains across most categories. And our system has delivered top tier incremental retail value for customers year-to-date, the second year in a row. We accelerated digital engagement with more than 4 million connected consumers year-to-date. In Africa, despite the macro environment remaining challenging, we gained volume and value share. We focus relentlessly on excellence in execution and reduced retail out-of-stocks. We've built sustainable customer engagement in more than 80,000 points of sale year-to-date through a customer loyalty partnership program. In Eurasia and the Middle East, we remain resilient amidst an unprecedented inflationary environment in many markets and some supply-related disruptions. A cross-market launch of fee for activation and the Fanta Fest campaign were key enablers of growth. With strong focus on execution, we placed over 50,000 coolers and have gained availability in 33,000 new outlets year-to-date. In North America, we drove volume and value share gains through strong core sparkling performance, complemented by robust innovation and music-led experiential marketing despite intermittent supply chain challenges. Smartwater growth was strong during the quarter and innovations like Coca-Cola Creations and Minute Maid Aguas Frescas continue to expand and exceed expectations. The Coca-Cola Value Bundle, a collection of core sparkling offerings, providing more choices to cost-conscious consumers, is helping to retain and recruit more consumers while creating value for our customers. In Latin America, we leveraged connected experiences and strong execution to drive top line growth and sequentially improve on our share losses. We strengthened our connections with [Use Through Music], leveraging the Coca-Cola Marshmallow flavor to stream Rock in Rio across the continent. Through RGM initiatives, we focused on single-serve package growth to drive transaction growth. Alignment with our bonding partners remain strong, and our joint market initiatives are ensuring our focus on accelerating growth. In Global Ventures, we witnessed robust volume growth. However, overall cost of performance was impacted by a dynamic operating environment in the UK, along with investments in the marketplace as we expand internationally. China ready-to-drink value share grew with the strong performance of innovations like [Costa Char Tea] and [Oak Coffee]. Ready-to-drink in Japan is also delivering strong performance supported by sampling in-store execution and the launch of Caramel Latte. Finally, our Bottling Investments Group delivered strong volume and top line performance driven by a focus on affordable entry-pack expansion across all markets. Additionally, we're driving availability and efficiencies in cost to serve. As we look forward beyond this year, we continue to see great opportunity for our industry. We are allocating resources in a disciplined way to gain share. Success from our marketing model is based on two critical components: linking occasions and passion points to drive engagement, and leveraging experiments to optimize our marketing. This drives deeper connections with consumers, reaching them in new and unique ways. The launch of the Bleeding is Magic global campaign for the FIFA World Cup celebrates the passionate journey of soccer fans by unveiling a suite of digital experiences that capture the full extent of fans' devotion to their beloved teams. The campaign includes the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour as well as a digital hub called Coca-Cola Fan Zone, which creates in-person opportunities for fans to come together to trade Panini stickers behind the Coca-Cola labels. This campaign has already led to a gain of more than 3.5 million consumers for direct engagement. Building on our digital experiments, we also announced a strategic partnership in six countries with Grab, Southeast Asia's leading connected app. This builds new consumer connections and offers a new level of convenience Through a mix of off-line advertising on the Grab fleet, online advertising in the Grab app, gamification and product sampling, we are building more purchasing occasions to grow demand for at-home consumption. Our innovations have delivered strong results with more than 25% contribution to incremental gross profit year-to-date. Our innovations span markets and categories, with 55% of year-to-date innovations outside of the sparkling category. Our pipeline is robust and we are excited about their unique consumer propositions. For example, Coca-Cola Creations is providing bold on-trend flavors designed to build both with younger consumers. Ready-to-drink Costa offers new and exciting flavors with authentic, rich coffee and milk taste. We are also excited about the potential for Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink, which will launch in Mexico in the fourth quarter and is coming to a digital markets next year, including the U.S. in the spring through our agreements with Brown-Forman. This will give consumers a convenient way to enjoy the world's most popular bar cooler. Our innovations are designed with scalability in mind to further support our growth portfolio. We expect inflationary pressures to continue, so we are leveraging all the levers of RGM at our disposal, including price, promotional intelligence and proactive mix management. Our RGM capability is mining insights such as consumer motivations as well as category and customer opportunities, giving us a precise approach to package, placement and promotional investments. This drives trip conversion and value growth for customers. For example, in Japan, we are seeing strong results from our segmented approach. Instead of our key 500 ml PET pack for Fanta, we now sell one smaller 350 ml PET pack on the go and one larger 700 ml PET pack for home occasions. This dual pack strategy has increased beverage incidents by 9%. In Q3, retail value transactions and market share were all up for these packages. Our system is investing to grow our executional footprint, adding to what was already pervasive distribution resulting in availability of our products in nearly 2/3 of all outlets globally. These strong results are clear proof points of what is possible when our alliance system leans forward for growth. Underpinning all of this work is our purpose to Refresh the World and Make a Difference. Sustainability remains an integral part of our business and strategy and is a key driver of future growth and business resilience. While we have made progress towards our World Without Waste goals, we remain committed to do more and faster so we can grow our business the right way. We're continuing to partner with other businesses, civil society and governments to support cooperative action on this critical issue. During the quarter, we played a leadership role and helped launch the business coalition for a global plastics treaty convened by key partners, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and World Wildlife Fund, alongside other private sector companies. We are also continuing to take steps to help drive the circular economy by making our bottles more eco-friendly. In North America and Latin America, Sprite has shifted all of its PET packaging from green to clear, improving the efficiency of recycling systems and increasing the availability of food-grade rPET. In Vietnam, we launched Coca-Cola bottles made from 100% recycled plastic, excluding the cap and the label. We now have more than 30 markets where we offer at least one brand in a 100% rPET package, with similar launches planned in additional markets next year. In an operating environment that increasingly puts more variables into the equation than we've seen in the past, we are focused on delivering and executing for growth. We are encouraged by what we are seeing in the business. We are committed to expanding the circumference of what we can control by delivering world-class marketing, disciplined innovation, excellence in revenue growth management, and laser-sharp execution in the marketplace, with a goal of operating at a higher level through these challenging market conditions. We are doing this with capable and aligned bottling partners around the world. The combination of strong loved brands and a pervasive distribution system is a formula for resilience in times like these, and we are pleased to be raising both our top line and bottom line guidance today.  With that, I'll turn the call over to you, John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll comment on our third quarter performance and provide considerations for our updated guidance to this year. I'll also provide some early commentary on 2023 and what actions we are taking to drive a top line-led growth equation to navigate this dynamic environment. . We are encouraged with the continued momentum of our business, and we delivered another set of strong results in the third quarter. We grew organic revenue 16%, unit cases grew 4%, with broad-based growth across most operating segments and targeted investments in the marketplace. Concentrate sales were in line with unit cases for the quarter. Our price/mix of 12% was driven primarily by pricing actions across operating segments, along with revenue growth management initiatives, further improvement in away-from-home channels in most markets and positive segment mix. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 190 basis points versus the prior year. The underlying margin compression was approximately 60 basis points, with the rest of the impact coming from currency headwinds driven by the volatile macro backdrop and the mechanical effect of consolidating the BODYARMOR finished goods business. We significantly stepped up our consumer and customer-facing investments to support our robust marketing agenda and strong innovation pipeline. Notwithstanding higher costs and continued investments in the marketplace, we expanded underlying operating margin by approximately 100 basis points, driven by strong top line growth. Comparable operating margin, however, compressed by approximately 50 basis points due to the impact of the BODYARMOR acquisition and currency headwinds. Below the line, we benefited from a lower-than-expected effective tax rate for the full year. All in, third quarter comparable EPS of $0.69 grew 7% year-over-year, and this was impacted by 11 points of currency headwinds. On cash flow, we delivered free cash flow of $7.3 billion year-to-date driven by our strong business performance. This was 14% lower versus the prior year, primarily due to two items: one, cycling the timing of working capital benefits in the prior year; and two, higher 2021 annual incentives paid in the first quarter. Additionally, our net debt leverage is 1.8x EBITDA, which is slightly below our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. As we look to the operating environment, there are clearly many variables at play today, as James mentioned. We are spinning our top line and bottom line flywheels faster to fortify our business and manage through many types of environments, and we're investing in the marketplace to create value for our customers and consumers. Given our strong results and the visibility we have for the rest of the year, we are raising guidance for the full year. We now expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 14% to 15% and comparable currency-neutral EPS growth of 15% to 16%. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we expect currency to be a 7-point headwind to comparable net revenues and a 9-point headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. We now expect an underlying effective tax rate of 19% in 2022. All in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 6% to 7% versus 2021. We continue to expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow for 2022, through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less about $1.5 billion in capital investments. There are some considerations to keep in mind for Q4 that we factored into our full year guidance. There is an additional day in the fourth quarter, however, we expect concentrate sales to end the year in line with unit case sales. We are investing in consumer-facing marketing to get a fast start for next year. Lastly, given the backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see an impact on our interest expense given our effective exposure to floating rate debt. The environment remains volatile, and while we are preparing for many futures in 2023, we did want to share some early considerations for next year based on what we know today. We are encouraged by the momentum in our top line and we leverage our capabilities to sustain top line growth with the ongoing inflationary backdrop. As we look to our cost outlook, we expect global inflation to continue to impact our expenses across the board and commodities to remain volatile. We benefited from hedges in our commodity exposure this year. And even though some of the commodities have started to come off their highs, we expect another year of elevated inflation on a per case basis next year. We estimate the underlying effective tax rate to be 19.5% for 2023. Regarding currency, if we were to assume current rates and our hedge positions, there would be an approximate 5-point to 6-point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 7-point to 8-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023. However, given the amount of volatility in the currency markets, this initial view could change when we come back to you for the fourth quarter call in February. We are committed to delivering top line-led growth and we remain focused and confident in our ability to achieve our three key objectives: investing for the long-term health of the business, winning locally and generating U.S. dollar EPS growth. We are pleased with our results so far and have the visibility to deliver on our updated guidance, creating value for our shareowners through strong top line growth, cash flow generation and dividend growth. Our strong system leadership and the tremendous ongoing commitment of our people around the world gives us confidence that we will continue to deliver sustainable results in the year ahead. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. \nBryan Spillane: So I guess, John, I wanted to just pick up on your commentary about '23. We've got this question a bunch this morning about dollar earnings growth next year. So I just want to clarify, in your comments on those three objectives, does that apply to next year kind of based on where you sit now? And then maybe if you can just talk about some of the trade-offs with regards to delivering on dollar earnings growth given all of the dynamics that are going on in the marketplace.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Bryan. Yes, those comments were very much related to next year. We do see a path to generating U.S. dollar EPS growth next year. Clearly, there's a lot of variables in the equation. And if anything, there's even more variability with some of those variables. We've talked a lot about our strategy is to lead a sustainable equation from the top line. We continue to have confidence in the momentum that our business has and to continue that momentum. The cost outlook does remain more elevated than we are used to. But we've got a higher revenue, higher cost algorithm that we're looking to manage going into next year. I think the work we've done over the last couple of years to build flexibility to be able to adapt quicker than perhaps we have done historically to changes in the markets around us, is something that we take on board and will continue to drive. And with that, we've given the guidance or the considerations for next year. And we're very focused on finishing the year strong, starting fast and being able to deliver on those three objectives.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian : So obviously, another set of strong top line results in the quarter. You also mentioned the underlying top line momentum in the release when thinking about 2023. So just wanted to get a bit of an update, given the external environment, there's obviously a lot of concerns around weaker consumer spending and some of the pressure points out there. Do you guys see anything towards the end of the quarter or so far in October that would give you any cause for concern? And as you think about these much higher than typical levels of pricing, are you seeing any sort of changes in consumer volume demand elasticity, that pricing, as you look around the world here, that would be helpful?\nJames Quincey : Yes. Thanks, Dara. The short answer is yes. We're seeing some changes in consumer behavior. I mean, overall, in the third quarter, consumer remained pretty resilient and elasticities were at the better end of the spectrum. Clearly, there are some changes in consumer behavior going on. We talked last quarter about how we have typically experienced recessions.  In other words, there tends to be a sequence, which is that the consumers back off on some more discretionary, higher ticket items white goods types of things. And then as they -- as the pressure comes on purchasing power, they start to reevaluate the total basket. They tend to squeeze down the basket size per trip and they look in some categories where the equity isn't as strong to perhaps trade down to some private label or smaller packages. And you can clearly see that happening -- beginning to happen in a number of places. It would seem to us that Europe is probably the most obvious example, where, in the at-home channel, you can see some growth in private label across a number of categories. In beverages, you could see it tick up a little in water and juices. You can certainly see the growth of the hard discounters, some channel shifting in Europe. That's very consistent with purchasing power squeeze behavior, some signs of that, too, in the U.S. with the dollar channels. So there's clearly the impact of inflation running ahead of wages is starting to come through now that the summer is over and back to school has happened. Our focus and our confidence in our year-to-go and going into next year is about the momentum we've created in our business over the years and our ability to not just to continue with marketing and innovation, but to leverage all the thinking behind revenue growth management and the price pack promo architectures to maximize affordability, and therefore, accessibility of our categories for those consumers that are under pressure. And, of course, backed by excellence in execution and generating the value for retailers by our system that will help us get through what is likely, in all likelihood, going to be a tighter situation for the next six to 12 months. And if I just come back and close the circle by using the European example, where consumers are under pressure. In the third quarter, the Coke system was the biggest creator of additional retail value for at-home retailers well ahead of the rest of CPG. But we believe we have a strategy that's given us momentum. It will see us through the year to go. It will see us into 2023. It may, as John said, end up with above algorithm pricing and some pressure on volume, but we believe our top line can go forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. \nLauren Lieberman : You'd mentioned the ability for the company to adapt more quickly than in the past. And I was intrigued by the example you gave of the value packs in North America that you've started to roll out. So I was curious if you could tell us a bit more about kind of how broad-based those are, the degree to which that's something that's being explored for other markets? And James, you just mentioned some of the pressures in Western Europe, but anything you can share on the kind of leveraging experience and learning across the global system in terms of how to manage through in different RGM type practices?\nJames Quincey : Yes, absolutely. I mean value packs or ensuring affordability for the consumer is one of the core pieces of RGM. It's about extending the price ladder and, in recessionary times, about making sure the entry price point, whether it would be on the larger packs or on the smaller packs becomes as low down in the price spectrum, the actual out-of-pocket as possible. As I talked about in the last answer, one of the recession behavior tends to be to try and reduce the dollar outlay of the basket, and therefore, the price point becomes even more important than the price per liter.  And so around the world, that's absolutely what we're pursuing, whether it's in the U.S., having smaller bottles or smaller multipacks of less cans per multipack; or the example I used, in Japan, where we took the 500 ml and split it into 350 and 700. Of course, around the world in a number of countries, we leverage our capabilities with returnable bottles, given the economics of returnables particularly in the developing markets, that is a way of generating a lower price point because, of course, in effect, you don't pay for the packaging because it comes back again. And so those returnable bottles that we refill are a way of bringing the price points down and keeping the consumer in the category. And so that's -- it's a well-developed skill around the world. The bottlers share a lot of learnings between themselves on how to think about the technology of RGM, and that allows us to leverage it to its maximum, particularly in times like these.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: I guess just to drill a little bit further into the path to dollar-based EPS growth next year. Clearly, as we stand here today, there are a number of headwinds to overcome, and you've outlined and quantified some of them between FX and interest expense, underlying inflation, higher year-over-year tax rate next year. I guess what I'm left trying to unravel is how dependent is the path to dollar-based EPS growth next year on this continued top line momentum that you've been -- that you've emphasized today versus are there other levers that you can look to, whether that's paring back a bit on marketing investments and the innovation agenda investments or just doubling down on productivity? I guess the question I'm asking is, underneath from an underlying perspective, is it -- are we to be -- are we -- how dependent are we on that top of momentum continuing versus there being other levers that the company can look to?\nJames Quincey: The simple answer, Steve, is we're very dependent on top line momentum. In the sense that we are going to continue, we believe, barring something very unforeseen or at this stage, we believe we're going to continue to invest for the long-term health of the business and that's going to drive top line growth, as it has. I mean, if I -- just for the sake of the argument, if you take the five-year CAGR of revenue through all the ups and downs of COVID and everything, in round numbers, it's trending at 6% compound for the last five years. So preserving and sustaining top line momentum is actually the key starting point. And of course, if there are parts of the world where circumstances do not merit continued high levels of marketing investment and there's reasons to pare back, then as John mentioned earlier, we absolutely will lean on our increased degree of agility and adaptability to make those adjustments in the moment. And similarly, with any SG&A. But the predominant drivers, again, is going to be the top line. We will manage the other elements of the P&L based on the local markets. I don't think it's our expectation that this is going to be like the second quarter of 2020, where everything stoped everywhere at the same time. If there are to be pressures, it's likely that they are spread out over time. So the predominant modus operandi will be leaning to growth, invest in top line growth. And then yes, we expect, at times, different markets to kind of have to, yes, optimize the marketing. But on an overall basis, it's top line momentum driven.\nOperator: Next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. \nNik Modi: So James, I was wondering if you could just comment. I saw some of the organizational priorities that came out of the U.S. bottler meeting recently, and I was hoping, just linked to this top line momentum comment, if you can provide some context on other markets in terms of organizational priorities, whether it be some of your larger markets like in Japan or in Western Europe or Latin America. Maybe you can just share some thoughts on how you're thinking about some of the key initiatives in those regions.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean let's start with Japan. Clearly, in Japan, we're very focused on the marketing and innovation. It tends to be a market that's very driven by engagement with the consumer. Also, importantly in Japan, after perhaps multiple decades of not taking price, we have taken price on large packs in Japan in the third quarter. Actually, in the fourth quarter, we've been taking pricing on immediate consumption packaging in Japan. So I think we're going to see an opportunity to lean a little more on the RGM lever in Japan as we continue to engage with the consumer there. In Western Europe, clearly, the basic strategy of investing in marketing, investing in innovation, leveraging RGM and driving in-store execution and value for retailers has been working in Western Europe. As we go into the winter and going into next year, that's still going to be the push we make. The bottlers have got great momentum in execution. Of course, Europe is where there's more of the developed world inflation. Think commodities plus the devaluation of the euro, so that's feeding through. And so we're likely to have to lean heavier on RGM in Europe in the next 12 months, backed up by the marketing, innovation and execution. And then Latin America, a lot of work over the last number of years with the long-term relationship model. Bottlers there have good momentum. Clearly, it's one of our strongest regions. We lost a little share in the beginning of the year. They're very focused on getting that back, obviously, starting from a high bar. And I think perhaps, overall, it would be worth commenting that, obviously, in COVID, we took a number of what were difficult decisions at the time, slimming down the portfolio, changing the marketing model, changing the organizational model for the company. We've got that done and stood up. And I think now we're reaping the benefits of us being able to drive growth with a more agile organization ourselves, combined with really strong and aligned bottling partners. We've driven growth this year, and we're well set up next year. I mean just to cap it all, we had a global system top to top with a number of the bottlers a few weeks ago, and I think everyone is ready and energized for what's ahead.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala : Can you talk a bit about fixed versus floating debt and how that might impact both your cash balance and your interest expense in the coming year?\nJohn Murphy : Sure, Kaumil, thanks for the question. Yes, as you know, we manage our funding through -- with an eye towards liquidity risk and with a multiyear lens, and have done that for many years. We've -- through COVID, I think we've talked about we've pushed our age of our debt out a number of years. And we do have a mix of fixed and floating. Most of the floating is in euro, and so we will wait and see what ECB does over the coming months to have a clearer picture on the impact for 2023. But I think it's an area that we'll provide more detail on in February, subject to the development by the Fed here and by ECB over the coming months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. \nBonnie Herzog : I have a question on your commodity inflation. John, you touched on this, but hoping you could help frame the commodity inflation expectation next year. You mentioned another year of expected growth, but is it realistic to expect this growth might be more modest versus this year, possibly in the mid-single-digit range, given some of your commodities peaking as well as hedges you have in place? And then I guess I'm asking in the context of the pricing environment and whether you think it's likely that ongoing price increases maybe won't need to be as aggressive and we might actually see a step-up in promotional spend to ensure price points for consumers are affordable. And then if so, is it realistic to expect a better balance between price/mix and volume growth next year?\nJohn Murphy : A lot of questions, Bonnie. Let me start with the commodity point and our outlook for the year ahead. As I said at the -- I think in answer to the first question, there are a lot of variables in that equation. And indeed, the variability with some of them is maybe even broader. When I think about the cost environment, not just the commodity environment, I think about both our commodities, the commodity pressures that we have within our business and the non-commodity pressures that we have. And so as we look at '23 on the commodity front, we are rolling off some very favorable hedges that we were fortunate to have this year. And it's still -- in our mind, it's still unclear as to how commodities will trend over the next six to 12 months. So we'll have more visibility on that when we get to the call in February. With regard to the non-commodity items, just within that, you've got a bucket of different topics -- freight, logistics, the transportation in our finished goods models and the overall wage environment. And we have to take into account that the wage environment is not the same everywhere, and indirect impacts on supply chain pressures. As we think about the supply chain, it's important to not just have efficiency as a metric, we also need to make sure that we have continuity, we have, for the short and longer term, and we're able to manage many of the pressures that I think we've talked about on previous calls, manage those effectively. So there's a lot going on inside of the cost of goods line. And hence, I think it's better for us to just provide you with how we're seeing it overall, and we'll come back in February with more specifics. And to your second question on ongoing price increases, I think it links back to some of James' comments earlier. The name of the game is to optimize our revenue equation over the next 12 to 18 months. That's going to be a combination of smart pricing, understanding the mix, both from a channel and package perspective, and being able to utilize the many levers that we have inside of the RGM toolkits that our bottlers have. So again, I think at this stage, it's still early to say what the exact numbers will be for each of those topics. But I think the broader point is that the top line momentum that we've enjoyed here today, that we see continuing to hold through the rest of the year, is something that we expect to be able to generate into 2023.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. \nChristopher Carey: So just following up on that. I think it's pretty well established price/mix versus volume algorithm will probably be more skewed to price/mix next year again. This could be for James or John, but is it fair to assume that the rate of pricing is likely to be a bigger percentage of the price/mix equation going forward as we lap the recovery and the away-from-home channel and some other channel mix dynamics? And then just connected, James, it's been harder to see the underlying rate of pricing this year relative to the price mix. Can you just remind us your philosophy for the rate of pricing to track inflation, and whether you believe your business is close to satisfying that objective today and perhaps how much room you have?\nJames Quincey : Yes, Chris, I think, yes, clearly, it's likely that next year price/mix will run ahead of volume in a similar way it has this year. I mean our long-term growth algorithm has assumed a relative balance between price and mix. Clearly, at the moment, we're in a period where there's more price/mix than there is volume, and that seems that seems likely to continue into next year. It is also true that, this year, there has been some benefit from the channel mix on the reopening. The reopening benefit that was obviously a reopening cost in the previous year in price/mix is now largely done. And so that kind of tailwind won't be there last -- next year. Are all the channels away from home completely reopened? No. But the remaining kind of sliver is either a function of closed outlets or something that's going to take a while to come back. And of course, some of the mobility restrictions in places like China, which I think also won't snap back certainly in the first half of next year. So the away-from-home of price/mix won't be the tailwind next year. And so in that sense, yes, we'll be very much back to it's all about what's the rate and what's the benefit from all the RGM strategies, whether to drive affordability or to offer premium categories or package sizes, and that's what will be the primary driver going into next year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan Chase.\nAndrea Teixeira : So I wanted to go back to John's comment on growing EPS in dollar terms next year. And along with that, James, you mentioned that you're looking at pricing above algorithm, which makes sense. But given the volume loss, I was just hoping if you can comment, in general, as we stand right now, that operating income would probably grow faster than EPS in order to absorb some of the unfavorable hedges and any issues in the financial expenses. Is that the way we should be thinking of next year, to a more muted EPS growth? Or you still think you can grow above low single next year in EPS?\nJohn Murphy : So, Andrea, thanks. I'll take that. As we said on the earlier, I think it's too early to get into those specifics for next year. I think the way to think about the year ahead is I think it's going to be another year out of our typical algorithm. We continue to build greater visibility around how -- what to expect in the -- particularly in the first half of the year when we'll be looking for that fast start. What each line item of the income statement looks like is -- it's just too early. We'll come back in February with that detail. I think the key takeaway is that as we sit here, we do see a path to generating U.S. dollar EPS growth in 2023. As I said earlier, there's many variables to bring that path to fruition. And we know that top-line driven smart investments and effective management of our cost structure, those thee will deliver. And below the operating income line, as I said, there's a lot that still needs to play out in the next few months to give you a clearer picture on what to expect. And we'll come back in February with that detail.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos Laboy from HSBC.\nCarlos Laboy : Yes. Some of the benefits of the new Latin American LCRM are obvious, like faster revenue growth, higher ROIC for the bottlers for the system, really clarity of profit splits. But can you expand on some of the less obvious but important benefits that are important to you, James?\nJames Quincey : Sure. Thanks, Carlos. I mean, clearly, this is a feature of particularly the Latin American system. We're using similar models in conversations around the world. They're built on many years of working together collaboratively in Latin America. And then other than some of the features that you mentioned, I think what's really kind of less visible perhaps is its ability to speed up the rate at which actions or decisions and actions are taken by the system. And so it has provided a stimulus to really focusing in on getting to grips with some of the nausea problems and to moving with speed and simplifying the decision-making progress in a whole series of areas, particularly those that have been kind of slower historically.  Some of the stills business models come to mind, particularly as it relates to Latin America. And that will ultimately feed through to, as I said, speed of decision-making, which then needs better marketplace actions, whether that be marketing, innovation, RGM or execution. And I think the system in Latin America is very energized and building on their historic great position and set for further momentum going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore ISI.\nRobert Ottenstein: And terrific results. I was wondering, James, if you could drill down a little bit more on what's going on in emerging markets and the emerging market consumer. We were a little surprised by the results of China looking to be maybe a little bit more, do a little better than we had modeled given the lockdowns. Some of the other emerging markets, a little bit weaker than we would have thought. So I guess the question is, are -- is local competition a problem? Is it demand? Is it too much pricing? And obviously, it depends market by market. But if you could give us some sense of what is going on in the major emerging markets, that would be helpful.\nJames Quincey : Sure. I'm not sure which ones you're putting in the bucket of weaker, but let me do a little walk around some of the emerging markets. We had good results we feel in China for the quarter. I mean we had good growth overall for China, notwithstanding some of the mobility restrictions that came in the whole raft of cities. So China remains a good long-term opportunity. We have a good business there, good bottling partners, and there was some resilience to the business in the quarter. . Just keeping with the Asian theme, India had a knockout quarter. Clearly, they're having a very strong run this year. Lots of growth in India, really powering forward. Very pleased with that. Looking, of course, to extend that into the future. Probably won't be a straight line, but certainly looking to continue to invest strongly in India. The rest of ASEAN, there were some pluses and minuses, but generally positive. If I switch to Africa. Africa, you've heard me talk in the past that it's always a rollercoaster. There was a little bit of rollercoaster in the quarter. But overall, we had good growth in those markets we were focused on. There was growth that was ultimately pretty broad-based, whether that was South Africa or elsewhere. It would be worth noting that this quarter, remember, we made a switch in our franchise partner in a number of territories across Africa. So we brought to a close our relationship with BGI, the Castel Group, in a whole raft of African markets. And some of them we had partners ready to go, and some of them we're still working on it. So there is a transition loss of volume in those ex-BGI territories where we ceased that partnership. And so that weighs on the Africa number. And then as you keep going around the world, obviously, Latin America had a good quarter. And then I think the last one I'm really missing is a bit of Eurasia. And there, we had a pretty decent quarter. We had growth in Turkey, which is an important market to us, and a number of other of the Central Asian markets and the Middle Eastern markets. Obviously, those ones that are -- tend to have resources or oil exporting countries tend to have done better than the heavily oil-importing countries, so the Middle East is better than Egypt. Of course, remember that the EMEA numbers have the dropout of the Russia business.\nOperator: Next question comes from Charlie Higgs from Redburn.\nCharlie Higgs: So we're a year now into the reformulation of Coco-Cola Zero Sugar. And to cap it off, we've seen 11% volume growth and double-digit growth in developed markets. So James, just wondering your opinion on Coke Zero, how it's gone since the relaunch? And then also just looking into 2023, does your approach to innovation change at all that we think we're going to enter a weakening consumer environment?\nJames Quincey : Yes, sure. Look, super happy with Coke Zero Sugar. We have been investing behind it for a good number of years and have been driving double-digit Coke Zero Sugar volumes for many years in a row. And obviously, that's getting really material, including strong double-digit growth in the U.S. So very pleased with the reformulation update. Of course, we continue to bring new marketing and new innovation to Coke Zero Sugar and it's going to be a big focus of what we drive going forward. On innovation, as it relates to 2023. I mean, yes, there will be a kind of bias shift in the mix of the innovation for 2023. If one of the imperatives remains affordability and to kind of anchor price points, at the low end of the actual dollar outlay, then clearly, package innovation takes a bigger role in that sort of environment, whether it be smaller packages, whether it be the returnable packaging. Big investments going in by the bottling system in returnable packaging to help the affordability strategy. So in a kind of purchasing power pressured year for the consumer, we expect innovation to be slightly heavier on the packaging side, particularly to drive affordability. But of course, that will also have its other side of the coin which is to try and ensure there are some perhaps more premium options for those that still have plenty of disposable income. Not everyone will have exactly the same effect in this period. So likely to see continued push, for example, in the U.S. on small cans or sleek cans to really stretching out the pricing ladder, not just putting all the bets on the affordable end. And we will continue with the brand and the product innovation. I don't know if you went to the NACS. There was a lot of innovation on show the Convenience Store Conference for the North America, there was a lot of innovation on display there, both package and product. And so we will be approaching '23 with a broad innovation agenda, but with some slight weighting to packaging to stretch on the price ladder.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS.\nPeter Grom: So I guess I wanted to circle back to '23 guidance. And I guess what I'm trying to understand is the company's long-term algorithm has largely embedded some operating leverage over time. And maybe I'm just reading too much into this, but there was just a lot of emphasis throughout the call today that next year will be a top line-driven year. And so I guess based on where things stand today, should we expect underlying growth from a top line and operating profit perspective to be more aligned versus what's embedded in a long-term algorithm? Again, I could be misinterpreting the emphasis, but if that's correct, it would imply very strong top line growth in order to deliver U.S. dollar EPS growth.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks for the question. And just to maybe to reiterate, the difference, I think, between the long-term growth algorithm and what may be coming at us over the next year or so, I think it's going to be somewhat out of algorithm, given the various factors that we have discussed on the call and indeed have discussed throughout the year. So at this point in time, I think it is too soon to give you line-by-line guidance. But we continue to see a path to generate U.S. dollar EPS growth in 2023, and that will be -- will need to be driven from the top line. The cost pressures are there. We're very aware of them. We talked about the currency outlook. And so, we still think when you put all the pieces together that we have that path. But we'll have a lot more coming at us over the next three to four months. And in February, can give you a more granular breakdown of how we expect to get there.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities.\nBill Chappell : Just I guess a question on some of the competitive response or individual markets. I mean everything you've talked about today has certainly been positive. And I guess, any of the the setbacks have been kind of attributed to macro issues. Are there any areas where you're worried about where there's been a competitive response, where you need to step up, be it on a product or an individual country? Or is it really just there's just so much momentum and anything else is just macro related?\nJames Quincey : It would be a particularly delusional position to, say, I'm not worried about anything. That would be very weird. But clearly, we have -- it's a competitive industry. There are a lot of good competitors, big and small. So we absolutely worry what they're up to. We always take it from satisfying the consumer and the retailer point of view. We're not chasing the competitors, we're chasing the consumers and the retailers. And certainly, there, we could point to a set of things where competitors have done well, and that calls attention to us to whether we are really doing everything we can to satisfy the consumer or the retailer. I think one obvious example is in sports drinks advanced hydration in the U.S., where this year, our competitors are coming off having a whole series of supply chain challenges last year. And that's -- we had a great year last year, and we've had a not-so-great year this year and we're also obviously in the transition of taking on the BODYARMOR. But the U.S. bottlers are very energized about the BODYARMOR and Powerade plans going forward. A lot of innovation on the brand, on the product, on the packaging setup. So we'll be back. I mean -- but it's -- what guides us is are we satisfying the consumer and the retailer.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Thank you, operator. So just in summary, third quarter results, I think, exemplify how we're executing and winning in the marketplace. It's been driven by the work we've done as a system and the transformation we've undergone over the last few years. We are a more resilient business, and we're committed to delivering long-term value for our shareholders and stakeholders. And thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Quincey",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. After a strong first half of the year, we continued our momentum in the third quarter with effective execution across our global system despite a macro backdrop that remains challenging. In the face of these pressures, consumers stayed resilient, and we continue to invest behind our loved brands to drive value in the marketplace and growth in our business. Given our strong results year-to-date, and increased visibility into the rest of the year, we are raising our top line and bottom line guidance, while continuing to invest strategically. So this morning, I'll provide a business update and discuss how we are expanding the circumference of what we can control. Then I'll pass to John, and he will discuss financial details for the quarter, our revised guidance for the full year 2022 and some early considerations for 2023. During the third quarter, macroeconomic crosscurrents continued to impact the operating environment. The conflict in Ukraine is ongoing, which creates challenges in that country and beyond. And we saw renewed pandemic-related mobility restrictions in China. Inflationary forces are driving costs, pricing and interest rates higher, resulting in currency volatility in many parts of the world. Against this backdrop, our industry remains healthy and is growing both in value and volume, which continues to include some benefit from cycling COVID-related impacts from the prior year. In the third quarter, we delivered strong organic revenue growth across all operating segments. This was driven by pricing actions and robust volume growth. We had share gains overall and across most categories, as well as within both at-home and away-from-home channels. We accomplished this by investing in our business and providing the right portfolio of brands and packages to retain and add consumers. Notably, we drove revenue growth ahead of transactions growth, which is also ahead of volume growth in the quarter, reflecting the strength of our revenue growth management capabilities. Consumer elasticities in core categories have continued to hold up well. We are leveraging our consumer-centric marketing model and increasingly using digital engagement to link consumption occasions with passion points. Our system has never been stronger, and our global network model is allowing us to leverage the vast experiences of the systems' leaders from various parts of the world. We are increasingly sharing learnings and generating faster responses to a changing environment through the right mix of local relevance and scale. Now recapping the third quarter performance across the world, starting with Asia Pacific. In India, we continued to strengthen in the first half of the year as we gained share in sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coke delivered strong growth through effective execution and occasion-based marketing. Year-to-date, we drove approximately 2.5 billion transactions at affordable price points through the expansion of returnable glass bottles and single-serve PET packages. Sprite has grown to become a $1 billion brand in the market, driven by the success of locally adapted occasion-based global marketing campaigns like Heat Happens and Screentime. In Japan, we continue to strengthen our business amidst an inflationary environment in the country for the first time in many years, we took price increases in large PET packages. Through intelligent innovation on small packs, we've gained value share, transactions and household penetration year-to-date. Additionally, we continued our strong share gains in vending in the quarter, and we expanded our leadership position in e-commerce. In China, we grew volume in the quarter and achieved strong growth in sparkling soft drinks during the summer selling season, amidst varying levels of pandemic-related mobility restrictions. We focused on digital to unlock new opportunities. We deployed Fans Festival, a drink-scan-win pilot at scale, which drove widespread brand exposure and connected consumer traffic to more than 30,000 outlets. We remain focused on executing RGM strategies to drive outlet expansion and increase key SKU availability. In ASEAN and South Pacific, we saw strong volume and transaction growth across most markets, driven by new product launches and continued recovery in away-from-home channels. We saw significant top line improvement in sparkling flavors for most markets, driven by our Sprite Lemon+ and Schweppes Soda Zero Sugar innovations. In EMEA, European consumers continue to experience inflationary costs. We leveraged our RGM strategies to drive away-from-home single-serve mix and retain consumers, and delivered value share gains across most categories. And our system has delivered top tier incremental retail value for customers year-to-date, the second year in a row. We accelerated digital engagement with more than 4 million connected consumers year-to-date. In Africa, despite the macro environment remaining challenging, we gained volume and value share. We focus relentlessly on excellence in execution and reduced retail out-of-stocks. We've built sustainable customer engagement in more than 80,000 points of sale year-to-date through a customer loyalty partnership program. In Eurasia and the Middle East, we remain resilient amidst an unprecedented inflationary environment in many markets and some supply-related disruptions. A cross-market launch of fee for activation and the Fanta Fest campaign were key enablers of growth. With strong focus on execution, we placed over 50,000 coolers and have gained availability in 33,000 new outlets year-to-date. In North America, we drove volume and value share gains through strong core sparkling performance, complemented by robust innovation and music-led experiential marketing despite intermittent supply chain challenges. Smartwater growth was strong during the quarter and innovations like Coca-Cola Creations and Minute Maid Aguas Frescas continue to expand and exceed expectations. The Coca-Cola Value Bundle, a collection of core sparkling offerings, providing more choices to cost-conscious consumers, is helping to retain and recruit more consumers while creating value for our customers. In Latin America, we leveraged connected experiences and strong execution to drive top line growth and sequentially improve on our share losses. We strengthened our connections with [Use Through Music], leveraging the Coca-Cola Marshmallow flavor to stream Rock in Rio across the continent. Through RGM initiatives, we focused on single-serve package growth to drive transaction growth. Alignment with our bonding partners remain strong, and our joint market initiatives are ensuring our focus on accelerating growth. In Global Ventures, we witnessed robust volume growth. However, overall cost of performance was impacted by a dynamic operating environment in the UK, along with investments in the marketplace as we expand internationally. China ready-to-drink value share grew with the strong performance of innovations like [Costa Char Tea] and [Oak Coffee]. Ready-to-drink in Japan is also delivering strong performance supported by sampling in-store execution and the launch of Caramel Latte. Finally, our Bottling Investments Group delivered strong volume and top line performance driven by a focus on affordable entry-pack expansion across all markets. Additionally, we're driving availability and efficiencies in cost to serve. As we look forward beyond this year, we continue to see great opportunity for our industry. We are allocating resources in a disciplined way to gain share. Success from our marketing model is based on two critical components: linking occasions and passion points to drive engagement, and leveraging experiments to optimize our marketing. This drives deeper connections with consumers, reaching them in new and unique ways. The launch of the Bleeding is Magic global campaign for the FIFA World Cup celebrates the passionate journey of soccer fans by unveiling a suite of digital experiences that capture the full extent of fans' devotion to their beloved teams. The campaign includes the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour as well as a digital hub called Coca-Cola Fan Zone, which creates in-person opportunities for fans to come together to trade Panini stickers behind the Coca-Cola labels. This campaign has already led to a gain of more than 3.5 million consumers for direct engagement. Building on our digital experiments, we also announced a strategic partnership in six countries with Grab, Southeast Asia's leading connected app. This builds new consumer connections and offers a new level of convenience Through a mix of off-line advertising on the Grab fleet, online advertising in the Grab app, gamification and product sampling, we are building more purchasing occasions to grow demand for at-home consumption. Our innovations have delivered strong results with more than 25% contribution to incremental gross profit year-to-date. Our innovations span markets and categories, with 55% of year-to-date innovations outside of the sparkling category. Our pipeline is robust and we are excited about their unique consumer propositions. For example, Coca-Cola Creations is providing bold on-trend flavors designed to build both with younger consumers. Ready-to-drink Costa offers new and exciting flavors with authentic, rich coffee and milk taste. We are also excited about the potential for Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink, which will launch in Mexico in the fourth quarter and is coming to a digital markets next year, including the U.S. in the spring through our agreements with Brown-Forman. This will give consumers a convenient way to enjoy the world's most popular bar cooler. Our innovations are designed with scalability in mind to further support our growth portfolio. We expect inflationary pressures to continue, so we are leveraging all the levers of RGM at our disposal, including price, promotional intelligence and proactive mix management. Our RGM capability is mining insights such as consumer motivations as well as category and customer opportunities, giving us a precise approach to package, placement and promotional investments. This drives trip conversion and value growth for customers. For example, in Japan, we are seeing strong results from our segmented approach. Instead of our key 500 ml PET pack for Fanta, we now sell one smaller 350 ml PET pack on the go and one larger 700 ml PET pack for home occasions. This dual pack strategy has increased beverage incidents by 9%. In Q3, retail value transactions and market share were all up for these packages. Our system is investing to grow our executional footprint, adding to what was already pervasive distribution resulting in availability of our products in nearly 2/3 of all outlets globally. These strong results are clear proof points of what is possible when our alliance system leans forward for growth. Underpinning all of this work is our purpose to Refresh the World and Make a Difference. Sustainability remains an integral part of our business and strategy and is a key driver of future growth and business resilience. While we have made progress towards our World Without Waste goals, we remain committed to do more and faster so we can grow our business the right way. We're continuing to partner with other businesses, civil society and governments to support cooperative action on this critical issue. During the quarter, we played a leadership role and helped launch the business coalition for a global plastics treaty convened by key partners, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and World Wildlife Fund, alongside other private sector companies. We are also continuing to take steps to help drive the circular economy by making our bottles more eco-friendly. In North America and Latin America, Sprite has shifted all of its PET packaging from green to clear, improving the efficiency of recycling systems and increasing the availability of food-grade rPET. In Vietnam, we launched Coca-Cola bottles made from 100% recycled plastic, excluding the cap and the label. We now have more than 30 markets where we offer at least one brand in a 100% rPET package, with similar launches planned in additional markets next year. In an operating environment that increasingly puts more variables into the equation than we've seen in the past, we are focused on delivering and executing for growth. We are encouraged by what we are seeing in the business. We are committed to expanding the circumference of what we can control by delivering world-class marketing, disciplined innovation, excellence in revenue growth management, and laser-sharp execution in the marketplace, with a goal of operating at a higher level through these challenging market conditions. We are doing this with capable and aligned bottling partners around the world. The combination of strong loved brands and a pervasive distribution system is a formula for resilience in times like these, and we are pleased to be raising both our top line and bottom line guidance today.  With that, I'll turn the call over to you, John. Yes. Thanks, Dara. The short answer is yes. We're seeing some changes in consumer behavior. I mean, overall, in the third quarter, consumer remained pretty resilient and elasticities were at the better end of the spectrum. Clearly, there are some changes in consumer behavior going on. We talked last quarter about how we have typically experienced recessions.  In other words, there tends to be a sequence, which is that the consumers back off on some more discretionary, higher ticket items white goods types of things. And then as they -- as the pressure comes on purchasing power, they start to reevaluate the total basket. They tend to squeeze down the basket size per trip and they look in some categories where the equity isn't as strong to perhaps trade down to some private label or smaller packages. And you can clearly see that happening -- beginning to happen in a number of places. It would seem to us that Europe is probably the most obvious example, where, in the at-home channel, you can see some growth in private label across a number of categories. In beverages, you could see it tick up a little in water and juices. You can certainly see the growth of the hard discounters, some channel shifting in Europe. That's very consistent with purchasing power squeeze behavior, some signs of that, too, in the U.S. with the dollar channels. So there's clearly the impact of inflation running ahead of wages is starting to come through now that the summer is over and back to school has happened. Our focus and our confidence in our year-to-go and going into next year is about the momentum we've created in our business over the years and our ability to not just to continue with marketing and innovation, but to leverage all the thinking behind revenue growth management and the price pack promo architectures to maximize affordability, and therefore, accessibility of our categories for those consumers that are under pressure. And, of course, backed by excellence in execution and generating the value for retailers by our system that will help us get through what is likely, in all likelihood, going to be a tighter situation for the next six to 12 months. And if I just come back and close the circle by using the European example, where consumers are under pressure. In the third quarter, the Coke system was the biggest creator of additional retail value for at-home retailers well ahead of the rest of CPG. But we believe we have a strategy that's given us momentum. It will see us through the year to go. It will see us into 2023. It may, as John said, end up with above algorithm pricing and some pressure on volume, but we believe our top line can go forward. Yes, absolutely. I mean value packs or ensuring affordability for the consumer is one of the core pieces of RGM. It's about extending the price ladder and, in recessionary times, about making sure the entry price point, whether it would be on the larger packs or on the smaller packs becomes as low down in the price spectrum, the actual out-of-pocket as possible. As I talked about in the last answer, one of the recession behavior tends to be to try and reduce the dollar outlay of the basket, and therefore, the price point becomes even more important than the price per liter.  And so around the world, that's absolutely what we're pursuing, whether it's in the U.S., having smaller bottles or smaller multipacks of less cans per multipack; or the example I used, in Japan, where we took the 500 ml and split it into 350 and 700. Of course, around the world in a number of countries, we leverage our capabilities with returnable bottles, given the economics of returnables particularly in the developing markets, that is a way of generating a lower price point because, of course, in effect, you don't pay for the packaging because it comes back again. And so those returnable bottles that we refill are a way of bringing the price points down and keeping the consumer in the category. And so that's -- it's a well-developed skill around the world. The bottlers share a lot of learnings between themselves on how to think about the technology of RGM, and that allows us to leverage it to its maximum, particularly in times like these. The simple answer, Steve, is we're very dependent on top line momentum. In the sense that we are going to continue, we believe, barring something very unforeseen or at this stage, we believe we're going to continue to invest for the long-term health of the business and that's going to drive top line growth, as it has. I mean, if I -- just for the sake of the argument, if you take the five-year CAGR of revenue through all the ups and downs of COVID and everything, in round numbers, it's trending at 6% compound for the last five years. So preserving and sustaining top line momentum is actually the key starting point. And of course, if there are parts of the world where circumstances do not merit continued high levels of marketing investment and there's reasons to pare back, then as John mentioned earlier, we absolutely will lean on our increased degree of agility and adaptability to make those adjustments in the moment. And similarly, with any SG&A. But the predominant drivers, again, is going to be the top line. We will manage the other elements of the P&L based on the local markets. I don't think it's our expectation that this is going to be like the second quarter of 2020, where everything stoped everywhere at the same time. If there are to be pressures, it's likely that they are spread out over time. So the predominant modus operandi will be leaning to growth, invest in top line growth. And then yes, we expect, at times, different markets to kind of have to, yes, optimize the marketing. But on an overall basis, it's top line momentum driven. Sure. I mean let's start with Japan. Clearly, in Japan, we're very focused on the marketing and innovation. It tends to be a market that's very driven by engagement with the consumer. Also, importantly in Japan, after perhaps multiple decades of not taking price, we have taken price on large packs in Japan in the third quarter. Actually, in the fourth quarter, we've been taking pricing on immediate consumption packaging in Japan. So I think we're going to see an opportunity to lean a little more on the RGM lever in Japan as we continue to engage with the consumer there. In Western Europe, clearly, the basic strategy of investing in marketing, investing in innovation, leveraging RGM and driving in-store execution and value for retailers has been working in Western Europe. As we go into the winter and going into next year, that's still going to be the push we make. The bottlers have got great momentum in execution. Of course, Europe is where there's more of the developed world inflation. Think commodities plus the devaluation of the euro, so that's feeding through. And so we're likely to have to lean heavier on RGM in Europe in the next 12 months, backed up by the marketing, innovation and execution. And then Latin America, a lot of work over the last number of years with the long-term relationship model. Bottlers there have good momentum. Clearly, it's one of our strongest regions. We lost a little share in the beginning of the year. They're very focused on getting that back, obviously, starting from a high bar. And I think perhaps, overall, it would be worth commenting that, obviously, in COVID, we took a number of what were difficult decisions at the time, slimming down the portfolio, changing the marketing model, changing the organizational model for the company. We've got that done and stood up. And I think now we're reaping the benefits of us being able to drive growth with a more agile organization ourselves, combined with really strong and aligned bottling partners. We've driven growth this year, and we're well set up next year. I mean just to cap it all, we had a global system top to top with a number of the bottlers a few weeks ago, and I think everyone is ready and energized for what's ahead. Yes, Chris, I think, yes, clearly, it's likely that next year price/mix will run ahead of volume in a similar way it has this year. I mean our long-term growth algorithm has assumed a relative balance between price and mix. Clearly, at the moment, we're in a period where there's more price/mix than there is volume, and that seems that seems likely to continue into next year. It is also true that, this year, there has been some benefit from the channel mix on the reopening. The reopening benefit that was obviously a reopening cost in the previous year in price/mix is now largely done. And so that kind of tailwind won't be there last -- next year. Are all the channels away from home completely reopened? No. But the remaining kind of sliver is either a function of closed outlets or something that's going to take a while to come back. And of course, some of the mobility restrictions in places like China, which I think also won't snap back certainly in the first half of next year. So the away-from-home of price/mix won't be the tailwind next year. And so in that sense, yes, we'll be very much back to it's all about what's the rate and what's the benefit from all the RGM strategies, whether to drive affordability or to offer premium categories or package sizes, and that's what will be the primary driver going into next year. Sure. Thanks, Carlos. I mean, clearly, this is a feature of particularly the Latin American system. We're using similar models in conversations around the world. They're built on many years of working together collaboratively in Latin America. And then other than some of the features that you mentioned, I think what's really kind of less visible perhaps is its ability to speed up the rate at which actions or decisions and actions are taken by the system. And so it has provided a stimulus to really focusing in on getting to grips with some of the nausea problems and to moving with speed and simplifying the decision-making progress in a whole series of areas, particularly those that have been kind of slower historically.  Some of the stills business models come to mind, particularly as it relates to Latin America. And that will ultimately feed through to, as I said, speed of decision-making, which then needs better marketplace actions, whether that be marketing, innovation, RGM or execution. And I think the system in Latin America is very energized and building on their historic great position and set for further momentum going forward. Sure. I'm not sure which ones you're putting in the bucket of weaker, but let me do a little walk around some of the emerging markets. We had good results we feel in China for the quarter. I mean we had good growth overall for China, notwithstanding some of the mobility restrictions that came in the whole raft of cities. So China remains a good long-term opportunity. We have a good business there, good bottling partners, and there was some resilience to the business in the quarter. . Just keeping with the Asian theme, India had a knockout quarter. Clearly, they're having a very strong run this year. Lots of growth in India, really powering forward. Very pleased with that. Looking, of course, to extend that into the future. Probably won't be a straight line, but certainly looking to continue to invest strongly in India. The rest of ASEAN, there were some pluses and minuses, but generally positive. If I switch to Africa. Africa, you've heard me talk in the past that it's always a rollercoaster. There was a little bit of rollercoaster in the quarter. But overall, we had good growth in those markets we were focused on. There was growth that was ultimately pretty broad-based, whether that was South Africa or elsewhere. It would be worth noting that this quarter, remember, we made a switch in our franchise partner in a number of territories across Africa. So we brought to a close our relationship with BGI, the Castel Group, in a whole raft of African markets. And some of them we had partners ready to go, and some of them we're still working on it. So there is a transition loss of volume in those ex-BGI territories where we ceased that partnership. And so that weighs on the Africa number. And then as you keep going around the world, obviously, Latin America had a good quarter. And then I think the last one I'm really missing is a bit of Eurasia. And there, we had a pretty decent quarter. We had growth in Turkey, which is an important market to us, and a number of other of the Central Asian markets and the Middle Eastern markets. Obviously, those ones that are -- tend to have resources or oil exporting countries tend to have done better than the heavily oil-importing countries, so the Middle East is better than Egypt. Of course, remember that the EMEA numbers have the dropout of the Russia business. Yes, sure. Look, super happy with Coke Zero Sugar. We have been investing behind it for a good number of years and have been driving double-digit Coke Zero Sugar volumes for many years in a row. And obviously, that's getting really material, including strong double-digit growth in the U.S. So very pleased with the reformulation update. Of course, we continue to bring new marketing and new innovation to Coke Zero Sugar and it's going to be a big focus of what we drive going forward. On innovation, as it relates to 2023. I mean, yes, there will be a kind of bias shift in the mix of the innovation for 2023. If one of the imperatives remains affordability and to kind of anchor price points, at the low end of the actual dollar outlay, then clearly, package innovation takes a bigger role in that sort of environment, whether it be smaller packages, whether it be the returnable packaging. Big investments going in by the bottling system in returnable packaging to help the affordability strategy. So in a kind of purchasing power pressured year for the consumer, we expect innovation to be slightly heavier on the packaging side, particularly to drive affordability. But of course, that will also have its other side of the coin which is to try and ensure there are some perhaps more premium options for those that still have plenty of disposable income. Not everyone will have exactly the same effect in this period. So likely to see continued push, for example, in the U.S. on small cans or sleek cans to really stretching out the pricing ladder, not just putting all the bets on the affordable end. And we will continue with the brand and the product innovation. I don't know if you went to the NACS. There was a lot of innovation on show the Convenience Store Conference for the North America, there was a lot of innovation on display there, both package and product. And so we will be approaching '23 with a broad innovation agenda, but with some slight weighting to packaging to stretch on the price ladder. It would be a particularly delusional position to, say, I'm not worried about anything. That would be very weird. But clearly, we have -- it's a competitive industry. There are a lot of good competitors, big and small. So we absolutely worry what they're up to. We always take it from satisfying the consumer and the retailer point of view. We're not chasing the competitors, we're chasing the consumers and the retailers. And certainly, there, we could point to a set of things where competitors have done well, and that calls attention to us to whether we are really doing everything we can to satisfy the consumer or the retailer. I think one obvious example is in sports drinks advanced hydration in the U.S., where this year, our competitors are coming off having a whole series of supply chain challenges last year. And that's -- we had a great year last year, and we've had a not-so-great year this year and we're also obviously in the transition of taking on the BODYARMOR. But the U.S. bottlers are very energized about the BODYARMOR and Powerade plans going forward. A lot of innovation on the brand, on the product, on the packaging setup. So we'll be back. I mean -- but it's -- what guides us is are we satisfying the consumer and the retailer. Thank you, operator. So just in summary, third quarter results, I think, exemplify how we're executing and winning in the marketplace. It's been driven by the work we've done as a system and the transformation we've undergone over the last few years. We are a more resilient business, and we're committed to delivering long-term value for our shareholders and stakeholders. And thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning."

            "name": "John Murphy",
            "content": "Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll comment on our third quarter performance and provide considerations for our updated guidance to this year. I'll also provide some early commentary on 2023 and what actions we are taking to drive a top line-led growth equation to navigate this dynamic environment. . We are encouraged with the continued momentum of our business, and we delivered another set of strong results in the third quarter. We grew organic revenue 16%, unit cases grew 4%, with broad-based growth across most operating segments and targeted investments in the marketplace. Concentrate sales were in line with unit cases for the quarter. Our price/mix of 12% was driven primarily by pricing actions across operating segments, along with revenue growth management initiatives, further improvement in away-from-home channels in most markets and positive segment mix. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 190 basis points versus the prior year. The underlying margin compression was approximately 60 basis points, with the rest of the impact coming from currency headwinds driven by the volatile macro backdrop and the mechanical effect of consolidating the BODYARMOR finished goods business. We significantly stepped up our consumer and customer-facing investments to support our robust marketing agenda and strong innovation pipeline. Notwithstanding higher costs and continued investments in the marketplace, we expanded underlying operating margin by approximately 100 basis points, driven by strong top line growth. Comparable operating margin, however, compressed by approximately 50 basis points due to the impact of the BODYARMOR acquisition and currency headwinds. Below the line, we benefited from a lower-than-expected effective tax rate for the full year. All in, third quarter comparable EPS of $0.69 grew 7% year-over-year, and this was impacted by 11 points of currency headwinds. On cash flow, we delivered free cash flow of $7.3 billion year-to-date driven by our strong business performance. This was 14% lower versus the prior year, primarily due to two items: one, cycling the timing of working capital benefits in the prior year; and two, higher 2021 annual incentives paid in the first quarter. Additionally, our net debt leverage is 1.8x EBITDA, which is slightly below our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. As we look to the operating environment, there are clearly many variables at play today, as James mentioned. We are spinning our top line and bottom line flywheels faster to fortify our business and manage through many types of environments, and we're investing in the marketplace to create value for our customers and consumers. Given our strong results and the visibility we have for the rest of the year, we are raising guidance for the full year. We now expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 14% to 15% and comparable currency-neutral EPS growth of 15% to 16%. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we expect currency to be a 7-point headwind to comparable net revenues and a 9-point headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. We now expect an underlying effective tax rate of 19% in 2022. All in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 6% to 7% versus 2021. We continue to expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow for 2022, through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less about $1.5 billion in capital investments. There are some considerations to keep in mind for Q4 that we factored into our full year guidance. There is an additional day in the fourth quarter, however, we expect concentrate sales to end the year in line with unit case sales. We are investing in consumer-facing marketing to get a fast start for next year. Lastly, given the backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see an impact on our interest expense given our effective exposure to floating rate debt. The environment remains volatile, and while we are preparing for many futures in 2023, we did want to share some early considerations for next year based on what we know today. We are encouraged by the momentum in our top line and we leverage our capabilities to sustain top line growth with the ongoing inflationary backdrop. As we look to our cost outlook, we expect global inflation to continue to impact our expenses across the board and commodities to remain volatile. We benefited from hedges in our commodity exposure this year. And even though some of the commodities have started to come off their highs, we expect another year of elevated inflation on a per case basis next year. We estimate the underlying effective tax rate to be 19.5% for 2023. Regarding currency, if we were to assume current rates and our hedge positions, there would be an approximate 5-point to 6-point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 7-point to 8-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023. However, given the amount of volatility in the currency markets, this initial view could change when we come back to you for the fourth quarter call in February. We are committed to delivering top line-led growth and we remain focused and confident in our ability to achieve our three key objectives: investing for the long-term health of the business, winning locally and generating U.S. dollar EPS growth. We are pleased with our results so far and have the visibility to deliver on our updated guidance, creating value for our shareowners through strong top line growth, cash flow generation and dividend growth. Our strong system leadership and the tremendous ongoing commitment of our people around the world gives us confidence that we will continue to deliver sustainable results in the year ahead. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions. Thanks, Bryan. Yes, those comments were very much related to next year. We do see a path to generating U.S. dollar EPS growth next year. Clearly, there's a lot of variables in the equation. And if anything, there's even more variability with some of those variables. We've talked a lot about our strategy is to lead a sustainable equation from the top line. We continue to have confidence in the momentum that our business has and to continue that momentum. The cost outlook does remain more elevated than we are used to. But we've got a higher revenue, higher cost algorithm that we're looking to manage going into next year. I think the work we've done over the last couple of years to build flexibility to be able to adapt quicker than perhaps we have done historically to changes in the markets around us, is something that we take on board and will continue to drive. And with that, we've given the guidance or the considerations for next year. And we're very focused on finishing the year strong, starting fast and being able to deliver on those three objectives. Sure, Kaumil, thanks for the question. Yes, as you know, we manage our funding through -- with an eye towards liquidity risk and with a multiyear lens, and have done that for many years. We've -- through COVID, I think we've talked about we've pushed our age of our debt out a number of years. And we do have a mix of fixed and floating. Most of the floating is in euro, and so we will wait and see what ECB does over the coming months to have a clearer picture on the impact for 2023. But I think it's an area that we'll provide more detail on in February, subject to the development by the Fed here and by ECB over the coming months. A lot of questions, Bonnie. Let me start with the commodity point and our outlook for the year ahead. As I said at the -- I think in answer to the first question, there are a lot of variables in that equation. And indeed, the variability with some of them is maybe even broader. When I think about the cost environment, not just the commodity environment, I think about both our commodities, the commodity pressures that we have within our business and the non-commodity pressures that we have. And so as we look at '23 on the commodity front, we are rolling off some very favorable hedges that we were fortunate to have this year. And it's still -- in our mind, it's still unclear as to how commodities will trend over the next six to 12 months. So we'll have more visibility on that when we get to the call in February. With regard to the non-commodity items, just within that, you've got a bucket of different topics -- freight, logistics, the transportation in our finished goods models and the overall wage environment. And we have to take into account that the wage environment is not the same everywhere, and indirect impacts on supply chain pressures. As we think about the supply chain, it's important to not just have efficiency as a metric, we also need to make sure that we have continuity, we have, for the short and longer term, and we're able to manage many of the pressures that I think we've talked about on previous calls, manage those effectively. So there's a lot going on inside of the cost of goods line. And hence, I think it's better for us to just provide you with how we're seeing it overall, and we'll come back in February with more specifics. And to your second question on ongoing price increases, I think it links back to some of James' comments earlier. The name of the game is to optimize our revenue equation over the next 12 to 18 months. That's going to be a combination of smart pricing, understanding the mix, both from a channel and package perspective, and being able to utilize the many levers that we have inside of the RGM toolkits that our bottlers have. So again, I think at this stage, it's still early to say what the exact numbers will be for each of those topics. But I think the broader point is that the top line momentum that we've enjoyed here today, that we see continuing to hold through the rest of the year, is something that we expect to be able to generate into 2023. So, Andrea, thanks. I'll take that. As we said on the earlier, I think it's too early to get into those specifics for next year. I think the way to think about the year ahead is I think it's going to be another year out of our typical algorithm. We continue to build greater visibility around how -- what to expect in the -- particularly in the first half of the year when we'll be looking for that fast start. What each line item of the income statement looks like is -- it's just too early. We'll come back in February with that detail. I think the key takeaway is that as we sit here, we do see a path to generating U.S. dollar EPS growth in 2023. As I said earlier, there's many variables to bring that path to fruition. And we know that top-line driven smart investments and effective management of our cost structure, those thee will deliver. And below the operating income line, as I said, there's a lot that still needs to play out in the next few months to give you a clearer picture on what to expect. And we'll come back in February with that detail. Thanks for the question. And just to maybe to reiterate, the difference, I think, between the long-term growth algorithm and what may be coming at us over the next year or so, I think it's going to be somewhat out of algorithm, given the various factors that we have discussed on the call and indeed have discussed throughout the year. So at this point in time, I think it is too soon to give you line-by-line guidance. But we continue to see a path to generate U.S. dollar EPS growth in 2023, and that will be -- will need to be driven from the top line. The cost pressures are there. We're very aware of them. We talked about the currency outlook. And so, we still think when you put all the pieces together that we have that path. But we'll have a lot more coming at us over the next three to four months. And in February, can give you a more granular breakdown of how we expect to get there."

[Operator Instructions] Now I'll turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we delivered strong performance by continuing to execute on our growth strategy. Our industry remained robust, and we gained both volume and value share in the quarter. Our first half 2022 results and the resiliency of our business give us confidence to raise our top line guidance. This is offsetting the meaningful increases in costs and currency headwinds to hold our bottom line U.S. dollar outlook of 5% to 6% growth, even as we accelerate investments in our business to drive future growth. These results are enabled by our organization's purpose-led culture, strong alignment with our bottling partners and the dedication and flexibility of our people while driving our growth agenda. This morning, I'll discuss the current operating environment and how we're delivering results and building for the future in that environment and the progress on our sustainability agenda. Then John will discuss the financial details of the quarter and how we are building resilience to manage through external factors worldwide. During the second quarter, the operating environment continued to be asynchronous with many moving parts. Some regions continued to experience broad-based macro strength while others are experiencing strong inflationary pressures. Some countries are still recovering from the pandemic, while China experienced pandemic-related lockdowns. And the conflict in Ukraine is ongoing, and we'd like to send our thoughts and deepest sympathies to all of those who continue to be affected. With this as a backdrop, we have managed well with our bottlers and delivered robust revenue growth across all our geographic segments that encompass strong pricing actions and strong volume performance helped by away-from-home recovery. Consumer elasticities have largely held a better-than-expected year-to-date, though we are watching closely for signs of changing consumer behavior as the year goes on and as the average cost of the consumer basket continues to go up. We expect the consumer environment to be more challenging, and we are preparing accordingly, stepping up our investments, sharpening our resource allocation capabilities and tapping into data to better reach our consumers. We also recognize that the dollar strength is impacting our translated earnings, and we remain committed to delivering U.S. dollar growth. As a system, we are focusing on expanding the circumference of what we can control, understanding and providing what consumers want, ultimately giving them more reasons to choose our great brands and driving value for our consumers, our customers and the industry. Now recapping our Q2 performance across the world, starting with Asia Pacific. In India, we delivered our best-ever quarter volumetrically and added 1 billion incremental transactions in the quarter, led by affordable single-serve packs. We gained share in sparkling soft drinks and juices, and our system is continuing to invest in the marketplace availability and execution to capture growth. Japan made progress in recovery, and we gained share and consumers year-to-date versus 2019. Additionally, we gained 7 points of share of visible inventory, driven by coffee and Tea in the ambience base. We continue to have a strong innovation pipeline with the launch of Ayataka Hojicha Latte, non-alcohol Lemon-Dou, [indiscernible] and Georgia Latte Nista. Performance in China was under pressure, driven by COVID lockdowns. Volume was down for all months in the quarter, but the team persevered through a challenging environment, and recovery began in June as most restrictions started to lift. We focused on the core, prioritized top SKUs and reallocated resources to digital engagement, e-commerce and O2O as consumer demand shifted to at-home consumption. In ASEAN and South Pacific, macro fundamentals remained strong despite ongoing supply chain headwinds. We added new consumers, and transactions grew ahead of volume. We invested in consumer-facing marketing and improvement in execution and increased distribution across key entry packs and multipacks. Turning to EMEA. Europe saw strong volume performance, leading to value share gains across total NARTD and online. Strong marketing campaigns, including Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Zero Words, What The Fanta 3.0 and Sprite Screen Time Messaging are tying our beverages to more consumption occasions with better results. In Africa, we delivered strong performance and translated into NARTD volume and value share gains. We continue to focus on skills, affordability and in-market execution. Digital initiatives remained strong and grows merchandise value of our eB2B marketplace businesses were up approximately 50% sequentially. We accelerated cooler placement, reduced retail out of stocks and continued building RGM capability across markets. In Eurasia and Middle East, amidst an unprecedented inflationary environment, the industry is growing, and the recovery of the on-premise channel is driving our growth. Through the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour, we leveraged the iconic Coca-Cola trademark to generate significant media traction across the markets. Turning to North America. We gained both volume and value share through the strength of our brands despite navigating a challenging supply chain, including higher labor and freight costs. We continue to drive mix improvement in sparkling soft drinks and more than doubled mini can availability on this play. New product innovations, including Coke Starlight, Fanta Dragon Fruit Zero Sugar and Minute Maid Aguas Frescas are showing promising early results. We're continuing to work closely with our bottling partners to accelerate overall commercial execution. Turning to Latin America. We leverage compelling occasion-based marketing campaigns and execution in the marketplace, and our share losses improved sequentially. Coca-Cola trademark focus on building meals and brakes rituals under the Real Magic platform with returnable packages as the main enabler, while in juice and dairy, we're focused on everyday mills occasions. Our flavored alcohol beverage business is growing strongly. We're gaining share in the direct-to-consumer business and now reaching approximately 6.3 million consumers via digital channels. In Global Ventures, the cost of retail business was under pressure as footfall in the U.K. stayed below 2019 levels. However, the Costa Express platform remained robust, and the launch of the new Frappe range in the U.K. drove growth. Finally, our Bottling Investments Group delivered strong top line performance, driven by a focus on recruitment through affordable entry packs, including a relaunch of returnable glass bottles in India. Additionally, we saw continued sparkling soft drink share gains versus 2019 in the Philippines and Vietnam. While the macro environment is still asynchronous around the world, we're operating in an industry with a relatively predictable pattern of growth and attractive growth potential over the long term. So we're investing in our business and are anticipating the many futures as they come at us. We have managed a broad-based recovery coming out of the pandemic. Our 5-year average organic revenue growth rate is at the top end of our long-term growth target of 4% to 6%, which is a proof point of our transformed and strengthened organization. As we look to the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on raising the bar on the elements of our flywheels for top line growth and, as I said earlier, expand the circumference of what we can control, namely through building our strong portfolio of loved brands, excellence in revenue growth management and the power of our system execution. We're making targeted investments to unlock our growth agenda. We've built capabilities in brand building, innovation, RGM and execution, leveraging the power of scale while still being locally relevant to consumers. These investments enable us to win not only in today's environment but continue to build our business for the long term. Our new marketing model is focused on adding and retaining consumers. And we're doing this through an ecosystem of experiences that link consumption occasions with consumer passion points. The launch of the Global Magic Weekends campaign with Trademark Coke, in partnership with more than 20 food service aggregators, is showing great results. This campaign engages consumers at key moments from gaming to music to meal times. We are seeing 3.5x redemption levels for Coca-Cola combo meals versus pre-campaign levels and a 50% lift in outlets with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar availability. We also launched end-to-end digital-first brand campaigns for smartwater and vitaminwater, the snackable video content on social platforms for smartwater with global icon Zendaya and the launch of vitaminwater Lil Nas X partnership on TikTok is a different engagement approach to marketing that is already delivering strong results across channels. With new faces and new platforms for some of our billion-dollar brands, we are creating excitement and recruiting a new generation of drinkers. We continue to strengthen our RGM capabilities, which allows us to drive value for our consumers and our customers. RGM allows us to better navigate a dynamic consumer and retail environment, using effective tools such as price and promotional intelligence to leverage the power of our brands, proactive mix management and premiumization and addressing affordability to drive recruitment and keep value-conscious consumers. We work to bring these elements to life at a local level with our bottling partners. For example, in India, we focus on segmented pricing, increasing prices on multiserves and premium packs while holding transaction-driving price points in single-serve and the affordable portfolio. Additionally, we reached our highest-ever outlet availability and drove a 4-point increase in single-serve availability and a 6-point increase in affordable pack availability. In Europe, our system implemented several affordability and premiumization initiatives. We drove strong transaction and volume growth through initiatives like incentivizing multipacks to drive value on a price-per-ounce basis for consumers and driving single-serve packages like cans and returnable glass bottles in HORECA channels. By keeping transaction-driving price points in play, we expanded our consumer base with sparkling soft drinks in the region year-to-date. We're building consumer-centric loved brands and products, and our improving excellence in execution extends the building a more sustainable future for our business and the planet. During the quarter, we released our fourth World Without Waste Report, which provides an update on our ambitious sustainable packaging initiatives. It showcases how we are using our global reach and expertise to drive solutions at scale. Our operating units are further integrating sustainable practices into the business to drive growth. For example, in the United States, we are executing a set of initiatives to help solve the plastic waste problem. We recently joined industry groups, including the Consumer Goods Forum and the American Beverage Association, to support our model Extended Producer Responsibility Bill in Colorado. This is in addition to the support we provided for well-designed minimum-recycled content legislation in 3 states. These are now being enacted into law. Currently, 20-ounce bottles for Coca-Cola Trademark and The Summit in California, Texas, New York and throughout the Northeast are in 100% recycled PET. In 2021, we launched a bottled label clearly communicating that the bottles, excluding the caps and labels, are made from 100% recycled content, which is driving strong performance in the marketplace. Later this month, we will expand our use of 100% recycled PET throughout the U.S. and Canada. Every part of our business understands how their actions impact the company's wider sustainability goals, and we continue to make progress. To sum up, we are continuing to navigate a confluence of macroeconomic factors, and our networked organization is embracing the resilience to weather many environments. Guided by our purpose and with the right strategy through our portfolio and the right execution capabilities, we are confident about delivering top line growth for now and the long term. Before I turn the call over to John, I want to congratulate him for assuming the role of President beginning October 1, in addition to his current responsibility as a CFO. And of course, I also want to thank Brian Smith for his service and innumerable contributions to the system during his 25-year tenure with the company and wish him all the best for the future. So John, over to you.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I will briefly touch on the drivers of our second quarter performance and the update to our full year 2022 guidance, then I'll provide commentary on building resilience in our business by investing behind our brands and driving top line led growth. We're pleased with the continued momentum of our business around the world. This has translated into strong top line and comparable EPS growth, notwithstanding the larger-than-expected currency headwinds and increased cost pressures. We delivered organic revenue growth of 16%. Unit cases grew 8% with broad-based growth across all operating segments. Concentrate sales were behind unit cases by 4 points in the quarter, primarily due to the timing of shipments in Latin America and our Europe, Middle East and Africa Group. Our price/mix of 12% was primarily driven by strategic pricing actions across markets, along with revenue growth management initiatives, further improvement in away-from-home channels in most markets and positive segment mix. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 250 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to the impact of 3 items: one, an upsized increase in costs in the business due to the inflationary environment; two, currency headwinds driven by the volatile macro backdrop; and three, the mechanical effect of consolidating the BODYARMOR finished goods business. On the marketing front, we increased our consumer and customer-facing spending to create more value for our brands and continue to earn their respective price points. Despite increased investments and costs throughout the P&L, we expanded underlying operating margin by approximately 40 basis points, driven by a higher return from our investments in the marketplace. Comparable operating margin, however, compressed by approximately 110 basis points due to the BODYARMOR acquisition and currency headwinds. Putting this all together, second quarter comparable EPS of $0.70 grew 4% year-over-year. And this was impacted by 9 points of currency headwinds, 5 points higher than what we'd anticipated when we last gave guidance. On cash flow, we delivered free cash flow of $4.1 billion year-to-date, driven by our strong business performance. This was 20% lower versus the prior year, primarily due to 2 items: one, cycling the timing of working capital benefits in the prior year; and two, higher 2021 annual incentives paid in the first quarter. Additionally, our net debt leverage is 2.1x EBITDA, which is within the targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. As we look at the operating environment and the resilience consumers have shown thus far, we are watching closely for signs that indicate this may change. We remain ready to adapt. We're using a dynamic resource allocation framework to ensure our investments are directed towards country category combinations that drive the highest growth, thereby maximizing our returns. And we are working closely with our bottling partners to effectively navigate whatever comes our way. With this backdrop, this morning, we are raising our top line and currency-neutral EPS guidance. We now expect organic revenue growth of 12% to 13% and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 14% to 15% versus 2021. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now expect currency to be a 6-point headwind to comparable net revenues and a 9-point headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of 19.5% in 2022. And all in, we continue to expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus 2021. And we continue to expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow for 2022 through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. There are some considerations to keep in mind for 2022 that we factored into our guidance. While our shipments are currently behind unit cases, we expect these to run in line for the full year with the catch-up expected in the fourth quarter. We now expect that the direct impact of the Ukraine conflict and the resulting suspensions of business in Russia, will be approximately $0.03 to comparable EPS. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now expect commodity price inflation to move to a high single-digit impact from mid-single digits on comparable cost-of-goods sold in 2022. This is primarily due to commodity cost increases across our concentrate and finished goods businesses. Other costs, including wages, transportation, media and operating expenses, are also increasing and adding incremental pressures. The consolidation of the BODYARMOR finished goods business will continue to have a mechanical effect on margins, partially offset by the impact of refranchising our Vietnam and Cambodia bottling operations. And lastly, given the backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see an impact on our interest expense given our exposure to floating rate debt. As we enter the second half of the year, we continue to raise the bar in every aspect of how we do business. And we feel confident in our ability to effectively navigate this dynamic global environment and deliver on our updated guidance for 2022. Along with our bottling partners, we remain focused on the compelling growth opportunity our industry offers, and we are investing and creating flexibility in the business by taking actions on those things within our control. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane : So really wanted to touch on both. James and John, you talked a little bit about the second half and watching the consumer. And again, having had such a strong first half, your guidance for the full year implies a slowdown to, I guess, somewhere around 7%-or-so organic sales growth. And so can you just touch on a little bit how you've maybe risk-adjusted the second half versus the first half? Is it a reflection of, a, expectation that macro environment or the consumer may weaken or are there other considerations that kind of got -- kind of are underneath that sort of deceleration that's implied in the guidance? And if you can maybe talk a little bit about maybe where the risks are geographically also, that would help.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure, Brian. Let me start off kind of by zooming out and then come back to the consumer and the uncertainty in the downhill. And that is -- in the end, it's going to be 2 ways underlining the kind of the relatively atypical point we are, given the end of COVID and the kind of post-COVID era. And where I'm going with that is to start by zooming out and saying, look, if you were to take a 3-year or a 5-year compound annual growth rate and look at the first half and what's implied in the second half guidance, you wouldn't see as much choppiness as you're seeing when you compare to prior year, and that's all related to COVID. In fact, if you take the 3-year or 5-year compound annual growth rate and look backwards and through the amazing roll coaster of volume and down and then up and price down then up, what you actually see is something simpler and more encouraging, which is that the volume has grown at 2 and a bit and the price has grown at 3 and a bit, whichever of those 2-time periods you've taken, so you net out at about 6. And so what you see over that long time period is the thesis we've been advancing, which is we've got an industry that grows at 4-ish percent. We are the leader that gain share with our portfolio, whether our RGM with our execution, and therefore, we can get to the top end of our long-term growth model. And if you zoom out, that's the kind of picture that you can see. And I would encourage people to not get too lost in the weeds to start with in trying to figure out the second half or even maybe the future and start with kind of starting from a macro position and saying like what does that look like when you kind of look through on a longer-term basis. And I think that will help people think about the downhill. The second thing I would say about those, we don't know how it's going to turn out. There's clearly a set of things going on and the net impact is difficult to predict in terms of the rest of the year. One, we've clearly, in some parts of the world, got a squeeze on purchasing power, and higher inflation is running ahead of wages. That's true in many places, U.S., Europe. It's not universally true. The inflation in China and Southeast Asia is only running at 3%. But there's clearly a big part of the world where there's a purchasing power squeeze. But at the same time, you've got relatively stable deposit balances. And you've got a big, very atypical reprioritization of spend occurring by consumers. And that's an important feature of how to see what the consumer is doing, because whilst there are a number of channels and categories where things look a little tougher in the short term. So if you're looking in grocery in the developed markets, if you're looking at some of the convenience channels in developed markets, you're seeing some pressure on consumers with less income, some early signs of trading down, depending on which category you're in, not necessarily in beverages yet. That's not to be -- that's to be expected. But then if you're in the away-from-home channels, the theme parks, the leisure parks, that sort of thing, travel, it's about as good as it's ever been. And so this post-COVID reprioritization of spend by consumers is layered over what feels like a squeeze on purchasing power. Whether it's a recession with peak employment is yet to be seen, but there's a kind of a standard process going on a squeezing purchase path, layered over with this weird or atypical consumer reprioritization post-COVID. How that's all going to net out in the second half and going into next year? There are a lot of opinions. I don't think anyone is going to know until we actually get there. But let me zoom back out again. The long picture is a stable sustained and accelerated momentum for the Coke system over a good number of years that we feel good about going into the downhill.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: So just 2 follow-ups on that. A, can you just give us a sense of how much of the full year top line raise was due to price/mix versus volume specifically and just break it out between those 2 factors? And then B, just any update on if towards the end of the quarter in July, if you saw any of that potential squeeze in consumer purchasing power play out? Obviously, in aggregate, very strong top line numbers, but are there any regions maybe where you're seeing either demand drop off or signs of consumer trade down? It'd be helpful to get a bit of a compare and contrast regionally and if there are any initial sites.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean, firstly, we don't break out price/mix and volume in the downhill. I'm expecting it to be a balance. We clearly are expecting to get both volume growth and price/mix growth going into the downhill. I would just underline again partly the commentary I made on the last answer, which is the price/mix that you see in the year-to-date, some of that is rate increase, but actually, slightly more than half is mix, whether it's geographic or away-from-home recovering relative at home. So there are a couple of big profound effects going on. So you've got to lay it over that right with reopenings and shifts in countries and shift in channels, which are very important. But we're expecting a balance of volume and price into the downhill, not just because we continue to be biased towards investing for growth, but we are very focused on in an expected squeeze on purchasing power to anchor ourselves in affordability to keep focus through the brand investments, through the revenue growth management strategies to keep the entry price points for the categories and for the packages as low as we can to keep the consumer base. We've talked about this strategy before. It's one of our playbooks. It works for us. We believe it's very important to push ahead. Of course, we balance that out with a focus on premiumization opportunities, and it's what we're going to focus into as we go into the downhill. As I said, we have not yet experienced a very significant or a significant pullback from the consumer that's not surprising to us at this stage. If there were a recessionary environment or in some countries, 1 country, more countries, a typical recessionary pattern in past experience would be consumers initially stop buying high-ticket item, discretionary things. I'll replace the car later. I\u2019ll replace the mattress later. They then start saving on the lower ticket items and they trade down in categoies which have weaker leader brands and then eventually might hit the grocery categories with strong leader brands and the away-from-home. So we came to have some lead time going into some normal recession, we have not seen large effects of that yet, even though, as I said, you can see in some channels, in some countries, what looks like the beginnings of that process, it has not gone to us yet. But as I said in the beginning, the overlay from that, a reprioritization of spend which is, I think, confusing or making hard to read whether it truly is \u201cas normal recession\u201d or it's just a reprioritization of spend away from typical things into things I missed out on in the last couple of years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: James, you've commented before on the view that the company is taking on pricing and pricing ahead of a recession. I was curious, given your -- just your comments on still not seeing any signs, you typically have some lead time for the business and in your categories before there would be impacts from consumer softness. Where do you feel you stand on pricing at this point? I know it's a big world, so it may be hard to give one blanket answer. But it would be great if you could give some context by larger markets where you stand on pricing if you feel like you're in the right place given the level of cost inflation.\nJames Quincey: Yes. I mean, as you say, there's not a one size fits all. We've rather atypically got relatively high inflation in the U.S. and Europe with the kind of 8% to 10%, and there are emerging markets that are down at 3%. So it's not a normal time. We obviously have a lot of experience. I won't go over our RGM strategy and how we use that to manage through maintaining affordability. What you see -- and let me make a couple of points here. One, it's important to consider in the headline price/mix that we're reporting that a big component of price/mix in the first half is mix. Unusually, relative to the past and pre-COVID, mix is an important factor, both from a country point of view and from a channel point of view. And both are favoring reported price/mix at the moment. So underlying rate increases, if you like, are not as high as the price/mix number. And they are in the ballpark of slightly behind inflation. And the reason that -- and that's relatively typical as well. So that's not surprising to us because what we essentially try to do as -- firstly, as I commented before, is we don't want to get behind passing cost increases through. We don't want to arrive a recession with a big buildup of cost increases that has not gone through, but nor do we get ahead and anticipate inflation by pricing ahead of it. And so that the rates increases are kind of in the ballpark of inflation would be the normal expected kind of trajectory. And so what we're seeing is, yes, we've been passing through the commodity increases. Again, we don't price -- we don't pass through to the peak. We're not chasing the spot market. We are hedged on commodities. And so as the prices come up, clearly, we know when the hedges are going to roll off, and we need to pass through those. But the commodities are not the majority of the cost base. We've got a lot of service and other inputs, and we are seeing broader-based inflation than just commodities up and down. And so as those come through, we pass them through. And so we've passed a good bit through so far this year. We anticipate more cost increases will come through on a broad-based set of inputs. And we will continue locally in each country because it's very different. We will continue to pass those through. And what that's likely to look like in terms of rate is we'll kind of be at inflation or slightly behind headline inflation as it goes up with the layover of price/mix.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Yes, I think this question is probably for John. And congrats, John, on the new role. But I guess I was hoping you could give us just maybe a bit more insight into your line of sight into productivity and cost savings over the balance of the year and whether the philosophy from here is still more to reinvest those savings to drive profit growth through accelerated revenue and expense leverage. Or whether, given the higher inflationary pressure that you called out and the prospects of deteriorating demand on the horizon, the philosophy is now biasing at all more towards harvesting those cost savings and dropping them more straight through to profit? Just some context there. And then if you could also comment at all as to how your investment priorities may be shifting in this environment, that would be helpful as well.\nJohn Murphy: Sure. Thanks, Steve. Yes, I think I mentioned in the script that as we look to the second half of the year, we look to continue the momentum that we have enjoyed year-to-date so far. And we're very focused on providing the resources to our markets and to our brands to continue to sustain that momentum. So the clear bias is to support the top line as we go forward. When I look at the overall cost base, there's a number of factors, I think, to take into account. As James highlighted, we do have broad-based increases across the board, not only on the core commodities but other inputs into our concentrate business. And we have -- we're taking on board inflationary increases in operating expenses and even our marketing expenses. We do have an ongoing focus on productivity, and there's a number of levers that we've discussed in the past. We have -- I think we've been able to leverage the scale of our network. We've been able to build, deepened even more strategic relationships with a number of our key supply partners across the world over the last couple of years, one of the benefits of COVID. And we're taking actions to simplify and streamline the way we do business. And so you can expect us to continue to drive productivity across the board. But the guidance that we've given this morning, I think, is reflective of the overarching bias to continue to invest to support the top line and to continue to take actions across the board to mitigate against those inflationary pressures that we're seeing in a number of key areas.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kaumal Gajrawala from Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: John, congratulations. For a few years now, you've talked about dollar-based EPS growth. And James, you mentioned it again, the commitment to growing in dollar terms in your prepared remarks. Can you maybe talk about what new maybe policies or procedures you have in place to try to accomplish that? Or perhaps how things might be different if we go through another period of years of dollar strengthening versus the last cycle?\nJames Quincey: Yes. I mean very much -- let me start by reading them. Our goals are to, on a continuous basis, strengthen the strategic position of the Coke Company and to deliver ultimately, when all said and done, increases in dollar EPS back to the shareholders. And so that is the North Star, and we've broken that out into all the strategies necessary to make that a reality. And that's what we're going to continue to pursue. Clearly, at the moment, we're focused on increasing our ability, both the resilience to face up to what could be yet further unexpected twists and turns in the coming months or even years, and adaptability. One of the features of the COVID crisis was the amount of learning that took place to be able to respond to the lockdowns. So the first lockdown was very painful. The second one, less so and onwards and onwards. And actually, in the second quarter, there was a considerable lockdown in China. China was negative in volume each month through the second quarter. And yet, we were able to both accommodate that and manage through it in China and mitigate it at a total company point of view. So bear in mind, Q2 had both the disappearance of the Russian business and a quite negative China business due to the lockdown. So this idea of focusing -- continuing to focus on the strategy that has been guiding us for the last number of years with a double-down on both resilience and adaptability, we feel, is going to give us the wherewithal to manage through the twists and turns that are yet ahead of us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: I guess I have a question on your guidance. Could you give us a sense of the scenarios you considered in your new updated guidance in terms of a potential recession and whether you've considered a severe scenario? And then how should we think about your business relative to peers given you over-indexed to the on-premise channel? James, you touched on this, but just curious to hear if you see a greater potential risk on your business as consumers potentially pull back on dining out and entertainment. And if so, is this considered in your guidance? And then maybe just touch on the strategy you can implement to mitigate this.\nJames Quincey: Look, in preparing the guidance and thinking about our way forward, we've considered a whole number of potential scenarios. What we feel is -- the most likely is what we've reflected in the guidance. Clearly, there's a lot of uncertainty, which is why rather than having our operators focus on debating which scenario do they think is right, we said, \"Look, let's lean into growth.\" We've been growing coming out of last year. We're growing in each of the quarters this year. We're still growing. So let's maintain our bias to growth and keep going. And in the meantime, make sure that we're doubling down on resilience and adaptability for whatever is going to come. And that may end up being different by region in the world and by country in the world. Certainly, overall and in time as well, the recessions, if they arrive, generally are not completely the same everywhere. And so it's very much, we have a bias to growth and we're going to focus on resilience and adaptability. I think the fact that our businesses, in round numbers, half at home and half away from home, clearly, at the moment, is favorable. Clearly, it was a disadvantage at the height of COVID. Experience of recession says that we have a great business system that can see us through. Let me reinforce again, and when you zoom out and you think of all that's happened in the last 5 years, and you say, \"Well, what's the net number for the Coke system or the Coke Company?\" The organic revenue growth is, in round numbers, about 6%. And so we have seen our way through, and that's what we're focused on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Congrats to John. My question is on the potential for increasing the concentrate incidence cost for some of the bottlers that operate in a high inflationary environment. I believe Arca spoke to higher concentrate costs, but I was just checking if this is more a flow-through from the pricing and the percentage there and -- or some adjustments to the puts and takes of inflation. And just a clarification on your commentary about Europe in general. You're seeing on-premise keeping the momentum or you're seeing any exit rate there as had been more moderate embedded in your guidance?\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Andreas. So on the last point, I think as James highlighted, we're not seeing any significant changes on that front, so very much focused on continuing to drive the momentum. With regard to the whole topic of how we work with our bottling partners, as I think many of you on the call understand and appreciate, we have an economic model that is under-led by instance pricing. That pricing allows both of us to focus on growth in the marketplace and allows greater certainty as to what to expect from our activities in the marketplace. And as we work through periods of high growth, low growth, volatility, stability, the model doesn't change that much. It's what allows us to -- I think, to stay focused on delivering what we need to in whatever the context is. So not a -- there's not a lot to report out on changes. I think the model itself is actually what allows us to -- one of the reasons that allows us to continue to deliver on the opportunities that the industry has that we've talked about and allows us to continue to be optimistic about sustaining momentum.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore ISI.\nRob Ottenstein: I just first wanted to follow up on the question on the bottling system. Can you just maybe, number one, talk a little bit about Swire and kind of the thought pattern there? where you stand on the refranchising in general. And then just more specifically on the pricing, you talked about leaning into growth. How does that play into the pressures that are on the bottlers themselves? I mean, obviously, with the incident pricing, you both share, but presumably, the bottlers are getting hurt a little bit more in a number of countries from inflation. So how does the discussion work between you and the bottlers in terms of how much pricing is appropriate?\nJames Quincey: Yes. I mean, look, the conversation in any given country on the pricing strategy is clearly a conversation where we're trying to bring some strategic start with the consumer, brand thinking, some RGM technology integrated with the way the bottles see RGM. We are both exposed to cost basis, yes, difference in nature. We both very much have the idea. The costs, ultimately, if there's an inflationary environment, then those costs are going to have to be passed through in some way, shape or form through to the consumer pricing, and we work very hard to do that. And so I think if you look around the world, you'll see that the bottlers are in good health. The bottlers are in good health, not just in the developed markets, but the bottlers in the emerging markets where there has been a history of higher inflation and even some of the ones where there's very high inflation currently, the bottlers are in good shape. And let me underline that the incidence model, the model that John talked about, was essentially invented in an environment of high inflation and was invented to help the system stay focused on the consumer and the retailers and creating value for everyone in times of high inflation and volatility. In a way, it was designed for exactly the sorts of situations we're in. So this is a muscle that is well developed in the Coke system, in the company and in the bottlers. And it has proven to be very effective in helping us stay focused on the marketplace and to work together to achieve what we need to achieve in terms of the brand investments, in terms of the RGM strategy and in terms of the marketplace investments. And that's why I think ultimately, both the company and the bottlers are in good shape post-COVID and good shape as we stand here at the middle of 2022. And so I think that's the most important thing. And then I think Swire was the right partner for Vietnam and Cambodia. And then obviously, we're left with very little of the global bottling system, predominantly some of the operations we own in India and then CCBA.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: So my question is actually on BODYARMOR. The outlook was slightly lowered today for both sales and profit. We've seen some normalization in scanner trends for the brand. So I wonder if you could just give a bit of a state of the union and again, some of the developments that you're seeing both on top line and bottom line for that specific offering.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Just to clear, we didn't provide any guidance for BODYARMOR itself. And clearly, we've been -- it's a great brand. It's high growth with strong innovation. It's done a great job of reinvigorating the advanced hydration and bringing people into the sports drink category. We are lapping some disruption in the category from last year, and that's obviously had some kind of effect on the comparisons. And I think we're in good shape. We're in the process of kind of fully connecting it to the Coke system and continuing to drive it forward and continuing to do what the brand needs to do and keep it true to itself. And as and when we've got international opportunities, we will address those over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Congrats on strong results. James, a question for you. You kind of touched on some of this, but maybe not directly. It's on your U.S. business and potential implications from some of the margin pressures we're seeing very publicly from large retail customers. So understanding those issues are more around general merchandise than grocery, but nevertheless, notable margin compression, which I'm sure cannot, should not go unnoticed by any large suppliers or anyone in the industry for that matter. Just comment on potential implications from your business in categories where you participate, whether this is potentially less ability to take price if it's called for, greater likelihood of demands on trade dollars. So the question is very specific. I do not ask you to be redundant because I think it was Lauren's question, you talked a little bit about pricing. But the question is very specifically on any fallout you may see from the margin pressure we're seeing at large retail customers in the U.S.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Look, whether it's the U.S. or other parts of the world, as retailers come under pressure from the consumers' wallet pullbacks, whether it's because they're losing purchasing power or they're reprioritizing their spend from something in that store to a different store, clearly, there will be pressure. And the way we approach it is to take a value creation point of view. Our idea is like, look, we're investing in our brands to create value for the consumers that the retailers can realize in their stores. And therefore, we've got to focus on making the category attractive to bring the consumers in, to generate value from those consumers to the retailers. And ideally, our category would grow faster than their average business, and they would do well out of it. Of course, we would like to see ourselves gain share within those category growth. So very much, we're focused on driving a growth story, a growth story that creates value for everyone who touches the business. If there's going to be a much more recessionary environment ahead of us, clearly, it's going to get difficult around. But as we sit here today, we've been able to drive growth, as I said, for the consumer, growth for the retailers. And I think that's what we bring to the table, which is creating something that's really working for them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research.\nBrett Cooper: Question for you on developed markets and price/mix. The place where we can see the best number is in North America. And your price/mix in 2Q or year-to-date is up more than 20% from 2019. In the off-premise data, we can see that 20-ounce is now selling for about $2 a bottle. So the question is whether the rapid rise in consumer prices requires a meaningful shift in package mix in order to try to hit key price points like you've done in other markets, in order to drive recruitment and retainment over the medium term? And then if you can just offer some color on how you can segment the market so that you don't generate trade down from what has been a profitable pack.\nJames Quincey: I mean we're getting right down into the -- some of the packaging stuff. Look, the price/mix, I think, is very important to try and disaggregate channel and category pricing changes. You alluded to something on the 20-ounce. I presume that was in a specific channel. And we very much are focused on driving not just, as I said, consumer value, but also we were going to take rate, but we do focus on, as we've talked about many times, retaining affordability whilst also looking for premiumization. And whether 1 pack is going up in price, then clearly, that's probably more of the premiumization strategy where the other packs will be looking to stay anchored in affordability, whether they be individual pack sizes or multipacks. And we use different pack sizes and different combinations of multipacks to move across the spectrum of what price point is going to work for which consumers. And therefore, the key in that dynamic is to increase the diversity of the packaging mix. It's almost impossible to segment and resegment the marketplace with only 1 or 2 package slices. So the important factor becomes the diversity in the number of packaging size or material options and the diversity of the multipack options. That's the dynamic that allows you to play across the spectrum of price points and elasticities. And so one going up. There's probably another one staying anchored that allows us to do the strategy. But I think the most important is the overall dynamic of using the diversification of the packages, the growth in the mini cans, the introduction of some smaller-sized PET bottles to be able to capture the whole kind of demand curve spectrum.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities.\nBill Chappell: Just kind of a follow-up on the pack sizes. I mean, one of the things you had said was you've benefited from country mix and, I guess, product mix, but not necessarily pack mix. And I would think that as the higher prices are being flowed through, maybe you have some acceleration to smaller pack sizes, which are higher margin? So I guess is that -- are you seeing any of that? And if not, if you're not seeing any trade down, is there any reason down the road in the back half if commodity prices come down, you would roll back any of these price increases? Or do you feel like, hey, there's no real elasticity. We're just going to hold the line here.\nJames Quincey: Okay. Let me try and unpack that a bit and start at the end. I commented earlier, we don't price to commodity spikes. So there are some commodities that shot up from January through to March and then come back down again. We didn't chase the commodity price up. Because we use a hedging program and long-term relationships, we have a lot of -- and many of our bottlers too, we have a smooth curve, if you like, on the pricing of commodities. So what's important there is the overall underlying trend in the commodity price, not the spot market. And so we haven't priced up. Now having said that, commodities -- the basket of commodities, particularly energy and some other ones, still is trending up and so are services and labor. So I don't think -- I don't foresee the total basket of imports, whether they'd be the sum of the commodities or the sum of the services and other imports, suddenly being in a deflationary environment. I mean, if you take the commodities and not the majority of the cost but the services and everything else, basically, for the price to have to roll back, we need the overall economy to enter deflation before it's even really a question, which does not seem the most likely scenario in the short term, certainly not on a global basis. So I think price rollbacks in that sense, seems very unlikely. I think we're much -- it's more likely that inflation softens, and therefore, the rate of increase can come down, but I don't foresee a big global deflationary burst at the moment. In terms of the -- I didn't mention pack mix as one of the mixed things. Well, clearly, a channel mix is intimately related to pack mix. So away-from-home rather -- versus at home, that being a positive mix effect for price is somewhat synonymous to we've got more IC packs, immediate consumption packs, than we have larger packs. And so the 2 -- they're not the same, but they are relatively correlated. So for example, in the U.S., the reopening has increased fountain, has increased smaller pack sizes as people travel. So pack size very much goal with channel mix, not the same, but there's a reasonably close correlation.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Great. Thanks very much, everyone. Clearly, we feel our second quarter exemplified the strength of our brands, the execution of our bottlers and the momentum in our business. We're pleased with the performance so far in the first half. We entered the second half with confidence that we can sustain value for the long run. And thanks for your interest, investment in the company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Quincey",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we delivered strong performance by continuing to execute on our growth strategy. Our industry remained robust, and we gained both volume and value share in the quarter. Our first half 2022 results and the resiliency of our business give us confidence to raise our top line guidance. This is offsetting the meaningful increases in costs and currency headwinds to hold our bottom line U.S. dollar outlook of 5% to 6% growth, even as we accelerate investments in our business to drive future growth. These results are enabled by our organization's purpose-led culture, strong alignment with our bottling partners and the dedication and flexibility of our people while driving our growth agenda. This morning, I'll discuss the current operating environment and how we're delivering results and building for the future in that environment and the progress on our sustainability agenda. Then John will discuss the financial details of the quarter and how we are building resilience to manage through external factors worldwide. During the second quarter, the operating environment continued to be asynchronous with many moving parts. Some regions continued to experience broad-based macro strength while others are experiencing strong inflationary pressures. Some countries are still recovering from the pandemic, while China experienced pandemic-related lockdowns. And the conflict in Ukraine is ongoing, and we'd like to send our thoughts and deepest sympathies to all of those who continue to be affected. With this as a backdrop, we have managed well with our bottlers and delivered robust revenue growth across all our geographic segments that encompass strong pricing actions and strong volume performance helped by away-from-home recovery. Consumer elasticities have largely held a better-than-expected year-to-date, though we are watching closely for signs of changing consumer behavior as the year goes on and as the average cost of the consumer basket continues to go up. We expect the consumer environment to be more challenging, and we are preparing accordingly, stepping up our investments, sharpening our resource allocation capabilities and tapping into data to better reach our consumers. We also recognize that the dollar strength is impacting our translated earnings, and we remain committed to delivering U.S. dollar growth. As a system, we are focusing on expanding the circumference of what we can control, understanding and providing what consumers want, ultimately giving them more reasons to choose our great brands and driving value for our consumers, our customers and the industry. Now recapping our Q2 performance across the world, starting with Asia Pacific. In India, we delivered our best-ever quarter volumetrically and added 1 billion incremental transactions in the quarter, led by affordable single-serve packs. We gained share in sparkling soft drinks and juices, and our system is continuing to invest in the marketplace availability and execution to capture growth. Japan made progress in recovery, and we gained share and consumers year-to-date versus 2019. Additionally, we gained 7 points of share of visible inventory, driven by coffee and Tea in the ambience base. We continue to have a strong innovation pipeline with the launch of Ayataka Hojicha Latte, non-alcohol Lemon-Dou, [indiscernible] and Georgia Latte Nista. Performance in China was under pressure, driven by COVID lockdowns. Volume was down for all months in the quarter, but the team persevered through a challenging environment, and recovery began in June as most restrictions started to lift. We focused on the core, prioritized top SKUs and reallocated resources to digital engagement, e-commerce and O2O as consumer demand shifted to at-home consumption. In ASEAN and South Pacific, macro fundamentals remained strong despite ongoing supply chain headwinds. We added new consumers, and transactions grew ahead of volume. We invested in consumer-facing marketing and improvement in execution and increased distribution across key entry packs and multipacks. Turning to EMEA. Europe saw strong volume performance, leading to value share gains across total NARTD and online. Strong marketing campaigns, including Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Zero Words, What The Fanta 3.0 and Sprite Screen Time Messaging are tying our beverages to more consumption occasions with better results. In Africa, we delivered strong performance and translated into NARTD volume and value share gains. We continue to focus on skills, affordability and in-market execution. Digital initiatives remained strong and grows merchandise value of our eB2B marketplace businesses were up approximately 50% sequentially. We accelerated cooler placement, reduced retail out of stocks and continued building RGM capability across markets. In Eurasia and Middle East, amidst an unprecedented inflationary environment, the industry is growing, and the recovery of the on-premise channel is driving our growth. Through the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour, we leveraged the iconic Coca-Cola trademark to generate significant media traction across the markets. Turning to North America. We gained both volume and value share through the strength of our brands despite navigating a challenging supply chain, including higher labor and freight costs. We continue to drive mix improvement in sparkling soft drinks and more than doubled mini can availability on this play. New product innovations, including Coke Starlight, Fanta Dragon Fruit Zero Sugar and Minute Maid Aguas Frescas are showing promising early results. We're continuing to work closely with our bottling partners to accelerate overall commercial execution. Turning to Latin America. We leverage compelling occasion-based marketing campaigns and execution in the marketplace, and our share losses improved sequentially. Coca-Cola trademark focus on building meals and brakes rituals under the Real Magic platform with returnable packages as the main enabler, while in juice and dairy, we're focused on everyday mills occasions. Our flavored alcohol beverage business is growing strongly. We're gaining share in the direct-to-consumer business and now reaching approximately 6.3 million consumers via digital channels. In Global Ventures, the cost of retail business was under pressure as footfall in the U.K. stayed below 2019 levels. However, the Costa Express platform remained robust, and the launch of the new Frappe range in the U.K. drove growth. Finally, our Bottling Investments Group delivered strong top line performance, driven by a focus on recruitment through affordable entry packs, including a relaunch of returnable glass bottles in India. Additionally, we saw continued sparkling soft drink share gains versus 2019 in the Philippines and Vietnam. While the macro environment is still asynchronous around the world, we're operating in an industry with a relatively predictable pattern of growth and attractive growth potential over the long term. So we're investing in our business and are anticipating the many futures as they come at us. We have managed a broad-based recovery coming out of the pandemic. Our 5-year average organic revenue growth rate is at the top end of our long-term growth target of 4% to 6%, which is a proof point of our transformed and strengthened organization. As we look to the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on raising the bar on the elements of our flywheels for top line growth and, as I said earlier, expand the circumference of what we can control, namely through building our strong portfolio of loved brands, excellence in revenue growth management and the power of our system execution. We're making targeted investments to unlock our growth agenda. We've built capabilities in brand building, innovation, RGM and execution, leveraging the power of scale while still being locally relevant to consumers. These investments enable us to win not only in today's environment but continue to build our business for the long term. Our new marketing model is focused on adding and retaining consumers. And we're doing this through an ecosystem of experiences that link consumption occasions with consumer passion points. The launch of the Global Magic Weekends campaign with Trademark Coke, in partnership with more than 20 food service aggregators, is showing great results. This campaign engages consumers at key moments from gaming to music to meal times. We are seeing 3.5x redemption levels for Coca-Cola combo meals versus pre-campaign levels and a 50% lift in outlets with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar availability. We also launched end-to-end digital-first brand campaigns for smartwater and vitaminwater, the snackable video content on social platforms for smartwater with global icon Zendaya and the launch of vitaminwater Lil Nas X partnership on TikTok is a different engagement approach to marketing that is already delivering strong results across channels. With new faces and new platforms for some of our billion-dollar brands, we are creating excitement and recruiting a new generation of drinkers. We continue to strengthen our RGM capabilities, which allows us to drive value for our consumers and our customers. RGM allows us to better navigate a dynamic consumer and retail environment, using effective tools such as price and promotional intelligence to leverage the power of our brands, proactive mix management and premiumization and addressing affordability to drive recruitment and keep value-conscious consumers. We work to bring these elements to life at a local level with our bottling partners. For example, in India, we focus on segmented pricing, increasing prices on multiserves and premium packs while holding transaction-driving price points in single-serve and the affordable portfolio. Additionally, we reached our highest-ever outlet availability and drove a 4-point increase in single-serve availability and a 6-point increase in affordable pack availability. In Europe, our system implemented several affordability and premiumization initiatives. We drove strong transaction and volume growth through initiatives like incentivizing multipacks to drive value on a price-per-ounce basis for consumers and driving single-serve packages like cans and returnable glass bottles in HORECA channels. By keeping transaction-driving price points in play, we expanded our consumer base with sparkling soft drinks in the region year-to-date. We're building consumer-centric loved brands and products, and our improving excellence in execution extends the building a more sustainable future for our business and the planet. During the quarter, we released our fourth World Without Waste Report, which provides an update on our ambitious sustainable packaging initiatives. It showcases how we are using our global reach and expertise to drive solutions at scale. Our operating units are further integrating sustainable practices into the business to drive growth. For example, in the United States, we are executing a set of initiatives to help solve the plastic waste problem. We recently joined industry groups, including the Consumer Goods Forum and the American Beverage Association, to support our model Extended Producer Responsibility Bill in Colorado. This is in addition to the support we provided for well-designed minimum-recycled content legislation in 3 states. These are now being enacted into law. Currently, 20-ounce bottles for Coca-Cola Trademark and The Summit in California, Texas, New York and throughout the Northeast are in 100% recycled PET. In 2021, we launched a bottled label clearly communicating that the bottles, excluding the caps and labels, are made from 100% recycled content, which is driving strong performance in the marketplace. Later this month, we will expand our use of 100% recycled PET throughout the U.S. and Canada. Every part of our business understands how their actions impact the company's wider sustainability goals, and we continue to make progress. To sum up, we are continuing to navigate a confluence of macroeconomic factors, and our networked organization is embracing the resilience to weather many environments. Guided by our purpose and with the right strategy through our portfolio and the right execution capabilities, we are confident about delivering top line growth for now and the long term. Before I turn the call over to John, I want to congratulate him for assuming the role of President beginning October 1, in addition to his current responsibility as a CFO. And of course, I also want to thank Brian Smith for his service and innumerable contributions to the system during his 25-year tenure with the company and wish him all the best for the future. So John, over to you. Yes, sure, Brian. Let me start off kind of by zooming out and then come back to the consumer and the uncertainty in the downhill. And that is -- in the end, it's going to be 2 ways underlining the kind of the relatively atypical point we are, given the end of COVID and the kind of post-COVID era. And where I'm going with that is to start by zooming out and saying, look, if you were to take a 3-year or a 5-year compound annual growth rate and look at the first half and what's implied in the second half guidance, you wouldn't see as much choppiness as you're seeing when you compare to prior year, and that's all related to COVID. In fact, if you take the 3-year or 5-year compound annual growth rate and look backwards and through the amazing roll coaster of volume and down and then up and price down then up, what you actually see is something simpler and more encouraging, which is that the volume has grown at 2 and a bit and the price has grown at 3 and a bit, whichever of those 2-time periods you've taken, so you net out at about 6. And so what you see over that long time period is the thesis we've been advancing, which is we've got an industry that grows at 4-ish percent. We are the leader that gain share with our portfolio, whether our RGM with our execution, and therefore, we can get to the top end of our long-term growth model. And if you zoom out, that's the kind of picture that you can see. And I would encourage people to not get too lost in the weeds to start with in trying to figure out the second half or even maybe the future and start with kind of starting from a macro position and saying like what does that look like when you kind of look through on a longer-term basis. And I think that will help people think about the downhill. The second thing I would say about those, we don't know how it's going to turn out. There's clearly a set of things going on and the net impact is difficult to predict in terms of the rest of the year. One, we've clearly, in some parts of the world, got a squeeze on purchasing power, and higher inflation is running ahead of wages. That's true in many places, U.S., Europe. It's not universally true. The inflation in China and Southeast Asia is only running at 3%. But there's clearly a big part of the world where there's a purchasing power squeeze. But at the same time, you've got relatively stable deposit balances. And you've got a big, very atypical reprioritization of spend occurring by consumers. And that's an important feature of how to see what the consumer is doing, because whilst there are a number of channels and categories where things look a little tougher in the short term. So if you're looking in grocery in the developed markets, if you're looking at some of the convenience channels in developed markets, you're seeing some pressure on consumers with less income, some early signs of trading down, depending on which category you're in, not necessarily in beverages yet. That's not to be -- that's to be expected. But then if you're in the away-from-home channels, the theme parks, the leisure parks, that sort of thing, travel, it's about as good as it's ever been. And so this post-COVID reprioritization of spend by consumers is layered over what feels like a squeeze on purchasing power. Whether it's a recession with peak employment is yet to be seen, but there's a kind of a standard process going on a squeezing purchase path, layered over with this weird or atypical consumer reprioritization post-COVID. How that's all going to net out in the second half and going into next year? There are a lot of opinions. I don't think anyone is going to know until we actually get there. But let me zoom back out again. The long picture is a stable sustained and accelerated momentum for the Coke system over a good number of years that we feel good about going into the downhill. Sure. I mean, firstly, we don't break out price/mix and volume in the downhill. I'm expecting it to be a balance. We clearly are expecting to get both volume growth and price/mix growth going into the downhill. I would just underline again partly the commentary I made on the last answer, which is the price/mix that you see in the year-to-date, some of that is rate increase, but actually, slightly more than half is mix, whether it's geographic or away-from-home recovering relative at home. So there are a couple of big profound effects going on. So you've got to lay it over that right with reopenings and shifts in countries and shift in channels, which are very important. But we're expecting a balance of volume and price into the downhill, not just because we continue to be biased towards investing for growth, but we are very focused on in an expected squeeze on purchasing power to anchor ourselves in affordability to keep focus through the brand investments, through the revenue growth management strategies to keep the entry price points for the categories and for the packages as low as we can to keep the consumer base. We've talked about this strategy before. It's one of our playbooks. It works for us. We believe it's very important to push ahead. Of course, we balance that out with a focus on premiumization opportunities, and it's what we're going to focus into as we go into the downhill. As I said, we have not yet experienced a very significant or a significant pullback from the consumer that's not surprising to us at this stage. If there were a recessionary environment or in some countries, 1 country, more countries, a typical recessionary pattern in past experience would be consumers initially stop buying high-ticket item, discretionary things. I'll replace the car later. I'll replace the mattress later. They then start saving on the lower ticket items and they trade down in categoies which have weaker leader brands and then eventually might hit the grocery categories with strong leader brands and the away-from-home. So we came to have some lead time going into some normal recession, we have not seen large effects of that yet, even though, as I said, you can see in some channels, in some countries, what looks like the beginnings of that process, it has not gone to us yet. But as I said in the beginning, the overlay from that, a reprioritization of spend which is, I think, confusing or making hard to read whether it truly is \u201cas normal recession\u201d or it's just a reprioritization of spend away from typical things into things I missed out on in the last couple of years. Yes. I mean, as you say, there's not a one size fits all. We've rather atypically got relatively high inflation in the U.S. and Europe with the kind of 8% to 10%, and there are emerging markets that are down at 3%. So it's not a normal time. We obviously have a lot of experience. I won't go over our RGM strategy and how we use that to manage through maintaining affordability. What you see -- and let me make a couple of points here. One, it's important to consider in the headline price/mix that we're reporting that a big component of price/mix in the first half is mix. Unusually, relative to the past and pre-COVID, mix is an important factor, both from a country point of view and from a channel point of view. And both are favoring reported price/mix at the moment. So underlying rate increases, if you like, are not as high as the price/mix number. And they are in the ballpark of slightly behind inflation. And the reason that -- and that's relatively typical as well. So that's not surprising to us because what we essentially try to do as -- firstly, as I commented before, is we don't want to get behind passing cost increases through. We don't want to arrive a recession with a big buildup of cost increases that has not gone through, but nor do we get ahead and anticipate inflation by pricing ahead of it. And so that the rates increases are kind of in the ballpark of inflation would be the normal expected kind of trajectory. And so what we're seeing is, yes, we've been passing through the commodity increases. Again, we don't price -- we don't pass through to the peak. We're not chasing the spot market. We are hedged on commodities. And so as the prices come up, clearly, we know when the hedges are going to roll off, and we need to pass through those. But the commodities are not the majority of the cost base. We've got a lot of service and other inputs, and we are seeing broader-based inflation than just commodities up and down. And so as those come through, we pass them through. And so we've passed a good bit through so far this year. We anticipate more cost increases will come through on a broad-based set of inputs. And we will continue locally in each country because it's very different. We will continue to pass those through. And what that's likely to look like in terms of rate is we'll kind of be at inflation or slightly behind headline inflation as it goes up with the layover of price/mix. Yes. I mean very much -- let me start by reading them. Our goals are to, on a continuous basis, strengthen the strategic position of the Coke Company and to deliver ultimately, when all said and done, increases in dollar EPS back to the shareholders. And so that is the North Star, and we've broken that out into all the strategies necessary to make that a reality. And that's what we're going to continue to pursue. Clearly, at the moment, we're focused on increasing our ability, both the resilience to face up to what could be yet further unexpected twists and turns in the coming months or even years, and adaptability. One of the features of the COVID crisis was the amount of learning that took place to be able to respond to the lockdowns. So the first lockdown was very painful. The second one, less so and onwards and onwards. And actually, in the second quarter, there was a considerable lockdown in China. China was negative in volume each month through the second quarter. And yet, we were able to both accommodate that and manage through it in China and mitigate it at a total company point of view. So bear in mind, Q2 had both the disappearance of the Russian business and a quite negative China business due to the lockdown. So this idea of focusing -- continuing to focus on the strategy that has been guiding us for the last number of years with a double-down on both resilience and adaptability, we feel, is going to give us the wherewithal to manage through the twists and turns that are yet ahead of us. Look, in preparing the guidance and thinking about our way forward, we've considered a whole number of potential scenarios. What we feel is -- the most likely is what we've reflected in the guidance. Clearly, there's a lot of uncertainty, which is why rather than having our operators focus on debating which scenario do they think is right, we said, \"Look, let's lean into growth.\" We've been growing coming out of last year. We're growing in each of the quarters this year. We're still growing. So let's maintain our bias to growth and keep going. And in the meantime, make sure that we're doubling down on resilience and adaptability for whatever is going to come. And that may end up being different by region in the world and by country in the world. Certainly, overall and in time as well, the recessions, if they arrive, generally are not completely the same everywhere. And so it's very much, we have a bias to growth and we're going to focus on resilience and adaptability. I think the fact that our businesses, in round numbers, half at home and half away from home, clearly, at the moment, is favorable. Clearly, it was a disadvantage at the height of COVID. Experience of recession says that we have a great business system that can see us through. Let me reinforce again, and when you zoom out and you think of all that's happened in the last 5 years, and you say, \"Well, what's the net number for the Coke system or the Coke Company?\" The organic revenue growth is, in round numbers, about 6%. And so we have seen our way through, and that's what we're focused on. Yes. I mean, look, the conversation in any given country on the pricing strategy is clearly a conversation where we're trying to bring some strategic start with the consumer, brand thinking, some RGM technology integrated with the way the bottles see RGM. We are both exposed to cost basis, yes, difference in nature. We both very much have the idea. The costs, ultimately, if there's an inflationary environment, then those costs are going to have to be passed through in some way, shape or form through to the consumer pricing, and we work very hard to do that. And so I think if you look around the world, you'll see that the bottlers are in good health. The bottlers are in good health, not just in the developed markets, but the bottlers in the emerging markets where there has been a history of higher inflation and even some of the ones where there's very high inflation currently, the bottlers are in good shape. And let me underline that the incidence model, the model that John talked about, was essentially invented in an environment of high inflation and was invented to help the system stay focused on the consumer and the retailers and creating value for everyone in times of high inflation and volatility. In a way, it was designed for exactly the sorts of situations we're in. So this is a muscle that is well developed in the Coke system, in the company and in the bottlers. And it has proven to be very effective in helping us stay focused on the marketplace and to work together to achieve what we need to achieve in terms of the brand investments, in terms of the RGM strategy and in terms of the marketplace investments. And that's why I think ultimately, both the company and the bottlers are in good shape post-COVID and good shape as we stand here at the middle of 2022. And so I think that's the most important thing. And then I think Swire was the right partner for Vietnam and Cambodia. And then obviously, we're left with very little of the global bottling system, predominantly some of the operations we own in India and then CCBA. Yes. Just to clear, we didn't provide any guidance for BODYARMOR itself. And clearly, we've been -- it's a great brand. It's high growth with strong innovation. It's done a great job of reinvigorating the advanced hydration and bringing people into the sports drink category. We are lapping some disruption in the category from last year, and that's obviously had some kind of effect on the comparisons. And I think we're in good shape. We're in the process of kind of fully connecting it to the Coke system and continuing to drive it forward and continuing to do what the brand needs to do and keep it true to itself. And as and when we've got international opportunities, we will address those over time. Yes. Look, whether it's the U.S. or other parts of the world, as retailers come under pressure from the consumers' wallet pullbacks, whether it's because they're losing purchasing power or they're reprioritizing their spend from something in that store to a different store, clearly, there will be pressure. And the way we approach it is to take a value creation point of view. Our idea is like, look, we're investing in our brands to create value for the consumers that the retailers can realize in their stores. And therefore, we've got to focus on making the category attractive to bring the consumers in, to generate value from those consumers to the retailers. And ideally, our category would grow faster than their average business, and they would do well out of it. Of course, we would like to see ourselves gain share within those category growth. So very much, we're focused on driving a growth story, a growth story that creates value for everyone who touches the business. If there's going to be a much more recessionary environment ahead of us, clearly, it's going to get difficult around. But as we sit here today, we've been able to drive growth, as I said, for the consumer, growth for the retailers. And I think that's what we bring to the table, which is creating something that's really working for them. I mean we're getting right down into the -- some of the packaging stuff. Look, the price/mix, I think, is very important to try and disaggregate channel and category pricing changes. You alluded to something on the 20-ounce. I presume that was in a specific channel. And we very much are focused on driving not just, as I said, consumer value, but also we were going to take rate, but we do focus on, as we've talked about many times, retaining affordability whilst also looking for premiumization. And whether 1 pack is going up in price, then clearly, that's probably more of the premiumization strategy where the other packs will be looking to stay anchored in affordability, whether they be individual pack sizes or multipacks. And we use different pack sizes and different combinations of multipacks to move across the spectrum of what price point is going to work for which consumers. And therefore, the key in that dynamic is to increase the diversity of the packaging mix. It's almost impossible to segment and resegment the marketplace with only 1 or 2 package slices. So the important factor becomes the diversity in the number of packaging size or material options and the diversity of the multipack options. That's the dynamic that allows you to play across the spectrum of price points and elasticities. And so one going up. There's probably another one staying anchored that allows us to do the strategy. But I think the most important is the overall dynamic of using the diversification of the packages, the growth in the mini cans, the introduction of some smaller-sized PET bottles to be able to capture the whole kind of demand curve spectrum. Okay. Let me try and unpack that a bit and start at the end. I commented earlier, we don't price to commodity spikes. So there are some commodities that shot up from January through to March and then come back down again. We didn't chase the commodity price up. Because we use a hedging program and long-term relationships, we have a lot of -- and many of our bottlers too, we have a smooth curve, if you like, on the pricing of commodities. So what's important there is the overall underlying trend in the commodity price, not the spot market. And so we haven't priced up. Now having said that, commodities -- the basket of commodities, particularly energy and some other ones, still is trending up and so are services and labor. So I don't think -- I don't foresee the total basket of imports, whether they'd be the sum of the commodities or the sum of the services and other imports, suddenly being in a deflationary environment. I mean, if you take the commodities and not the majority of the cost but the services and everything else, basically, for the price to have to roll back, we need the overall economy to enter deflation before it's even really a question, which does not seem the most likely scenario in the short term, certainly not on a global basis. So I think price rollbacks in that sense, seems very unlikely. I think we're much -- it's more likely that inflation softens, and therefore, the rate of increase can come down, but I don't foresee a big global deflationary burst at the moment. In terms of the -- I didn't mention pack mix as one of the mixed things. Well, clearly, a channel mix is intimately related to pack mix. So away-from-home rather -- versus at home, that being a positive mix effect for price is somewhat synonymous to we've got more IC packs, immediate consumption packs, than we have larger packs. And so the 2 -- they're not the same, but they are relatively correlated. So for example, in the U.S., the reopening has increased fountain, has increased smaller pack sizes as people travel. So pack size very much goal with channel mix, not the same, but there's a reasonably close correlation. Great. Thanks very much, everyone. Clearly, we feel our second quarter exemplified the strength of our brands, the execution of our bottlers and the momentum in our business. We're pleased with the performance so far in the first half. We entered the second half with confidence that we can sustain value for the long run. And thanks for your interest, investment in the company and for joining us this morning."

            "content": "Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I will briefly touch on the drivers of our second quarter performance and the update to our full year 2022 guidance, then I'll provide commentary on building resilience in our business by investing behind our brands and driving top line led growth. We're pleased with the continued momentum of our business around the world. This has translated into strong top line and comparable EPS growth, notwithstanding the larger-than-expected currency headwinds and increased cost pressures. We delivered organic revenue growth of 16%. Unit cases grew 8% with broad-based growth across all operating segments. Concentrate sales were behind unit cases by 4 points in the quarter, primarily due to the timing of shipments in Latin America and our Europe, Middle East and Africa Group. Our price/mix of 12% was primarily driven by strategic pricing actions across markets, along with revenue growth management initiatives, further improvement in away-from-home channels in most markets and positive segment mix. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 250 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to the impact of 3 items: one, an upsized increase in costs in the business due to the inflationary environment; two, currency headwinds driven by the volatile macro backdrop; and three, the mechanical effect of consolidating the BODYARMOR finished goods business. On the marketing front, we increased our consumer and customer-facing spending to create more value for our brands and continue to earn their respective price points. Despite increased investments and costs throughout the P&L, we expanded underlying operating margin by approximately 40 basis points, driven by a higher return from our investments in the marketplace. Comparable operating margin, however, compressed by approximately 110 basis points due to the BODYARMOR acquisition and currency headwinds. Putting this all together, second quarter comparable EPS of $0.70 grew 4% year-over-year. And this was impacted by 9 points of currency headwinds, 5 points higher than what we'd anticipated when we last gave guidance. On cash flow, we delivered free cash flow of $4.1 billion year-to-date, driven by our strong business performance. This was 20% lower versus the prior year, primarily due to 2 items: one, cycling the timing of working capital benefits in the prior year; and two, higher 2021 annual incentives paid in the first quarter. Additionally, our net debt leverage is 2.1x EBITDA, which is within the targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. As we look at the operating environment and the resilience consumers have shown thus far, we are watching closely for signs that indicate this may change. We remain ready to adapt. We're using a dynamic resource allocation framework to ensure our investments are directed towards country category combinations that drive the highest growth, thereby maximizing our returns. And we are working closely with our bottling partners to effectively navigate whatever comes our way. With this backdrop, this morning, we are raising our top line and currency-neutral EPS guidance. We now expect organic revenue growth of 12% to 13% and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 14% to 15% versus 2021. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now expect currency to be a 6-point headwind to comparable net revenues and a 9-point headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of 19.5% in 2022. And all in, we continue to expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus 2021. And we continue to expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow for 2022 through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. There are some considerations to keep in mind for 2022 that we factored into our guidance. While our shipments are currently behind unit cases, we expect these to run in line for the full year with the catch-up expected in the fourth quarter. We now expect that the direct impact of the Ukraine conflict and the resulting suspensions of business in Russia, will be approximately $0.03 to comparable EPS. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now expect commodity price inflation to move to a high single-digit impact from mid-single digits on comparable cost-of-goods sold in 2022. This is primarily due to commodity cost increases across our concentrate and finished goods businesses. Other costs, including wages, transportation, media and operating expenses, are also increasing and adding incremental pressures. The consolidation of the BODYARMOR finished goods business will continue to have a mechanical effect on margins, partially offset by the impact of refranchising our Vietnam and Cambodia bottling operations. And lastly, given the backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see an impact on our interest expense given our exposure to floating rate debt. As we enter the second half of the year, we continue to raise the bar in every aspect of how we do business. And we feel confident in our ability to effectively navigate this dynamic global environment and deliver on our updated guidance for 2022. Along with our bottling partners, we remain focused on the compelling growth opportunity our industry offers, and we are investing and creating flexibility in the business by taking actions on those things within our control. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions. Sure. Thanks, Steve. Yes, I think I mentioned in the script that as we look to the second half of the year, we look to continue the momentum that we have enjoyed year-to-date so far. And we're very focused on providing the resources to our markets and to our brands to continue to sustain that momentum. So the clear bias is to support the top line as we go forward. When I look at the overall cost base, there's a number of factors, I think, to take into account. As James highlighted, we do have broad-based increases across the board, not only on the core commodities but other inputs into our concentrate business. And we have -- we're taking on board inflationary increases in operating expenses and even our marketing expenses. We do have an ongoing focus on productivity, and there's a number of levers that we've discussed in the past. We have -- I think we've been able to leverage the scale of our network. We've been able to build, deepened even more strategic relationships with a number of our key supply partners across the world over the last couple of years, one of the benefits of COVID. And we're taking actions to simplify and streamline the way we do business. And so you can expect us to continue to drive productivity across the board. But the guidance that we've given this morning, I think, is reflective of the overarching bias to continue to invest to support the top line and to continue to take actions across the board to mitigate against those inflationary pressures that we're seeing in a number of key areas. Thanks, Andreas. So on the last point, I think as James highlighted, we're not seeing any significant changes on that front, so very much focused on continuing to drive the momentum. With regard to the whole topic of how we work with our bottling partners, as I think many of you on the call understand and appreciate, we have an economic model that is under-led by instance pricing. That pricing allows both of us to focus on growth in the marketplace and allows greater certainty as to what to expect from our activities in the marketplace. And as we work through periods of high growth, low growth, volatility, stability, the model doesn't change that much. It's what allows us to -- I think, to stay focused on delivering what we need to in whatever the context is. So not a -- there's not a lot to report out on changes. I think the model itself is actually what allows us to -- one of the reasons that allows us to continue to deliver on the opportunities that the industry has that we've talked about and allows us to continue to be optimistic about sustaining momentum."

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President of IR and FP&A. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.\nTim Leveridge: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our Chief Financial Officer. Note that we\u2019ve posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website at www.coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins. In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks this morning, we'll turn the call over for questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing one first and then re-enter the queue. Now I'll turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. First and foremost, on behalf of our company and our entire system, I'd like to share our deepest sympathies to all those who have been affected by what's happening in Ukraine. The safety of our people and their families continues to be our top priority. And as we highlighted in our release this morning, we are taking actions to provide that support. Now this morning, I'll discuss how we drove strong results in the quarter and that we are reiterating our guidance even in the face of incremental challenges. Then John will discuss the financial details of the quarter and how our work has prepared us for whatever may be around the corner. We all know that much has happened in the world since we last talked with you in February, leading, for sure, to an operating environment that is fast changing and increasingly complex. However, we remain confident about the future and are well equipped to manage external factors worldwide through our strengthened leadership position with the right portfolio, the right strategy and the right execution in the marketplace. After a promising start to the year, the operating environment soon changed with very significant geopolitical conflict, a resurgence of COVID in various places, record-high inflation and continued challenges on the supply chain front. Nonetheless, we've consistently sustained our momentum from last year, moving with agility as conditions changed to generate strong top and bottom line growth in the quarter. We delivered 8% unit case volume growth, primarily driven by strong recovery in away-from-home channels and continued growth in our home channels. Volume growth was strong across all operating segments, driven by marketing investments and aided by an increase in consumer mobility as the impact of the pandemic abated in most regions. Our enhanced capabilities helped us gain value share overall in both at-home and away-from-home channels globally and across most of our geographic operating segments, a clear indicator of the power of our new approach. Amidst the dynamic macro conditions and an inflationary cost backdrop, we focused on delivering growth. The key competitive edge of The Coca-Cola system continues to be the ability to deliver value for our consumers and our customers in any environment. Our accelerated agenda in marketing and innovation is tying our beverages to daily consumption occasions, adding and creating value for our brands. Additionally, we continue to work with our bottling partners to expand package offerings and strengthen distribution to capture growth opportunities, using all the available revenue growth management levers, including price, to win in the marketplace. These scaled global initiatives are coming to life at a local level all around the world. So let's start with Asia Pacific. In India, we drove excellence in integrated execution as consumer mobility improved across channels by stepping up product availability, adding approximately 240,000 outlets and over 50,000 coolers. We also continue to build relevance through innovation by launching Maaza Aam Panna to leverage our equity in Mango and Fanta Apple to expand our footprint in the fast-growing fruit-flavored sparkling subcategory. Japan is emerging from its extended state of emergency, and we've increased our consumer base and driven market share gains in key categories. The Coke ON app reached 35 million app downloads, continuing the direct engagement with consumers to create and capture value. We also continued our focus on ESG initiatives with 100% recycled PET bottles now available in Japan for 5 key brands, including Coke and Georgia Coffee. In China, a strong start in January, led by an excellent Chinese New Year brand activation with Coke, was followed by strict COVID lockdowns, and this resulted in reduced consumer mobility. Momentum reversed in February and March and led to a decline in unit case volume during the quarter. We're moving fast to focus on core SKUs and ensure product availability. We're adapting how we engage with consumers depending upon local market conditions, and we're working in close collaboration with our bottling partners to focus on execution basics like increasing multipack availability and maximizing share of visible inventory in channels and regions that are open. In ASEAN and South Pacific, we gained share in key countries and across most categories, while consumer mobility was mixed and supply chain headwinds remained. Growth was led by Trademark Coke and sparkling flavors, driven by strong end-to-end execution of the [Zero Words] (ph), Sprite Heat Happens and the Fanta Colorful People brand campaigns. In EMEA, notwithstanding the conflict in Ukraine and an uptick in inflation, we delivered a strong performance in Europe in the quarter. The continued rollout of new and improved Coca-Cola Zero Sugar across key markets helped drive 5 percentage points of sparkling single-serve mix growth, which is ahead of pre-pandemic levels. Topo Chico Hard Seltzer is closing the gap with the #1 hard seltzer brand in Europe, and the eB2B business with myccep.com accounted for low double-digit contribution to total revenue. We are keeping a close watch on the spillover reflex of the conflict in Ukraine on the health of the consumer, and we remain ready to pivot and adapt. In Africa, macroeconomic recovery is underway, although conditions remain challenging due to inflationary pressure. In South Africa, we accelerated refillable PET expansion and the execution of in-store sampling to retain consumers. We are connecting with our existing customers in the digital space and have surpassed 65,000 outlets on the Wabi eB2B platform, significantly ahead of plan. Despite macro volatility and intense inflation in the region, Eurasia and Middle East drove top line growth through a strong suite of marketing programs across categories, led by sparkling and ready-to-drink tea. In Turkey, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar became the #2 immediate consumption player in value share behind brand Coke. In Pakistan, Coke Studio, a platform that unites diverse cultures through the power of music, drove social engagement that reached an all-time high in terms of impressions and viewings. In North America, we are seeing more inflation and continue to navigate supply chain dynamics. We're closely monitoring further pressure in some inputs such as high fructose corn syrup, PET and metals, along with wages and transportation as they impact us as well as our bottling partners. Despite these challenges, we continue to gain share in both at-home and away-from-home channels and across most categories. The strong rollout of Real Magic platform and the successful launch of Coke Starlight resulted in Coke Trademark being the fastest-growing trademark in measured retail, driving household penetration up a full point. Powerade [posed its power] (ph) launch during NCAA March Madness, generating more than 1 billion impressions. We also continue to learn from the returnable glass-bottled pilot that has been implemented in the Southwest. In Latin America, we delivered strong performance despite challenging macro conditions, and the investments we made to sustain momentum are paying off. We remain focused on integrated execution and drove revenue growth faster than transaction growth, both of which grew faster than unit case volume growth. Our work to strengthen the traditional trade is paying off as the channel showed the best underlying performance across all channels. The Prospera loyalty program added nearly 50,000 retailers in the quarter while continuing to advance our customer-focused digital expansion. Notably, we have digitized nearly 2 million customers in the region, and we are leveraging the strong system alignment with our bottling partners and are continuing to execute for growth. Within Global Ventures, despite an inflationary backdrop in the UK, Costa continued to recover driven by retail and strong like-for-like sales with Costa Express. In China, while retail sales were impacted by store closures due to the pandemic, Costa ready-to-drink coffee sustained its #2 position and continue to innovate with Costa chart. Finally, our Bottling Investments Group delivered strong Q1 performance, driven by the expansion of affordable immediate consumption entry packs in key markets, and this resulted in share gains in sparkling. We also continue to make progress towards optimizing trade promotions and cost to serve in our key markets and raise the bar on operational excellence. Clearly, the operating environment has proven to be more challenging, but we're pleased with the results we delivered in the first quarter. We continue to believe the recovery in 2022 will be asynchronous. We anticipate many new chapters and challenges, including, but not limited to, ongoing geopolitical conflict; uncertain consumer sentiment amidst the increasingly inflationary environment, accelerated cost pressures and ongoing supply challenges; and of course, continued evolution of pandemic. That said, the changes we have made during the pandemic have left us better positioned than ever to capture growth, increasing our confidence in the future. The multiple levers of revenue growth management have never been more important, and our investments in building this capability over the past few years are giving us a clear advantage. Further actions on pricing will depend on the consumer and inflationary environment as the year progresses, but we will continue to rely on a mix of price, package differentiation and ever-sharper promotional strategies. Through integrated RGM and execution capabilities, we adapt to local market conditions and give consumers what they want, where they want it and at the right price. By extending package offerings to keep transaction driving price points in play, we retain consumers through affordability while also driving premiumization with innovation and targeted pricing. For example, in Latin America, we are continuing the expansion of refillables to sparkling flavors and juices, and this remains a compelling consumer proposition to address the need for affordability. In North America, we're maximizing value by initiatives like the one expanding the availability of mini cans for consumption across occasions such as breaks and meals and by offering 6 packs, 10 packs and 30 packs, driving an approximate 45% increase in retail dollars in measured channels and their near-20% increase in total distribution points. Our networked organization structure extends to our system. Our bottling partners complement our progress against our capabilities by continuing to invest in the marketplace, and they help put our purpose into action. We have strong partners with highly capable and experienced leadership, and we continue to build and foster our business and each in our relationship that drive system health and long-term growth opportunities. With our purpose to refresh the world to make a difference, we continue to focus our ESG work on issues where we can have a measurable positive impact on communities as well as create opportunities for our business to grow. We release our fourth combined business and ESG report tomorrow, an integrated approach to reporting that is a strong demonstration of how sustainability is linked to our business, builds resilience and demonstrates transparency. We have a long history of assuring select sustainability metrics while also providing key public disclosures against the TCFD recommendations as well as other reporting frameworks such as SASB, GRI and the UN Global Compact. In the report, we highlight how we and our bottling partners are driving business growth through our interconnected ESG goals and how we continue to seek an exponentially greater impact by fostering collective action, partnering across industry, government and society to address shared challenges. In conclusion, while there is no doubt the world is more uncertain and the operating environment remains highly dynamic, our strategy remains the same: to execute for sustainable growth through strengthened capabilities in innovation, marketing, RGM and execution. Now I'll turn the call over to John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll highlight our first quarter performance and discuss our full year 2022 earnings guidance; then I'll provide commentary on the overall operating environment and how our organization is navigating effectively to drive results. Let me first start by saying how pleased we are with the results in the first quarter. We delivered strong organic revenue growth of 18%; unit cases grew 8%, with strong growth across all operating segments; concentrate sales were ahead of unit cases by 3 points in the quarter, primarily due to the timing of shipments in Latin America and EMEA. Our price/mix of 7% was driven by strategic pricing, revenue growth management initiatives, further improvement in away-from-home channels in most markets and positive segment mix. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 90 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to the impact of 2 items: one, consolidating the BODYARMOR; and two, currency headwinds. Underlying gross margin expanded despite continued pressure from commodity costs, due to pricing actions in the market and a benefit from the timing of concentrate shipments. We continue to prioritize consumer-facing marketing to maximize returns while driving productivity in our operating costs leading to leverage in the P&L. Comparable operating margin expanded by approximately 50 basis points despite acquisition and currency headwinds. First quarter comparable EPS of $0.64 grew 16% year-over-year. This was driven by strong top line growth which benefited from the timing of concentrate shipments and operating margin improvements, partially offset by currency and cost headwinds. On the cash flow front, we delivered free cash flow of approximately $400 million in the first quarter as our strong business performance was more than offset primarily by 2 items: one, cycling the timing of working capital benefits in the prior year; and two, higher 2021 annual incentives paid in the first quarter. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our cash flow goals for the full year. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, with net debt leverage within our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. As James mentioned, much has happened since we last gave guidance in February. The conflict in Ukraine has created further volatility in the world as well as added to the inflationary backdrop and impacted the currency market. The resurgence of COVID in China and some other geographies around the world is a clear indication that the pandemic is still very much a part of the conversation, and a reminder that the recovery path has been and will continue to be asynchronous. Obviously, there are lots of puts and takes at play, and we see a number of potential futures coming at us. But notwithstanding this backdrop, we believe our organization is better prepared today, and we're confident in the flexibility we've built and our ability to manage what's around the corner. We continue to spin the growth flywheels faster, and our local businesses are adapting and executing for growth. With that in mind, this morning, we are reiterating our guidance for 2022. We continue to expect organic revenue growth of approximately 7% to 8% and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share guidance of 8% to 10% growth versus 2021. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we are reiterating our currency outlook of a 2- to 3-point currency headwinds to comparable net revenues and a 3- to 4-point currency headwinds to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. Additionally, taking into account our current understanding of recently issued regulations, we now expect an effective tax rate of 19.5% in 2022 versus the 20% that we had guided to previously. All in, we continue to expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus 2021. And we continue to expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow for 2022 through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. To put this guidance in context, there are some considerations to keep in mind for 2022. The direct impact of the Ukraine conflict and the resulting suspension of business in Russia is estimated to be approximately $0.04 to comparable EPS. The recent increases in commodity costs are having an incremental effect. But based on current rates and hedge positions, we expect the commodity price inflation to remain in the range of mid-single digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2022. Additionally, we see incremental cost pressure coming from areas like wages and transportation. The consolidation of the BODYARMOR finished goods business will continue to have a mechanical effect on margins. When it comes to capital allocation, our priorities remain the same, and we continue to balance financial flexibility with efficient capital structure. For 2022, we announced a dividend increase of 5%, a higher rate than in recent years; and we also announced the resumption of share repurchases with approximately $500 million in net share repurchases expected this year. Despite uncertainties around the world, our strategic transformation has fortified the organization to weather the storm, and we are extremely proud of how our people are responding and delivering. We are keeping consumers at the center, operating more effectively and efficiently and unlocking the immense potential of our growth portfolio of brands. This gives us confidence that we can deliver on our guidance for 2022. And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: I was hoping we could talk a little bit more about Latin America, an area like you called out about performance, in particular, Mexico and Brazil this quarter. And I had sort of 2 sets of questions. One is this is a region where your partnership with bottling has been particularly strong certainly versus the past. And if you could talk a little bit about how that may be enabling your ability to be performing as well as you are in this challenging time. So that's kind of one. And then two was there was a mention in the release about shares being down. It looked -- I'm guessing it might be in juice because I think you talked about sparkling being up, but anything in particular you're doing or the degree to which the market share performance is an area, a watch point for you and how you're balancing that versus thinking about recovering cost inflation.\nJames Quincey: Yes. There was -- I think we'll call that several questions.\nLauren Lieberman: I never do it, though. So I'm sorry. It's the first time.\nJames Quincey: Okay. We'll be -- in the spirit of generosity, we'll try and -- because they're very related. Look, we have a great partnership with our bottlers in Latin America from the 2 very big ones. Coke FEMSA, Arca Continental, through Andina and some of the more country-based bottlers. And we have developed collectively the system, many capabilities on many fronts, whether it be marketing automation, but particularly, the levers of revenue growth management and execution in volatile times. It escapes no one's attention that Latin America was a place that has had a rollercoaster of economic growth and inflation and difficulties. And we have a very deep partnership with these bottlers to work through these times. And that, I think, you see reflected in this quarter as we had a lot of good growth. The share did come in negative overall. I think there's a couple of things going on there. As you say, we did a lot better in sparkling, a lot of good execution in sparkling. And there was some pressure as much in juice or some of the juice drink categories, but also category mix. We are very much focused on, as we've talked about previously that when you are in a cost environment, that those cost increases, whether it be commodities or wages or logistics or marketing costs, need to go through over time. We have to earn the right for the brands to take if they need to go through. Sometimes when you're in a very high share market like Latin America and you lead on pricing, not all competitors necessarily follow immediately, and that can have temporary impacts on share. But we, with the bottlers, will be very focused on not only continuing to carry on growing, but to regain and expand our share position.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: So I just want to focus on top line visibility here. You obviously kept the full year top line guidance despite the Russia impact. So underlying sales are moving up ex Russia, and Q1 was another strong quarter. But clearly, there's risk consumer spending might weaken with the unprecedented inflation we're seeing. So first, maybe just looking backwards, can you give us an update on if you're seeing any signs of consumer stress in terms of impact on your business or pushback to higher pricing around the world, either late in Q1 or in April? And then also on a go-forward basis, can you juxtapose the positive impact of normalization of COVID behavior on your business as away-from-home recovers maybe versus any potential macro pressure you could see or consumer spending weakness? And how that impacts your visibility in terms of full year top line view?\nJames Quincey: Well, clearly, my active generosity, Lauren has unleashed a torrent of multi-question questions, but it would be harsh to cut it off at this stage, Dara. Look, a couple of things. We did come in with strong momentum out of 2021 and coming to this year. And as I and John and we talked about previously on calls, we believe that pricing for our business has to be earned for the brands. We have to give the consumer and the retailer reason for the price increase and for the value of our brands, whether it's the marketing, the innovation, the execution or the packaging options, we do that. It's not a cost-plus business, although we do seek, of course, to protect the margin structure by moving through changes in commodities and other costs.  But we very much foresee as experience and history -- who was it? Mark Twain said, history doesn't repeat itself, it just rhymes. But when you go into high inflation, consumers come under pressure. There's clearly reductions in real purchasing power going on for some segments of the population, if not everyone around the world. And so our focus is very much to find those packaging and price options by channel where we can stay connected to people who are coming under purchasing power pressure, very much the affordability just building on the Latin America example for the last question; a lot of focus on returnable, refillable bottles because the economics of those packages work to an extent that you can have a lower price point for the package. And with reductions in purchasing power, we very much see the actual out-of-pocket price point and keeping a low entry point into the category is very important, also pushing the expansion of refillables in places like South Africa. So very much acting on the signs of consumer purchasing power pressure, but very much also anticipating that it will increase. It would be great if there were a perfect landing out of this inflationary environment. The rhyme of history would tell you that at some point, either inflation or reduction in purchasing power or supply constraints eventually create a bump. And at that point, we will want to both be accessing the premium opportunities that have but very much with an anchor in the affordability and entry price point opportunities and necessities as consumers come under pressure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: When I think about -- just the approach to capital allocation and business reinvestment, as you talked about it in the prepared remarks, you framed it as essentially unchanged as a framework. But with all the variability you called out in the operating environment, I guess I'm curious as to where there are areas of your going in plans where maybe you pulled back a bit versus other areas where you found yourself now leading in more? Maybe James, to your answer to the last question, maybe it's affordability or something like that. But just again, overall all spending as you framed it and as the guidance implies seems intact but my sense is it's moving around a lot under the cover. So just I'm curious how that kind of agility is manifesting in terms of reallocations of spend.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Steve, it's John. Let me first just lay the picture of total capital allocation. The first priority is to invest in the business. And as we -- as James just said, when you think about the environment that we're -- we have been dealing in and we will be dealing with the rest of the year, the name of the game right now is to do exactly that is to continue to invest in our brands so that we have the wherewithal to manage through whatever comes at us. I think at a local level, the mix of investments is something that we continue to be very flexible with. And we are leveraging the work that we have been doing over the last couple of years to be even more effective in how we're spending our marketing dollars, whether it's on building our brands or whether it's on supporting our RGM efforts in the marketplace. The other areas of our capital allocation framework, supporting the dividend, looking at opportunistic M&A and share repurchase, we covered in the script with the dividend and share repurchase, we continue to be very open as to what opportunities may be out there. But in the here and now, the top priority is investing appropriately in the business. And as I say, the mix of that investment is something that varies and will continue to vary depending on what we need to do locally.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: I had just a big picture question about how you're working with your bottlers who are experiencing pretty sharp cost pressures to essentially help them navigate through this tough environment, if you guys could talk about that. And also looking at the equity income in the quarter, it remained relatively strong, but is the expectation going forward that there will be a greater impact in the next couple of quarters, given some of these pressures?\nJames Quincey: Yes. Sure, Bonnie. I mean I'm not sure it would be appropriate to comment on equity income into the future for our bottling partners. But as we go into a tough environment, as we always do historically, we make sure that we intensify our collaboration and partnership with our bottlers, both to work on what are the marketing programs and the innovation programs that are going to work in the consumer and the retail environment that we face wherever we are in the world, and also the execution initiatives and focus areas that bottlers can drive on. Because firstly, the environment is not the same in every country around the world. Some are opening up exuberantly and actually chasing and keeping up with demand and the kind of the reopening euphoria, all the way across the spectrum to parts of China like Shanghai, which is in full lockdown as though it were April 2020. So the environment is absolutely not the same in every country, and we have to work where on the curve of all the change, are we and be very clear. And in terms of the pressures, you talked about it, the pressure is both headwind and tailwind. Clearly, there are headwinds in terms of cost, whether it be commodities, logistics, wages. And as I said earlier in one of the questions, we work with our system, our bottling partners, to make sure we protect and sustain the margin structure over time. That's not necessarily true every single quarter, but that is our overall objective: earning the right to price the brands so that the system has the sort of margin structure and stability of that over the course of time, if not every single quarter. But there are headwinds there. Balancing those headwinds, there are tailwinds out there, as I said. The reopenings provide fuel not just for overall demand, but improvements in channels, away-from-home channels where we're strong and leaning in with investment produces great results. So this is -- there's a lot of variables at play in the downhill of the year and really just the key is the intense partnership with our bottlers to make the most of the opportunity ahead of us and to prepare ourselves for step 2 and step 3 further down the road.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: James, I wanted to just circle back to the comments you made in the prepared remarks about ESG and, I guess, tying it to comp. If I understood the proxy correctly, there\u2019s been 2 changes. One is the ESG component now being a portion of both the annual and long-term comp. I think it moves to 10%. And then also for your annual long-term incentive comp, the amount that's paid out in stock options, I think, goes up from like 1/3 to 1/2. So just wanted to sort of get your perspective on why make those changes now? And just what it signals about your focus going forward?\nJames Quincey: Yes. Thanks, Bryan. Yes, I mean, firstly, we'd refer everyone who wants a greater depth to the proxy that's out there on our website, and we've tried to lay out some of the mechanics and our thinking behind the 2. We have made some changes, as you point out, Bryan, to the way the long-term incentives or more specifically, the performance share units, which are kind of a 3-year program. We've got a 10% element in that that's linked to our ESG goals. And so we are laying out some very specific targets that will drive a portion of those payouts. And because some of those ESG objectives take some time to execute against, we felt they were better embedded into the 3-year stock award programs. And then secondly, as you point out, with the Board and with the Compensation Committee, we felt to increase greater alignment with shareowners. We would readjust the balance of performance share units versus options for myself and push that up to 50%. I mean you can take that as a confidence in the future, but that's one very small stone on the large pile of stones of things we do to demonstrate that we believe this is a great company with a great future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets.\nFilippo Falorni: This is Filippo Falorni on for Nick. My question is on pricing. Clearly, price realization has been very strong in the carbonated soft drink category and particularly North America with a very rational environment in the industry and pretty low elasticity so far. So can you comment how you balance the need to take pricing while ensuring affordability using price/pack architecture, your revenue growth management, given this inflationary environment, the impact on consumer wallets in North America and in other parts of the world? And then secondly, if you think you will see more promotional activity in the industry in the balance of the year.\nJames Quincey: I mean our approach to pricing, I've commented a little bit on it already. Firstly, the highest level principle is the brand has to earn the right for pricing. And that is the combination of its activities in marketing, in innovation, in execution and the investments in the store and of course, in RGM to make the packaging and pricing architecture fit the consumers' needs. Obviously, what goes into a piece of that puzzle is also the cost environment, whether that be commodities, marketing, logistics, et cetera, et cetera. And we seek to balance the various challenges using RGM. As I said earlier, clearly, as we go into reducing consumer purchasing power, we need to have affordability as front and center, and depending on where you are in the world, can take the shape of different packaging but it all becomes about the entry price point to the category, not the kind of the higher-end price towards the category. But you balance that out by having -- moving up the price points on other package combinations. It all has to go in the mix. And it is all done with a perspective that not necessarily every single day, but in a reasonable time frame, the margin structure of the system needs to be sustained. You definitely don't want to get to a point where there's been a substantial cost push through, and that has not yet been passed on into the marketplace when any recessionary impact appears. Trying to catch up on pricing in a recessionary environment is very hard. And so we have a bias to action. In the same way, we have a bias to invest behind our brands in marketing innovation. We have a bias to keep up with cost pressures as they occur. And that, of course, leads us to take pricing more or less frequently depending on where you are in the world, and I expect to see more of that in the rest of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: This should be a quick one and a single question. Is there any update on the tax litigation matter perhaps? Maybe not just on your end, but some of the other moving parts, I suppose, on what needs to happen there beforehand.\nJohn Murphy: Quick answer. No updates -- no developments during the quarter. We'll keep you posted as they happen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos Laboy from HSBC.\nCarlos Laboy: I was hoping you could give us an update on some of the stepped-up efforts on -- for renewable -- for refillable packages in Latin America and how that's going, please?\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. Thanks, Carlos. Clearly, as part of both our RGM initiatives, because the refillable, reusable packages tend to give you the opportunity especially in larger sizes, have a lower entry price point, which is particularly useful in developing and emerging markets. And so you have an intersection of a very important business imperative on affordability and the fact that ultimately, a refillable package is less likely to go to waste and has a lower carbon footprint. And so it really complements our world without waste ESG strategy where we're looking to create a circular economy around our packaging material. So the 2 intersect and give us 2 imperatives at both point in the same direction. And so we're very much looking to invest behind refillable packaging, making progress in gaining in mix in Latin America, also been driving that in parts of Africa. We've even taken to experimenting with returnable glass in the Southwest of the U.S. And so we are very focused on this because it does work for both of these imperatives, and so expect to see kind of more focus and more investment behind keeping that up and working with retailers to make it simple for the consumers to get the credits when they return these reusable bottles. So very much an investment focus.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira : James, just to conclude on pricing, you mentioned that you continue to monitor further inflation pressures and also alluded to potentially further pricing. Are you seeing -- I'm assuming you're seeing better-than-anticipated price elasticity. Do you see room for additional pricing perhaps in developed markets and in particular in certain clusters in the U.S.? And if not, any flexibility to protect the bottom line with SG&A efficiencies that you can highlight at this point?\nJames Quincey: Well, clearly, I mean, I've talked about our approach to pricing several times. And that is going to lead to more -- I mean there are going to be more price increases depending on where you are in. I mean there are countries with inflation well into double digits. And you do see multiple price increases during the year, as a matter, of course, when you're in those sorts of circumstances, with cost pressures to push through as you seek to sustain margins over time. Let me just address the elasticity question. It has been apparent, and other people have commented on less elasticity in recent times as price increases have gone through. I do not expect elasticities to be inelastic going forward. There's a reason you got the name elasticity. And so I fully expect, as I commented earlier on, inflation generally ends with some pressure somewhere. I expect elasticity to increase at some point in the future. Will that be next quarter? Or will that be next year? I can't give you the answer to that because it's very dependent on some macros, and it's probably going to vary by country. But we are very attuned to it, which is why I talked about how we are leaning into investing behind our brands so that we earn the right for the price increases, so that we can minimize the elasticity and that we keep a sharp eye on affordability, which again tends to minimize elasticity if we use RGM well. But as I say, if the choice comes down to, we think the elasticity is going up or we're going to have to not pass through some cost, we're going to err towards taking the price increase rather than not taking the price increase. As I said earlier, not seeing the cost go through and arriving at a recession being behind the curve is less desirable than embarking and having to take the hit from a greater elasticity in the short term. And so that's our kind of modus operandi, and we will certainly seek to earn the right to take the price increases. We certainly aren't looking to take price increases just because we can. We want to earn them as a brand, and we want to make sure we recover the cost over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore.\nRob Ottenstein : James, in the opening comments, you mentioned that you had digitally connected, I believe, with 2 million customers in Latin America. Can you elaborate on what that allows you to do? What that means, the upside there? What you're seeing in the market from that and how you expect to or how you plan to roll that out globally?\nJames Quincey: Yes. Thanks, Robert. This is a very important area for us and our bottling partners. Simply put, the idea of connecting these customers is essentially that our retailers, particularly the traditional trade and the fragmented trade, remembering that on a global basis, about half of our sales go to the fragmented trade, whether that's from grocery side or fragmented in terms of being away-from-home and [eatery], so about half of the global sales go to that, is being able -- that they can order the Cokes they need or the rest of the portfolio that they need, they don't have to necessarily wait for the salesperson to turn up. This isn't about replacing the salesperson, very far from it. This is about enabling the selling system to be even more effective in that being able to connect with the retailers, generate orders. And so very much it's about sales force enablement system, such that in the same way that consumers in the developed world can just use their phones to -- with whatever system, with whatever app is appropriate to order things, and they don't have to go to the store to get them.  We see that the bottling system will be able to sell more and very much in the -- where we've implemented these systems, where it's a complement to the sales force, it has driven extra sales and driven retailer loyalty. And so we think we can see -- and obviously, we're very much engaged with the bottling partners to drive the connectivity, particularly for the fragmented trade so that they could order whatever they want, whenever they want from the Coke portfolio. And that's as true in the rollout, as you called out in Latin America. Myccep.com is the same basic idea. It's all about technologically enabling the selling system to be more effective for the retailers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Laurent Grandet from Guggenheim.\nLaurent Grandet: I'd like to come back to the progress of Costa Cafe. I mean, it was mentioned in your prepared remark, I mean Coffee was up 27%. But some of it was -- of that growth was coming from cycling in the Costa store closures. Could you expand maybe more on the non-store business progress? Hot and cold, where are you expanding the brand, which countries? And what are you seeing in terms of consumer reaction?\nJames Quincey: Yes. Laurent, looking at the non-retail business of Costa, the Express machines, the kind of vending digital barista machine had a very strong quarter with transactions growing strongly, and we're starting -- and we're seeing -- now that reopenings have occurred, we're starting to see the focus on placement of new machines across Europe and the Middle East; and also in China, although that's got a little harder in the last couple of months. But the Express machine is still doing very well. Obviously, they need the opening of the world to happen. And then on the Proud to Serve front, which is kind of providing the beans and machines to independent outlets, starting to ramp that up more in the Europe.  Europe environment, again, early days. We did launch some tests in at-home. That's too early to kind of call. And then Costa ready-to-drink has done pretty well in China. It's sustained its #2 position. It's continuing to grow, and we've launched it also in some of the European markets. So starting to see those innovations roll out, and we'll see how they do in the coming quarters.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: James, I wanted to pivot to your business in China, given the uptick in COVID cases there and related lockdown measures. Perhaps you could just comment on one, what you're seeing from a demand perspective; two, perhaps the exit rate for March and what you're seeing in April; and then three, maybe just more broadly, the company's ability to better execute in your view, despite lower levels of consumer mobility now over 2 years into the pandemic?\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. I mean, clearly, China is an important market to us. As I said in the script, we had a strong start to the year going into Chinese New Year. But the lockdowns, particularly Shanghai, took the steam out of things, and we ended the quarter negative. It's -- the key factor will be the degree of mobility. And we had -- and depending on how big that is will make a huge difference to the level of results. I don't think there's anything to call from the early days of April that's different to what was happening at the back end of March. The lockdowns, as you can read in the newspapers, are still in full force, so to speak, in those cities where they're locking down. And I think that's going to remain the biggest factor. Of course, we're going to focus on what we can control. We certainly had 2 years of trying to look at what that looked like over the last couple of years, and we'll continue to build on those learnings and the playbook that we had and adapt as necessary. It's a little difficult to predict exactly what it's going to look like, but we feel -- said a different way, we feel better prepared and more resilient for the COVID journey of 2022 in China than we did in 2020.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities..\nChris Carey : So actually, following up a bit on the prior question, but more globally. John said in the prepared remarks, there was improvement away-from-home channel in most markets, but not all. I appreciate Asia Pacific will have specific impacts in the quarter, as just noted. But I wonder if you could just give us a sense of the progression of the away-from-home channel recovery globally, perhaps relative to 2019? And if you have any context on total company or key region, that would be helpful. Really underlying the question here is just a sense of the current state of the channel as we all contemplate prospects of slowing global growth and how the company will manage through any reversal back of the away-from-home with levers at its disposal.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean, firstly on -- firstly, let me step back both. The away-from-home channels, whilst we have recovered to our 2019 levels, the away-from-home channels have not yet fully recovered. And in part, the -- and we -- I think I've talked about this on previous call, we've lost outlets in the course of the pandemic. That's true of the away-from-home, and that's also true of the fragmented grocery trades. And so there has been an impact on the number of outlets. It's not fully back. Of course, there is a distinction by sub-channel with away-from-home, particularly QSR has done well, particularly those with digital and drive-through have done well. So the away-from-home channel, even in a country, can't be considered as a thing. You need to break it down into the different subcategories and really look at it by that. But again, globally, it's not quite back at the 2019. There are big distinctions depending on what sort of sub-channel we're looking at. In terms of the current global status, yes, China very much impacted by COVID lockdowns, but there are other parts of Asia Pacific, Southeast Asia where there were pressures on the away-from-home channel. I mean, let me include Japan, which only just lifted the state of emergency, and we should start to see that improve. So as you think about the rest of the year, there are places where there is recovery yet to come. And of course, if there are recessionary impacts, either because of recession or loss of purchasing power in the face of inflation in certain parts of the world, then that will be an offsetting factor as we go into it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research.\nBrett Cooper : Can you address your thoughts on adding non-owned products to your or your systems offerings to win in digitization of your customer relationships? And then maybe in alcohol specifically to help scale the system in what is a new area for the company on an aligned basis across markets?\nJames Quincey: I mean, we have a whole series of different situations around the world. I think the starting point is there's not one universal answer to this question. And part of that is because the nature of the retail landscape, the nature of the distribution systems and the nature of the alcohol regulation is different in different parts of the world. We certainly start from the principle that our primary interest is in the brands of The Coca-Cola Company. To the extent -- and you've heard me talk about like never say never in a kind of a probalistic view of things, to the extent that a case can be made for other products being on the trucks, probably other beverage products, including alcohol, and that is somehow going to make the system, the bottlers and it's going to sell more of our brands, then that is a question we're going to look at. And there are certainly parts of the world. We're going down that road, has been successful in selling more Coke products. Chile would be an example of that where there are other beverage brands, are typically alcoholic ones, whether that be beer or spirits on the truck and in the selling system, which has allowed us to have more salespeople with a digital overlay as we talked about on the previous question, so retailers can order things. But ultimately, it's successful not because we can get more things on the truck, it's successful because we can sell more of the Coke brands. And that was demonstrably true in Chile. Other parts of the world and not necessarily the same initial starting point, and it might make more sense. But the question will always come back to -- I'm always open to hear any ideas that are going to drive more business results and better business results. And my starting point for more and better business results is selling more Cokes and Coke products.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities.\nStephen Lengel: This is Stephen Lengel on for Bill Chappell. Can you help us understand the ultimate goal of the [Coke] marketing campaign comparing regular Coke to Coke Zero? Is there a potential expectation that Coke Zero may be bigger than regular Coke in North America within the next 5 years?\nJames Quincey: That's a simple one. No. I'm not sure there's anywhere in the world that Coke Zero is bigger than Coke. There are certainly some countries in the world where the combination of Diet Coke and Coke Zero sell approximately the same as Coke Classic. In the end, Coke is a great franchise. We make available the classic version, the Coke Zero Sugar version, and we invite consumers to drink the one that best suits them. We are not trying to predetermine the mix structure. We are trying to offer the alternatives to get to invite the consumers into the franchise. But no, specifically, I don't expect Coke Zero to overtake Coke Classic in North America in the short term.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Thank you, operator. Well, just to summarize, obviously, we're very pleased with our first quarter results. And while there are clearly more clouds on the horizon, our strategy is intact, and we are well equipped to execute and invest for sustained growth. Thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Quincey",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. First and foremost, on behalf of our company and our entire system, I'd like to share our deepest sympathies to all those who have been affected by what's happening in Ukraine. The safety of our people and their families continues to be our top priority. And as we highlighted in our release this morning, we are taking actions to provide that support. Now this morning, I'll discuss how we drove strong results in the quarter and that we are reiterating our guidance even in the face of incremental challenges. Then John will discuss the financial details of the quarter and how our work has prepared us for whatever may be around the corner. We all know that much has happened in the world since we last talked with you in February, leading, for sure, to an operating environment that is fast changing and increasingly complex. However, we remain confident about the future and are well equipped to manage external factors worldwide through our strengthened leadership position with the right portfolio, the right strategy and the right execution in the marketplace. After a promising start to the year, the operating environment soon changed with very significant geopolitical conflict, a resurgence of COVID in various places, record-high inflation and continued challenges on the supply chain front. Nonetheless, we've consistently sustained our momentum from last year, moving with agility as conditions changed to generate strong top and bottom line growth in the quarter. We delivered 8% unit case volume growth, primarily driven by strong recovery in away-from-home channels and continued growth in our home channels. Volume growth was strong across all operating segments, driven by marketing investments and aided by an increase in consumer mobility as the impact of the pandemic abated in most regions. Our enhanced capabilities helped us gain value share overall in both at-home and away-from-home channels globally and across most of our geographic operating segments, a clear indicator of the power of our new approach. Amidst the dynamic macro conditions and an inflationary cost backdrop, we focused on delivering growth. The key competitive edge of The Coca-Cola system continues to be the ability to deliver value for our consumers and our customers in any environment. Our accelerated agenda in marketing and innovation is tying our beverages to daily consumption occasions, adding and creating value for our brands. Additionally, we continue to work with our bottling partners to expand package offerings and strengthen distribution to capture growth opportunities, using all the available revenue growth management levers, including price, to win in the marketplace. These scaled global initiatives are coming to life at a local level all around the world. So let's start with Asia Pacific. In India, we drove excellence in integrated execution as consumer mobility improved across channels by stepping up product availability, adding approximately 240,000 outlets and over 50,000 coolers. We also continue to build relevance through innovation by launching Maaza Aam Panna to leverage our equity in Mango and Fanta Apple to expand our footprint in the fast-growing fruit-flavored sparkling subcategory. Japan is emerging from its extended state of emergency, and we've increased our consumer base and driven market share gains in key categories. The Coke ON app reached 35 million app downloads, continuing the direct engagement with consumers to create and capture value. We also continued our focus on ESG initiatives with 100% recycled PET bottles now available in Japan for 5 key brands, including Coke and Georgia Coffee. In China, a strong start in January, led by an excellent Chinese New Year brand activation with Coke, was followed by strict COVID lockdowns, and this resulted in reduced consumer mobility. Momentum reversed in February and March and led to a decline in unit case volume during the quarter. We're moving fast to focus on core SKUs and ensure product availability. We're adapting how we engage with consumers depending upon local market conditions, and we're working in close collaboration with our bottling partners to focus on execution basics like increasing multipack availability and maximizing share of visible inventory in channels and regions that are open. In ASEAN and South Pacific, we gained share in key countries and across most categories, while consumer mobility was mixed and supply chain headwinds remained. Growth was led by Trademark Coke and sparkling flavors, driven by strong end-to-end execution of the [Zero Words] (ph), Sprite Heat Happens and the Fanta Colorful People brand campaigns. In EMEA, notwithstanding the conflict in Ukraine and an uptick in inflation, we delivered a strong performance in Europe in the quarter. The continued rollout of new and improved Coca-Cola Zero Sugar across key markets helped drive 5 percentage points of sparkling single-serve mix growth, which is ahead of pre-pandemic levels. Topo Chico Hard Seltzer is closing the gap with the #1 hard seltzer brand in Europe, and the eB2B business with myccep.com accounted for low double-digit contribution to total revenue. We are keeping a close watch on the spillover reflex of the conflict in Ukraine on the health of the consumer, and we remain ready to pivot and adapt. In Africa, macroeconomic recovery is underway, although conditions remain challenging due to inflationary pressure. In South Africa, we accelerated refillable PET expansion and the execution of in-store sampling to retain consumers. We are connecting with our existing customers in the digital space and have surpassed 65,000 outlets on the Wabi eB2B platform, significantly ahead of plan. Despite macro volatility and intense inflation in the region, Eurasia and Middle East drove top line growth through a strong suite of marketing programs across categories, led by sparkling and ready-to-drink tea. In Turkey, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar became the #2 immediate consumption player in value share behind brand Coke. In Pakistan, Coke Studio, a platform that unites diverse cultures through the power of music, drove social engagement that reached an all-time high in terms of impressions and viewings. In North America, we are seeing more inflation and continue to navigate supply chain dynamics. We're closely monitoring further pressure in some inputs such as high fructose corn syrup, PET and metals, along with wages and transportation as they impact us as well as our bottling partners. Despite these challenges, we continue to gain share in both at-home and away-from-home channels and across most categories. The strong rollout of Real Magic platform and the successful launch of Coke Starlight resulted in Coke Trademark being the fastest-growing trademark in measured retail, driving household penetration up a full point. Powerade [posed its power] (ph) launch during NCAA March Madness, generating more than 1 billion impressions. We also continue to learn from the returnable glass-bottled pilot that has been implemented in the Southwest. In Latin America, we delivered strong performance despite challenging macro conditions, and the investments we made to sustain momentum are paying off. We remain focused on integrated execution and drove revenue growth faster than transaction growth, both of which grew faster than unit case volume growth. Our work to strengthen the traditional trade is paying off as the channel showed the best underlying performance across all channels. The Prospera loyalty program added nearly 50,000 retailers in the quarter while continuing to advance our customer-focused digital expansion. Notably, we have digitized nearly 2 million customers in the region, and we are leveraging the strong system alignment with our bottling partners and are continuing to execute for growth. Within Global Ventures, despite an inflationary backdrop in the UK, Costa continued to recover driven by retail and strong like-for-like sales with Costa Express. In China, while retail sales were impacted by store closures due to the pandemic, Costa ready-to-drink coffee sustained its #2 position and continue to innovate with Costa chart. Finally, our Bottling Investments Group delivered strong Q1 performance, driven by the expansion of affordable immediate consumption entry packs in key markets, and this resulted in share gains in sparkling. We also continue to make progress towards optimizing trade promotions and cost to serve in our key markets and raise the bar on operational excellence. Clearly, the operating environment has proven to be more challenging, but we're pleased with the results we delivered in the first quarter. We continue to believe the recovery in 2022 will be asynchronous. We anticipate many new chapters and challenges, including, but not limited to, ongoing geopolitical conflict; uncertain consumer sentiment amidst the increasingly inflationary environment, accelerated cost pressures and ongoing supply challenges; and of course, continued evolution of pandemic. That said, the changes we have made during the pandemic have left us better positioned than ever to capture growth, increasing our confidence in the future. The multiple levers of revenue growth management have never been more important, and our investments in building this capability over the past few years are giving us a clear advantage. Further actions on pricing will depend on the consumer and inflationary environment as the year progresses, but we will continue to rely on a mix of price, package differentiation and ever-sharper promotional strategies. Through integrated RGM and execution capabilities, we adapt to local market conditions and give consumers what they want, where they want it and at the right price. By extending package offerings to keep transaction driving price points in play, we retain consumers through affordability while also driving premiumization with innovation and targeted pricing. For example, in Latin America, we are continuing the expansion of refillables to sparkling flavors and juices, and this remains a compelling consumer proposition to address the need for affordability. In North America, we're maximizing value by initiatives like the one expanding the availability of mini cans for consumption across occasions such as breaks and meals and by offering 6 packs, 10 packs and 30 packs, driving an approximate 45% increase in retail dollars in measured channels and their near-20% increase in total distribution points. Our networked organization structure extends to our system. Our bottling partners complement our progress against our capabilities by continuing to invest in the marketplace, and they help put our purpose into action. We have strong partners with highly capable and experienced leadership, and we continue to build and foster our business and each in our relationship that drive system health and long-term growth opportunities. With our purpose to refresh the world to make a difference, we continue to focus our ESG work on issues where we can have a measurable positive impact on communities as well as create opportunities for our business to grow. We release our fourth combined business and ESG report tomorrow, an integrated approach to reporting that is a strong demonstration of how sustainability is linked to our business, builds resilience and demonstrates transparency. We have a long history of assuring select sustainability metrics while also providing key public disclosures against the TCFD recommendations as well as other reporting frameworks such as SASB, GRI and the UN Global Compact. In the report, we highlight how we and our bottling partners are driving business growth through our interconnected ESG goals and how we continue to seek an exponentially greater impact by fostering collective action, partnering across industry, government and society to address shared challenges. In conclusion, while there is no doubt the world is more uncertain and the operating environment remains highly dynamic, our strategy remains the same: to execute for sustainable growth through strengthened capabilities in innovation, marketing, RGM and execution. Now I'll turn the call over to John. Yes. There was -- I think we'll call that several questions. Okay. We'll be -- in the spirit of generosity, we'll try and -- because they're very related. Look, we have a great partnership with our bottlers in Latin America from the 2 very big ones. Coke FEMSA, Arca Continental, through Andina and some of the more country-based bottlers. And we have developed collectively the system, many capabilities on many fronts, whether it be marketing automation, but particularly, the levers of revenue growth management and execution in volatile times. It escapes no one's attention that Latin America was a place that has had a rollercoaster of economic growth and inflation and difficulties. And we have a very deep partnership with these bottlers to work through these times. And that, I think, you see reflected in this quarter as we had a lot of good growth. The share did come in negative overall. I think there's a couple of things going on there. As you say, we did a lot better in sparkling, a lot of good execution in sparkling. And there was some pressure as much in juice or some of the juice drink categories, but also category mix. We are very much focused on, as we've talked about previously that when you are in a cost environment, that those cost increases, whether it be commodities or wages or logistics or marketing costs, need to go through over time. We have to earn the right for the brands to take if they need to go through. Sometimes when you're in a very high share market like Latin America and you lead on pricing, not all competitors necessarily follow immediately, and that can have temporary impacts on share. But we, with the bottlers, will be very focused on not only continuing to carry on growing, but to regain and expand our share position. Well, clearly, my active generosity, Lauren has unleashed a torrent of multi-question questions, but it would be harsh to cut it off at this stage, Dara. Look, a couple of things. We did come in with strong momentum out of 2021 and coming to this year. And as I and John and we talked about previously on calls, we believe that pricing for our business has to be earned for the brands. We have to give the consumer and the retailer reason for the price increase and for the value of our brands, whether it's the marketing, the innovation, the execution or the packaging options, we do that. It's not a cost-plus business, although we do seek, of course, to protect the margin structure by moving through changes in commodities and other costs.  But we very much foresee as experience and history -- who was it? Mark Twain said, history doesn't repeat itself, it just rhymes. But when you go into high inflation, consumers come under pressure. There's clearly reductions in real purchasing power going on for some segments of the population, if not everyone around the world. And so our focus is very much to find those packaging and price options by channel where we can stay connected to people who are coming under purchasing power pressure, very much the affordability just building on the Latin America example for the last question; a lot of focus on returnable, refillable bottles because the economics of those packages work to an extent that you can have a lower price point for the package. And with reductions in purchasing power, we very much see the actual out-of-pocket price point and keeping a low entry point into the category is very important, also pushing the expansion of refillables in places like South Africa. So very much acting on the signs of consumer purchasing power pressure, but very much also anticipating that it will increase. It would be great if there were a perfect landing out of this inflationary environment. The rhyme of history would tell you that at some point, either inflation or reduction in purchasing power or supply constraints eventually create a bump. And at that point, we will want to both be accessing the premium opportunities that have but very much with an anchor in the affordability and entry price point opportunities and necessities as consumers come under pressure. Yes. Sure, Bonnie. I mean I'm not sure it would be appropriate to comment on equity income into the future for our bottling partners. But as we go into a tough environment, as we always do historically, we make sure that we intensify our collaboration and partnership with our bottlers, both to work on what are the marketing programs and the innovation programs that are going to work in the consumer and the retail environment that we face wherever we are in the world, and also the execution initiatives and focus areas that bottlers can drive on. Because firstly, the environment is not the same in every country around the world. Some are opening up exuberantly and actually chasing and keeping up with demand and the kind of the reopening euphoria, all the way across the spectrum to parts of China like Shanghai, which is in full lockdown as though it were April 2020. So the environment is absolutely not the same in every country, and we have to work where on the curve of all the change, are we and be very clear. And in terms of the pressures, you talked about it, the pressure is both headwind and tailwind. Clearly, there are headwinds in terms of cost, whether it be commodities, logistics, wages. And as I said earlier in one of the questions, we work with our system, our bottling partners, to make sure we protect and sustain the margin structure over time. That's not necessarily true every single quarter, but that is our overall objective: earning the right to price the brands so that the system has the sort of margin structure and stability of that over the course of time, if not every single quarter. But there are headwinds there. Balancing those headwinds, there are tailwinds out there, as I said. The reopenings provide fuel not just for overall demand, but improvements in channels, away-from-home channels where we're strong and leaning in with investment produces great results. So this is -- there's a lot of variables at play in the downhill of the year and really just the key is the intense partnership with our bottlers to make the most of the opportunity ahead of us and to prepare ourselves for step 2 and step 3 further down the road. Yes. Thanks, Bryan. Yes, I mean, firstly, we'd refer everyone who wants a greater depth to the proxy that's out there on our website, and we've tried to lay out some of the mechanics and our thinking behind the 2. We have made some changes, as you point out, Bryan, to the way the long-term incentives or more specifically, the performance share units, which are kind of a 3-year program. We've got a 10% element in that that's linked to our ESG goals. And so we are laying out some very specific targets that will drive a portion of those payouts. And because some of those ESG objectives take some time to execute against, we felt they were better embedded into the 3-year stock award programs. And then secondly, as you point out, with the Board and with the Compensation Committee, we felt to increase greater alignment with shareowners. We would readjust the balance of performance share units versus options for myself and push that up to 50%. I mean you can take that as a confidence in the future, but that's one very small stone on the large pile of stones of things we do to demonstrate that we believe this is a great company with a great future. I mean our approach to pricing, I've commented a little bit on it already. Firstly, the highest level principle is the brand has to earn the right for pricing. And that is the combination of its activities in marketing, in innovation, in execution and the investments in the store and of course, in RGM to make the packaging and pricing architecture fit the consumers' needs. Obviously, what goes into a piece of that puzzle is also the cost environment, whether that be commodities, marketing, logistics, et cetera, et cetera. And we seek to balance the various challenges using RGM. As I said earlier, clearly, as we go into reducing consumer purchasing power, we need to have affordability as front and center, and depending on where you are in the world, can take the shape of different packaging but it all becomes about the entry price point to the category, not the kind of the higher-end price towards the category. But you balance that out by having -- moving up the price points on other package combinations. It all has to go in the mix. And it is all done with a perspective that not necessarily every single day, but in a reasonable time frame, the margin structure of the system needs to be sustained. You definitely don't want to get to a point where there's been a substantial cost push through, and that has not yet been passed on into the marketplace when any recessionary impact appears. Trying to catch up on pricing in a recessionary environment is very hard. And so we have a bias to action. In the same way, we have a bias to invest behind our brands in marketing innovation. We have a bias to keep up with cost pressures as they occur. And that, of course, leads us to take pricing more or less frequently depending on where you are in the world, and I expect to see more of that in the rest of the year. Yes, sure. Thanks, Carlos. Clearly, as part of both our RGM initiatives, because the refillable, reusable packages tend to give you the opportunity especially in larger sizes, have a lower entry price point, which is particularly useful in developing and emerging markets. And so you have an intersection of a very important business imperative on affordability and the fact that ultimately, a refillable package is less likely to go to waste and has a lower carbon footprint. And so it really complements our world without waste ESG strategy where we're looking to create a circular economy around our packaging material. So the 2 intersect and give us 2 imperatives at both point in the same direction. And so we're very much looking to invest behind refillable packaging, making progress in gaining in mix in Latin America, also been driving that in parts of Africa. We've even taken to experimenting with returnable glass in the Southwest of the U.S. And so we are very focused on this because it does work for both of these imperatives, and so expect to see kind of more focus and more investment behind keeping that up and working with retailers to make it simple for the consumers to get the credits when they return these reusable bottles. So very much an investment focus. Well, clearly, I mean, I've talked about our approach to pricing several times. And that is going to lead to more -- I mean there are going to be more price increases depending on where you are in. I mean there are countries with inflation well into double digits. And you do see multiple price increases during the year, as a matter, of course, when you're in those sorts of circumstances, with cost pressures to push through as you seek to sustain margins over time. Let me just address the elasticity question. It has been apparent, and other people have commented on less elasticity in recent times as price increases have gone through. I do not expect elasticities to be inelastic going forward. There's a reason you got the name elasticity. And so I fully expect, as I commented earlier on, inflation generally ends with some pressure somewhere. I expect elasticity to increase at some point in the future. Will that be next quarter? Or will that be next year? I can't give you the answer to that because it's very dependent on some macros, and it's probably going to vary by country. But we are very attuned to it, which is why I talked about how we are leaning into investing behind our brands so that we earn the right for the price increases, so that we can minimize the elasticity and that we keep a sharp eye on affordability, which again tends to minimize elasticity if we use RGM well. But as I say, if the choice comes down to, we think the elasticity is going up or we're going to have to not pass through some cost, we're going to err towards taking the price increase rather than not taking the price increase. As I said earlier, not seeing the cost go through and arriving at a recession being behind the curve is less desirable than embarking and having to take the hit from a greater elasticity in the short term. And so that's our kind of modus operandi, and we will certainly seek to earn the right to take the price increases. We certainly aren't looking to take price increases just because we can. We want to earn them as a brand, and we want to make sure we recover the cost over time. Yes. Thanks, Robert. This is a very important area for us and our bottling partners. Simply put, the idea of connecting these customers is essentially that our retailers, particularly the traditional trade and the fragmented trade, remembering that on a global basis, about half of our sales go to the fragmented trade, whether that's from grocery side or fragmented in terms of being away-from-home and [eatery], so about half of the global sales go to that, is being able -- that they can order the Cokes they need or the rest of the portfolio that they need, they don't have to necessarily wait for the salesperson to turn up. This isn't about replacing the salesperson, very far from it. This is about enabling the selling system to be even more effective in that being able to connect with the retailers, generate orders. And so very much it's about sales force enablement system, such that in the same way that consumers in the developed world can just use their phones to -- with whatever system, with whatever app is appropriate to order things, and they don't have to go to the store to get them.  We see that the bottling system will be able to sell more and very much in the -- where we've implemented these systems, where it's a complement to the sales force, it has driven extra sales and driven retailer loyalty. And so we think we can see -- and obviously, we're very much engaged with the bottling partners to drive the connectivity, particularly for the fragmented trade so that they could order whatever they want, whenever they want from the Coke portfolio. And that's as true in the rollout, as you called out in Latin America. Myccep.com is the same basic idea. It's all about technologically enabling the selling system to be more effective for the retailers. Yes. Laurent, looking at the non-retail business of Costa, the Express machines, the kind of vending digital barista machine had a very strong quarter with transactions growing strongly, and we're starting -- and we're seeing -- now that reopenings have occurred, we're starting to see the focus on placement of new machines across Europe and the Middle East; and also in China, although that's got a little harder in the last couple of months. But the Express machine is still doing very well. Obviously, they need the opening of the world to happen. And then on the Proud to Serve front, which is kind of providing the beans and machines to independent outlets, starting to ramp that up more in the Europe.  Europe environment, again, early days. We did launch some tests in at-home. That's too early to kind of call. And then Costa ready-to-drink has done pretty well in China. It's sustained its #2 position. It's continuing to grow, and we've launched it also in some of the European markets. So starting to see those innovations roll out, and we'll see how they do in the coming quarters. Yes, sure. I mean, clearly, China is an important market to us. As I said in the script, we had a strong start to the year going into Chinese New Year. But the lockdowns, particularly Shanghai, took the steam out of things, and we ended the quarter negative. It's -- the key factor will be the degree of mobility. And we had -- and depending on how big that is will make a huge difference to the level of results. I don't think there's anything to call from the early days of April that's different to what was happening at the back end of March. The lockdowns, as you can read in the newspapers, are still in full force, so to speak, in those cities where they're locking down. And I think that's going to remain the biggest factor. Of course, we're going to focus on what we can control. We certainly had 2 years of trying to look at what that looked like over the last couple of years, and we'll continue to build on those learnings and the playbook that we had and adapt as necessary. It's a little difficult to predict exactly what it's going to look like, but we feel -- said a different way, we feel better prepared and more resilient for the COVID journey of 2022 in China than we did in 2020. Sure. I mean, firstly on -- firstly, let me step back both. The away-from-home channels, whilst we have recovered to our 2019 levels, the away-from-home channels have not yet fully recovered. And in part, the -- and we -- I think I've talked about this on previous call, we've lost outlets in the course of the pandemic. That's true of the away-from-home, and that's also true of the fragmented grocery trades. And so there has been an impact on the number of outlets. It's not fully back. Of course, there is a distinction by sub-channel with away-from-home, particularly QSR has done well, particularly those with digital and drive-through have done well. So the away-from-home channel, even in a country, can't be considered as a thing. You need to break it down into the different subcategories and really look at it by that. But again, globally, it's not quite back at the 2019. There are big distinctions depending on what sort of sub-channel we're looking at. In terms of the current global status, yes, China very much impacted by COVID lockdowns, but there are other parts of Asia Pacific, Southeast Asia where there were pressures on the away-from-home channel. I mean, let me include Japan, which only just lifted the state of emergency, and we should start to see that improve. So as you think about the rest of the year, there are places where there is recovery yet to come. And of course, if there are recessionary impacts, either because of recession or loss of purchasing power in the face of inflation in certain parts of the world, then that will be an offsetting factor as we go into it. I mean, we have a whole series of different situations around the world. I think the starting point is there's not one universal answer to this question. And part of that is because the nature of the retail landscape, the nature of the distribution systems and the nature of the alcohol regulation is different in different parts of the world. We certainly start from the principle that our primary interest is in the brands of The Coca-Cola Company. To the extent -- and you've heard me talk about like never say never in a kind of a probalistic view of things, to the extent that a case can be made for other products being on the trucks, probably other beverage products, including alcohol, and that is somehow going to make the system, the bottlers and it's going to sell more of our brands, then that is a question we're going to look at. And there are certainly parts of the world. We're going down that road, has been successful in selling more Coke products. Chile would be an example of that where there are other beverage brands, are typically alcoholic ones, whether that be beer or spirits on the truck and in the selling system, which has allowed us to have more salespeople with a digital overlay as we talked about on the previous question, so retailers can order things. But ultimately, it's successful not because we can get more things on the truck, it's successful because we can sell more of the Coke brands. And that was demonstrably true in Chile. Other parts of the world and not necessarily the same initial starting point, and it might make more sense. But the question will always come back to -- I'm always open to hear any ideas that are going to drive more business results and better business results. And my starting point for more and better business results is selling more Cokes and Coke products. That's a simple one. No. I'm not sure there's anywhere in the world that Coke Zero is bigger than Coke. There are certainly some countries in the world where the combination of Diet Coke and Coke Zero sell approximately the same as Coke Classic. In the end, Coke is a great franchise. We make available the classic version, the Coke Zero Sugar version, and we invite consumers to drink the one that best suits them. We are not trying to predetermine the mix structure. We are trying to offer the alternatives to get to invite the consumers into the franchise. But no, specifically, I don't expect Coke Zero to overtake Coke Classic in North America in the short term. Thank you, operator. Well, just to summarize, obviously, we're very pleased with our first quarter results. And while there are clearly more clouds on the horizon, our strategy is intact, and we are well equipped to execute and invest for sustained growth. Thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning."

            "name": "John Murphy",
            "content": "Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll highlight our first quarter performance and discuss our full year 2022 earnings guidance; then I'll provide commentary on the overall operating environment and how our organization is navigating effectively to drive results. Let me first start by saying how pleased we are with the results in the first quarter. We delivered strong organic revenue growth of 18%; unit cases grew 8%, with strong growth across all operating segments; concentrate sales were ahead of unit cases by 3 points in the quarter, primarily due to the timing of shipments in Latin America and EMEA. Our price/mix of 7% was driven by strategic pricing, revenue growth management initiatives, further improvement in away-from-home channels in most markets and positive segment mix. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 90 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to the impact of 2 items: one, consolidating the BODYARMOR; and two, currency headwinds. Underlying gross margin expanded despite continued pressure from commodity costs, due to pricing actions in the market and a benefit from the timing of concentrate shipments. We continue to prioritize consumer-facing marketing to maximize returns while driving productivity in our operating costs leading to leverage in the P&L. Comparable operating margin expanded by approximately 50 basis points despite acquisition and currency headwinds. First quarter comparable EPS of $0.64 grew 16% year-over-year. This was driven by strong top line growth which benefited from the timing of concentrate shipments and operating margin improvements, partially offset by currency and cost headwinds. On the cash flow front, we delivered free cash flow of approximately $400 million in the first quarter as our strong business performance was more than offset primarily by 2 items: one, cycling the timing of working capital benefits in the prior year; and two, higher 2021 annual incentives paid in the first quarter. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our cash flow goals for the full year. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, with net debt leverage within our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. As James mentioned, much has happened since we last gave guidance in February. The conflict in Ukraine has created further volatility in the world as well as added to the inflationary backdrop and impacted the currency market. The resurgence of COVID in China and some other geographies around the world is a clear indication that the pandemic is still very much a part of the conversation, and a reminder that the recovery path has been and will continue to be asynchronous. Obviously, there are lots of puts and takes at play, and we see a number of potential futures coming at us. But notwithstanding this backdrop, we believe our organization is better prepared today, and we're confident in the flexibility we've built and our ability to manage what's around the corner. We continue to spin the growth flywheels faster, and our local businesses are adapting and executing for growth. With that in mind, this morning, we are reiterating our guidance for 2022. We continue to expect organic revenue growth of approximately 7% to 8% and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share guidance of 8% to 10% growth versus 2021. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we are reiterating our currency outlook of a 2- to 3-point currency headwinds to comparable net revenues and a 3- to 4-point currency headwinds to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. Additionally, taking into account our current understanding of recently issued regulations, we now expect an effective tax rate of 19.5% in 2022 versus the 20% that we had guided to previously. All in, we continue to expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus 2021. And we continue to expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow for 2022 through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. To put this guidance in context, there are some considerations to keep in mind for 2022. The direct impact of the Ukraine conflict and the resulting suspension of business in Russia is estimated to be approximately $0.04 to comparable EPS. The recent increases in commodity costs are having an incremental effect. But based on current rates and hedge positions, we expect the commodity price inflation to remain in the range of mid-single digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2022. Additionally, we see incremental cost pressure coming from areas like wages and transportation. The consolidation of the BODYARMOR finished goods business will continue to have a mechanical effect on margins. When it comes to capital allocation, our priorities remain the same, and we continue to balance financial flexibility with efficient capital structure. For 2022, we announced a dividend increase of 5%, a higher rate than in recent years; and we also announced the resumption of share repurchases with approximately $500 million in net share repurchases expected this year. Despite uncertainties around the world, our strategic transformation has fortified the organization to weather the storm, and we are extremely proud of how our people are responding and delivering. We are keeping consumers at the center, operating more effectively and efficiently and unlocking the immense potential of our growth portfolio of brands. This gives us confidence that we can deliver on our guidance for 2022. And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions. Thanks, Steve, it's John. Let me first just lay the picture of total capital allocation. The first priority is to invest in the business. And as we -- as James just said, when you think about the environment that we're -- we have been dealing in and we will be dealing with the rest of the year, the name of the game right now is to do exactly that is to continue to invest in our brands so that we have the wherewithal to manage through whatever comes at us. I think at a local level, the mix of investments is something that we continue to be very flexible with. And we are leveraging the work that we have been doing over the last couple of years to be even more effective in how we're spending our marketing dollars, whether it's on building our brands or whether it's on supporting our RGM efforts in the marketplace. The other areas of our capital allocation framework, supporting the dividend, looking at opportunistic M&A and share repurchase, we covered in the script with the dividend and share repurchase, we continue to be very open as to what opportunities may be out there. But in the here and now, the top priority is investing appropriately in the business. And as I say, the mix of that investment is something that varies and will continue to vary depending on what we need to do locally. Quick answer. No updates -- no developments during the quarter. We'll keep you posted as they happen."

        "content": "Operator: At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Coca-Cola Company's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be on listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations Department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Ms. Robin Halpern, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Halpern, you may now begin.\nRobin Halpern: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We've posted schedules under financial information in the Investors section of our company website. These reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to this morning to results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our growth and operating margin. This call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question. Re-enter the queue to ask any follow-up. Now, I will turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Robin. And good morning, everyone. In 2023, we achieved our near-term goals, while also positioning our business for the long-term. Our all-weather strategy delivered 8% comparable earnings per share growth despite greater than expected 7% currency headwinds. Today, we are leveraging our scale globally and winning locally, which gives us confidence that we can deliver on our 2024 guidance. This morning, I'll talk about the global consumer landscape, then I'll highlight how our strategy and enhanced capabilities are making us a more agile and effective organization. And finally, John will discuss our financial results and our 2024 guidance. During the quarter, we benefited from strong performance across many of our markets. However, some were impacted by elevated inflation and others by geopolitical tensions and conflict. We delivered 12% organic revenue growth, which included 2 points of volume growth, continuing a positive volume trend for the year. Throughout, we continue to invest in our business to provide the right portfolio of brands and packages to retain and attract more drinkers. We drove industry growth and delivered value share gains in the quarter and for the full year. We achieved these results by effectively navigating a number of headwinds and capitalizing on tailwinds across our markets. During the quarter, we saw strong consumer demand across Australia, India, Latin America, Japan and South Korea. In North America, consumer spending in aggregate is holding up well. And in Europe, consumers remain cost conscious. In Africa and China, the macro environment remains uncertain. And in the Middle East, tensions have resulted in some shapes in consumer behavior that have had an impact on our business. Another important fact that I highlight is the inflationary pressures, which are moderating or stabilizing across most of our markets. To keep consumers in our franchise, we are leveraging our revenue growth management capabilities to tailor our offerings and price pack architecture to meet consumers' evolving needs. In North America and Europe, while inflation is moderating, the cumulative impact of inflation is pressuring certain consumer segments we're seeking value. Throughout 2023, we increased our affordability offerings and one volume and value share in both regions. In Latin America, despite double digit inflation during the fourth quarter, we grew volume 4% and increased household penetration and basket initiatives. There are a few pockets of the world that are experiencing hyperinflation. John will later speak to how this dynamic is impacting our business. However, I did want to mention that our local franchise operating model allows us to navigate through hyperinflationary environment and then gain an advantage over the long-term. Across our business, we continue to prioritize agility and focus on improving every aspect of how we operate. An important part of this is our marketing transformation. To recruit the next generation of drinkers, our marketing has shifted from a TV centric model to a digital first organization that balances local intimacy, scale and flexibility. Our digital mix has gone from less than 30% in 2019 to approximately 60% of our total media spend. In 2023, we stood up Studio X, the digital ecosystem that brings this altogether. We created physical hubs in each of our operating units to integrate disciplines, standardized data and technology and step change our capabilities. Creative, media, social and production capabilities and now operating at scale connected by our global network structure. In our previous model, it took several months to create a TV ad. Now, we're producing thousands of pieces of digital content that are contextually relevant and measuring these results in real-time. Studio X is driving tangible results. For example, Coke Studio which originated in Pakistan and taps into consumers' passion for music has been scale to our top 40 markets. The campaign uses packaging as digital portals to access real magic experiences, which have generated more than 1.2 billion YouTube views and a 100 million music streams this year, resulting in strong recruitment of Gen Z drinkers. We're engaging differently with consumers and is delivering results. In 2023, according to Cantor, Coca-Cola brand value increased $8 billion. Coke is now the 10th most valuable brand in the world, up seven spots from the prior year. In the US, Sprite was named by Morning Consult as the number one beverage brands for Gen Z drinkers. We were also named one of the top 10 innovative companies in augmented and virtual reality by Fast Company. Our innovation agenda is increasing our competitive advantage across our products, packaging and equipment. Taste is the starting point. Simply put, people want drinks to taste great. To drive superiority across our total beverage portfolio, we're continuing to build capabilities to tap into unique insights in taste and aroma sciences. We're applying digital tools, ingredient processing technology and AI to create bolder and more successful innovations. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar is an ongoing example of how superior taste drives demand, with volume that grew 5% in 2023, leading to continued volume and value share gains. We are applying learnings from this multiyear success and driving taste superiority elsewhere in our sparkling portfolio. In 2023, we launched Sprite and Fanta reformulations in 25 markets, delivering mid-single digit volume growth in those markets and driving overall sparkling flavors value share gains. Outside of our sparkling portfolio, we're dialing up flavor profiles, adding functional benefits and expanding into new categories. In Japan, we relaunched Georgia Coffee, which generated broader customer interest and led to value share gains. In the US, fairlife\u2019s Core Power and nutrition plan of a high protein dairy without compromising taste. In 2023, fairlife grew volume 15%, its 9th consecutive year of double digit volume growth. We're also seeing continued promising results from FUZE Tea across Europe, Jack and Coke in the Philippines, Flashlight in Mexico, among many others. In 2023, innovation contributed to approximately 30% of gross profit growth and our success rates have nearly tripled compared to 2019 levels. Our revenue growth management execution capabilities continue to be distinct advantages. As demonstrated by our ability to deliver volume and transaction growth, despite ongoing inflationary pressures. We're working with our bottling partners to capture every opportunity available to create significant value for consumers and customers. By offering a total beverage portfolio in the right packages and at the right price points, we're driving category expansion and becoming more relevant to more consumers and customers. In North America, we're evolving packaging options across more distribution points, drive affordability and premiumization. On the affordability side, our 1.25 liter PET bottles are now available in 80% of supermarkets and our 16 ounce can distribution increased by 14 points in convenience stores during 2023. We're also focused on premiumization through the expansion of our mini can offerings. During the quarter, we launched 15 pack mini cans in grocery and club channels. In Europe, we're leveraging the same playbook, but adapting it to local needs. In Spain, our 1.25 liter PET package is offered at a compelling price point and it drove 16% volume growth and increased household penetration in 2023. In Italy, Britain and Ireland, we drove premium single serve mini cans, a smaller package offerings to generate positive mix and incremental retail sales. Our franchise system uniquely combines the benefits of scale and knowledge sharing with the know-how needed to execute for customers and win locally in many different operating environments. For example, approximately 70% of purchase decisions are influenced at point of sale, our systems stepped up in-store displays during the quarter which drove incremental retail sales and cross selling opportunities. Putting it all together, we created $15 billion in incremental retail sales for our customers in 2023, more than any other beverage company. This was our sixth year in a row as the leader in value creation. While we're pleased with our progress, we recognize there's still much work to be done to capture the vast opportunities available. Our system is galvanized to move further and faster. Before I hand over to John, I want to acknowledge that none of this could happen without the unwavering dedication of our employees. And so as we turn to 2024, we expect the year will bring new challenges and opportunities. And we'll remain ready to respond through continuing to improve execution of our strategy across our total beverage portfolio. I look forward to sharing more next Tuesday at CAGNY and I encourage everyone to listen in. With that, I will turn the call over to John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James. And good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter and throughout 2023, we delivered strong results. During the quarter, we grew organic revenues 12% which was in-line with our full year organic revenue growth. Unit case growth was 2% and it was positive in each quarter of 2023. Concentrate sales grew 1 point ahead of unit cases, driven primarily by one additional day in the quarter. Our price mix growth of 9% in the quarter was driven by three factors. One, 2023 pricing actions across most of our markets. Two, hyperinflationary pricing that I'll speak to in just a moment. And three, some mix which is mostly timing related. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 140 basis points. Driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottle refranchising. Partially offset by the impact of currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 40 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong topline growth, partially offset by currency headwinds and an increase in marketing investments. The positive volume and topline growth that we're realizing today demonstrates the effectiveness of our marketing spend. Below the line, comparable other income declined primarily due to the operating environment in Argentina. Putting it all together, fourth quarter comparable EPS of $0.49 was up 10% year-over-year, despite higher than expected 13% currency headwinds. Before moving on, I wanted to discuss the impact of a few hyperinflationary markets on our fourth quarter results. During the quarter, inflation intensified and exceeded 60% across these markets. In aggregate, while they represent less than 5% of our total volume, this degree of inflation creates a cosmetic distortion to our underlying results. In the fourth quarter, these markets contributed more than 3 points of our price mix and most of our currency headwinds, including an outsized impact to comparable other income from balance sheet remeasurement in Argentina. They did not, however, have a material impact on our earnings per share results. In hyperinflationary markets it's either impractical or impossible to hedge our currency exposure. And to manage it, we use our full suite of revenue growth management tools, including pricing actions to keep pace with local market inflation. We have been operating a long-time in these markets and we expect to be in them for a long-time to come. We work hand-in-hand with our local bottling partners and our focus will be to continue to nurture the strong relationships we have with our consumers and customers. And to ultimately prevail longer-term. So while we will continue to experience volatility of this nature in a few markets, it's important to keep in mind they are operated locally, they are typically self-funding and they have not impeded our overall ability to grow earnings per share. As we move forward, we are confident that our business model and the many levers within it will allow us to deliver on our overall objectives. In 2023 free cash flow was $9.7 billion, which increased from the prior year. 2023 free cash flow included a transition tax payment of approximately $720 million, which was approximately $340 million higher than the prior year and included approximately $230 million in M&A related payments. Our underlying free cash flow growth was largely attributable to strong operational performance and working capital benefits. If you exclude the full impact of the transition tax in M&A related payments, our adjusted free cash flow conversion ratio would be within our target range of 90% to 95%. Our balance sheet remains strong. And our net debt leverage of 1.7 times EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times. During the fourth quarter, in addition to offsetting dilution from the exercise of stock options by employees, we repurchased additional shares in anticipation of expected proceeds from bottler refranchising. As James mentioned, we anticipate 2024 will bring new challenges and opportunities. However, through our all-weather strategy, we've proven we can deliver in many different operating environments. Our 2024 guidance builds on the underlying momentum of our business. We expect organic revenue growth of 6% to 7% and comparable currency neutral earnings per share growth of 8% to 10%. We anticipate hyperinflationary pricing will continue to play a role in 2024, but it will moderate throughout the year. We continue to make significant progress towards refranchising company owned bottling operations. Bottler refranchising is expected to be a 4 point to 5 point headwind to comparable net revenues and a 2 point headwind to comparable earnings per share. But will have a positive impact on both our margins and the return profile of our business. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate 2 point to 3 point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 4 point to 5 point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024. Notably, much of our anticipated 2024 currency headwinds are attributed to hyperinflationary markets with a meaningful impact in the fourth quarter. Our underlying effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be 19.2%. All in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5% versus $2.69 in 2023. We expect to generate approximately $9.2 billion of free cash flow in 2024 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $2.2 billion in capital investments. The $11.4 billion of cash from operations includes two items to highlight, transition tax payments of approximately $960 million, an increase of approximately $240 million versus 2023, payments associated with various M&A transactions of approximately $560 million, an increase of approximately $330 million versus 2023. Driven by our underlying cash flow generation and current balance sheet strength, we have ample flexibility to both reinvest in our business to drive growth and return capital to our shareowners. A significant portion of our expected capital investment increase is to build capacity for fairlife and for our India business, both of which experienced robust growth in 2023. Related to capital return, we have an unwavering priority to grow our dividend as we've done with 61 consecutive years of dividend increases. With respect to share repurchases, we will be flexible in our approach. Typically, we've repurchased shares to offset any dilution from the exercise of stock options by employees in the given year. Our capital allocation policy prioritize agility. And we're committed to taking the right actions needed to drive the long-term health of our business and create value for our stakeholders. There are some considerations to keep in mind for 2024. The first quarter of 2024 will be impacted by the timing of concentrate shipments in the fourth quarter of 2023 in some markets and cycling our strongest volume growth quarter from the prior year. We estimate the ongoing conflict in the Middle East had approximately 1 point of impact on volume growth during the fourth quarter of 2023. It's unclear how long this impact will last. In November 2023, the U.S. Tax Court rendered its supplemental opinion related to our ongoing dispute with the Internal Revenue Service. We intend to move forward on appeal and vigorously defend our position. We have ample balance sheet flexibility to fund any payment related to the appeal. Finally, due to our reporting calendar, there will be one less day in the first quarter and two additional days in the fourth quarter. So in summary, we're pleased with what we accomplished in 2023, we're building on our capabilities to continue the underlying momentum across our markets, we're progressing on our refranchising agenda and we're reinvesting in our system to drive long-term growth. We have great confidence, we can deliver on our 2024 guidance and long-term commitments. With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have any additional questions, you may rejoin the queue. Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I know John just went through a lot of details on the guide, but I did just want to step back and maybe go to a higher level conversation on this, because for 2023, you ended up with high single digit earnings growth even with that 7 point currency headwind. And the initial guide for 2024 for mid-single digit earnings growth, feels like a reasonable starting point, but can you just contextualize a bit how you're thinking about the impact of hyperinflation like John mentioned in the Middle East tensions that consumer backdrop, et cetera. How you're able to kind of come through with that U.S. dollar based earnings growth outlook for the year? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Good morning. A couple of things. Firstly, the mid single digit growth in 2024 is after the impact of the refranchising that we pulled out. So in other words, pre-structural change that's really six to seven. Second, what I think 2024 represents is a -- ultimately a continuation of the underlying strength and momentum in the business that's being created. If you look at 2023 or you look all the way back to 2019, take five years if you like, what is captured within that is the kernel of the core business running at the top end of the growth algorithm. Yes, there has been inflation and distractions and up and downs, but in the end, running through that is a continuous amount of volume growth as we focus on our consumer franchise and keeping people in and growing the weekly plus consumers in our franchise, managing the cycle of inflation that is now distinct depending on where you are and well, but managing that cycle of inflation, such that we now have in the majority of the countries, 90% plus of the countries normalized levels of kind of pricing more or less coming out of 2023. And so, what you see in this guidance is really the core business in the 90 plus percent of the countries, really low -- taking that combination of headwinds and tailwinds that we've experienced, there'll be a different setting in 2024 that bound to be some new surprises. But we will manage through them with our all-weather strategy and deliver volume growth, growth in the consumer base with weekly plus, we'll earn our right to take an appropriate level of pricing and deliver at the top end of the growth algorithm. And then there's the overlay of the inflationary markets and the selling of the bottler, the bottling investment groups that we've done. And that hyperinflation upright is, as John said, a few points on the top. And obviously, some on the bottom and largely offset by the devaluation. So those two things go together, but captured within that is a strong core growing top and bottom, in-line with the growth algorithm.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey. Good morning. So maybe just a quick follow-up there. As you think about that 6% to 7% organic sales growth guidance for 2024, can you just give us a bit more detail on volume versus pricing on the underlying business, maybe extra hyperinflationary markets just as we think about that balance between volume and pricing. And then, James just more importantly longer-term, perhaps you could just take a step back and review your confidence in delivering that long-term top line algorithm and the higher end of that algorithm, just as you look out over the next few years, taking a look back at the last few years, there's obviously been a lot of volatility, hard for us to judge from an external perspective given all the volatility with COVID, but how do you think about sort of the success of the strategic initiatives you put in place the last few years, and what level of confidence that gives you in the long-term looking out a few years? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Look, I'm trying to justice the various angles that. Let me unpack a little bit 2023 -- the end of 2023 as a way of coming into 2024. In 2023, we had 2% volume growth, that was true in the fourth quarter and it was true through the year. And actually if you take a five year CAGR, we've been running at 2% volume growth for the last five years. So, to start with the volume, there has been strong underlying volume growth in the last quarter, in the last year, in the last five years. So that's there. And that's true because we focused on building momentum in the system around building the consumer franchise. When you look at how that's come along with pricing, obviously there's the pandemic, the ups and downs and inflation. But let's just break apart 2023 and how that then flows into 2024. If you look at the fourth quarter of 2023, it says 9%, yes, it says 9%. As John pointed out, there a couple of points there that's related to the intra year quarter-to-quarter deduction timing, so take off the two and you get a seven. Of the remaining seven, half of it is normal pricing in the 95% of the business, does not hyperinflationary. And the other 3.5% is in the hyperinflationary countries, because the inflation is so high. So really, what have you've got in the fourth quarter. You've got 2% volume, you've got 3.5%, a bit more than 3.5% price -- price mix and that's the call. There you've got something that's running bang in the center of the long-term growth algorithm of five to six on the topline. It was true in the fourth quarter, it's true as the kernel in the whole 2023, actually it's really true across the whole of the last five years. Once you take out some of these inflationary distortions in the selling of the bottling company. But there it is running the last quarter of last year, the last five years. Think about 2024, we're going to go as we've always said, for a balance of volume and price. In that 95% of the business, we're going to see volume growth and we're going to see normalized pricing growth on -- our aim is for the net of the two to be in that top end of the long-term growth algorithm for revenue growth. Yes, there's going to be an overlay of hyperinflation, that's probably more like a couple of points as we think about 2024 on the topline and that's why you get what we called out in terms of the topline growth. But hopefully that unpack a bit of how price mix has got this hyperinflationary distortion, it actually it's also got the selling of the bottlers, if you don't do it on comparable. But really embedded in that six to seven is a keep hitting the long-term growth [algorithm] (ph) on revenue for the kind of the six year. And we feel the momentum we've built with our bottling partners, investing in the marketing, the innovation, the in-store execution. The execution in the marketplace with the RGM strategies across the global profile of geographies gives us strong confidence we will continue with our momentum.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs . Please go ahead, your line is open.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Good morning. Actually, I had a question on gross margins. I was hoping for a little bit more color on the drivers of your expansion in Q4, which came in better than expected. And then could you highlight maybe the key puts and takes on margins this year. Curious, how much do you expect COGS inflation maybe to moderate or will higher sugar cost continue to be a big headwind? Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Bonnie. Let me start by just pickup from her. James has often step out of both the quarter and the year, if you look over the last four years our -- we've been able to sustain a pretty resilient gross margin line. And as we go into 2024, expect to be able to continue to do so. There's some expansion embedded in the long-term growth model and we're confident that we can continue to drive that. With respect to 2023, the key ingredients, so to speak were the impact of the various pricing actions. We've had around the world, somewhat offset by higher than the normal inflation with some of our commodity items, and some our non-commodity costs. But overall for 2023, that's the key story. In 2024, I think you\u2019ll need to take into account the mechanical impact of the refranchising of those markets that we talked about in the release that will layer in throughout 2024. Keep in mind to the impact of foreign currency headwinds. I think, against that, then we will continue to drive the levers that we have. I've talked about this in the past, but maybe worth just highlighting. We start really with the -- with that suite of revenue growth management tools and the many actions that we can take with that. We have a very resilient supply chain, tremendous partners across the supply chain. We source mostly locally and we continue to drive through our scale a lot of productivity and in almost each line item of what comprises the supply chain. So going into 2024, I think it's worth just reiterating, well we expect to see margin expansion. Some of it driven by that mechanical effect of the bottler refranchising. And with some more normalized costs inflation relative to the last couple of years, plus continuing to deploy those levers. I talked about, we see the opportunity to continue to drive per our long-term growth model expansion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nBryan Spillane: Hey. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to just drill in a little bit more on North America. And James, I think on the last earnings call, you talked a little bit about channel shift, right like on-premise or foodservice maybe growing faster than some of the take home channels, there were some commentary, I think also about or observations, I should say about maybe low income consumers. So maybe just kind of state of things there. And John, just if you can also clarify, I think in the press release there was a mentioned in the description around price mix, some sort of adjustment, so wasn't sure if that's an accrual related to promotions or just if you could just give us a little bit more color on that as well. And also, it sounds like it's concentrate shipments might have lagged in the quarter, so that we make that up in the first quarter. There's a lot there, but if you guys can just fill in that would be helpful. Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Yes. Let me take the end. And then I'll pass it over to James for the beginning. The mix that you referred to is timing related and it's not unusual in the fourth quarter to have timing related items, and in the deductions area, particularly, that will flow back through into next year.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Consumer, let me go with two things. One, clearly the consumer landscape in North America, one has to not think of it in aggregate, because actually in aggregate, the U.S. consumer spending power has held up pretty strongly compared to some other developed markets. What has been important is to understand, there is a section of the population that has come under pressure from disposable income, the real spending power squeeze from the inflationary effects and there we are very much focused on affordability. And you could perhaps argue that some of them went out less, there was more at-home purchases. Some of the certain channels and there we really focus with affordability, both from pack size --individual pack size and with multi packs. On the other hand, there a segment of consumers that still have plenty of money, plenty of purchasing power and we've seen strong growth for some of the higher price point premium segments like fairlike core power. Simply, some of those ones, so there's clearly a multiple things going on in the landscape in terms of categories and price points and we've been working to address both ends of those. And as it relates to channels, I think we've seen the kind of re-normalization, there has been a historic slight shift in volume consumption from at-home to away over time. Clearly through COVID, there was a big down in the away from home and then a rebound in 2021 the away from home channels. In 2022 they stay out, but they continue to outpace at-homes. In 2023, they were slightly ahead of at-home. If you look at the various away from home channels, they were slightly ahead of at-home. I would say that landing more in what it was previous to COVID kind of the more normal situation. So that's kind of what I would say strong need to focus on the different consumer segments and the sort of re-normalization of the -- some of the channel dynamics.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nStephen Powers: Great. Thank you. Good morning. Two questions if I could, I know I'm supposed to have one, but one to quick. Just on the -- so if you could clarify, maybe it's for John, you called out the 2% to 3% currency headwind for next year on the revenue, but a 4% to 5% headwind on EPS. Just if you could, how much of that incremental bottom line headwinds is going to show up in operating profit versus below the line, given monetary asset revaluation, et cetera. And then, I guess the broader question is just thinking about all the refranchising activity and the system progress that you've made in 2023, we talked about the financial impacts of that in 2024, but I guess I'd love your perspective, James, on the importance of the steps you made in 2023 in terms of just betterment of the system overall and priorities going forward from a system evolution perspective. Thank you.\nJohn Murphy: Okay. Shall I start at this time? And then you go second, John.\nJohn Murphy: Sure.\nJames Quincey: Look, we have been focused on our refranchising effort. And as I like John's raised, our ambition is to be the world's smallest bottler. It still remains absolutely true, but we're going to do it at the pace. We sort of make sure we do the refranchising in the right way with the right partners. I think we can categorically say we're very pleased with the refranchising process that we have undertaken over the last number of years. Almost without exception, every time we've poured one of the bottling companies into the hands of the right partner with the joint vision and investment plan to take the business forward. We have stepped up performance, whether it be a straight refranchising or a combination, creating new bottlers or evolve bottlers, we have up to a level of performance. And I think that is a sign of the commitment of the company to invest in what it does best, which is the branding, the marketing, the innovation, working with our bottlers to get the revenue growth management and their unwavering commitment to drive execution and build capabilities and capacities in the marketplace. And that does help, Power, the overall performance I talked about in the answer to the previous questions. So, as -- I think we're in the penultimate chapter of the refranchising. There's only really a couple of pieces left at the right time with the right partners, we would like to finish the play. But really, we have our eye on the prize on creating a much stronger system together with our bottling partners to continue the top of the algorithm momentum very far into the future.\nJohn Murphy: Great. And on currency, Steve. Let me just make a couple of comments in case there are other questions out there on currency overall. First of all, I think it's important to highlight the 2024 guidance that we've given. It would be close to flat if we were to exclude those few hyperinflationary markets. And it just reinforces the point that we're making on that sort of distortion that those few markets have. And then secondly, with regards to your specific question, I do not have that breakdown. Today, there is just too many -- there's just too many puts and takes, particularly in that below the operating income line as we go through the year. You got to do a monthly remeasurement on the balance sheet items. And that's just a calculation, that's -- I don't have the ability to predict with great detail. So I just keep in mind that the overall impact I think is the one to focus on. In normal years the multiplier is 1.5 times to 2 times, we would continue to assume that will be the case going forward. But these hyperinflationary markets have a tenancy to create that distortion that we've highlighted and we\u2019ll continue to provide guidance as we go through the year to make sure that everybody stays abreast of the latest developments.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. So, James, I think you made a very strong case that really over the last five years, if you accept the noise you've delivered at roughly kind of 5.5%, topline growth, which puts you clearly in the top rankings of your other staples companies. And that's great. In terms of both 2024 and looking forward, assuming a continuation of that, what can you do to both derisk that in terms of the bottom line and enhance it in terms of the bottom line given various macro variables. And then given that you've now de-levered to 1.7%, you've shown interest in buying back stock. Should we think of share buybacks as perhaps a greater part of the overall algorithm and value creation for shareholders going forward. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Okay. So, I mean I think the derisking, I think what I would say is, look, we face an extraordinary number of headwinds in the last five years and still delivered at the top end of the algorithm. Things will happen in the coming years. But there'll be tailwinds and I think really the argument about the all-weather is, I cannot tell you what the future holds. But if you look at what we've managed to work through and deliver at the top end on the revenue. And the momentum and the capabilities that we've built in the system. And actually if you look at the share and look at our long-term performance, we are also gaining share within the industry, I think you can see a head of steam builds upon momentum and at the scale that we operate, it's a very compelling way to drive it forward. And as that feeds down into the bottom line, obviously, the mid-single digits, the U.S. dollar EPS goal for 2024 includes the disposal of 2 points of EPS from the bottling system. So kind of on an ongoing basis, that's already six to seven. I think we can continue to drive some leverage from the topline to the bottom line in dollars, and that becomes a compelling compound over time. And as it relates to cash, I think that you will see -- we've put in a kind of a new non-GAAP metric, somewhere in the ecosystem of the website, which just calls out what John was talking about, about the number of discrete items that are coming up over the next couple of years. As it relates to transition tax actually curiously tax on the M&A transactions, if you sell a bottler, the money you get disappears into one account, for the taxes you pay goes into the free cash flow curiously enough. So there's a whole set of discrete items that make the free cash flow look odd for the next few years. But if you strip that out, you see that the earnings are flowing into free cash flow. The cash conversion on that adjusted basis remains very high and is likely to do so. So on a -- in a normal world, clearly, as John said, we will continue to increase our dividend and we would have substantive additional cash to continue to invest in the business and consider potential share repurchases. The wrinkle in the cream, if you like, is our considerations of the IRS tax case and the impending appeal. And so, as we go forward for the next few years, we like our strong balance sheet, we are mindful of the likelihood of launching the appeal in the second half. We have incoming non-operating cash flows, which as John talked about, we used to buy some shares in the fourth quarter. We're going to balance all these things, particularly in the next couple of years, we'll keep everyone updated. But I think the long-term perspective is that, the cash generation will continue to be very strong. John, yes, go on.\nJohn Murphy: Just one additional point. In addition to that, unwavering commitment we have to the dividend that we talked about in the script. One of the lessons I think over the last couple of years is to be prepared to be more dynamic relative to your kind of normal view of the individual components. So, as you know, our debt -- our debt goal is to be 2 times to 2.5 times, and we're up 1.7 times. We think that's right for what we need going into 2024, 2025. We've taken up our CapEx for 2024 because it's the right thing to do to continue to build the growth foundations that we need. And in those parts of the business that need capacity. Just two examples. And so, I think we will continue to demonstrate that as we go forward, the share repurchases in the back half of the year, again was not something that we had necessarily considered at the start of the year. But we first, there was an opportunity with the buffer proceeds coming in to do so. And we continue to take that approach as we enter this coming year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. I wanted to see if you could maybe frame the global away from home channel. I know you touched on it a little bit in response to Brian's question. But we've heard about, obviously there's a lot of pricing power in that channel, there's been a lot of pricing, you're talking about a normalization from elevated levels back to a more normal channel distribution between at-home and away from home. But can you maybe just give us a bit more granular perspective on what you're seeing by region and whether some of the strengths that I think was occurring in Q4 has continued into this year. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Sure, Chris. I'll give it a go. Look, I think that the headline is the commentary about North America to some extent applies -- to some extent applies everywhere else in the sense that clearly in COVID there was the close downs, the reopening, big swings between away from home and at-home. But in 2022, it kind of re normalized. And I think overall in 2023, you see that again, you saw that in the U.S. where the away from home channels in aggregate was slightly ahead of the at-home channels. You see that also in Europe or the EMEA segment, you see the at-home slightly high, but it's only marginal. And when you break it down, I mean there's going to be the kind of continuing structural growth of away from home. But it's only a small fraction. If that's a sort of leading to a question about pricing. And is there some ongoing likelihood of big upside from kind of channel mix, the short answer is, no. If I were to take a proxy of immediate consumption packages in future comps and consumption packages, because channel mix becomes very different as you get to different parts of the world, particularly the emerging markets. Then they became much more -- the kind of the immediate consumption came much more into balance versus the future consumption in 2023 relative to 2022. And that's not too surprising as we stopped also [indiscernible] affordability having been a strategy in 2023. So that's a roundabout way of saying, we're not expecting big mix effects from channel in 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. And good morning, everyone. So James, can you comment a little bit about the U.S., I understand obviously U.S. is not -- in terms of the volumes, it's about 20%, but within our -- your outlook for 2024, you quoted in the fourth quarter that water sports coffee were more negative or decelerating. And how about -- what is of that is like mostly self-inflicted vis-a-vis what you're actually facing in terms of market share and how much you expect that to be lingering into the first half of 2024? And just a clarification to your comment now in terms of like to shifting to on-premise in back to your comments on price mix. Out of the 9% that you got, if my math is correct, you've got about 2% or 3% benefit from mix in 2023. Should we expect that to decelerate or with your efforts to do more mini cans and take that more broadly? Is that still going to be the projected contribution for 2024? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Okay. The comments on the 2% in the fourth quarter, that was related not to channel mix. But to the right -- the way that deductions happens, so this is not -- this is often just an accounting treatment between the quarters within the year. So it's not mix as you would think about it in terms of package mix or channel mix of category mix. This is related to kind of the big difference between gross and net revenue. And so, I -- it's a distraction in the short-term. So I would move past backlog. And if you like -- to me, ignore that bit, focus instead on the underlying impact in 2023 of the non-hyperinflationary pricing, which was the kind of 3.5% which is very -- which ran through 2023 and is inherent in what we are saying roughly speaking for 2024. So we're expecting, right and mix whether these channel category geography package, the sort of things we were saying, which in 2023 is what we're expecting in 2024. And again, those are all largely normalized in 2023, so by influence, they're all largely normalized in 2024 as well. So you kind of see a stability across channels packages, et cetera, et cetera. As it relates more specifically to the U.S., yes, we did some de-prioritization of some of the bulk water categories. And some of the advanced hydration was the normalization or re-stabilization of the sports drinks category. I mean, I don't think there's a -- an obvious or useful split between self-inflicted or proactive decisions versus things that were competitive, that's hard to tease apart. Clearly from a performance point of view, when we think about it in the U.S., yes, there's a fractional softening of the volume through the year, which I think goes back to the comment I made about the different consumer segments. But if you step back and think about what was the overall impact of our marketing innovation RGM and execution with the bottlers, the answer is, we want volume share in 2023, and we want value share in 2023. So yes, there's work to be done in the water category and advance hydration then to a much lesser extent in tea. But the overall picture is strong growth in sparkling particularly, Coke and Sprite, good on smart water, good on vitamin water, good on Topo Chico. Very good on fairlife. Good overall win on both dimensions. And that's the platform we'll be looking to drive in 2024.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nBill Chappell: Yes. Good morning.\nJames Quincey: Hey, Bill.\nBill Chappell: Just a question on kind of the Chinese -- China consumer and both kind of how it's progressed or how he or she has progressed over the past few months versus your expectations or just in general and kind of what you see kind of spending power and just getting back to normal consumption as we move into 2024.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Let me put it out. 2023 started very strongly in China, we had invested very heavily behind Chinese New Year. And we had a very -- actually we had a very strong first quarter last year in China. And then, which is kind of still the back end of the re-openings, and while we grew volumes for the restaurant for the total of the year 2023 and revenues, it did soften for the last three quarters of the year in China. And I think what we're going to see is a kind of a reverse of that in 2024. We've invested strongly again in Chinese New Year. This year, we won't know the result for another few weeks net-net. But we're kind of expecting it to be a little slower in the first quarter, especially given what we are cycling from last year. And then for the year to improve, but not too hot or not too cold, if I can use that analogy. So yes, there's a little weakness in the economic system. But we expect things to get -- we get [tends] (ph) directionally to get better through the year and we're going to keep investing behind not just keep key moments in the year like Chinese New Year but restoring more momentum to sparkling and really focusing on RGM and execution opportunities.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hey, everybody. Good morning. When we met in December, we talked a little bit about 2023, there is a bunch of testing and learning on innovation and 2024 will be about scaling some of them. Both of you mentioned fairlife core power, it's a big brand now. Can you maybe just talk about the scaling of that capacity expansion. And then maybe what other brands we should be considering in that same context? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Sure. I mean, firstly, we're going to continue to experiment and find lots of new things hopefully in 2024, but it's certainly true as say that fairlife has been on a roll. And we have been driving that. I think you should have noted a double digit volume growth for as many years I can remember plus faster double digits in revenue. Clearly, as we scale that we needed to put that more capacity. We have recently announced and begun the process of building a mega plant up in upstate New York. And so, capacity tight in the fairlife business and core power is also firing on all cylinders. We'll certainly talk about some of these at CAGNY when we'll kind of lay out some of the back story. I think it's like fairlife and particularly core power and how these brands and products have done a great job in driving from experimentation to scaling, the challenging and, for example, in the case of core power to leading.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator. And good morning, everyone. So, James, I was hoping to pick up on your commentary in response to Bryan and Andrea's question on the U.S. Maybe, first, the performance in the quarter play out as you expected, you mentioned softening in the market in your response to Andrea. But was that in-line with how you thought growth would evolve or was it a bit weaker than you would have anticipated? And then looking ahead to 2024, I appreciate the commentary on expecting balanced growth at the total company level, but do you expect that balance to incur in North America as well? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Look, I mean, I think it was at a macro level foreseeable that the market would get tied-up through the course of 2023 as inflation run ahead of wage growth. And so, therefore, yes, it wasn't surprising that would tightness, particularly for certain -- for certain consumer segments. I think all things in due proportion. I mean, the growth in North America in the fourth quarter was basically the same as the growth in the full year, it's only very fractional differences. So, I think these are not big changes in trends. But yes, I think there was a little softening through the -- through 2023. And I think we'll see that kind of a bidding reverse as 2024 starts off as consumers and you can see it in the confidence indicators, the consumers, they're starting to feel like the money coming in is starting to contain and get ahead of the inflation. So I think we'll see that improve through the year, again, all in due proportion, they're not going to be big shifts in the volume growth rate in the U.S. business. In aggregate, we would expect to get more from price relative to volume for the U.S. business. So the balance that I talk about between price and volume applies on a global basis clearly that's been made up of geographic portfolio mix, so places like the U.S., we'd expect to see stable or slightly increasing volume with decent pricing, all the way over to place like India, where clearly we're getting much more volume than price and having to invest significantly in capacity. And those two -- take those two examples, so that's true of the global portfolio, blend it all together and that's where the balance comes from.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charlie Higgs from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nCharlie Higgs: Yeah. Hi, James, John, hope you both are well. I got a question on sparkling, please, where I mean, 2% volume growth in the quarter and the year very strong. I think in the 20 quarters since 2019, it's actually averaged 3% in those 20 quarters. So definitely testing our ex-growth. I was just wondering what your perspective is on the category going forward, maybe with the consumer weakening. And if you can just touch on the launch of Coca-Cola space, so [indiscernible] talked about that yet. I mean, what gives you the confidence of launching this as a permanent launch rather than that a limited edition Coke Creations launch and here's the target consumers are going have to Gen Z, is it adds to held for Coke with meals strategy. Just any color on that be useful, please.\nJames Quincey: Yes. I mean, Coke Space, bit like Coke Creations, not exactly, but it is really aimed at increasing connectivity with Gen Z and the broad consumers, driving engagement -- driving reconsideration is part of a whole overall strategy that as you say we've been deploying for a good number of years, that has really worked to reengage consumers with the Coke trademark, whether it's Coke original, Coke Zero Sugar or even Diet Coke to some extent. The overall strategy of an upgraded approach to the marketing, the innovation whether it's Coke's Space or some of the Creations through the RGM in the execution has allowed us to drive our Coke growth across the global business. And actually by also increasing the focus on Fanta and Sprite even organizationally splitting them out into two sub teams within the organization has allowed us to bring more clarity and more focus onto Fanta and to Sprite and to drive growth there, too. Which has worked in Q4 in 2023 and as you say, over the last five years. I know that sometimes people -- well, I would say that people think about the sparkling category just through the optic of the U.S. over the last 20 years. And I would invite you to look at the optics or everyone to look at the optics of the sparkling category globally all the time, and actually there, you see that the category remains robust on a global scale, both in terms of volume and revenue growth. And of course we are not just the leaders, but we are the share winners, so we see -- if we do the right things for our brands, we will be able to drive the category forward and benefit disproportionately from that growth.\nOperator: Our last question today will come from Carlos Laboy from HSBC. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nCarlos Laboy: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Can you comment for us on the state of global independent bottlers CapEx or digital capabilities, we've seen a really robust Latin American digital investment over the last four years or five years, but where else do you see a step up in digital market development capabilities like this. And can you comment on the U.S. in this area as well.\nJames Quincey: On U.S., what?\nCarlos Laboy: On the U.S. regarding digital bottling system investments.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Carlos, yes. I think it's fair to say that the overall investment levels that you referred to in Lat-Am are pretty consistent across the world. Like one of the underlying tailwinds, I believe we have is the degree to which our system is sharing and thus the opportunity that's ahead and willing to increasingly invest ahead of the curve. So I think that's happening across the global system. One of the subsets of that, of course, is the degree to which digital, and its many forms is playing a pivotal role to sustaining and indeed building advantage wherever we operate. We have CAGNY next week. And I think you'll hear more of that threaded through the conversation we'll see up there. But safe to say, I think CapEx levels are at the highest as a percentage of system revenue that I can remember. And within that the appetite and willingness to invest ahead of the curve, particularly in digital is also at a very high level.\nCarlos Laboy: Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Right. Thanks very much, everyone. Just to summarize, we're proud of what we've accomplished in 2023. We are winning in the marketplace, we're going to be maintaining agility and improving every aspect of how we do business across our total beverage portfolio. John and I look forward to discussing more with you all next week at CAGNY. Thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and joining us this morning. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Quincey",
            "content": "Thanks, Robin. And good morning, everyone. In 2023, we achieved our near-term goals, while also positioning our business for the long-term. Our all-weather strategy delivered 8% comparable earnings per share growth despite greater than expected 7% currency headwinds. Today, we are leveraging our scale globally and winning locally, which gives us confidence that we can deliver on our 2024 guidance. This morning, I'll talk about the global consumer landscape, then I'll highlight how our strategy and enhanced capabilities are making us a more agile and effective organization. And finally, John will discuss our financial results and our 2024 guidance. During the quarter, we benefited from strong performance across many of our markets. However, some were impacted by elevated inflation and others by geopolitical tensions and conflict. We delivered 12% organic revenue growth, which included 2 points of volume growth, continuing a positive volume trend for the year. Throughout, we continue to invest in our business to provide the right portfolio of brands and packages to retain and attract more drinkers. We drove industry growth and delivered value share gains in the quarter and for the full year. We achieved these results by effectively navigating a number of headwinds and capitalizing on tailwinds across our markets. During the quarter, we saw strong consumer demand across Australia, India, Latin America, Japan and South Korea. In North America, consumer spending in aggregate is holding up well. And in Europe, consumers remain cost conscious. In Africa and China, the macro environment remains uncertain. And in the Middle East, tensions have resulted in some shapes in consumer behavior that have had an impact on our business. Another important fact that I highlight is the inflationary pressures, which are moderating or stabilizing across most of our markets. To keep consumers in our franchise, we are leveraging our revenue growth management capabilities to tailor our offerings and price pack architecture to meet consumers' evolving needs. In North America and Europe, while inflation is moderating, the cumulative impact of inflation is pressuring certain consumer segments we're seeking value. Throughout 2023, we increased our affordability offerings and one volume and value share in both regions. In Latin America, despite double digit inflation during the fourth quarter, we grew volume 4% and increased household penetration and basket initiatives. There are a few pockets of the world that are experiencing hyperinflation. John will later speak to how this dynamic is impacting our business. However, I did want to mention that our local franchise operating model allows us to navigate through hyperinflationary environment and then gain an advantage over the long-term. Across our business, we continue to prioritize agility and focus on improving every aspect of how we operate. An important part of this is our marketing transformation. To recruit the next generation of drinkers, our marketing has shifted from a TV centric model to a digital first organization that balances local intimacy, scale and flexibility. Our digital mix has gone from less than 30% in 2019 to approximately 60% of our total media spend. In 2023, we stood up Studio X, the digital ecosystem that brings this altogether. We created physical hubs in each of our operating units to integrate disciplines, standardized data and technology and step change our capabilities. Creative, media, social and production capabilities and now operating at scale connected by our global network structure. In our previous model, it took several months to create a TV ad. Now, we're producing thousands of pieces of digital content that are contextually relevant and measuring these results in real-time. Studio X is driving tangible results. For example, Coke Studio which originated in Pakistan and taps into consumers' passion for music has been scale to our top 40 markets. The campaign uses packaging as digital portals to access real magic experiences, which have generated more than 1.2 billion YouTube views and a 100 million music streams this year, resulting in strong recruitment of Gen Z drinkers. We're engaging differently with consumers and is delivering results. In 2023, according to Cantor, Coca-Cola brand value increased $8 billion. Coke is now the 10th most valuable brand in the world, up seven spots from the prior year. In the US, Sprite was named by Morning Consult as the number one beverage brands for Gen Z drinkers. We were also named one of the top 10 innovative companies in augmented and virtual reality by Fast Company. Our innovation agenda is increasing our competitive advantage across our products, packaging and equipment. Taste is the starting point. Simply put, people want drinks to taste great. To drive superiority across our total beverage portfolio, we're continuing to build capabilities to tap into unique insights in taste and aroma sciences. We're applying digital tools, ingredient processing technology and AI to create bolder and more successful innovations. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar is an ongoing example of how superior taste drives demand, with volume that grew 5% in 2023, leading to continued volume and value share gains. We are applying learnings from this multiyear success and driving taste superiority elsewhere in our sparkling portfolio. In 2023, we launched Sprite and Fanta reformulations in 25 markets, delivering mid-single digit volume growth in those markets and driving overall sparkling flavors value share gains. Outside of our sparkling portfolio, we're dialing up flavor profiles, adding functional benefits and expanding into new categories. In Japan, we relaunched Georgia Coffee, which generated broader customer interest and led to value share gains. In the US, fairlife's Core Power and nutrition plan of a high protein dairy without compromising taste. In 2023, fairlife grew volume 15%, its 9th consecutive year of double digit volume growth. We're also seeing continued promising results from FUZE Tea across Europe, Jack and Coke in the Philippines, Flashlight in Mexico, among many others. In 2023, innovation contributed to approximately 30% of gross profit growth and our success rates have nearly tripled compared to 2019 levels. Our revenue growth management execution capabilities continue to be distinct advantages. As demonstrated by our ability to deliver volume and transaction growth, despite ongoing inflationary pressures. We're working with our bottling partners to capture every opportunity available to create significant value for consumers and customers. By offering a total beverage portfolio in the right packages and at the right price points, we're driving category expansion and becoming more relevant to more consumers and customers. In North America, we're evolving packaging options across more distribution points, drive affordability and premiumization. On the affordability side, our 1.25 liter PET bottles are now available in 80% of supermarkets and our 16 ounce can distribution increased by 14 points in convenience stores during 2023. We're also focused on premiumization through the expansion of our mini can offerings. During the quarter, we launched 15 pack mini cans in grocery and club channels. In Europe, we're leveraging the same playbook, but adapting it to local needs. In Spain, our 1.25 liter PET package is offered at a compelling price point and it drove 16% volume growth and increased household penetration in 2023. In Italy, Britain and Ireland, we drove premium single serve mini cans, a smaller package offerings to generate positive mix and incremental retail sales. Our franchise system uniquely combines the benefits of scale and knowledge sharing with the know-how needed to execute for customers and win locally in many different operating environments. For example, approximately 70% of purchase decisions are influenced at point of sale, our systems stepped up in-store displays during the quarter which drove incremental retail sales and cross selling opportunities. Putting it all together, we created $15 billion in incremental retail sales for our customers in 2023, more than any other beverage company. This was our sixth year in a row as the leader in value creation. While we're pleased with our progress, we recognize there's still much work to be done to capture the vast opportunities available. Our system is galvanized to move further and faster. Before I hand over to John, I want to acknowledge that none of this could happen without the unwavering dedication of our employees. And so as we turn to 2024, we expect the year will bring new challenges and opportunities. And we'll remain ready to respond through continuing to improve execution of our strategy across our total beverage portfolio. I look forward to sharing more next Tuesday at CAGNY and I encourage everyone to listen in. With that, I will turn the call over to John. Yeah. Good morning. A couple of things. Firstly, the mid single digit growth in 2024 is after the impact of the refranchising that we pulled out. So in other words, pre-structural change that's really six to seven. Second, what I think 2024 represents is a -- ultimately a continuation of the underlying strength and momentum in the business that's being created. If you look at 2023 or you look all the way back to 2019, take five years if you like, what is captured within that is the kernel of the core business running at the top end of the growth algorithm. Yes, there has been inflation and distractions and up and downs, but in the end, running through that is a continuous amount of volume growth as we focus on our consumer franchise and keeping people in and growing the weekly plus consumers in our franchise, managing the cycle of inflation that is now distinct depending on where you are and well, but managing that cycle of inflation, such that we now have in the majority of the countries, 90% plus of the countries normalized levels of kind of pricing more or less coming out of 2023. And so, what you see in this guidance is really the core business in the 90 plus percent of the countries, really low -- taking that combination of headwinds and tailwinds that we've experienced, there'll be a different setting in 2024 that bound to be some new surprises. But we will manage through them with our all-weather strategy and deliver volume growth, growth in the consumer base with weekly plus, we'll earn our right to take an appropriate level of pricing and deliver at the top end of the growth algorithm. And then there's the overlay of the inflationary markets and the selling of the bottler, the bottling investment groups that we've done. And that hyperinflation upright is, as John said, a few points on the top. And obviously, some on the bottom and largely offset by the devaluation. So those two things go together, but captured within that is a strong core growing top and bottom, in-line with the growth algorithm. Sure. Look, I'm trying to justice the various angles that. Let me unpack a little bit 2023 -- the end of 2023 as a way of coming into 2024. In 2023, we had 2% volume growth, that was true in the fourth quarter and it was true through the year. And actually if you take a five year CAGR, we've been running at 2% volume growth for the last five years. So, to start with the volume, there has been strong underlying volume growth in the last quarter, in the last year, in the last five years. So that's there. And that's true because we focused on building momentum in the system around building the consumer franchise. When you look at how that's come along with pricing, obviously there's the pandemic, the ups and downs and inflation. But let's just break apart 2023 and how that then flows into 2024. If you look at the fourth quarter of 2023, it says 9%, yes, it says 9%. As John pointed out, there a couple of points there that's related to the intra year quarter-to-quarter deduction timing, so take off the two and you get a seven. Of the remaining seven, half of it is normal pricing in the 95% of the business, does not hyperinflationary. And the other 3.5% is in the hyperinflationary countries, because the inflation is so high. So really, what have you've got in the fourth quarter. You've got 2% volume, you've got 3.5%, a bit more than 3.5% price -- price mix and that's the call. There you've got something that's running bang in the center of the long-term growth algorithm of five to six on the topline. It was true in the fourth quarter, it's true as the kernel in the whole 2023, actually it's really true across the whole of the last five years. Once you take out some of these inflationary distortions in the selling of the bottling company. But there it is running the last quarter of last year, the last five years. Think about 2024, we're going to go as we've always said, for a balance of volume and price. In that 95% of the business, we're going to see volume growth and we're going to see normalized pricing growth on -- our aim is for the net of the two to be in that top end of the long-term growth algorithm for revenue growth. Yes, there's going to be an overlay of hyperinflation, that's probably more like a couple of points as we think about 2024 on the topline and that's why you get what we called out in terms of the topline growth. But hopefully that unpack a bit of how price mix has got this hyperinflationary distortion, it actually it's also got the selling of the bottlers, if you don't do it on comparable. But really embedded in that six to seven is a keep hitting the long-term growth [algorithm] (ph) on revenue for the kind of the six year. And we feel the momentum we've built with our bottling partners, investing in the marketing, the innovation, the in-store execution. The execution in the marketplace with the RGM strategies across the global profile of geographies gives us strong confidence we will continue with our momentum. Yes. Consumer, let me go with two things. One, clearly the consumer landscape in North America, one has to not think of it in aggregate, because actually in aggregate, the U.S. consumer spending power has held up pretty strongly compared to some other developed markets. What has been important is to understand, there is a section of the population that has come under pressure from disposable income, the real spending power squeeze from the inflationary effects and there we are very much focused on affordability. And you could perhaps argue that some of them went out less, there was more at-home purchases. Some of the certain channels and there we really focus with affordability, both from pack size --individual pack size and with multi packs. On the other hand, there a segment of consumers that still have plenty of money, plenty of purchasing power and we've seen strong growth for some of the higher price point premium segments like fairlike core power. Simply, some of those ones, so there's clearly a multiple things going on in the landscape in terms of categories and price points and we've been working to address both ends of those. And as it relates to channels, I think we've seen the kind of re-normalization, there has been a historic slight shift in volume consumption from at-home to away over time. Clearly through COVID, there was a big down in the away from home and then a rebound in 2021 the away from home channels. In 2022 they stay out, but they continue to outpace at-homes. In 2023, they were slightly ahead of at-home. If you look at the various away from home channels, they were slightly ahead of at-home. I would say that landing more in what it was previous to COVID kind of the more normal situation. So that's kind of what I would say strong need to focus on the different consumer segments and the sort of re-normalization of the -- some of the channel dynamics. Look, we have been focused on our refranchising effort. And as I like John's raised, our ambition is to be the world's smallest bottler. It still remains absolutely true, but we're going to do it at the pace. We sort of make sure we do the refranchising in the right way with the right partners. I think we can categorically say we're very pleased with the refranchising process that we have undertaken over the last number of years. Almost without exception, every time we've poured one of the bottling companies into the hands of the right partner with the joint vision and investment plan to take the business forward. We have stepped up performance, whether it be a straight refranchising or a combination, creating new bottlers or evolve bottlers, we have up to a level of performance. And I think that is a sign of the commitment of the company to invest in what it does best, which is the branding, the marketing, the innovation, working with our bottlers to get the revenue growth management and their unwavering commitment to drive execution and build capabilities and capacities in the marketplace. And that does help, Power, the overall performance I talked about in the answer to the previous questions. So, as -- I think we're in the penultimate chapter of the refranchising. There's only really a couple of pieces left at the right time with the right partners, we would like to finish the play. But really, we have our eye on the prize on creating a much stronger system together with our bottling partners to continue the top of the algorithm momentum very far into the future. Okay. So, I mean I think the derisking, I think what I would say is, look, we face an extraordinary number of headwinds in the last five years and still delivered at the top end of the algorithm. Things will happen in the coming years. But there'll be tailwinds and I think really the argument about the all-weather is, I cannot tell you what the future holds. But if you look at what we've managed to work through and deliver at the top end on the revenue. And the momentum and the capabilities that we've built in the system. And actually if you look at the share and look at our long-term performance, we are also gaining share within the industry, I think you can see a head of steam builds upon momentum and at the scale that we operate, it's a very compelling way to drive it forward. And as that feeds down into the bottom line, obviously, the mid-single digits, the U.S. dollar EPS goal for 2024 includes the disposal of 2 points of EPS from the bottling system. So kind of on an ongoing basis, that's already six to seven. I think we can continue to drive some leverage from the topline to the bottom line in dollars, and that becomes a compelling compound over time. And as it relates to cash, I think that you will see -- we've put in a kind of a new non-GAAP metric, somewhere in the ecosystem of the website, which just calls out what John was talking about, about the number of discrete items that are coming up over the next couple of years. As it relates to transition tax actually curiously tax on the M&A transactions, if you sell a bottler, the money you get disappears into one account, for the taxes you pay goes into the free cash flow curiously enough. So there's a whole set of discrete items that make the free cash flow look odd for the next few years. But if you strip that out, you see that the earnings are flowing into free cash flow. The cash conversion on that adjusted basis remains very high and is likely to do so. So on a -- in a normal world, clearly, as John said, we will continue to increase our dividend and we would have substantive additional cash to continue to invest in the business and consider potential share repurchases. The wrinkle in the cream, if you like, is our considerations of the IRS tax case and the impending appeal. And so, as we go forward for the next few years, we like our strong balance sheet, we are mindful of the likelihood of launching the appeal in the second half. We have incoming non-operating cash flows, which as John talked about, we used to buy some shares in the fourth quarter. We're going to balance all these things, particularly in the next couple of years, we'll keep everyone updated. But I think the long-term perspective is that, the cash generation will continue to be very strong. John, yes, go on. Yes. Sure, Chris. I'll give it a go. Look, I think that the headline is the commentary about North America to some extent applies -- to some extent applies everywhere else in the sense that clearly in COVID there was the close downs, the reopening, big swings between away from home and at-home. But in 2022, it kind of re normalized. And I think overall in 2023, you see that again, you saw that in the U.S. where the away from home channels in aggregate was slightly ahead of the at-home channels. You see that also in Europe or the EMEA segment, you see the at-home slightly high, but it's only marginal. And when you break it down, I mean there's going to be the kind of continuing structural growth of away from home. But it's only a small fraction. If that's a sort of leading to a question about pricing. And is there some ongoing likelihood of big upside from kind of channel mix, the short answer is, no. If I were to take a proxy of immediate consumption packages in future comps and consumption packages, because channel mix becomes very different as you get to different parts of the world, particularly the emerging markets. Then they became much more -- the kind of the immediate consumption came much more into balance versus the future consumption in 2023 relative to 2022. And that's not too surprising as we stopped also [indiscernible] affordability having been a strategy in 2023. So that's a roundabout way of saying, we're not expecting big mix effects from channel in 2024. Sure. Okay. The comments on the 2% in the fourth quarter, that was related not to channel mix. But to the right -- the way that deductions happens, so this is not -- this is often just an accounting treatment between the quarters within the year. So it's not mix as you would think about it in terms of package mix or channel mix of category mix. This is related to kind of the big difference between gross and net revenue. And so, I -- it's a distraction in the short-term. So I would move past backlog. And if you like -- to me, ignore that bit, focus instead on the underlying impact in 2023 of the non-hyperinflationary pricing, which was the kind of 3.5% which is very -- which ran through 2023 and is inherent in what we are saying roughly speaking for 2024. So we're expecting, right and mix whether these channel category geography package, the sort of things we were saying, which in 2023 is what we're expecting in 2024. And again, those are all largely normalized in 2023, so by influence, they're all largely normalized in 2024 as well. So you kind of see a stability across channels packages, et cetera, et cetera. As it relates more specifically to the U.S., yes, we did some de-prioritization of some of the bulk water categories. And some of the advanced hydration was the normalization or re-stabilization of the sports drinks category. I mean, I don't think there's a -- an obvious or useful split between self-inflicted or proactive decisions versus things that were competitive, that's hard to tease apart. Clearly from a performance point of view, when we think about it in the U.S., yes, there's a fractional softening of the volume through the year, which I think goes back to the comment I made about the different consumer segments. But if you step back and think about what was the overall impact of our marketing innovation RGM and execution with the bottlers, the answer is, we want volume share in 2023, and we want value share in 2023. So yes, there's work to be done in the water category and advance hydration then to a much lesser extent in tea. But the overall picture is strong growth in sparkling particularly, Coke and Sprite, good on smart water, good on vitamin water, good on Topo Chico. Very good on fairlife. Good overall win on both dimensions. And that's the platform we'll be looking to drive in 2024. Hey, Bill. Sure. Let me put it out. 2023 started very strongly in China, we had invested very heavily behind Chinese New Year. And we had a very -- actually we had a very strong first quarter last year in China. And then, which is kind of still the back end of the re-openings, and while we grew volumes for the restaurant for the total of the year 2023 and revenues, it did soften for the last three quarters of the year in China. And I think what we're going to see is a kind of a reverse of that in 2024. We've invested strongly again in Chinese New Year. This year, we won't know the result for another few weeks net-net. But we're kind of expecting it to be a little slower in the first quarter, especially given what we are cycling from last year. And then for the year to improve, but not too hot or not too cold, if I can use that analogy. So yes, there's a little weakness in the economic system. But we expect things to get -- we get [tends] (ph) directionally to get better through the year and we're going to keep investing behind not just keep key moments in the year like Chinese New Year but restoring more momentum to sparkling and really focusing on RGM and execution opportunities. Yes. Sure. I mean, firstly, we're going to continue to experiment and find lots of new things hopefully in 2024, but it's certainly true as say that fairlife has been on a roll. And we have been driving that. I think you should have noted a double digit volume growth for as many years I can remember plus faster double digits in revenue. Clearly, as we scale that we needed to put that more capacity. We have recently announced and begun the process of building a mega plant up in upstate New York. And so, capacity tight in the fairlife business and core power is also firing on all cylinders. We'll certainly talk about some of these at CAGNY when we'll kind of lay out some of the back story. I think it's like fairlife and particularly core power and how these brands and products have done a great job in driving from experimentation to scaling, the challenging and, for example, in the case of core power to leading. Yes. Look, I mean, I think it was at a macro level foreseeable that the market would get tied-up through the course of 2023 as inflation run ahead of wage growth. And so, therefore, yes, it wasn't surprising that would tightness, particularly for certain -- for certain consumer segments. I think all things in due proportion. I mean, the growth in North America in the fourth quarter was basically the same as the growth in the full year, it's only very fractional differences. So, I think these are not big changes in trends. But yes, I think there was a little softening through the -- through 2023. And I think we'll see that kind of a bidding reverse as 2024 starts off as consumers and you can see it in the confidence indicators, the consumers, they're starting to feel like the money coming in is starting to contain and get ahead of the inflation. So I think we'll see that improve through the year, again, all in due proportion, they're not going to be big shifts in the volume growth rate in the U.S. business. In aggregate, we would expect to get more from price relative to volume for the U.S. business. So the balance that I talk about between price and volume applies on a global basis clearly that's been made up of geographic portfolio mix, so places like the U.S., we'd expect to see stable or slightly increasing volume with decent pricing, all the way over to place like India, where clearly we're getting much more volume than price and having to invest significantly in capacity. And those two -- take those two examples, so that's true of the global portfolio, blend it all together and that's where the balance comes from. Yes. I mean, Coke Space, bit like Coke Creations, not exactly, but it is really aimed at increasing connectivity with Gen Z and the broad consumers, driving engagement -- driving reconsideration is part of a whole overall strategy that as you say we've been deploying for a good number of years, that has really worked to reengage consumers with the Coke trademark, whether it's Coke original, Coke Zero Sugar or even Diet Coke to some extent. The overall strategy of an upgraded approach to the marketing, the innovation whether it's Coke's Space or some of the Creations through the RGM in the execution has allowed us to drive our Coke growth across the global business. And actually by also increasing the focus on Fanta and Sprite even organizationally splitting them out into two sub teams within the organization has allowed us to bring more clarity and more focus onto Fanta and to Sprite and to drive growth there, too. Which has worked in Q4 in 2023 and as you say, over the last five years. I know that sometimes people -- well, I would say that people think about the sparkling category just through the optic of the U.S. over the last 20 years. And I would invite you to look at the optics or everyone to look at the optics of the sparkling category globally all the time, and actually there, you see that the category remains robust on a global scale, both in terms of volume and revenue growth. And of course we are not just the leaders, but we are the share winners, so we see -- if we do the right things for our brands, we will be able to drive the category forward and benefit disproportionately from that growth. On U.S., what? Sure. Carlos, yes. I think it's fair to say that the overall investment levels that you referred to in Lat-Am are pretty consistent across the world. Like one of the underlying tailwinds, I believe we have is the degree to which our system is sharing and thus the opportunity that's ahead and willing to increasingly invest ahead of the curve. So I think that's happening across the global system. One of the subsets of that, of course, is the degree to which digital, and its many forms is playing a pivotal role to sustaining and indeed building advantage wherever we operate. We have CAGNY next week. And I think you'll hear more of that threaded through the conversation we'll see up there. But safe to say, I think CapEx levels are at the highest as a percentage of system revenue that I can remember. And within that the appetite and willingness to invest ahead of the curve, particularly in digital is also at a very high level. Right. Thanks very much, everyone. Just to summarize, we're proud of what we've accomplished in 2023. We are winning in the marketplace, we're going to be maintaining agility and improving every aspect of how we do business across our total beverage portfolio. John and I look forward to discussing more with you all next week at CAGNY. Thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and joining us this morning. Thank you."

            "name": "John Murphy",
            "content": "Thank you, James. And good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter and throughout 2023, we delivered strong results. During the quarter, we grew organic revenues 12% which was in-line with our full year organic revenue growth. Unit case growth was 2% and it was positive in each quarter of 2023. Concentrate sales grew 1 point ahead of unit cases, driven primarily by one additional day in the quarter. Our price mix growth of 9% in the quarter was driven by three factors. One, 2023 pricing actions across most of our markets. Two, hyperinflationary pricing that I'll speak to in just a moment. And three, some mix which is mostly timing related. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 140 basis points. Driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottle refranchising. Partially offset by the impact of currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 40 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong topline growth, partially offset by currency headwinds and an increase in marketing investments. The positive volume and topline growth that we're realizing today demonstrates the effectiveness of our marketing spend. Below the line, comparable other income declined primarily due to the operating environment in Argentina. Putting it all together, fourth quarter comparable EPS of $0.49 was up 10% year-over-year, despite higher than expected 13% currency headwinds. Before moving on, I wanted to discuss the impact of a few hyperinflationary markets on our fourth quarter results. During the quarter, inflation intensified and exceeded 60% across these markets. In aggregate, while they represent less than 5% of our total volume, this degree of inflation creates a cosmetic distortion to our underlying results. In the fourth quarter, these markets contributed more than 3 points of our price mix and most of our currency headwinds, including an outsized impact to comparable other income from balance sheet remeasurement in Argentina. They did not, however, have a material impact on our earnings per share results. In hyperinflationary markets it's either impractical or impossible to hedge our currency exposure. And to manage it, we use our full suite of revenue growth management tools, including pricing actions to keep pace with local market inflation. We have been operating a long-time in these markets and we expect to be in them for a long-time to come. We work hand-in-hand with our local bottling partners and our focus will be to continue to nurture the strong relationships we have with our consumers and customers. And to ultimately prevail longer-term. So while we will continue to experience volatility of this nature in a few markets, it's important to keep in mind they are operated locally, they are typically self-funding and they have not impeded our overall ability to grow earnings per share. As we move forward, we are confident that our business model and the many levers within it will allow us to deliver on our overall objectives. In 2023 free cash flow was $9.7 billion, which increased from the prior year. 2023 free cash flow included a transition tax payment of approximately $720 million, which was approximately $340 million higher than the prior year and included approximately $230 million in M&A related payments. Our underlying free cash flow growth was largely attributable to strong operational performance and working capital benefits. If you exclude the full impact of the transition tax in M&A related payments, our adjusted free cash flow conversion ratio would be within our target range of 90% to 95%. Our balance sheet remains strong. And our net debt leverage of 1.7 times EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times. During the fourth quarter, in addition to offsetting dilution from the exercise of stock options by employees, we repurchased additional shares in anticipation of expected proceeds from bottler refranchising. As James mentioned, we anticipate 2024 will bring new challenges and opportunities. However, through our all-weather strategy, we've proven we can deliver in many different operating environments. Our 2024 guidance builds on the underlying momentum of our business. We expect organic revenue growth of 6% to 7% and comparable currency neutral earnings per share growth of 8% to 10%. We anticipate hyperinflationary pricing will continue to play a role in 2024, but it will moderate throughout the year. We continue to make significant progress towards refranchising company owned bottling operations. Bottler refranchising is expected to be a 4 point to 5 point headwind to comparable net revenues and a 2 point headwind to comparable earnings per share. But will have a positive impact on both our margins and the return profile of our business. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate 2 point to 3 point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 4 point to 5 point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024. Notably, much of our anticipated 2024 currency headwinds are attributed to hyperinflationary markets with a meaningful impact in the fourth quarter. Our underlying effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be 19.2%. All in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5% versus $2.69 in 2023. We expect to generate approximately $9.2 billion of free cash flow in 2024 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $2.2 billion in capital investments. The $11.4 billion of cash from operations includes two items to highlight, transition tax payments of approximately $960 million, an increase of approximately $240 million versus 2023, payments associated with various M&A transactions of approximately $560 million, an increase of approximately $330 million versus 2023. Driven by our underlying cash flow generation and current balance sheet strength, we have ample flexibility to both reinvest in our business to drive growth and return capital to our shareowners. A significant portion of our expected capital investment increase is to build capacity for fairlife and for our India business, both of which experienced robust growth in 2023. Related to capital return, we have an unwavering priority to grow our dividend as we've done with 61 consecutive years of dividend increases. With respect to share repurchases, we will be flexible in our approach. Typically, we've repurchased shares to offset any dilution from the exercise of stock options by employees in the given year. Our capital allocation policy prioritize agility. And we're committed to taking the right actions needed to drive the long-term health of our business and create value for our stakeholders. There are some considerations to keep in mind for 2024. The first quarter of 2024 will be impacted by the timing of concentrate shipments in the fourth quarter of 2023 in some markets and cycling our strongest volume growth quarter from the prior year. We estimate the ongoing conflict in the Middle East had approximately 1 point of impact on volume growth during the fourth quarter of 2023. It's unclear how long this impact will last. In November 2023, the U.S. Tax Court rendered its supplemental opinion related to our ongoing dispute with the Internal Revenue Service. We intend to move forward on appeal and vigorously defend our position. We have ample balance sheet flexibility to fund any payment related to the appeal. Finally, due to our reporting calendar, there will be one less day in the first quarter and two additional days in the fourth quarter. So in summary, we're pleased with what we accomplished in 2023, we're building on our capabilities to continue the underlying momentum across our markets, we're progressing on our refranchising agenda and we're reinvesting in our system to drive long-term growth. We have great confidence, we can deliver on our 2024 guidance and long-term commitments. With that, operator, we're ready to take questions. Thanks, Bonnie. Let me start by just pickup from her. James has often step out of both the quarter and the year, if you look over the last four years our -- we've been able to sustain a pretty resilient gross margin line. And as we go into 2024, expect to be able to continue to do so. There's some expansion embedded in the long-term growth model and we're confident that we can continue to drive that. With respect to 2023, the key ingredients, so to speak were the impact of the various pricing actions. We've had around the world, somewhat offset by higher than the normal inflation with some of our commodity items, and some our non-commodity costs. But overall for 2023, that's the key story. In 2024, I think you'll need to take into account the mechanical impact of the refranchising of those markets that we talked about in the release that will layer in throughout 2024. Keep in mind to the impact of foreign currency headwinds. I think, against that, then we will continue to drive the levers that we have. I've talked about this in the past, but maybe worth just highlighting. We start really with the -- with that suite of revenue growth management tools and the many actions that we can take with that. We have a very resilient supply chain, tremendous partners across the supply chain. We source mostly locally and we continue to drive through our scale a lot of productivity and in almost each line item of what comprises the supply chain. So going into 2024, I think it's worth just reiterating, well we expect to see margin expansion. Some of it driven by that mechanical effect of the bottler refranchising. And with some more normalized costs inflation relative to the last couple of years, plus continuing to deploy those levers. I talked about, we see the opportunity to continue to drive per our long-term growth model expansion. Yes. Let me take the end. And then I'll pass it over to James for the beginning. The mix that you referred to is timing related and it's not unusual in the fourth quarter to have timing related items, and in the deductions area, particularly, that will flow back through into next year. Okay. Shall I start at this time? And then you go second, John. Sure. Great. And on currency, Steve. Let me just make a couple of comments in case there are other questions out there on currency overall. First of all, I think it's important to highlight the 2024 guidance that we've given. It would be close to flat if we were to exclude those few hyperinflationary markets. And it just reinforces the point that we're making on that sort of distortion that those few markets have. And then secondly, with regards to your specific question, I do not have that breakdown. Today, there is just too many -- there's just too many puts and takes, particularly in that below the operating income line as we go through the year. You got to do a monthly remeasurement on the balance sheet items. And that's just a calculation, that's -- I don't have the ability to predict with great detail. So I just keep in mind that the overall impact I think is the one to focus on. In normal years the multiplier is 1.5 times to 2 times, we would continue to assume that will be the case going forward. But these hyperinflationary markets have a tenancy to create that distortion that we've highlighted and we'll continue to provide guidance as we go through the year to make sure that everybody stays abreast of the latest developments. Just one additional point. In addition to that, unwavering commitment we have to the dividend that we talked about in the script. One of the lessons I think over the last couple of years is to be prepared to be more dynamic relative to your kind of normal view of the individual components. So, as you know, our debt -- our debt goal is to be 2 times to 2.5 times, and we're up 1.7 times. We think that's right for what we need going into 2024, 2025. We've taken up our CapEx for 2024 because it's the right thing to do to continue to build the growth foundations that we need. And in those parts of the business that need capacity. Just two examples. And so, I think we will continue to demonstrate that as we go forward, the share repurchases in the back half of the year, again was not something that we had necessarily considered at the start of the year. But we first, there was an opportunity with the buffer proceeds coming in to do so. And we continue to take that approach as we enter this coming year."

In the third quarter, we delivered strong top line growth, comparable operating margin expansion and earnings per share growth. Our strategy is working. These results continue our track record of consistent delivery. And given our year-to-date performance, we are raising both our top line and bottom line guidance. This morning, I'll provide a brief update on the global consumer landscape. Then I'll focus much of my time on business performance across the segments and discuss how we've been investing to further strengthen our capabilities to capture longer-term growth opportunities. John will end by discussing financial details for the quarter, our revised guidance for full year 2023 and some early considerations for 2024. The global operating environment is always dynamic and this quarter was no exception. Some markets improved sequentially, while others dealt with a variety of factors ranging from transitory weather conditions, ongoing inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions and conflicts. We delivered 11% organic revenue growth this quarter driven by positive volume, some pricing actions in the marketplace and carryover pricing coming into the base from last year. Volume grew 2% and sequentially improved each month in the quarter with September being our strongest month. Our year-to-date volume growth remains consistent with underlying performance compared to 2019. And overall, our industry remains vibrant and is expanding and we are executing to capture that growth. During the quarter, we gained volume and value share in both at-home and away-from-home channels. Consumer sentiment continues to vary around the world. In developed markets, consumer spending in agro goods [ph] has held up quite well, however, some consumers feel pressured. We've seen some shift to discount channels and switching to private label brands in a few markets and categories. The intensity of this activity was largely the same across Europe compared to the previous quarter but was less pronounced in the U.S., Australia and Japan. In the developing and emerging markets, the picture is more mixed. We're seeing broadly consumer strength across Latin America, India and in parts of Central and Southeast Asia. On the other hand, consumer confidence in spending has yet to fully recover in Africa and China. Our revenue growth management execution capabilities give us a distinct advantage and we are leveraging these capabilities to ensure we have the right product in the right package in the right channel and at the right price points to meet consumers where they are. Notwithstanding the dynamics in play around the world, we have many levers to pull and continue to deliver through varying market conditions. I'll share some more details from each region. Starting with Asia Pacific; we delivered organic revenue growth but operating income declined primarily as a result of investing ahead of the curve to participate in longer-term opportunities and incurring additional costs from strategic portfolio rationalization. In ASEAN and South Pacific, we grew top line and profit by linking our brands to drinking occasions coupled with strong execution. In Thailand, we launched Coke Kitchen which connected consumers to influencers who shared their favorite recipes with Coca-Cola. We also partnered with food service aggregators to drive combo meals. Campaign attracted nearly 1 million consumers and we significantly increased the attachment rate of our beverages with meals ordered through food service aggregators. In Japan, we're gaining volume and value share year-to-date. We continue to see strong momentum from our Coca-Cola, Georgia Coffee and I LOHAS campaigns and have stepped up execution in vending, e-commerce and community channels. However, in China, volume declined as the sparkling soft drink category is taking longer to recover. Our results were also impacted by some strategic conditions to deprioritize lower profit categories. Our focus is to restore momentum to the sparkling soft drink category and capitalize on revenue growth management and execution opportunities. In India, we delivered double-digit volume and top line growth which resulted in the highest value share gain over the past 3 years. We're winning in the marketplace by generating 2.6 billion transactions at affordable price point and driving availability across rural regions. Across Asia Pacific, as part of our World Without Waste strategy to help drive circular economy for packaging materials, our system launched 100% recycled PET packaging in India, Indonesia and Thailand. Moving on to EMEA; we delivered strong organic revenue and operating income growth. In Africa, macro conditions remain challenging and our business was further impacted by natural disasters in Morocco and Libya. Despite this environment, we drove transaction growth through accelerated refillable PET expansion, digitizing nearly 100,000 outlets and adding 80,000 coolers used to date. In Europe, consumers are still facing pressure and our business was unfavorably impacted by poor weather. Despite these dynamics, we gained value share through strong performances in sparkling soft drinks and tea. We did this by partnering with systems to drive value for key customers and our consumers. We continue to see promising early results for Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola in Europe. We are learning and expanding in alcoholic drinks, including our recent announcement of our Absolut Vodka & Sprite. And last, in Eurasia and Middle East, we recruited consumers through innovative, occasion-based marketing events like Fanta Fest Turkey which focused on snacking occasions with concerts by prominent local artists. They also launched 100% recycled PET package this summer. In North America, we generated strong organic revenue growth and delivered margin expansion by executing across our total beverage portfolio. We continue to see away-from-home channel outperform at-home channels. Within sparkling soft drink, elasticities are holding up well and we continue to drive quality leadership with Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta. For example, our systems stepped up in-store activation on Sprite Lymonade Legacy and with increased displays at point of sale which drove higher household penetration and repeat purchases. Fanta drove nearly 2 points of vale share gain year-to-date through innovation and new graphics, including the latest Halloween iteration of the What the Fanta platform. Outside sparkling, BODYARMOR and Powerade trends are stabilizing. And fairlife, Core Power, smartwater and Gold Peak generated value share gains. And in the U.S., to protect water resources, we renewed a decade-long partnership with the Department of Agriculture to restore and improve water sheds in national forests and grasslands. Water is a critical priority for our system and the communities that we serve. In Latin America, we generated double-digit top line and profit growth by executing on all facets of our strategy which resulted in value share gains in 4 of our top 5 markets. In the fifth market, Mexico, we're seeing improving value share trends over the last few months. We're increasingly linking our brands to consumers' passion points to build deeper connections. In Brazil, through Coke Studio, we partnered with the Town Music Festival, where we hosted 60 hours of concert and engaged with artists and influencers which generated 1 billion impressions and reached nearly 50 million consumers. We continue to drive affordability through refillable packaging of larger PET packages. In developing and emerging markets, refillables are an important tool to eliminate waste and offer products at lower price points. Last, our systems stepped up availability, reflecting over 270,000 coolers year-to-date which increased our share of visible inventory in key areas. Global ventures generated strong overall growth. At Costa, we strengthened our revenue growth management equation while driving transaction growth. This was supported by strong innovation and marketing campaigns such as our global summer of ice, expansion of the refreshment category and the introduction of our personalized pre-drop loyalty activation in U.K. Additionally, innocent gained value share in both the U.K. and France. Finally, Bottling Investments Group grew organic revenue and operating income through expanding affordable immediate consumption entry packs and progressing for strengthening route to market and optimizing trade collections. At the same time, we're working towards decarbonizing our operations in India through using 200 electric vehicles with plans to add more before the end of 2023. Beyond the quarter, we continue to have confidence in the long term. We see momentum continuing across our industry and our system is galvanized more than ever to capture this opportunity. Leveraging data to drive better decision-making is key to improving execution. Our system has collectively invested in digital initiatives to drive on all facets of our strategy. Starting first with marketing and innovation. Our marketing transformation is increasingly making our brands more relevant to consumers. Today, Gen Zs spend 7 to 9 hours per day on screen. However, very little time is spent watching traditional TV. We've been shifting our media spend towards digital. In 2019, digital was less than 30% of our total media spend and year-to-date is over 60%, through digital campaigns which segment the population that's disproportionately reaching consumers where we earn higher return on investments. We've seen tremendous engagement through digital-first campaigns for Coke with meals, Sprite Heat Happens and Fuze Tea's Made of Fusion among others. We're taking bold steps to be at the forefront of both consumer and non-consumer facing generative AI. For example, we launched Create Real Magic which turns consumers into digital creators. We also brought GenAI into our creative process for the award-winning Coca-Cola Masterpiece film and letting the fans the chance to take a piece of this work through the sale of NFTs. Recently, we launched Coke Y3000 which is our eighth iteration in the Coke Creations platform. Coca-Cola Y3000, the world's first futuristic flavor, co-created with AI. The launch has demonstrated strong initial results. On the non-consumer facing side, we're implementing generative AI to improve access to insight, market data, research and trends. Moving on to revenue growth management and integrated execution. As a system, we're accelerating eB2B platforms that allow for better tailoring of product, price and packaging architecture, reducing out of stocks and optimizing placement of physical inventory. Year-to-date, we've connected 6.9 million customers to eB2B platforms. We continue to expand coverage and offer customers personalization at scale. Initial pilots suggest that customers who receive AI-written push notifications have been more likely to purchase recommended SKUs, resulting in incremental retail sales. And we're just scratching the surface of what's possible but we're investing in digital capabilities now to expand our potential down the road. To sum it all up, we're encouraged by our results year-to-date and this is reflected in our updated 2023 guidance. We have many levers to pull and have proven that we can deliver in many types of markets around the world. We continue to win on a local level, maintain flexibility on a global level and reinvest to build our system for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll comment on our third quarter performance and highlight our updated 2023 guidance. I'll also provide some early commentary on 2024 and the actions we are taking to continue to deliver on our objectives. As James mentioned, we delivered strong third quarter results. Starting with the top line. We grew organic revenues 11%. Unit case growth was 2%. If you exclude the impact of suspending our business in Russia, we have delivered positive volume growth in each quarter since the start of 2021. Concentrate sales were in line with unit cases for the quarter. Price/mix growth was 9% driven by pricing actions across operating segments, including the impact of a few hyperinflationary markets, along with carryover pricing coming into the base from last year. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 130 basis points driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 20 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong top line growth and the impact of refranchising bottling operations, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments versus the prior year as well as currency headwinds. Putting it all together, third quarter comparable EPS of $0.74 was up 7% year-over-year despite higher-than-expected 4% currency headwinds. Free cash flow was approximately $7.9 billion year-to-date. This was largely attributable to strong underlying operational performance and working capital benefits, partially offset by $720 million transition tax payment and $230 million in M&A-related payments. Our balance sheet is strong and our net debt leverage of 1.5x EBITDA is below our target range of 2 to 2.5x. Recently, we entered into a letter of intent to refranchise our Philippines bottler. As we progress on our refranchising journey, we aspire to improve the return profile of our business. In 2015, when Bottling Investments Group was more than 50% of our net revenue, our return on invested capital was approximately 17%. Today, Bottling Investments Group makes up less than 20% of net revenue. And our return on invested capital is over 23%, nearly a 7-point increase. After this transaction closes, our remaining assets in the Bottling Investments Group will include operations in India, Africa and several smaller locations, primarily in Asia Pacific. We will remain disciplined in our refranchising approach by making sure we best position our system to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Our business performance year-to-date gives us confidence that we can deliver on our raised 2023 guidance. This is comprised of organic revenue growth of 10% to 11% which will be led by price/mix and includes positive volume growth. We do expect pricing in developed markets to moderate in the fourth quarter as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. There are also a few hyperinflationary markets that will continue to drive price/mix. There will be 1 additional day in the fourth quarter. We now expect comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 13% to 14%. And based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now expect currency to be an approximate 4-point headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 6-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect per-case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023. We now expect our underlying effective tax rate for 2023 to be 19%. All in, we are updating comparable earnings per share growth of 7% to 8% versus $2.48 in 2022. We continue to expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations. That's approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments. This guidance does not include any payments related to our U.S. income tax dispute with the IRS which are unlikely to occur in 2023. Given the momentum of our business, the strength of our balance sheet and some proceeds that we expect to receive from bottler refranchising, we have increased flexibility to continue to both reinvest in our business and return capital to shareowners. While it is too early to provide specific items on 2024, we want to share some considerations based on what we know today. We're encouraged by our top line momentum across the majority of our markets. There are a handful of hyperinflationary markets where it is either not possible to hedge or it is costly to do so. In these markets, we've demonstrated that we can manage currency pressures by taking price with local market inflation and we will continue to follow this approach. While some commodities are normalizing, we also have input costs that could be impacted by tensions and conflicts. With respect to advertising spend, our bias is to continue to reinvest behind our brands while maintaining flexibility. Regarding currency, if we assume current rates and our hedge positions, there would be an approximate low single-digit currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate mid-single-digit currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024. Of course, several factors could impact both our currency outlook and broader business outlook between now and February. Over the past few years, we've delivered U.S. dollar EPS growth and we have many levers to continue to do so. So in summary, we are encouraged by our business results and confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments over the long term. Thanks to the incredible commitment of our system employees around the world, we're very clear on the direction we are heading and well equipped to execute on the strategies to get us there. And we continue to invest to drive sustainable long-term growth. We remain focused on capturing the opportunities available to us. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: So clearly, another strong set of results in Q3 and obviously, increased confidence for the year with the full year raise. I'd love to sort of get a bit more perspective on 2024. I know you won't want to put specific numbers around the outlook but was just hoping you can give us a sense for how you think about the pricing outlook for next year, given the strength in Q3 and perhaps break that down into the price increase versus mix versus hyperinflationary market pieces of it and what the competitive environment sort of portends for next year on the pricing front.\nJames Quincey: Let me just offer up a few thoughts, Dara. Firstly, just breaking out Q3 because I think that's instructive as you think about the down end of the year and into next year. Firstly, there are a couple of points in Q3 that's the carryover from the more inflationary environment from 2022. And obviously, that will drop out as we get into Q4 and obviously next year. And then you've got the regular pricing. And then you've got a couple of points of pricing that's coming from these very high inflation markets, Argentina, Turkey and a number of the African markets that, given the levels of inflation, is making a difference at the overall company level. And as John mentioned in the FX guidance, we're assuming some degree of negativity from those markets next year. But we are assuming some degree of positivity in that sense in price/mix next year. The one thing that's uncertain about -- the one thing that's certain about high inflation markets is it ends unpredictably. So it's very early to have a full pitch on what that's going to look like in 2024. And obviously, we'll update when we get to February. So net-net, you're going to have continued moderation heading towards the landing zone in the developed economies. You've got a couple of emerging markets which are subnormal inflation, aka China. And then, you've got a mixed bag of emerging markets and a particular importance is going to be what is the overall journey in these high-inflation marketplaces. So hopefully that provides some parameters with which to think about how it lands in Q4 and into next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: So one of the things that struck me as really interesting is in the release, when you specifically -- first of all, it was helpful that you called out the specific contribution from inflationary pricing. But one thing I thought was interesting is the regions where there was greater inflationary pricing were also the regions where there was at least versus my expectations, better-than-expected unit case volume. So I think historically, right, the logic and the elasticity would say more pricing, less volume. But here, you're getting that unit case volume to come through. So I just wonder if you could talk a little bit maybe about what you're doing differently that's enabling that kind of combination. And then also, if you're able to speak to transaction growth in those markets also if that's pacing -- how that's pacing relative to unit cases.\nJames Quincey: Sure. So firstly, I want to just underline that we have been pursuing for a good number of years but very specifically this year and also will be pursuing into next year is, no matter what the degree of inflation in the environment, we want to protect the scale of our consumer franchise and see it grow. In other words, we want to see positive volume or transaction growth in the environment. And so very much our strategy of the marketing, the innovation, the RGM, the execution has been very much around not just gaining value share in these environments but making sure that there's volume growth embedded in it; so we very much take that approach. And as it relates to the regions where there was inflation, where there's volume, I mean, the two biggest pieces of the puzzle are Latin America and EMEA. And taking those in order, Latin America, the inflationary pricing is very clearly driven by Argentina. The rest of the content, generally speaking, is in the same sort of ballpark, the inflation that has been predominant there for an extended period of time. And it's an environment we very much know how to operate in. And we have a great business there and they very much are masters of executing against the marketing innovation, the execution, the RGM. And then Argentina is a rollercoaster, given its inflation levels and its economic levels. I can say that from personal experience as I was the country manager there in 2001 and 2002 when they had a big devaluation and default on their debt. And so this is something where we know how to operate and it's kind of part of what happens in certain markets in Latin America and so we are able to execute. As it relates to EMEA, divided into two parts. One is the European environment where inflation, much like the U.S., is moderating down and the dynamic in Europe was much more around a moderating degree of inflation and the fact that they had a relatively poor summer in terms of the weather and the consumer is perhaps under a little more pressure than the U.S. The other half of the EMEA group is Eurasia and Africa. And in that context, there are a number of very high inflation marketplaces like Turkey, Zimbabwe as it happens, Nigeria to some extent, Egypt to some extent. And there, when the inflation does spike, you do occasionally see impacts to volume. But overall, we've been able to manage through it so that on a total segment basis, we've carried it through. And we certainly look to, as I said, maintain and grow the consumer franchise, although in some of those markets in any given quarter, the volume may be negative as inflation tends to be much more spiky than the system.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. I had a question on your marketing investments. They were up and, I guess, a drag on operating margins in the quarter; so just hoping for some more color on these reinvestments. And then, James, you mentioned your plans to continue to invest ahead of the curve. So could you provide a little more color on how you're thinking about this? And then ultimately, how much of the top line strength you plan to reinvest in the marketing whether it's this year? And then more importantly, how you're thinking about this next year, especially in the context of greater FX headwinds. I guess trying to understand how flexible you're going to be to balance these reinvestments with driving dollar EPS growth.\nJames Quincey: Okay. Just kind of let me try and unpack that a little bit. So we have come in post-COVID over the last couple of years and said we expected a rebound. And we are going to lean in and invest for growth as long as growth is there rather than trying to pull back in anticipation of something. And that modus operandi, I'm not sure I would characterize extra marketing as a drag on results, more as a motor to driving the top line and the bottom line that we're seeing. So we feel that the leaning in is working, obviously, typified by the fact we've raised both the top line and the bottom line guidance. I think as a model to the extent that we can continue to push that through the end of this year and into next year, we would certainly be happy to do so. Having said that, to the extent that 2024 brings some unexpected surprises, we will pivot, whether it's a country, a region or globally, we will pivot with speed as we did in the second quarter of 2020 when COVID hit and we ramped down marketing spend in that environment. So we feel we've developed a much greater degree of flexibility to move, should moving be needed at whatever part of the world. But as a starting point, we're going to lean in for growth. And I think the last thing I would say is if you think about the balance of all these items, if you take -- if you kind of zoom out a little bit and take a broader perspective of the operating income margin because obviously, marketing is just a component of all the different pieces, if you take a look at operating income margin over the, I don't know, last 5 years or so, you'll see that it's been increasing at about 0.5 point a year operating margin which is broadly in line with the implied leverage in the long-term growth model. And so that has been an objective of ours. It's not going to happen every quarter because quarters are very lumpy but it is part of the way we see our strategy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein from Evercore ISI.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. James, in the past, you've talked that -- Coca-Cola Company has talked about moving the consumer from more commodity packs to the more that, I think you call them incident packs or the higher value-added packs, I'd love to get a sense and maybe we just focus on the U.S. of where you are in that journey, how much room there is to improve mix and is this something that you can do in a weaker economic environment where the consumer is also looking for more affordability and value options.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Thanks, Robert. Look, I absolutely think there's a tremendous opportunity in the U.S. marketplace to leverage greater pack diversity. We're not capturing all the opportunities that are there. And the leveraging of greater pack diversity actually helps in an environment where, as you have in the U.S. at the moment where certain segments of consumers feel under disposable income pressure and would look for more affordable options. And yet, there are plenty of segments either in terms of their income or in terms of the channels they're going and spending in who are more disposed for premium options. So the marketplace offers the opportunity of greater segmentation and diversity of packaging. We have more that we can do in the marketplace in the U.S., whether it be on the nature and the range of the can sizes and shapes or the PET bottles. So I think there's plenty of runway in the U.S. to continue to leverage packaging diversity to satisfy consumer needs and to deliver on the RGM equations that we have the opportunity for in the U.S. And ultimately, you could look at other parts of the world, Latin America or Europe which are relatively developed cold markets and see that we do successfully use more packages there to deliver the business that the consumers want to have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: So John, I appreciate your commentary about the EPS growth in 2024. And James, you said you would like to see volume growth which is obviously encouraging and in line with what you said in the last earnings call. But given the many moving pieces recently and the weaker consumer in developed markets, number one, is there anything that changed your thoughts sequentially? And two, related to the 80% of the volumes, of course, being abroad and granted that, obviously, is moving the impact of the GLP drugs, I think it would be dismissive not to ask, given investor concerns. Can you talk about how you're proactively approaching this potential risk? Obviously, it's similar to what you have done over the many, many years in terms of the sugar content and portion control but just curious how investors should be thinking of the tools you have at your disposal.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Andrea. So on the first point, if you think about 2023 from where we were 12 months ago and what we're guiding to for the rest of this year, it's in an environment that has had the same kinds of ForEx headwinds and much of the volatility that I would expect to continue into the next 12 months or so. And we've demonstrated as we've both highlighted both in the script and in a number of forums, the levers that we have developed over the last few years to effectively manage through those -- a period with such volatility and uncertainty; and I expect 2024 to be a similar type of year. So I would point you to many of these levers are improved marketing and innovation, the revenue growth management abilities that I think year-on-year are getting stronger and the overall execution of our system in the marketplace. So the industry continues to be strong and we expect that to be a feature of our underlying equation for 2024 also. Regarding the second point you raised, it is an area that we are very focused on. There's still a lot of views out there as to what impact, if any, it will have. I would offer -- if you step above us and lock us -- the thrust of our total beverage strategy over the last few years, that we are well positioned to provide choice and to provide options for people's respective motivations and needs. And so we'll continue to monitor the space but we're confident that the total beverage strategy -- 68% of our products have low or no calories today. And we continue to invest in innovation and choice to deal with whatever comes out [ph].\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: I wanted to ask you a question about Coca-Cola Zero. Growth has decelerated a bit through the year against pretty exceptional unit case growth last year. So I was just wondering if you could reframe where we are with the franchise, the opportunities you see for it and if we're perhaps reaching any thresholds just with the expansion of the offering.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Sure, Chris. I don't think we're reaching a threshold in terms of the expansion of Coke Zero. Actually, I think quite the opposite, I think there's a vast potential for Coke Zero going forward. I think what you see in the very short term is the impact of some of the big Coke Zero markets aka Europe. They also had a very poor summer and run for a couple of months there and that makes it look like it's dipped down in Q3. But I think Coke Zero has plenty of runway going forward and we will continue to invest behind it and are bullish on its long-term potential.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities.\nBill Chappell: Just a little bit on China and I guess, to some extent, Africa. Can you maybe -- this is obviously not the first we've heard of the consumer being a little bit slow to bounce back. But is there anything Coca-Cola can do to accelerate that in terms of pricing or promotion? Or is it really just waiting on the market? And did you see any real changes in that consumer as the quarter progressed, where you ended the quarter with maybe a little more green shoots that things are getting better as we go into the fourth?\nJames Quincey: Yes. Sure, Bill. Obviously, I hate the idea of just waiting for something to happen macro economically. Certainly, it helps when there's a tailwind from the general environment but we're not going to wait for that. We're very focused on investing to try and capitalize on the opportunities and restore momentum, particularly on the sparkling business and there's a lot of RGM and execution opportunities for us to go and tackle in China. Also, we need to get cranked up and have a really strong Chinese New Year which will be in the early part of 2024. And we took a set of decisions in Q3 which created a bit of an impact on the APAC segment margin to really get focused and kind of invest ahead and make some prioritization decisions so that we can really drive the Chinese business forward, hoping that there'll be a plus from the tailwinds of the macroeconomics but we can't wait for that. We need to focus on controlling what we can control and investing to drive the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charlie Higgs from Redburn Atlantic.\nCharlie Higgs: I've got a question on BIG and the Philippines. And James, maybe can you just talk about the Philippines high level, how the country has performed? And I guess, from a transaction, why now and why CCEP? And then, John, can you just give us some thoughts on what the transaction could mean for FY '24 outlook if it does go ahead, maybe the sales margin, EPS? And then maybe just comment when you said a portion of proceeds from non-operating activities may go towards buybacks, is that -- should we read that as BIG disposals?\nJames Quincey: Sure. Let me start there, Charlie. We have a clear stated objective that we want to be the world's smallest bottler and so over time have been refranchising the operations. We currently hold basically 4 pieces: the Philippines, a large-stage CCBA, a significant part of the system in India and then a number of -- a small number of other countries, about 1/4 in each in rough terms. And so we are long-term, refranchises of the bottling operations we own. In terms of the Philippines, we've had actually a good set of recent years in the Philippines, a good bounce back notwithstanding some ups and downs, given availability or as I said, lack of availability of some critical commodities in the marketplace. But actually, overall, we've had a very good run in the last number of years. And so we've been looking for the right time and the right partners to refranchise to. I think most importantly, this is a combination of a strong, local, long-term investing family, the Aboitiz Group together with some system expertise coming from CCEP. So, I think it's the right combination of partners that can bring bottling expertise and knowledge of the Philippine market -- Philippines market together to continue the track record of what's been achieved. John, do you want to do the other pieces?\nJohn Murphy: Yes. So on the transaction stuff, Charlie, we'll guide in February, assuming that the deal closes. It's -- we're making great progress on that at the moment. And without giving specifics, as you know from history and it will have a revenue headwind and a margin tailwind. And specifics, we'll give more details in February. And with regard to your last -- the last part of the long question, I would say the following. One is we have, I think, developed a strong position and created flexibility, given the momentum we have in the business, the stronger balance sheet we have today versus a few years back and the fact that we do have proceeds coming in from non-operating sources, i.e., the bottler refranchising primarily. We continue to be very focused on reinvesting in the business and returning capital. And as we look at some of these proceeds coming in, we will evaluate their best use, including share repurchases beyond the current objective we have to cover dilution. So more to come on that in February.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: I had one just clarification and then a question. The clarification is, did you give us how much hyperinflationary pricing affected just the total price/mix at the total company level?\nJames Quincey: No, we didn't give a precise number but it's about 2.5 points. It depends which countries you want to add in and where you want to cut the line but think of it as about 2.5 points in Q3.\nBryan Spillane: All right. And then my question is just about North America. I think in the press release, unit case volumes were flat and you called out that you had gained share. And then, James, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about away-from-home growing faster than at-home. So can you just sort of give us a little bit more perspective on kind of what's happening in North America in terms of both in the relative channel performance, anything you may be seeing in terms of value-seeking behavior with consumers? Just trying to get a better understanding of kind of how your business performed and just kind of what's happening with the category as we got through the quarter.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Firstly, let me start by saying the Nielsen universe represents just under half of our business in the U.S. So the measured channels are just under half of the total business. And what's happening in the consumer landscape is in kind of simplifying it down, the lower-income consumers are those most under pressure and the shopping occasion that's most under pressure is when they're buying for at-home. And so that is the business most captured by Nielsen. And the bit of the marketplace where there's more growth is when consumers are away from home. So there's still very -- still a rebound and strong growth in away-from-home channels, not just some of the restaurants but the amusements, travel, leisure, hospitality, those things. So you're seeing more growth in that part of the marketplace which is unmeasured. And so that's what's really driving the strength of the U.S. business overall and the revenue side. And so you see kind of a divergence of the consumer behavior between at home and away from home. Obviously, who's under pressure from a disposable income is clear. And then that feeds through into kind of the observed measures channels versus the total overall marketplace.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS.\nPeter Grom: So I kind of wanted to follow up on Bryan's question there. I mean, James, you mentioned trade down to private label and discount channels in your prepared remarks. But I think you also mentioned that relative to 2Q, the impact was similar in Europe but actually less pronounced in the markets like the U.S., Australia and Japan. So I would love just to get your perspective on why you think it was less pronounced in those markets? And then as you look out to 4Q and '24, how do you kind of see this trade-down dynamic evolving?\nJames Quincey: Okay. So I think -- look, the European consumer is under slightly more pressure than the U.S. consumer from a disposable income point of view. That's the starting point. So I think that's why you see a little more trading down or tightness on basket size in Europe versus the U.S. And I think that's generally overall true. And then the question of which categories are most pressured by that is really about brand strength and prioritization of occasions by the consumer. So if you've got to save money, you don't trade down averagely across everything, you make a choice in certain categories and you preserve your choices on other categories. So very much our objective is to make sure they value our brands so that they make the choices in the shopping occasion. If there is going to be a reduction in total spend, that obviously happens in some other categories when they trade down to the private label in those ones. And we preserve our brand strengths because we deliver value for them in the product, in the marketing and innovation. And so that's the overall dynamic as we see it. And that's the difference between the U.S. and Europe.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi.\nFilippo Falorni: A question on the Asia Pacific business. James, you mentioned that the India business was very solid but China was weak. First, maybe you can give a comment on how big of a drag China was in the quarter and what are your expectations going forward into next year? And then from a price/mix standpoint, price/mix of one in the segment was one of the lowest across your other segments. I know there's probably some geographic mix impact. But can you talk about the pricing environment as well in Asia Pacific?\nJames Quincey: Sure. Yes. I mean, China was clearly a drag in volumetric terms on the segment. Most importantly, from a margin point of view, it's really important to not over-rotate to the numbers in any given quarter, given the lumpiness of -- this is concentrate sales, several steps back in the supply chain from the consumer. So I think it's important to always take an average of four quarters. In the third quarter, as I commented a little earlier, we made a number of decisions on portfolio prioritization as it related to China and to investing for a fast start in 2024 in a number of markets in Asia Pacific, whether that be Japan or China. And so there are some investments going there. The overall pricing environment is relatively clear. China inflation is relatively minimal. In Japan, we've been taking pricing recently, given the inflation in Japan which is kind of very different to the last 30 years. And then the rest of the inflation is kind of the relatively obvious CPI around the rest of ASEAN and Australia. And so that's really what's driving it. I think see the third quarter in Asia Pacific more as an anomaly in terms of price/mix rather than a trend.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos Laboy from HSBC.\nCarlos Laboy: Can you speak to the sort of digital investments that the U.S. bottlers are doing and that you're helping them with? Is it more revenue-driven or perhaps more efficiency cost supply chain-centric? I guess in sum, what I'm trying to understand is how are digital investments changing these U.S. bottlers and their capabilities?\nJames Quincey: What was the last bit of the question, Carlos?\nCarlos Laboy: How are these digital investments changing these bottlers and their capabilities?\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean the U.S. bottler is much like the rest of the international bottlers are undergoing a set of digital investments. And actually, it's both. The answer is not either, it's both. We have been making investments in technology for a long period of time to drive efficiencies through the supply chain, through the manufacturing, through the logistics whether it be old-school technology investments, AI and now generative AIs are kind of a different feature. So there's a lot going on and there's a lot of connectivity among the bottlers on the enterprise software side because they're all connected through -- they're basically all use or most of them use a shared platform to get things done that's referred to internally as CONA. So there's a lot of investment on making sure the supply chain is as efficient as it can be and a lot of support from ecosystem partners to get it done. And then in terms of the rest of the -- I mean, they're investing in the marketplace that digitize the relationship with largely the non-modern trade. Obviously, when you're talking to the big modern retail customers, that interaction is already largely digitized. And the focus there is on trying to intensify the connection, really from a supply chain, inventory visibility and forecasting effectiveness point of view but the connectivity already exists. And then from the non-chain customers, it's really about can you get them on to -- in simple terms, a B2B platform so that it's 24/7 opportunities to order, knowing that if you can digitize the relationship, then it tends to be deeper and more productive. And then once that exists, layering on an AI component which a number of the bottlers internationally have been working on in coordination, an AI-supported kind of B2B relationship over a platform that can then provide them suggested purchase orders. And that is also helping to drive the business. So the U.S. bottlers in that sense are very much on a similar journey to the international bottlers.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge.\nBrett Cooper: Not necessarily looking at the third quarter or year-to-date results but looking over many years, Coke's growth in sparkling and non-sparkling hasn't been meaningfully different, whereas there would seem to be a higher growth opportunity in non-sparkling given just the differential in market share that you hold and the implementation of category cluster management. So can you speak to any impediment to higher growth in non-sparkling or what I'm likely missing? And then, I guess the part B is just within that umbrella, can you talk about your ability to develop newer categories to the company like hot coffee or alcohol?\nJames Quincey: Sure. We -- our objective is to do justice for the brands in the portfolio. And certainly, you can make an argument that those categories where we have lower shares have a natural opportunity to gain share. But of course, that is something you need to take from someone else. The other way of seeing the world is to say that the beverage industry seen from a global perspective are referenced back to the page in CAGNY with all the little people on it, the vast majority of the page is actually white space. In other words, the beverage industry is not yet created. And so actually, the idea that sparkling continues to grow is a representation of us operating from a position of strength to create the industry in the white spaces with our most successful and strongest brands. And so continued growth of sparkling should be a feature of our path going forward. And then in the non-sparkling categories, of course, we are looking to gain share. We talked historically about trying to get from experimental to challengers to leader to quality leadership. And I think that is a long-term build that has been playing out. If you take the long-term perspective and look at the percent of the total business that is made up of non-sparkling brands, it has increased slowly but it has increased consistently over the last couple of decades. So we start from a point of view of being consumer-centric from resource and capital allocation and from earning the right to move up the experimenters into the challenger into the leadership position. Nothing radical is going to happen overnight. But it is a dynamic that has built steadily over the last number of years and decades. And we're confident in the opportunity to rebuild the industry or to build the industry further into the future. Okay. That was the last question, operator. Okay. So to conclude, thanks very much, everyone. We've proven, I hope you can see, in Q3 that we continue to deliver volume, top line growth and incremental U.S. dollar earnings per share by executing against our all-weather strategy. And we're confident that we can create value over the long term. So thank you for your interest and your investment in the company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "James Quincey",
            "content": "Thanks, Robin and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we delivered strong top line growth, comparable operating margin expansion and earnings per share growth. Our strategy is working. These results continue our track record of consistent delivery. And given our year-to-date performance, we are raising both our top line and bottom line guidance. This morning, I'll provide a brief update on the global consumer landscape. Then I'll focus much of my time on business performance across the segments and discuss how we've been investing to further strengthen our capabilities to capture longer-term growth opportunities. John will end by discussing financial details for the quarter, our revised guidance for full year 2023 and some early considerations for 2024. The global operating environment is always dynamic and this quarter was no exception. Some markets improved sequentially, while others dealt with a variety of factors ranging from transitory weather conditions, ongoing inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions and conflicts. We delivered 11% organic revenue growth this quarter driven by positive volume, some pricing actions in the marketplace and carryover pricing coming into the base from last year. Volume grew 2% and sequentially improved each month in the quarter with September being our strongest month. Our year-to-date volume growth remains consistent with underlying performance compared to 2019. And overall, our industry remains vibrant and is expanding and we are executing to capture that growth. During the quarter, we gained volume and value share in both at-home and away-from-home channels. Consumer sentiment continues to vary around the world. In developed markets, consumer spending in agro goods [ph] has held up quite well, however, some consumers feel pressured. We've seen some shift to discount channels and switching to private label brands in a few markets and categories. The intensity of this activity was largely the same across Europe compared to the previous quarter but was less pronounced in the U.S., Australia and Japan. In the developing and emerging markets, the picture is more mixed. We're seeing broadly consumer strength across Latin America, India and in parts of Central and Southeast Asia. On the other hand, consumer confidence in spending has yet to fully recover in Africa and China. Our revenue growth management execution capabilities give us a distinct advantage and we are leveraging these capabilities to ensure we have the right product in the right package in the right channel and at the right price points to meet consumers where they are. Notwithstanding the dynamics in play around the world, we have many levers to pull and continue to deliver through varying market conditions. I'll share some more details from each region. Starting with Asia Pacific; we delivered organic revenue growth but operating income declined primarily as a result of investing ahead of the curve to participate in longer-term opportunities and incurring additional costs from strategic portfolio rationalization. In ASEAN and South Pacific, we grew top line and profit by linking our brands to drinking occasions coupled with strong execution. In Thailand, we launched Coke Kitchen which connected consumers to influencers who shared their favorite recipes with Coca-Cola. We also partnered with food service aggregators to drive combo meals. Campaign attracted nearly 1 million consumers and we significantly increased the attachment rate of our beverages with meals ordered through food service aggregators. In Japan, we're gaining volume and value share year-to-date. We continue to see strong momentum from our Coca-Cola, Georgia Coffee and I LOHAS campaigns and have stepped up execution in vending, e-commerce and community channels. However, in China, volume declined as the sparkling soft drink category is taking longer to recover. Our results were also impacted by some strategic conditions to deprioritize lower profit categories. Our focus is to restore momentum to the sparkling soft drink category and capitalize on revenue growth management and execution opportunities. In India, we delivered double-digit volume and top line growth which resulted in the highest value share gain over the past 3 years. We're winning in the marketplace by generating 2.6 billion transactions at affordable price point and driving availability across rural regions. Across Asia Pacific, as part of our World Without Waste strategy to help drive circular economy for packaging materials, our system launched 100% recycled PET packaging in India, Indonesia and Thailand. Moving on to EMEA; we delivered strong organic revenue and operating income growth. In Africa, macro conditions remain challenging and our business was further impacted by natural disasters in Morocco and Libya. Despite this environment, we drove transaction growth through accelerated refillable PET expansion, digitizing nearly 100,000 outlets and adding 80,000 coolers used to date. In Europe, consumers are still facing pressure and our business was unfavorably impacted by poor weather. Despite these dynamics, we gained value share through strong performances in sparkling soft drinks and tea. We did this by partnering with systems to drive value for key customers and our consumers. We continue to see promising early results for Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola in Europe. We are learning and expanding in alcoholic drinks, including our recent announcement of our Absolut Vodka & Sprite. And last, in Eurasia and Middle East, we recruited consumers through innovative, occasion-based marketing events like Fanta Fest Turkey which focused on snacking occasions with concerts by prominent local artists. They also launched 100% recycled PET package this summer. In North America, we generated strong organic revenue growth and delivered margin expansion by executing across our total beverage portfolio. We continue to see away-from-home channel outperform at-home channels. Within sparkling soft drink, elasticities are holding up well and we continue to drive quality leadership with Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta. For example, our systems stepped up in-store activation on Sprite Lymonade Legacy and with increased displays at point of sale which drove higher household penetration and repeat purchases. Fanta drove nearly 2 points of vale share gain year-to-date through innovation and new graphics, including the latest Halloween iteration of the What the Fanta platform. Outside sparkling, BODYARMOR and Powerade trends are stabilizing. And fairlife, Core Power, smartwater and Gold Peak generated value share gains. And in the U.S., to protect water resources, we renewed a decade-long partnership with the Department of Agriculture to restore and improve water sheds in national forests and grasslands. Water is a critical priority for our system and the communities that we serve. In Latin America, we generated double-digit top line and profit growth by executing on all facets of our strategy which resulted in value share gains in 4 of our top 5 markets. In the fifth market, Mexico, we're seeing improving value share trends over the last few months. We're increasingly linking our brands to consumers' passion points to build deeper connections. In Brazil, through Coke Studio, we partnered with the Town Music Festival, where we hosted 60 hours of concert and engaged with artists and influencers which generated 1 billion impressions and reached nearly 50 million consumers. We continue to drive affordability through refillable packaging of larger PET packages. In developing and emerging markets, refillables are an important tool to eliminate waste and offer products at lower price points. Last, our systems stepped up availability, reflecting over 270,000 coolers year-to-date which increased our share of visible inventory in key areas. Global ventures generated strong overall growth. At Costa, we strengthened our revenue growth management equation while driving transaction growth. This was supported by strong innovation and marketing campaigns such as our global summer of ice, expansion of the refreshment category and the introduction of our personalized pre-drop loyalty activation in U.K. Additionally, innocent gained value share in both the U.K. and France. Finally, Bottling Investments Group grew organic revenue and operating income through expanding affordable immediate consumption entry packs and progressing for strengthening route to market and optimizing trade collections. At the same time, we're working towards decarbonizing our operations in India through using 200 electric vehicles with plans to add more before the end of 2023. Beyond the quarter, we continue to have confidence in the long term. We see momentum continuing across our industry and our system is galvanized more than ever to capture this opportunity. Leveraging data to drive better decision-making is key to improving execution. Our system has collectively invested in digital initiatives to drive on all facets of our strategy. Starting first with marketing and innovation. Our marketing transformation is increasingly making our brands more relevant to consumers. Today, Gen Zs spend 7 to 9 hours per day on screen. However, very little time is spent watching traditional TV. We've been shifting our media spend towards digital. In 2019, digital was less than 30% of our total media spend and year-to-date is over 60%, through digital campaigns which segment the population that's disproportionately reaching consumers where we earn higher return on investments. We've seen tremendous engagement through digital-first campaigns for Coke with meals, Sprite Heat Happens and Fuze Tea's Made of Fusion among others. We're taking bold steps to be at the forefront of both consumer and non-consumer facing generative AI. For example, we launched Create Real Magic which turns consumers into digital creators. We also brought GenAI into our creative process for the award-winning Coca-Cola Masterpiece film and letting the fans the chance to take a piece of this work through the sale of NFTs. Recently, we launched Coke Y3000 which is our eighth iteration in the Coke Creations platform. Coca-Cola Y3000, the world's first futuristic flavor, co-created with AI. The launch has demonstrated strong initial results. On the non-consumer facing side, we're implementing generative AI to improve access to insight, market data, research and trends. Moving on to revenue growth management and integrated execution. As a system, we're accelerating eB2B platforms that allow for better tailoring of product, price and packaging architecture, reducing out of stocks and optimizing placement of physical inventory. Year-to-date, we've connected 6.9 million customers to eB2B platforms. We continue to expand coverage and offer customers personalization at scale. Initial pilots suggest that customers who receive AI-written push notifications have been more likely to purchase recommended SKUs, resulting in incremental retail sales. And we're just scratching the surface of what's possible but we're investing in digital capabilities now to expand our potential down the road. To sum it all up, we're encouraged by our results year-to-date and this is reflected in our updated 2023 guidance. We have many levers to pull and have proven that we can deliver in many types of markets around the world. We continue to win on a local level, maintain flexibility on a global level and reinvest to build our system for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to John. Let me just offer up a few thoughts, Dara. Firstly, just breaking out Q3 because I think that's instructive as you think about the down end of the year and into next year. Firstly, there are a couple of points in Q3 that's the carryover from the more inflationary environment from 2022. And obviously, that will drop out as we get into Q4 and obviously next year. And then you've got the regular pricing. And then you've got a couple of points of pricing that's coming from these very high inflation markets, Argentina, Turkey and a number of the African markets that, given the levels of inflation, is making a difference at the overall company level. And as John mentioned in the FX guidance, we're assuming some degree of negativity from those markets next year. But we are assuming some degree of positivity in that sense in price/mix next year. The one thing that's uncertain about -- the one thing that's certain about high inflation markets is it ends unpredictably. So it's very early to have a full pitch on what that's going to look like in 2024. And obviously, we'll update when we get to February. So net-net, you're going to have continued moderation heading towards the landing zone in the developed economies. You've got a couple of emerging markets which are subnormal inflation, aka China. And then, you've got a mixed bag of emerging markets and a particular importance is going to be what is the overall journey in these high-inflation marketplaces. So hopefully that provides some parameters with which to think about how it lands in Q4 and into next year. Sure. So firstly, I want to just underline that we have been pursuing for a good number of years but very specifically this year and also will be pursuing into next year is, no matter what the degree of inflation in the environment, we want to protect the scale of our consumer franchise and see it grow. In other words, we want to see positive volume or transaction growth in the environment. And so very much our strategy of the marketing, the innovation, the RGM, the execution has been very much around not just gaining value share in these environments but making sure that there's volume growth embedded in it; so we very much take that approach. And as it relates to the regions where there was inflation, where there's volume, I mean, the two biggest pieces of the puzzle are Latin America and EMEA. And taking those in order, Latin America, the inflationary pricing is very clearly driven by Argentina. The rest of the content, generally speaking, is in the same sort of ballpark, the inflation that has been predominant there for an extended period of time. And it's an environment we very much know how to operate in. And we have a great business there and they very much are masters of executing against the marketing innovation, the execution, the RGM. And then Argentina is a rollercoaster, given its inflation levels and its economic levels. I can say that from personal experience as I was the country manager there in 2001 and 2002 when they had a big devaluation and default on their debt. And so this is something where we know how to operate and it's kind of part of what happens in certain markets in Latin America and so we are able to execute. As it relates to EMEA, divided into two parts. One is the European environment where inflation, much like the U.S., is moderating down and the dynamic in Europe was much more around a moderating degree of inflation and the fact that they had a relatively poor summer in terms of the weather and the consumer is perhaps under a little more pressure than the U.S. The other half of the EMEA group is Eurasia and Africa. And in that context, there are a number of very high inflation marketplaces like Turkey, Zimbabwe as it happens, Nigeria to some extent, Egypt to some extent. And there, when the inflation does spike, you do occasionally see impacts to volume. But overall, we've been able to manage through it so that on a total segment basis, we've carried it through. And we certainly look to, as I said, maintain and grow the consumer franchise, although in some of those markets in any given quarter, the volume may be negative as inflation tends to be much more spiky than the system. Okay. Just kind of let me try and unpack that a little bit. So we have come in post-COVID over the last couple of years and said we expected a rebound. And we are going to lean in and invest for growth as long as growth is there rather than trying to pull back in anticipation of something. And that modus operandi, I'm not sure I would characterize extra marketing as a drag on results, more as a motor to driving the top line and the bottom line that we're seeing. So we feel that the leaning in is working, obviously, typified by the fact we've raised both the top line and the bottom line guidance. I think as a model to the extent that we can continue to push that through the end of this year and into next year, we would certainly be happy to do so. Having said that, to the extent that 2024 brings some unexpected surprises, we will pivot, whether it's a country, a region or globally, we will pivot with speed as we did in the second quarter of 2020 when COVID hit and we ramped down marketing spend in that environment. So we feel we've developed a much greater degree of flexibility to move, should moving be needed at whatever part of the world. But as a starting point, we're going to lean in for growth. And I think the last thing I would say is if you think about the balance of all these items, if you take -- if you kind of zoom out a little bit and take a broader perspective of the operating income margin because obviously, marketing is just a component of all the different pieces, if you take a look at operating income margin over the, I don't know, last 5 years or so, you'll see that it's been increasing at about 0.5 point a year operating margin which is broadly in line with the implied leverage in the long-term growth model. And so that has been an objective of ours. It's not going to happen every quarter because quarters are very lumpy but it is part of the way we see our strategy. Sure. Thanks, Robert. Look, I absolutely think there's a tremendous opportunity in the U.S. marketplace to leverage greater pack diversity. We're not capturing all the opportunities that are there. And the leveraging of greater pack diversity actually helps in an environment where, as you have in the U.S. at the moment where certain segments of consumers feel under disposable income pressure and would look for more affordable options. And yet, there are plenty of segments either in terms of their income or in terms of the channels they're going and spending in who are more disposed for premium options. So the marketplace offers the opportunity of greater segmentation and diversity of packaging. We have more that we can do in the marketplace in the U.S., whether it be on the nature and the range of the can sizes and shapes or the PET bottles. So I think there's plenty of runway in the U.S. to continue to leverage packaging diversity to satisfy consumer needs and to deliver on the RGM equations that we have the opportunity for in the U.S. And ultimately, you could look at other parts of the world, Latin America or Europe which are relatively developed cold markets and see that we do successfully use more packages there to deliver the business that the consumers want to have. Yes. Sure, Chris. I don't think we're reaching a threshold in terms of the expansion of Coke Zero. Actually, I think quite the opposite, I think there's a vast potential for Coke Zero going forward. I think what you see in the very short term is the impact of some of the big Coke Zero markets aka Europe. They also had a very poor summer and run for a couple of months there and that makes it look like it's dipped down in Q3. But I think Coke Zero has plenty of runway going forward and we will continue to invest behind it and are bullish on its long-term potential. Yes. Sure, Bill. Obviously, I hate the idea of just waiting for something to happen macro economically. Certainly, it helps when there's a tailwind from the general environment but we're not going to wait for that. We're very focused on investing to try and capitalize on the opportunities and restore momentum, particularly on the sparkling business and there's a lot of RGM and execution opportunities for us to go and tackle in China. Also, we need to get cranked up and have a really strong Chinese New Year which will be in the early part of 2024. And we took a set of decisions in Q3 which created a bit of an impact on the APAC segment margin to really get focused and kind of invest ahead and make some prioritization decisions so that we can really drive the Chinese business forward, hoping that there'll be a plus from the tailwinds of the macroeconomics but we can't wait for that. We need to focus on controlling what we can control and investing to drive the business. Sure. Let me start there, Charlie. We have a clear stated objective that we want to be the world's smallest bottler and so over time have been refranchising the operations. We currently hold basically 4 pieces: the Philippines, a large-stage CCBA, a significant part of the system in India and then a number of -- a small number of other countries, about 1/4 in each in rough terms. And so we are long-term, refranchises of the bottling operations we own. In terms of the Philippines, we've had actually a good set of recent years in the Philippines, a good bounce back notwithstanding some ups and downs, given availability or as I said, lack of availability of some critical commodities in the marketplace. But actually, overall, we've had a very good run in the last number of years. And so we've been looking for the right time and the right partners to refranchise to. I think most importantly, this is a combination of a strong, local, long-term investing family, the Aboitiz Group together with some system expertise coming from CCEP. So, I think it's the right combination of partners that can bring bottling expertise and knowledge of the Philippine market -- Philippines market together to continue the track record of what's been achieved. John, do you want to do the other pieces? No, we didn't give a precise number but it's about 2.5 points. It depends which countries you want to add in and where you want to cut the line but think of it as about 2.5 points in Q3. Sure. Firstly, let me start by saying the Nielsen universe represents just under half of our business in the U.S. So the measured channels are just under half of the total business. And what's happening in the consumer landscape is in kind of simplifying it down, the lower-income consumers are those most under pressure and the shopping occasion that's most under pressure is when they're buying for at-home. And so that is the business most captured by Nielsen. And the bit of the marketplace where there's more growth is when consumers are away from home. So there's still very -- still a rebound and strong growth in away-from-home channels, not just some of the restaurants but the amusements, travel, leisure, hospitality, those things. So you're seeing more growth in that part of the marketplace which is unmeasured. And so that's what's really driving the strength of the U.S. business overall and the revenue side. And so you see kind of a divergence of the consumer behavior between at home and away from home. Obviously, who's under pressure from a disposable income is clear. And then that feeds through into kind of the observed measures channels versus the total overall marketplace. Okay. So I think -- look, the European consumer is under slightly more pressure than the U.S. consumer from a disposable income point of view. That's the starting point. So I think that's why you see a little more trading down or tightness on basket size in Europe versus the U.S. And I think that's generally overall true. And then the question of which categories are most pressured by that is really about brand strength and prioritization of occasions by the consumer. So if you've got to save money, you don't trade down averagely across everything, you make a choice in certain categories and you preserve your choices on other categories. So very much our objective is to make sure they value our brands so that they make the choices in the shopping occasion. If there is going to be a reduction in total spend, that obviously happens in some other categories when they trade down to the private label in those ones. And we preserve our brand strengths because we deliver value for them in the product, in the marketing and innovation. And so that's the overall dynamic as we see it. And that's the difference between the U.S. and Europe. Sure. Yes. I mean, China was clearly a drag in volumetric terms on the segment. Most importantly, from a margin point of view, it's really important to not over-rotate to the numbers in any given quarter, given the lumpiness of -- this is concentrate sales, several steps back in the supply chain from the consumer. So I think it's important to always take an average of four quarters. In the third quarter, as I commented a little earlier, we made a number of decisions on portfolio prioritization as it related to China and to investing for a fast start in 2024 in a number of markets in Asia Pacific, whether that be Japan or China. And so there are some investments going there. The overall pricing environment is relatively clear. China inflation is relatively minimal. In Japan, we've been taking pricing recently, given the inflation in Japan which is kind of very different to the last 30 years. And then the rest of the inflation is kind of the relatively obvious CPI around the rest of ASEAN and Australia. And so that's really what's driving it. I think see the third quarter in Asia Pacific more as an anomaly in terms of price/mix rather than a trend. What was the last bit of the question, Carlos? Sure. I mean the U.S. bottler is much like the rest of the international bottlers are undergoing a set of digital investments. And actually, it's both. The answer is not either, it's both. We have been making investments in technology for a long period of time to drive efficiencies through the supply chain, through the manufacturing, through the logistics whether it be old-school technology investments, AI and now generative AIs are kind of a different feature. So there's a lot going on and there's a lot of connectivity among the bottlers on the enterprise software side because they're all connected through -- they're basically all use or most of them use a shared platform to get things done that's referred to internally as CONA. So there's a lot of investment on making sure the supply chain is as efficient as it can be and a lot of support from ecosystem partners to get it done. And then in terms of the rest of the -- I mean, they're investing in the marketplace that digitize the relationship with largely the non-modern trade. Obviously, when you're talking to the big modern retail customers, that interaction is already largely digitized. And the focus there is on trying to intensify the connection, really from a supply chain, inventory visibility and forecasting effectiveness point of view but the connectivity already exists. And then from the non-chain customers, it's really about can you get them on to -- in simple terms, a B2B platform so that it's 24/7 opportunities to order, knowing that if you can digitize the relationship, then it tends to be deeper and more productive. And then once that exists, layering on an AI component which a number of the bottlers internationally have been working on in coordination, an AI-supported kind of B2B relationship over a platform that can then provide them suggested purchase orders. And that is also helping to drive the business. So the U.S. bottlers in that sense are very much on a similar journey to the international bottlers. Sure. We -- our objective is to do justice for the brands in the portfolio. And certainly, you can make an argument that those categories where we have lower shares have a natural opportunity to gain share. But of course, that is something you need to take from someone else. The other way of seeing the world is to say that the beverage industry seen from a global perspective are referenced back to the page in CAGNY with all the little people on it, the vast majority of the page is actually white space. In other words, the beverage industry is not yet created. And so actually, the idea that sparkling continues to grow is a representation of us operating from a position of strength to create the industry in the white spaces with our most successful and strongest brands. And so continued growth of sparkling should be a feature of our path going forward. And then in the non-sparkling categories, of course, we are looking to gain share. We talked historically about trying to get from experimental to challengers to leader to quality leadership. And I think that is a long-term build that has been playing out. If you take the long-term perspective and look at the percent of the total business that is made up of non-sparkling brands, it has increased slowly but it has increased consistently over the last couple of decades. So we start from a point of view of being consumer-centric from resource and capital allocation and from earning the right to move up the experimenters into the challenger into the leadership position. Nothing radical is going to happen overnight. But it is a dynamic that has built steadily over the last number of years and decades. And we're confident in the opportunity to rebuild the industry or to build the industry further into the future. Okay. That was the last question, operator. Okay. So to conclude, thanks very much, everyone. We've proven, I hope you can see, in Q3 that we continue to deliver volume, top line growth and incremental U.S. dollar earnings per share by executing against our all-weather strategy. And we're confident that we can create value over the long term. So thank you for your interest and your investment in the company and for joining us this morning."

            "name": "John Murphy",
            "content": "Thank you, James and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll comment on our third quarter performance and highlight our updated 2023 guidance. I'll also provide some early commentary on 2024 and the actions we are taking to continue to deliver on our objectives. As James mentioned, we delivered strong third quarter results. Starting with the top line. We grew organic revenues 11%. Unit case growth was 2%. If you exclude the impact of suspending our business in Russia, we have delivered positive volume growth in each quarter since the start of 2021. Concentrate sales were in line with unit cases for the quarter. Price/mix growth was 9% driven by pricing actions across operating segments, including the impact of a few hyperinflationary markets, along with carryover pricing coming into the base from last year. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 130 basis points driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 20 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong top line growth and the impact of refranchising bottling operations, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments versus the prior year as well as currency headwinds. Putting it all together, third quarter comparable EPS of $0.74 was up 7% year-over-year despite higher-than-expected 4% currency headwinds. Free cash flow was approximately $7.9 billion year-to-date. This was largely attributable to strong underlying operational performance and working capital benefits, partially offset by $720 million transition tax payment and $230 million in M&A-related payments. Our balance sheet is strong and our net debt leverage of 1.5x EBITDA is below our target range of 2 to 2.5x. Recently, we entered into a letter of intent to refranchise our Philippines bottler. As we progress on our refranchising journey, we aspire to improve the return profile of our business. In 2015, when Bottling Investments Group was more than 50% of our net revenue, our return on invested capital was approximately 17%. Today, Bottling Investments Group makes up less than 20% of net revenue. And our return on invested capital is over 23%, nearly a 7-point increase. After this transaction closes, our remaining assets in the Bottling Investments Group will include operations in India, Africa and several smaller locations, primarily in Asia Pacific. We will remain disciplined in our refranchising approach by making sure we best position our system to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Our business performance year-to-date gives us confidence that we can deliver on our raised 2023 guidance. This is comprised of organic revenue growth of 10% to 11% which will be led by price/mix and includes positive volume growth. We do expect pricing in developed markets to moderate in the fourth quarter as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. There are also a few hyperinflationary markets that will continue to drive price/mix. There will be 1 additional day in the fourth quarter. We now expect comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 13% to 14%. And based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now expect currency to be an approximate 4-point headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 6-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect per-case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023. We now expect our underlying effective tax rate for 2023 to be 19%. All in, we are updating comparable earnings per share growth of 7% to 8% versus $2.48 in 2022. We continue to expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations. That's approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments. This guidance does not include any payments related to our U.S. income tax dispute with the IRS which are unlikely to occur in 2023. Given the momentum of our business, the strength of our balance sheet and some proceeds that we expect to receive from bottler refranchising, we have increased flexibility to continue to both reinvest in our business and return capital to shareowners. While it is too early to provide specific items on 2024, we want to share some considerations based on what we know today. We're encouraged by our top line momentum across the majority of our markets. There are a handful of hyperinflationary markets where it is either not possible to hedge or it is costly to do so. In these markets, we've demonstrated that we can manage currency pressures by taking price with local market inflation and we will continue to follow this approach. While some commodities are normalizing, we also have input costs that could be impacted by tensions and conflicts. With respect to advertising spend, our bias is to continue to reinvest behind our brands while maintaining flexibility. Regarding currency, if we assume current rates and our hedge positions, there would be an approximate low single-digit currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate mid-single-digit currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024. Of course, several factors could impact both our currency outlook and broader business outlook between now and February. Over the past few years, we've delivered U.S. dollar EPS growth and we have many levers to continue to do so. So in summary, we are encouraged by our business results and confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments over the long term. Thanks to the incredible commitment of our system employees around the world, we're very clear on the direction we are heading and well equipped to execute on the strategies to get us there. And we continue to invest to drive sustainable long-term growth. We remain focused on capturing the opportunities available to us. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions. Thanks, Andrea. So on the first point, if you think about 2023 from where we were 12 months ago and what we're guiding to for the rest of this year, it's in an environment that has had the same kinds of ForEx headwinds and much of the volatility that I would expect to continue into the next 12 months or so. And we've demonstrated as we've both highlighted both in the script and in a number of forums, the levers that we have developed over the last few years to effectively manage through those -- a period with such volatility and uncertainty; and I expect 2024 to be a similar type of year. So I would point you to many of these levers are improved marketing and innovation, the revenue growth management abilities that I think year-on-year are getting stronger and the overall execution of our system in the marketplace. So the industry continues to be strong and we expect that to be a feature of our underlying equation for 2024 also. Regarding the second point you raised, it is an area that we are very focused on. There's still a lot of views out there as to what impact, if any, it will have. I would offer -- if you step above us and lock us -- the thrust of our total beverage strategy over the last few years, that we are well positioned to provide choice and to provide options for people's respective motivations and needs. And so we'll continue to monitor the space but we're confident that the total beverage strategy -- 68% of our products have low or no calories today. And we continue to invest in innovation and choice to deal with whatever comes out [ph]. Yes. So on the transaction stuff, Charlie, we'll guide in February, assuming that the deal closes. It's -- we're making great progress on that at the moment. And without giving specifics, as you know from history and it will have a revenue headwind and a margin tailwind. And specifics, we'll give more details in February. And with regard to your last -- the last part of the long question, I would say the following. One is we have, I think, developed a strong position and created flexibility, given the momentum we have in the business, the stronger balance sheet we have today versus a few years back and the fact that we do have proceeds coming in from non-operating sources, i.e., the bottler refranchising primarily. We continue to be very focused on reinvesting in the business and returning capital. And as we look at some of these proceeds coming in, we will evaluate their best use, including share repurchases beyond the current objective we have to cover dilution. So more to come on that in February."

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and therefore questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations Department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Ms. Robin Halpern, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Halpern, you may now begin.\nRobin Halpern: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We've posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website at cocacolacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results, as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins. In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks, we will turn the call over for questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then re-enter the queue. Now I'll turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. After a strong start to the year, we continued our momentum in the second quarter. Our combination of strong love brands and an aligned pervasive distribution system is allowing us to win in many different operating environments. Given our strong first half results and the resilience of our business, we are raising both our top line and bottom line guidance today. To give you the full picture of our results and our raised guidance, I'll start by discussing second quarter performance and provide perspective on the current business and consumer environment. Then I'll highlight our performance across categories, including how we are driving quality leadership throughout our portfolio. Finally, I'll touch on why we're confident in our ability to deliver our long-term objectives and then John will end by discussing our results for the quarter and our revised guidance for 2023. In the second quarter, competing macro forces were at play across our markets. On the positive side, many supply chain pressures eased, concerns surrounding the stability of the banking sector diminished, and energy prices continued to pull back from record highs. However, global inflation was still elevated and geopolitical tensions continued to exist in some markets. Despite this confluence of factors, we delivered 11% organic revenue growth in this quarter. Volume was flat and after a slower start, it sequentially improved, with June being our strongest month in the quarter. In the first half of 2023, we delivered volume growth that was consistent with our underlying performance since 2019. More broadly, our industry is strong and we believe we have significant headroom to grow both volume and value and we continue to gain share. During the quarter, we gained value share in both At-Home and Away-From-Home channels. As we look towards the second half, the global inflationary environment is impacting consumers and our business differently across geographies. In developed markets like North America and Western Europe, inflation is beginning to moderate and labor markets remain strong. Our elasticities continued to be relatively low. However, we have seen some willingness to switch to private label brands in certain categories. Across the sector, consumers are increasingly cost conscious. They're looking for value and stocking up on items on sale. In these markets, our pricing is largely in place and is expected to moderate as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. It's more important than ever to be consumer centric and to partner with customers to provide affordable and premium propositions which deliver value through basket and incidents growth. In many developing and emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, consumers are more accustomed to persistent inflation. However, the number of markets with intense inflation has expanded. Five of our top 40 markets are currently experiencing over 20% annual inflation. In these markets, it's equally important to leverage revenue growth management capabilities to balance affordability with premiumization to be able to take price with local market inflation, which helps offset the currency pressures. There are, as always, a few markets affected by specific local factors. In China, economic recovery slowed in the second quarter and inflation has declined. Consumer confidence is below pre-pandemic levels and we continue to monitor our leading consumer indicators and take action to win in the market. In India, business was unfavourably impacted by unseasonable rain and cooler temperatures in the quarter. However, the growth outlook remains intact. In a world with a wide spectrum of market dynamics, from inflation to currency devaluation to shifting consumer needs, our business is proving to be very resilient. We have many levers to pull to manage successfully through different operating environments, and we remain consumer centric and focused on growth. A Recipe for Success is unchanged. We continue to deliver on our strategy through a combination of world class marketing and innovation, excellence in revenue growth management and strong execution. We are raising the bar and increasing quality leadership across our portfolio. Starting with Coca-Cola. We are growing our base of Gen-Z drinkers, gaining share and leveraging our scale to drive efficiencies across our system. During the quarter, we gained volume and value share by linking Coca-Cola to consumption occasions and engaging consumers through local experiences. A great example is A Recipe for Magic, which was activated more than 50 markets and celebrates consuming Coca-Cola with meals. The campaign was supported by experiences using local chefs, leveraging approximately 750 influencers globally and was brought to life through social media and recipe focused billboards. The Coke and Meals campaign also allows Coca-Cola to strengthen its local relevance. For instance, in the Away-From-Home channel in Italy, Coca-Cola has grown incidence with Pizza, the number one consumed meal with approximately 3 billion pizzas each year from 10% to 20% over the past four years. While the Coca-Cola brand is ubiquitous, we tailor our price pack architecture to consumption occasions and are continuing to drive both affordability and premiumization. During the second quarter, we grew basket incidence and volume per trip by double-digits while increasing price per liter. Moving on to sparkling flavors. We are seeing strong engagement from consumers across our stapler brands, which includes Sprite, Fanta, Fresca and Thums Up. At the same time, we have significant headroom to drive further quality leadership across developed and developing markets. With Sprite, we are driving brand awareness by connecting consumers to passion points and personalized experience at a more granular and locally relevant levels through our global Heat Happens platform. In North America, Sprite celebrated Hip-Hop's 50th anniversary with the launch of Sprite Lymonade Legacy and sponsorship of concert tours, exclusive experiences and collaborations with prominent artists. We partnered with local pop stars and a Grammy producer in China using our global Sprite Limelight music program for Gen-Z drinkers across 1500 college locations. In South Korea, the Sprite Waterbomb Festival similarly generated strong results. In India, the Joke-in-a-Bottle promotion allowed consumers to scan packages and receive customized and localized jokes through WhatsApp to beat the heat. In June, Sprite was awarded Most Resilient Brand by Kantar for adding the greatest number of new households in 2022 of any FMCG brand. Turning to water, sports, coffee and tea. We are segmenting the broader opportunities and using our refreshed resource allocation capabilities to prioritize markets and subcategories that offer the highest return on our investment. We are building our edge through consumer centricity by accelerating the speed to market of our innovation, measuring results in real-time and scaling successes. We continue to build excitement for Fuze Tea through the rollout of Green Tea in Mexico. Some are limited edition in Turkey and expansion of Zero Sugar offerings across Europe. Early results show promising velocities and Fuze Tea grew volume double-digits during the quarter. Vitaminwater is another example. During the quarter, we relaunched Vitaminwater Zero in North America with a new sweetener system of Monk Fruit and Stevia, which generated value share gains. We are capitalizing on consumer needs for rapid hydration, a fast growing sub-segment within sports drinks with the launch of BODYARMOR Flash I.V. in the US and FlashLyte in Mexico. While still early, both saw strong consumer interest during the quarter and have demonstrated promising initial results. Juice value added dairy and plant-based beverages have delivered nine consecutive quarters of double-digit top line growth and gained both volume and value share during the quarter. We continue to innovate and drive premiumization under the Simply trademark, Simply Mixology, which provides consumers with great-tasting mixers and ready-to-drink mocktails. kicked off an experiential campaign that celebrated the start of the summer and its national rollout. Also, Fairlife had another exceptional quarter as both Core Power and Fairlife nutrition plan continued their strong momentum. In May, we announced a $650 million investment to build a state-of-the-art production facility to help drive the next wave of growth. Finally, we are encouraged by what we are seeing across alcohol ready-to-drink beverages. We continue to take a measured approach through exploring and applying our learnings. While it's still early, Jack and Coke has shown promising results. In the Philippines, the combination of Jack and Coke and Lemon-dou delivered strong share gains. The Schweppes Mojito rollout in India is also off to a good start. And these examples illustrate how our marketing transformation is coming to life. The strength of our total beverage portfolio gives us further confidence that we can continue to deliver by providing consumers beverage choices for every occasion. Our purpose is to refresh the world and make a difference. And we remain committed to building a more sustainable future for our company and the planet as we strive to grow our business. We continue to pursue progress toward our vision of a circular economy for packaging through innovation and partnerships. For example, in the US, we recently partnered with Republic Services to ensure we have an adequate supply of recycled plastic for our packaging. At the same time, we are embracing refillables. We recently kicked off a program with customers in four US cities to test refillable fountain cups with plans to expand elsewhere. We've successfully navigated the first half of the year, which supports our decision to raise guidance for the full year. And instead of trying to predict the many directions things could take, we remain focused on delivering our key objectives that we outlined in February. In other words, number one, pursuing excellence globally and winning locally through relentless consumer centricity to drive top-line momentum. Two, investing for the long-term health of our business and raising the bar across all elements of our strategic flywheel. And three, generating US dollar EPS growth. Our system has never been stronger and our global network model is allowing us to quickly adapt to changing environments. We believe we are well positioned to deliver our updated guidance and objectives, thanks to our incredible system employees around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to you, John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with the momentum of our business and our strong second quarter results. Starting with the top line, we grew organic revenues 11%. Unit cases were flat. As James said, volume for the second quarter got off to a slower start, but ended on a positive note. Concentrate sales were one point ahead of unit cases for the quarter, primarily driven by the timing of concentrate shipments. Price mix growth was 10% for the quarter, driven by carryover pricing coming into the base from last year, along with some new pricing actions across operating segments, including the impact of hyperinflationary markets. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 40 basis points, driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottler refranchising partially offset by the impact of currency. Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 90 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong top line growth and the impact of refranchising bottling operations. Partially offset by an increase in marketing investments and higher operating costs versus the prior year as well as currency headwinds. Putting it all together, second quarter comparable EPS of $0.78 was up 11% year-over-year despite higher than expected 6% currency headwinds. Free cash flow was approximately $4 billion year-to-date. This was largely attributable to strong underlying operational performance and working capital benefits, partially offset by a $720 million transition tax payment that was made during the second quarter as well as M&A related payments. Our balance sheet is strong and our net debt leverage of 1.6 times EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same and we continue to invest to drive long-term growth. As James mentioned, we are encouraged by what we are seeing in the marketplace. While we continue to spend our strategic flywheel faster to generate top line led growth, we've also progressed on a margin agenda, as demonstrated by our consistent track record of offsetting cost headwinds to sustain steady gross margins. We have numerous levers available to drive top line growth and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our spend over the long-term. Our all-weather strategy, coupled with the great plans that we have in place to continue to create quality leadership across our portfolio give us good visibility to deliver on our raised 2023 guidance. This is comprised of organic revenue growth of 8% to 9%, which includes positive volume growth while continuing to be led by price mix. There are a few considerations to keep in mind. We expect pricing in developed markets to moderate through the year as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. In developing and emerging markets, we aim to take price with local market inflation. To the extent that intense inflationary markets drive elevated price mix. The impact is oftentimes offset by currency, as it is frequently difficult to hedge our exposure. Due to our reporting calendar, there will be one additional day in the fourth quarter. We now expect comparable currency neutral earnings per share growth of 9% to 11%. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we are updating our currency outlook of an approximate 3 to 4 point headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 4 to 5 point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023. Inflationary pressures are beginning to moderate in some ways, including freight rates that are favorable compared to last year. That said, several commodities that are prevalent in our basket like sugar and juice remain elevated and we have some hedges that we will be rolling off to less favorable rates. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect per case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid-single digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023. Our updated underlying effective tax rate for 2023 is now 19.3%. All-in, we are updating comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus $2.48 in 2022. We continue to expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations less approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments. If you exclude the transition tax payment made in the second quarter and various payments associated with M&A transactions, our implied free cash flow conversion would be within our long-term guidance. This guidance does not include any payments related to our ongoing US income tax dispute with the IRS. As we enter the second half of the year, we continue to build a culture that emphasizes raising the bar in every aspect of how we do business. Thanks to the tremendous ongoing commitment of our system employees around the world, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our guidance for 2023 and drive value for our stakeholders over the long-term. With that operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I guess I have a question about just as we kind of look into the back half of the year and looking at organic sales, the implied organic sales guidance, which I guess is in the kind of the 5 to 6% range in the back half of the year. Maybe James and John, can you just talk a little bit about how maybe the just the macro environment or you know the operating conditions are today versus what you were thinking at the start of the year? And given that there's, you know, more of these markets where countries where hyperinflation is an issue, is price a little bit more of a driver in terms of the organic sales comp in the back half of the year relative to volume again versus kind of what you were thinking at the start of the year?\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Good morning, Bryan. Yeah, let me try and unpack that a little bit. I think the headline part of the answer is there's a little more pricing in Q2 and in the downhill than we had expected at the beginning of the year, principally around that basket of countries where inflation is high above 20% and a little more persistent. That's the short answer. The longer version of the answer is, look, we're executing the strategy we've talked about consistently over time and again in CAGNY, the real focus on upping the bar on marketing, upping the bar on RGM, the commercial strategies and the execution of the marketplace. All with the intent about delivering a good strong top line led growth algorithm. And obviously that we've talked historically, that is normal, normal times that 5% to 6% would be split between volume and price on a roughly equal basis. And so what you're seeing in the back half of the year, which I think is important to note, is we're expecting volume to be consistent in the second half with the way it was in the first half, which in the end is running on a trend, if you like, a CAGR versus 2019, similar to what we did last year. So we see, you know, sustained positive volume growth coming out of '22 and we're looking for volume growth in the second half in a very similar way to the first half, whether you're comparing to prior year or to 2019. So we want a business that is growing consumer base for all the right appropriate strategic reasons. Then what's going to happen to revenue in the second half is we're going to see the impact of three buckets of price mix. The first bucket is the carryover of pricing from prior year. Obviously there was more cost inflation last year, but logically that is a set of numbers that is going to tend to zero by the end of December. And so that is going to step down as we go through Q3 and Q4. So bucket one carryover that's going to step down. Bucket two is price increases we've made so far this year that are leaving aside the large inflation countries look much more like a normal year in terms of what we've taken this year, both in terms of timing, number of price increases and relative level of price increases. So we're --\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we are experiencing technical difficulties. Please stay on the line.\nJames Quincey: When did I stop? Operator do you know when the line cut on my answer?\nOperator: Unfortunately not, sir. Our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJames Quincey: Hang on, one sec, operator.\nOperator: Oh, sorry.\nJames Quincey: Operator, if you let me just finish the other question.\nOperator: Certainly.\nJames Quincey: I was going to back up. Apologies to everyone for the technical trickiness. I'm just going to back up. And if I'm repeating something I said apologies and if there's a gap in the logic, apologies again. I think we talked about volume second half similar to first half, whether you're talking prior year or 2019 pricing three buckets. The big -- the bigger piece of the pricing of the three factors, which is the carryover obviously stepping down through the year towards zero by the end of the fourth quarter. The new pricing that's come in '23 being very consistent with the kind of our normal level of pricing that we would see. And it's kind of in place already for the year and that obviously then continues at the same rate through the rest of the second half. And the third piece, which is about a quarter of what's happening on PMO at the moment, this bucket of higher inflationary countries. And as I said earlier, there was a little more inflation from those countries in the second quarter than we had previously expected. Obviously that then comes back around in a little more ForEx headwind. We are assuming that some of those inflation rates will moderate in the balance of the year in the second half. And likewise moderate in the ForEx, although it's very uncertain. So we'll have to see what happens. But that's basically the composition of how to think about the effect of our strategy delivering goods, good top line growth in the second half. Next question, operator.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Can you hear me okay? Because like my line's got crackly now. That's okay.\nJames Quincey: Yeah, we got you, Lauren.\nLauren Lieberman: Cool. Good morning. Okay. I wanted to ask a little bit actually about Costa and coffee overall in light of the resource allocation model and identification of key profit pools and so on, not mentioned in the prepared remarks, but definitely called out in the press release this morning with particular strength in the UK. So I guess broad question would be how coffee overall is kind of fitting in on this thought process and resource allocation models if they are getting their particular differences by geography because we've heard different emphasis on the category by different bottlers. And then specific to the numbers called out in the release and Costa UK, should we think about that as recovery with mobility, COVID or tweaks or adjustments to the strategy you've made that are beginning to come through in performance? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Sure, Lauren. Let me do it in reverse order. The Q2, I think, is more recovery than new stages of growth. Having said that, the Express machines have continued to expand numerically in terms of numbers of placements all the way through COVID and including so far this year. So the Express business, the B2B business, the UK is -- has been strong, remains strong and still growing, so gaining share. The retail -- the store numbers are much more about a recovery kind of completing the play on mobility perhaps and gain share a little bit. And obviously, we're focused on how to drive growth going forward, and we see plenty of headroom in the UK market. But I would characterize year-to-date more on -- more of a biased recovery on stores than new and the bias on Express on new. Internationally speaking, in -- if you just break it down into -- there's a couple of different buckets, the ready-to-drink bucket, we've made some good progress in China. We made some good progress in Japan with launches of ready-to-drink Costa in the case of Japan complementing Georgia. And actually Japan had a pretty good start to the year growing both Georgia and Costa. So kind of a full coffee strategy in the ready-to-drink looking good and that's still the most important ready-to-drink coffee market for us. And then the B2B, which is a mix of Express along with kind of we're serving to providing machines and beans, starting to see that getting some traction in Europe with the bottling partners there and starting to kind of find its feet in the US, too. And those are the ones I've called out as the most -- as at front of the program in terms of geographic expansion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nDara Mohsenian: So I just wanted to follow-up on Bryan's back half question. You did mention a weaker start in April post the Q1 call and then the stronger June volume performance, obviously, on this call. Is that engendering additional confidence internally around top line? And the reason I'm asking is it sounds like conceptually, you're not necessarily guiding to the June volume strength continuing in the second half. I'm just trying to understand that. Is that more just prudence, given the inflationary environment you mentioned and consumer volatility? Or are there other factors there? And as we think about your full year organic sales growth guidance range as part of that question, was that just the upside in Q2? Was some of it maybe some upside from Q1? Did you change expectations at all for the back half within that full year organic sales growth guidance raise? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: I think, Dara, you might get the prize for the most questions in one question. Look, the -- clearly, in the second quarter, as we had anticipated in the previous call, April has started softly. But then things kind of normalized towards the end of the quarter, and June was a good solid month of growth. But I think the easier way to think about it is take the whole of the first half because you're always going to have some good months and some bad months. April happened to concentrate some price increases in developed countries and bad rains in India. Look, that will always happen on any given month. I think what is a question of what gives us confidence in the back half of the year by just saying January to June with its combination of good, middling and bad months, the growth rate in the first half, what we're expecting is a similar sort of growth rate in the second half, whether you compare to 2022 or to 2019. And so we think the momentum is there. We think in the developed markets, we've got through the pricing that needed to be taken in '23. We don't foresee substantive new pricing in the downhill. But we think this is going to be a well set up run through in the second half. And as I called out on that other answer with Bryan that the uncertainty factor is really around a concentrated in a few of these more inflationary marketplaces. Guidance going up, I guess there's obviously some flow through. We had a good first quarter, obviously, versus consensus. About a second quarter -- we clearly feel confident in our outlook for the full year, which is why we're taking it up. So there's some flow through. Obviously, there's some timing factors in the relative performance in Q2. And as we've talked on previous calls, given the nature of our business and where we sit in the supply chain relative to final sales, I think it's always good to take a multi-quarter average to the way of thinking about volume or pricing or even the flow-through to EPS. And I think that's kind of something that we always think about. Otherwise, you can get too distracted by the ups or downs on any given quarter. So we're going up. In the guidance, we feel confident about the second half. There'll always be some puts and takes, but we think we have a great strategy and a great plan to execute for the rest of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Good morning. I guess I had a question on your Asia Pacific operating margins, which were pressured again this quarter. And then, James, you touched on a couple of markets that are still facing pressures, but just hoping you could share a little bit more color on some of these headwinds in the region. And then any key initiatives you might have implemented to mitigate some of these pressures? And as a result, how should we think about your op margins trending through the remainder of the year in the region? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. As it relates to Asia Pacific, what we -- there's obviously a set of things that happened in Q2 that were specific to Q2. There were some destocking in the China operating unit that was kind of a significant piece there. And there was some strong demand for some of the juice businesses in China and India. And those are two kind of atypical factors that happened that depressed on a timing basis, the margin in Asia Pacific. It is worth noting that there is a sort of structural headwind when seen specifically just at the Asia Pacific region level. And what I mean by that is that we have a very big business in Japan, which is an excellent business and has a good operating margin. But then Asia Pacific concentrates a set of fast-growing emerging and developing markets, India, China, some of the Southeast Asian countries. And given the nature of how fast they grow and their emerging profile, i.e., they have price points that are lower than Japan, they create a negative geographic mix effect to the Asia Pacific reporting segment. And that's been a feature for an extended period of time. In other words, you have to sell one point something cases in India and China to make up to kind of compensate the mix effect relative to Japan. So that kind of structural headwind is always slightly there. Obviously, our objective is through our strategies, our marketing, RGM execution and the way we invest to try and offset that headwind. So if you look back over time, you'll see that the -- whilst the margin fluctuates up and down, it has kind of had a certain stability when you look, for example, 2019 versus 2022. And so I close by saying don't over rotate to one quarter in the case of Asia Pacific, given some of the issues. But I would also point out that this is not a region seen on its own where operating margin is likely to grow all the time because of the structural mix effect. But when seen at the company level, we obviously manage it as part of the overall portfolio so that it is a piece of the puzzle in looking at our total strategy of, as we've talked about, using the levers to hit that top end of the revenue 5 to 6 with a little bit of aggregate operating income margin expansion for the total enterprise. And we understand the role of each segment within that equation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nStephen Powers: Hey, good morning. Thank you. Actually, I want to squeeze in two topics, but I want to pick up first on, James, what you were just talking about in the broader total company context. In the quarter, the top line was obviously strong. But I think relative to external expectations, we saw a bit more margin flow through and SG&A leverage than was expected, especially in regions like North America, where the margin was exceptionally strong relative to history. So I'm curious in terms of how to think about the balance of managing top line growth versus continued margin expansion as you think about the back half. But then also more broadly, just in the context of your top line-led algo, is there may be more cost efficiency opportunities that we should be thinking about longer term? Or is what we see in the quarter maybe more just a matter of timing? I also, John, if I could, I just want to loop back to a question I asked last quarter on below-the-line dynamics. You came into the year talking about below-the-line deleverage, interest expense and so on. We haven't seen that again this quarter, especially with the lower tax rate. So I'm just curious if that has changed in the full year and is that factored in to the full year guidance raise. Thanks for both.\nJohn Murphy: Steve, let me take the second piece first. It's fairly straightforward. In the quarter, we benefited from higher equity income and from interest that we earned on our overseas cash, which was in both cases ahead of what we had assumed when we guided at the start of the year. And for the second half of the year, I don't expect either of those two to be as strong. So I do think we'll have a little bit of deleverage in the second half of the year but modest, not a significant variable for your consideration in the second half of the year.\nJames Quincey: Yeah, back to the margin element of the question. North America, in a way, is a fluid side of what we just talked about in Asia Pacific. Obviously, the results came in very strong in North America on the top line and on the margin. Again, there are a number of timing factors that kind of flatter the second quarter margin structure in the case of North America, including, for example, the -- a bit like the Costa UK bit as it was a much faster growth rate in the Away-From-Home than the At-Home in the North American marketplace. And obviously, that's margin accretive. That should be seen as, in a way, more completing the play of the recovery versus COVID. So the completion of the reopening of restaurants, cafes, theme parks, et cetera, et cetera. And so that channel mix, if you like, flatters the operating income in the short-term. There's a number of timings of other things that impact that, BODYARMOR integration, et cetera. I think the way to think about margin going forward by segment and most importantly for the company overall is, firstly, not to overrotate on any one quarter. Remember that there are a number of expense items and deduction items that we accrue on the basis of sales curve, not just what actually happened in the quarter. So timing is a feature. And that's why I'm very strong and let's take four quarters in a row and look at that relative to history. And when you do that, whether in North America or Asia Pacific or more importantly, the company in the overall, what you're going to see is us sticking to our strategy, which is to drive the growth from the top line and then to look for modest or moderate increments of the operating margin, which we deliver not just by effective strategies to allocate resources, whether they be marketing or operating expenses so that we are efficient and get a little bit of leverage there. But the design of the portfolio itself and the RGM strategies also is a component in creating sales that inherently have a little more gross margin. So we use all the levers to try and deliver. And so don't take these segments over or under deliveries as a sign of something new and radical happen. They are features of our business model. And the big overall idea is top line growth with small increments of operating margin expansion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. James, I'd like to talk about the global system. Recently, there's been a lot of interesting developments from some of the bottlers. You had CCH by Finlandia. You've had a lot of your bottlers, particularly in Latin America and elsewhere, talk about B2B platforms that they're developing. And so my question is, how are you thinking about these developments? Are there new models, revenue, earnings sharing models? And how do you make sure that the bottlers stay focused on those products that drive the most value for The Coca-Cola Company? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Let me start just by headlining actually, we've just come off. Last week, we had a global bottler meeting in Atlanta. I think it's in 30-plus years since we had that meeting in Atlanta, but we had it in Atlanta last week with the majority of the biggest bottlers in the Coke system. And I think it was a very clear meeting on our collective will and ability and interest in investing in this business and our overall level of alignment on what's important and what should we drive individually and what needs to be driven collectively. So actually, you guys all go around and talk to the bottlers as well, and I think you will get it reflected back from them that there is a very high degree, not just an alignment on what needs to be done, but enthusiasm on the opportunities ahead of us to drive the business, our collective business forward. On some of the specifics, clearly, you've got in that basket, there are things that happen around the world that are local and a better set of dynamics that are important and relevant and not necessarily projectable around the world. And the case of CCH and the distribution, now the ownership of Finlandia, I think, is one of those. The B2B platforms, which are progressed very nicely in Latin America are a feature of the business in multiple other countries. We've been testing and exploring and developing individually and collectively B2B platforms with the principal objective of enhancing the system and most importantly, the bottlers' relationships with the retailers. To the extent that we can complement, and here we're largely talking the fragmented channel because the relationship with the modern trade is already set on electronic platforms anyway. We're talking about the fragmented trade, and the majority of the almost 30 million customers we visit as a system is to enhance that relationship, to make it no longer hostage to the visit of the Coke sales rep but to make it a 24/7 opportunity to enhance relationship, to order product, to ask for a service call, to get a new cooler, to put some umbrellas up or to add to an order that's already about to be delivered. And that is certainly when we have evaluated how those customers where the B2B platforms are available how they're doing versus where it's not yet rolled out. There's clearly an improvement, not just in the relationship however you want to measure it, but also in the sales. So there's a lot going on in the system. And I think the last thought there is you should take it also as examples of the willingness of the system to experiment and try and be on the front edge of what drives value in the marketplace.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChristopher Carey: Hi. Good morning.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nChristopher Carey: You made a comment on some private label switching happening in certain markets. Can you just expand on where you're seeing this specifically geographically and perhaps by category and the playbook that you'll be deploying in these markets, the sorts of developments that you'd be looking for to respond to these actions ahead? And I asked that a bit in the context of, clearly, some of your ingredients are still quite inflationary and whether you see any potential risk to being able to price against that inflation in some of these markets going forward. Obviously, you have a playbook with a lot of different levers. And I'm just curious to hear your thoughts on where these developments seem to be happening and how do you think about responding to these a bit more specifically. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. So private label switching is principally a feature firstly in Europe, and then to some extent also in the US. If you were to include price brands or B brands, you might see some of that also in Latin America depending on how you want to define it. But very specifically on private label, that's number one, a European effect; and number two, a US effect. And it's, in our view, highly related to the strength of the brands in any specific category. So we see it more in terms of beverages, happening in water and juices rather than soft drinks and certainly less when you get to colas. The strategy on top of what we need to do in terms of marketing and continuing to make the brands relevant to the consumers and executing in the marketplace is, of course, the RGM strategy. Yes, premiumization remains an opportunity, but we need to keep an anchor and continue to evolve and adapt our strategies on affordability, whether that be refillables, whether it be affordable small packs or affordable future consumption packs, that has become something that is a tested strategy in inflationary environments, well learned in Latin America, for example, but now applied, has been for a number of years in Europe and in the US. And we have more things we can do in both marketplaces to have an anchor in both affordability and premiumization. And that's a playbook that we're rolling out and executing in those marketplaces. As it relates to the inflation and the COGS coming through, obviously, some of that, whether it be juice or sugar and corn syrup, affects different markets. The most of the inflation is in a set of markets where we do price for local inflation. And in a way, the higher inflation gets, the more likely it is we're just -- you're going to follow inflation. And so the risk not following is not really there as it goes up. The risk actually appears on the volume side. But this is a select group of markets. So if it were to err towards the more inflation in the back half of the year, we think it's manageable. If we were to err for the less inflation, that would be good, but we think it's in a bucket of manageable things. And as it relates to the total company relative to some of those input costs, we have very long-term relationships with most providers and long-term hedging programs, which allow us to kind of -- they don't avoid inflation, but they smooth it that they make it much more manageable from a pricing and packaging point of view.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey, good morning, everyone. Can you guys talk a bit more about your alcohol strategy broadly, particularly with the Red Tree beverages subsidiary? And specifically in terms of like new innovation, any other subcategories or areas where you're looking to expand within alcohol? I know you're experimenting, but just any color on the future plans will be great. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Thanks, Filippo. Look, the Red Tree entity that we stood up in the second quarter is more of a technicality than some new big step. It isn't a change of strategy, and it's not a vehicle to distribute in the US. It allows us a better platform to engage with the partners that we're working with in the US in terms of coordinating and influencing the marketing and allows us a better separation of the alcohol versus the non-alcohol band. So it's more an optimization of the model and how we want to execute things rather than a different thing. And then in terms of progress, look, it's still a small part of the business. And as I talked about, I think it was CAGNY, that's great, and there are lots of runs on the board. Jack and Coke has got some really promising nice results, including in the US. Simply Spiked Peach is performing very nicely in the US. If you want to look for a really bright spot, you can hedge the Philippines and Jack and Coke and Lemon-Dou, which is an alcoholic lemon drink, got well over 30% share of the RTD category. All of this is very encouraging as we continue to take a measured approach to this and to kind of learn and apply our learnings. All of this needs to generate belief that it can be material for the Coke company, not just a nice business, and that we're still in the process of driving towards. But certainly, so far, we're pleased with what's taken place and we are encouraged about the next steps that we have to take.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you for squeezing me in. And James, on your volumes commentary, and I appreciate that on your four-year CAGR, I think if our math is correct, it's 1.7% unit case for total company, which is obviously remarkable. That said, I think, EMEA was a bit softer in the quarter. I understand your commentary about Russia. And what is actually happening in EMEA ex-Russia? And how we should be thinking going forward? And related to that, since you commented that the US was very strong out of home, and Europe is a big percentage of Europe is out of home, on the comments about June, how we should be thinking not only about Europe, but the performance of on-premise against off-premise globally? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Hang on, I'm trying to process all the questions. I think you've beaten that was, Dara? I think you've beaten, Dara. EMEA was a bit soft. Yes. I think on EMEA, we are -- it was even though -- so on EMEA, we're expecting EMEA to be positive in the second half. And so there was a ramp effect from the withdrawal from Russia in the second quarter. But we -- so Europe was in pretty good shape, actually, Europe ex-Russia. If you take the first half, Europe ex-Russia was positive. So we are feeling that now it's dropped out of the base numbers in the second half that actually Europe and EMEA will be in good shape. Obviously, EMEA has got a couple of the hyperinflationary countries like Turkey, like Pakistan, so EMEA could get other effects. But if you concentrate where Russia is, which is Europe, which is the biggest impact, actually, Europe had a positive volume in the first half if you take out Russia. And so we're feeling good about Europe as we go into the second half. And I think the question really is the trade-off between pricing and volume in a couple of countries, particularly Turkey and Pakistan and for those that want to go deep down the rabbit hole, Zimbabwe as well. Now the next part of the question, which was about our Away-From-Home versus At-Home. Yes. It wasn't just June, which was the strength in the US basically the first half. You've seen the Out-Of-Home growing ahead of the At-Home and the recovery. And I think that's the way to think about it is we're seeing the back-end of the recovery in the Away-From-Home. Similarly, in Europe, in fact, globally, transactions were ahead of volume, which tends to imply smaller packages are growing faster than bigger packages from a mathematical point of view. So as a global feature, there's a little more on-premise consumption or a little more small package consumption than large package consumption, which helps as well. But I don't think we should see this as a new secular trend, more the kind of the last bit of renormalization post-COVID.\nOperator: Our final question today will come from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. So James, maybe just two quick follow-ups. One, just on Chris' question around trade down and improving affordability. Do you expect any changes in the promotional environment, particularly in North America? It doesn't sound like that's a shift you expect, but just wanted to be sure. And then just following up on your response to Andrea's question, I would be curious how you see channel mix evolving as consumers seek more value in some of these developed markets, particularly just given the strength from Away-From-Home that you just alluded to? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: We see the US pricing and promotional environment as pretty rational. We have a set of strategies in place to try and balance our premiumization, regular and affordability strategies in the US, which includes a little more promotion than the first quarter. But basically, promo levels are very similar to prior years and not as a step up. And we think that we have the right balance of premiumization and affordability plays to be able to continue to gain as we did in the second quarter volume and value share in the US. So we think the environment is rational. We think our strategy works for us because we gain volume and value share. And we've got the right mix of -- roughly the right mix of promo and price. And obviously, we're going to continue to push the affordability and the premiumization play. And then the channel mix question, do we think we'll see in developing markets -- I think the principal feature is a renormalization post-COVID. I don't think it's kind of recessionary or inflationary or that. I think it's just been -- we've kind of seen a renormalization of the channel mix. We had talked over prior years about how big an impact on price mix and margin structure, the shift in channels were with what seems ages ago, the lockdowns. That has now largely played out, which is another way of saying, we don't expect channel mix to be a major feature of the discussion in quarters and years to come.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Thank you, operator. So just to quickly summarize. Second quarter results, I think, demonstrate the momentum we have in the marketplace. We are navigating a broad set of dynamics in the local markets while driving scale and maintaining flexibility at a global level. We're confident in our ability to deliver on our '23 guidance and our longer-term objectives. Thanks for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Quincey",
            "content": "Thanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. After a strong start to the year, we continued our momentum in the second quarter. Our combination of strong love brands and an aligned pervasive distribution system is allowing us to win in many different operating environments. Given our strong first half results and the resilience of our business, we are raising both our top line and bottom line guidance today. To give you the full picture of our results and our raised guidance, I'll start by discussing second quarter performance and provide perspective on the current business and consumer environment. Then I'll highlight our performance across categories, including how we are driving quality leadership throughout our portfolio. Finally, I'll touch on why we're confident in our ability to deliver our long-term objectives and then John will end by discussing our results for the quarter and our revised guidance for 2023. In the second quarter, competing macro forces were at play across our markets. On the positive side, many supply chain pressures eased, concerns surrounding the stability of the banking sector diminished, and energy prices continued to pull back from record highs. However, global inflation was still elevated and geopolitical tensions continued to exist in some markets. Despite this confluence of factors, we delivered 11% organic revenue growth in this quarter. Volume was flat and after a slower start, it sequentially improved, with June being our strongest month in the quarter. In the first half of 2023, we delivered volume growth that was consistent with our underlying performance since 2019. More broadly, our industry is strong and we believe we have significant headroom to grow both volume and value and we continue to gain share. During the quarter, we gained value share in both At-Home and Away-From-Home channels. As we look towards the second half, the global inflationary environment is impacting consumers and our business differently across geographies. In developed markets like North America and Western Europe, inflation is beginning to moderate and labor markets remain strong. Our elasticities continued to be relatively low. However, we have seen some willingness to switch to private label brands in certain categories. Across the sector, consumers are increasingly cost conscious. They're looking for value and stocking up on items on sale. In these markets, our pricing is largely in place and is expected to moderate as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. It's more important than ever to be consumer centric and to partner with customers to provide affordable and premium propositions which deliver value through basket and incidents growth. In many developing and emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, consumers are more accustomed to persistent inflation. However, the number of markets with intense inflation has expanded. Five of our top 40 markets are currently experiencing over 20% annual inflation. In these markets, it's equally important to leverage revenue growth management capabilities to balance affordability with premiumization to be able to take price with local market inflation, which helps offset the currency pressures. There are, as always, a few markets affected by specific local factors. In China, economic recovery slowed in the second quarter and inflation has declined. Consumer confidence is below pre-pandemic levels and we continue to monitor our leading consumer indicators and take action to win in the market. In India, business was unfavourably impacted by unseasonable rain and cooler temperatures in the quarter. However, the growth outlook remains intact. In a world with a wide spectrum of market dynamics, from inflation to currency devaluation to shifting consumer needs, our business is proving to be very resilient. We have many levers to pull to manage successfully through different operating environments, and we remain consumer centric and focused on growth. A Recipe for Success is unchanged. We continue to deliver on our strategy through a combination of world class marketing and innovation, excellence in revenue growth management and strong execution. We are raising the bar and increasing quality leadership across our portfolio. Starting with Coca-Cola. We are growing our base of Gen-Z drinkers, gaining share and leveraging our scale to drive efficiencies across our system. During the quarter, we gained volume and value share by linking Coca-Cola to consumption occasions and engaging consumers through local experiences. A great example is A Recipe for Magic, which was activated more than 50 markets and celebrates consuming Coca-Cola with meals. The campaign was supported by experiences using local chefs, leveraging approximately 750 influencers globally and was brought to life through social media and recipe focused billboards. The Coke and Meals campaign also allows Coca-Cola to strengthen its local relevance. For instance, in the Away-From-Home channel in Italy, Coca-Cola has grown incidence with Pizza, the number one consumed meal with approximately 3 billion pizzas each year from 10% to 20% over the past four years. While the Coca-Cola brand is ubiquitous, we tailor our price pack architecture to consumption occasions and are continuing to drive both affordability and premiumization. During the second quarter, we grew basket incidence and volume per trip by double-digits while increasing price per liter. Moving on to sparkling flavors. We are seeing strong engagement from consumers across our stapler brands, which includes Sprite, Fanta, Fresca and Thums Up. At the same time, we have significant headroom to drive further quality leadership across developed and developing markets. With Sprite, we are driving brand awareness by connecting consumers to passion points and personalized experience at a more granular and locally relevant levels through our global Heat Happens platform. In North America, Sprite celebrated Hip-Hop's 50th anniversary with the launch of Sprite Lymonade Legacy and sponsorship of concert tours, exclusive experiences and collaborations with prominent artists. We partnered with local pop stars and a Grammy producer in China using our global Sprite Limelight music program for Gen-Z drinkers across 1500 college locations. In South Korea, the Sprite Waterbomb Festival similarly generated strong results. In India, the Joke-in-a-Bottle promotion allowed consumers to scan packages and receive customized and localized jokes through WhatsApp to beat the heat. In June, Sprite was awarded Most Resilient Brand by Kantar for adding the greatest number of new households in 2022 of any FMCG brand. Turning to water, sports, coffee and tea. We are segmenting the broader opportunities and using our refreshed resource allocation capabilities to prioritize markets and subcategories that offer the highest return on our investment. We are building our edge through consumer centricity by accelerating the speed to market of our innovation, measuring results in real-time and scaling successes. We continue to build excitement for Fuze Tea through the rollout of Green Tea in Mexico. Some are limited edition in Turkey and expansion of Zero Sugar offerings across Europe. Early results show promising velocities and Fuze Tea grew volume double-digits during the quarter. Vitaminwater is another example. During the quarter, we relaunched Vitaminwater Zero in North America with a new sweetener system of Monk Fruit and Stevia, which generated value share gains. We are capitalizing on consumer needs for rapid hydration, a fast growing sub-segment within sports drinks with the launch of BODYARMOR Flash I.V. in the US and FlashLyte in Mexico. While still early, both saw strong consumer interest during the quarter and have demonstrated promising initial results. Juice value added dairy and plant-based beverages have delivered nine consecutive quarters of double-digit top line growth and gained both volume and value share during the quarter. We continue to innovate and drive premiumization under the Simply trademark, Simply Mixology, which provides consumers with great-tasting mixers and ready-to-drink mocktails. kicked off an experiential campaign that celebrated the start of the summer and its national rollout. Also, Fairlife had another exceptional quarter as both Core Power and Fairlife nutrition plan continued their strong momentum. In May, we announced a $650 million investment to build a state-of-the-art production facility to help drive the next wave of growth. Finally, we are encouraged by what we are seeing across alcohol ready-to-drink beverages. We continue to take a measured approach through exploring and applying our learnings. While it's still early, Jack and Coke has shown promising results. In the Philippines, the combination of Jack and Coke and Lemon-dou delivered strong share gains. The Schweppes Mojito rollout in India is also off to a good start. And these examples illustrate how our marketing transformation is coming to life. The strength of our total beverage portfolio gives us further confidence that we can continue to deliver by providing consumers beverage choices for every occasion. Our purpose is to refresh the world and make a difference. And we remain committed to building a more sustainable future for our company and the planet as we strive to grow our business. We continue to pursue progress toward our vision of a circular economy for packaging through innovation and partnerships. For example, in the US, we recently partnered with Republic Services to ensure we have an adequate supply of recycled plastic for our packaging. At the same time, we are embracing refillables. We recently kicked off a program with customers in four US cities to test refillable fountain cups with plans to expand elsewhere. We've successfully navigated the first half of the year, which supports our decision to raise guidance for the full year. And instead of trying to predict the many directions things could take, we remain focused on delivering our key objectives that we outlined in February. In other words, number one, pursuing excellence globally and winning locally through relentless consumer centricity to drive top-line momentum. Two, investing for the long-term health of our business and raising the bar across all elements of our strategic flywheel. And three, generating US dollar EPS growth. Our system has never been stronger and our global network model is allowing us to quickly adapt to changing environments. We believe we are well positioned to deliver our updated guidance and objectives, thanks to our incredible system employees around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to you, John. Yeah. Good morning, Bryan. Yeah, let me try and unpack that a little bit. I think the headline part of the answer is there's a little more pricing in Q2 and in the downhill than we had expected at the beginning of the year, principally around that basket of countries where inflation is high above 20% and a little more persistent. That's the short answer. The longer version of the answer is, look, we're executing the strategy we've talked about consistently over time and again in CAGNY, the real focus on upping the bar on marketing, upping the bar on RGM, the commercial strategies and the execution of the marketplace. All with the intent about delivering a good strong top line led growth algorithm. And obviously that we've talked historically, that is normal, normal times that 5% to 6% would be split between volume and price on a roughly equal basis. And so what you're seeing in the back half of the year, which I think is important to note, is we're expecting volume to be consistent in the second half with the way it was in the first half, which in the end is running on a trend, if you like, a CAGR versus 2019, similar to what we did last year. So we see, you know, sustained positive volume growth coming out of '22 and we're looking for volume growth in the second half in a very similar way to the first half, whether you're comparing to prior year or to 2019. So we want a business that is growing consumer base for all the right appropriate strategic reasons. Then what's going to happen to revenue in the second half is we're going to see the impact of three buckets of price mix. The first bucket is the carryover of pricing from prior year. Obviously there was more cost inflation last year, but logically that is a set of numbers that is going to tend to zero by the end of December. And so that is going to step down as we go through Q3 and Q4. So bucket one carryover that's going to step down. Bucket two is price increases we've made so far this year that are leaving aside the large inflation countries look much more like a normal year in terms of what we've taken this year, both in terms of timing, number of price increases and relative level of price increases. So we're -- When did I stop? Operator do you know when the line cut on my answer? Hang on, one sec, operator. Operator, if you let me just finish the other question. I was going to back up. Apologies to everyone for the technical trickiness. I'm just going to back up. And if I'm repeating something I said apologies and if there's a gap in the logic, apologies again. I think we talked about volume second half similar to first half, whether you're talking prior year or 2019 pricing three buckets. The big -- the bigger piece of the pricing of the three factors, which is the carryover obviously stepping down through the year towards zero by the end of the fourth quarter. The new pricing that's come in '23 being very consistent with the kind of our normal level of pricing that we would see. And it's kind of in place already for the year and that obviously then continues at the same rate through the rest of the second half. And the third piece, which is about a quarter of what's happening on PMO at the moment, this bucket of higher inflationary countries. And as I said earlier, there was a little more inflation from those countries in the second quarter than we had previously expected. Obviously that then comes back around in a little more ForEx headwind. We are assuming that some of those inflation rates will moderate in the balance of the year in the second half. And likewise moderate in the ForEx, although it's very uncertain. So we'll have to see what happens. But that's basically the composition of how to think about the effect of our strategy delivering goods, good top line growth in the second half. Next question, operator. Yeah, we got you, Lauren. Yes. Sure, Lauren. Let me do it in reverse order. The Q2, I think, is more recovery than new stages of growth. Having said that, the Express machines have continued to expand numerically in terms of numbers of placements all the way through COVID and including so far this year. So the Express business, the B2B business, the UK is -- has been strong, remains strong and still growing, so gaining share. The retail -- the store numbers are much more about a recovery kind of completing the play on mobility perhaps and gain share a little bit. And obviously, we're focused on how to drive growth going forward, and we see plenty of headroom in the UK market. But I would characterize year-to-date more on -- more of a biased recovery on stores than new and the bias on Express on new. Internationally speaking, in -- if you just break it down into -- there's a couple of different buckets, the ready-to-drink bucket, we've made some good progress in China. We made some good progress in Japan with launches of ready-to-drink Costa in the case of Japan complementing Georgia. And actually Japan had a pretty good start to the year growing both Georgia and Costa. So kind of a full coffee strategy in the ready-to-drink looking good and that's still the most important ready-to-drink coffee market for us. And then the B2B, which is a mix of Express along with kind of we're serving to providing machines and beans, starting to see that getting some traction in Europe with the bottling partners there and starting to kind of find its feet in the US, too. And those are the ones I've called out as the most -- as at front of the program in terms of geographic expansion. Good morning. I think, Dara, you might get the prize for the most questions in one question. Look, the -- clearly, in the second quarter, as we had anticipated in the previous call, April has started softly. But then things kind of normalized towards the end of the quarter, and June was a good solid month of growth. But I think the easier way to think about it is take the whole of the first half because you're always going to have some good months and some bad months. April happened to concentrate some price increases in developed countries and bad rains in India. Look, that will always happen on any given month. I think what is a question of what gives us confidence in the back half of the year by just saying January to June with its combination of good, middling and bad months, the growth rate in the first half, what we're expecting is a similar sort of growth rate in the second half, whether you compare to 2022 or to 2019. And so we think the momentum is there. We think in the developed markets, we've got through the pricing that needed to be taken in '23. We don't foresee substantive new pricing in the downhill. But we think this is going to be a well set up run through in the second half. And as I called out on that other answer with Bryan that the uncertainty factor is really around a concentrated in a few of these more inflationary marketplaces. Guidance going up, I guess there's obviously some flow through. We had a good first quarter, obviously, versus consensus. About a second quarter -- we clearly feel confident in our outlook for the full year, which is why we're taking it up. So there's some flow through. Obviously, there's some timing factors in the relative performance in Q2. And as we've talked on previous calls, given the nature of our business and where we sit in the supply chain relative to final sales, I think it's always good to take a multi-quarter average to the way of thinking about volume or pricing or even the flow-through to EPS. And I think that's kind of something that we always think about. Otherwise, you can get too distracted by the ups or downs on any given quarter. So we're going up. In the guidance, we feel confident about the second half. There'll always be some puts and takes, but we think we have a great strategy and a great plan to execute for the rest of the year. Sure. As it relates to Asia Pacific, what we -- there's obviously a set of things that happened in Q2 that were specific to Q2. There were some destocking in the China operating unit that was kind of a significant piece there. And there was some strong demand for some of the juice businesses in China and India. And those are two kind of atypical factors that happened that depressed on a timing basis, the margin in Asia Pacific. It is worth noting that there is a sort of structural headwind when seen specifically just at the Asia Pacific region level. And what I mean by that is that we have a very big business in Japan, which is an excellent business and has a good operating margin. But then Asia Pacific concentrates a set of fast-growing emerging and developing markets, India, China, some of the Southeast Asian countries. And given the nature of how fast they grow and their emerging profile, i.e., they have price points that are lower than Japan, they create a negative geographic mix effect to the Asia Pacific reporting segment. And that's been a feature for an extended period of time. In other words, you have to sell one point something cases in India and China to make up to kind of compensate the mix effect relative to Japan. So that kind of structural headwind is always slightly there. Obviously, our objective is through our strategies, our marketing, RGM execution and the way we invest to try and offset that headwind. So if you look back over time, you'll see that the -- whilst the margin fluctuates up and down, it has kind of had a certain stability when you look, for example, 2019 versus 2022. And so I close by saying don't over rotate to one quarter in the case of Asia Pacific, given some of the issues. But I would also point out that this is not a region seen on its own where operating margin is likely to grow all the time because of the structural mix effect. But when seen at the company level, we obviously manage it as part of the overall portfolio so that it is a piece of the puzzle in looking at our total strategy of, as we've talked about, using the levers to hit that top end of the revenue 5 to 6 with a little bit of aggregate operating income margin expansion for the total enterprise. And we understand the role of each segment within that equation. Yeah, back to the margin element of the question. North America, in a way, is a fluid side of what we just talked about in Asia Pacific. Obviously, the results came in very strong in North America on the top line and on the margin. Again, there are a number of timing factors that kind of flatter the second quarter margin structure in the case of North America, including, for example, the -- a bit like the Costa UK bit as it was a much faster growth rate in the Away-From-Home than the At-Home in the North American marketplace. And obviously, that's margin accretive. That should be seen as, in a way, more completing the play of the recovery versus COVID. So the completion of the reopening of restaurants, cafes, theme parks, et cetera, et cetera. And so that channel mix, if you like, flatters the operating income in the short-term. There's a number of timings of other things that impact that, BODYARMOR integration, et cetera. I think the way to think about margin going forward by segment and most importantly for the company overall is, firstly, not to overrotate on any one quarter. Remember that there are a number of expense items and deduction items that we accrue on the basis of sales curve, not just what actually happened in the quarter. So timing is a feature. And that's why I'm very strong and let's take four quarters in a row and look at that relative to history. And when you do that, whether in North America or Asia Pacific or more importantly, the company in the overall, what you're going to see is us sticking to our strategy, which is to drive the growth from the top line and then to look for modest or moderate increments of the operating margin, which we deliver not just by effective strategies to allocate resources, whether they be marketing or operating expenses so that we are efficient and get a little bit of leverage there. But the design of the portfolio itself and the RGM strategies also is a component in creating sales that inherently have a little more gross margin. So we use all the levers to try and deliver. And so don't take these segments over or under deliveries as a sign of something new and radical happen. They are features of our business model. And the big overall idea is top line growth with small increments of operating margin expansion. Sure. Let me start just by headlining actually, we've just come off. Last week, we had a global bottler meeting in Atlanta. I think it's in 30-plus years since we had that meeting in Atlanta, but we had it in Atlanta last week with the majority of the biggest bottlers in the Coke system. And I think it was a very clear meeting on our collective will and ability and interest in investing in this business and our overall level of alignment on what's important and what should we drive individually and what needs to be driven collectively. So actually, you guys all go around and talk to the bottlers as well, and I think you will get it reflected back from them that there is a very high degree, not just an alignment on what needs to be done, but enthusiasm on the opportunities ahead of us to drive the business, our collective business forward. On some of the specifics, clearly, you've got in that basket, there are things that happen around the world that are local and a better set of dynamics that are important and relevant and not necessarily projectable around the world. And the case of CCH and the distribution, now the ownership of Finlandia, I think, is one of those. The B2B platforms, which are progressed very nicely in Latin America are a feature of the business in multiple other countries. We've been testing and exploring and developing individually and collectively B2B platforms with the principal objective of enhancing the system and most importantly, the bottlers' relationships with the retailers. To the extent that we can complement, and here we're largely talking the fragmented channel because the relationship with the modern trade is already set on electronic platforms anyway. We're talking about the fragmented trade, and the majority of the almost 30 million customers we visit as a system is to enhance that relationship, to make it no longer hostage to the visit of the Coke sales rep but to make it a 24/7 opportunity to enhance relationship, to order product, to ask for a service call, to get a new cooler, to put some umbrellas up or to add to an order that's already about to be delivered. And that is certainly when we have evaluated how those customers where the B2B platforms are available how they're doing versus where it's not yet rolled out. There's clearly an improvement, not just in the relationship however you want to measure it, but also in the sales. So there's a lot going on in the system. And I think the last thought there is you should take it also as examples of the willingness of the system to experiment and try and be on the front edge of what drives value in the marketplace. Good morning. Sure. So private label switching is principally a feature firstly in Europe, and then to some extent also in the US. If you were to include price brands or B brands, you might see some of that also in Latin America depending on how you want to define it. But very specifically on private label, that's number one, a European effect; and number two, a US effect. And it's, in our view, highly related to the strength of the brands in any specific category. So we see it more in terms of beverages, happening in water and juices rather than soft drinks and certainly less when you get to colas. The strategy on top of what we need to do in terms of marketing and continuing to make the brands relevant to the consumers and executing in the marketplace is, of course, the RGM strategy. Yes, premiumization remains an opportunity, but we need to keep an anchor and continue to evolve and adapt our strategies on affordability, whether that be refillables, whether it be affordable small packs or affordable future consumption packs, that has become something that is a tested strategy in inflationary environments, well learned in Latin America, for example, but now applied, has been for a number of years in Europe and in the US. And we have more things we can do in both marketplaces to have an anchor in both affordability and premiumization. And that's a playbook that we're rolling out and executing in those marketplaces. As it relates to the inflation and the COGS coming through, obviously, some of that, whether it be juice or sugar and corn syrup, affects different markets. The most of the inflation is in a set of markets where we do price for local inflation. And in a way, the higher inflation gets, the more likely it is we're just -- you're going to follow inflation. And so the risk not following is not really there as it goes up. The risk actually appears on the volume side. But this is a select group of markets. So if it were to err towards the more inflation in the back half of the year, we think it's manageable. If we were to err for the less inflation, that would be good, but we think it's in a bucket of manageable things. And as it relates to the total company relative to some of those input costs, we have very long-term relationships with most providers and long-term hedging programs, which allow us to kind of -- they don't avoid inflation, but they smooth it that they make it much more manageable from a pricing and packaging point of view. Yes. Thanks, Filippo. Look, the Red Tree entity that we stood up in the second quarter is more of a technicality than some new big step. It isn't a change of strategy, and it's not a vehicle to distribute in the US. It allows us a better platform to engage with the partners that we're working with in the US in terms of coordinating and influencing the marketing and allows us a better separation of the alcohol versus the non-alcohol band. So it's more an optimization of the model and how we want to execute things rather than a different thing. And then in terms of progress, look, it's still a small part of the business. And as I talked about, I think it was CAGNY, that's great, and there are lots of runs on the board. Jack and Coke has got some really promising nice results, including in the US. Simply Spiked Peach is performing very nicely in the US. If you want to look for a really bright spot, you can hedge the Philippines and Jack and Coke and Lemon-Dou, which is an alcoholic lemon drink, got well over 30% share of the RTD category. All of this is very encouraging as we continue to take a measured approach to this and to kind of learn and apply our learnings. All of this needs to generate belief that it can be material for the Coke company, not just a nice business, and that we're still in the process of driving towards. But certainly, so far, we're pleased with what's taken place and we are encouraged about the next steps that we have to take. Hang on, I'm trying to process all the questions. I think you've beaten that was, Dara? I think you've beaten, Dara. EMEA was a bit soft. Yes. I think on EMEA, we are -- it was even though -- so on EMEA, we're expecting EMEA to be positive in the second half. And so there was a ramp effect from the withdrawal from Russia in the second quarter. But we -- so Europe was in pretty good shape, actually, Europe ex-Russia. If you take the first half, Europe ex-Russia was positive. So we are feeling that now it's dropped out of the base numbers in the second half that actually Europe and EMEA will be in good shape. Obviously, EMEA has got a couple of the hyperinflationary countries like Turkey, like Pakistan, so EMEA could get other effects. But if you concentrate where Russia is, which is Europe, which is the biggest impact, actually, Europe had a positive volume in the first half if you take out Russia. And so we're feeling good about Europe as we go into the second half. And I think the question really is the trade-off between pricing and volume in a couple of countries, particularly Turkey and Pakistan and for those that want to go deep down the rabbit hole, Zimbabwe as well. Now the next part of the question, which was about our Away-From-Home versus At-Home. Yes. It wasn't just June, which was the strength in the US basically the first half. You've seen the Out-Of-Home growing ahead of the At-Home and the recovery. And I think that's the way to think about it is we're seeing the back-end of the recovery in the Away-From-Home. Similarly, in Europe, in fact, globally, transactions were ahead of volume, which tends to imply smaller packages are growing faster than bigger packages from a mathematical point of view. So as a global feature, there's a little more on-premise consumption or a little more small package consumption than large package consumption, which helps as well. But I don't think we should see this as a new secular trend, more the kind of the last bit of renormalization post-COVID. We see the US pricing and promotional environment as pretty rational. We have a set of strategies in place to try and balance our premiumization, regular and affordability strategies in the US, which includes a little more promotion than the first quarter. But basically, promo levels are very similar to prior years and not as a step up. And we think that we have the right balance of premiumization and affordability plays to be able to continue to gain as we did in the second quarter volume and value share in the US. So we think the environment is rational. We think our strategy works for us because we gain volume and value share. And we've got the right mix of -- roughly the right mix of promo and price. And obviously, we're going to continue to push the affordability and the premiumization play. And then the channel mix question, do we think we'll see in developing markets -- I think the principal feature is a renormalization post-COVID. I don't think it's kind of recessionary or inflationary or that. I think it's just been -- we've kind of seen a renormalization of the channel mix. We had talked over prior years about how big an impact on price mix and margin structure, the shift in channels were with what seems ages ago, the lockdowns. That has now largely played out, which is another way of saying, we don't expect channel mix to be a major feature of the discussion in quarters and years to come. Yes. Thank you, operator. So just to quickly summarize. Second quarter results, I think, demonstrate the momentum we have in the marketplace. We are navigating a broad set of dynamics in the local markets while driving scale and maintaining flexibility at a global level. We're confident in our ability to deliver on our '23 guidance and our longer-term objectives. Thanks for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning."

            "name": "John Murphy",
            "content": "Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with the momentum of our business and our strong second quarter results. Starting with the top line, we grew organic revenues 11%. Unit cases were flat. As James said, volume for the second quarter got off to a slower start, but ended on a positive note. Concentrate sales were one point ahead of unit cases for the quarter, primarily driven by the timing of concentrate shipments. Price mix growth was 10% for the quarter, driven by carryover pricing coming into the base from last year, along with some new pricing actions across operating segments, including the impact of hyperinflationary markets. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 40 basis points, driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottler refranchising partially offset by the impact of currency. Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 90 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong top line growth and the impact of refranchising bottling operations. Partially offset by an increase in marketing investments and higher operating costs versus the prior year as well as currency headwinds. Putting it all together, second quarter comparable EPS of $0.78 was up 11% year-over-year despite higher than expected 6% currency headwinds. Free cash flow was approximately $4 billion year-to-date. This was largely attributable to strong underlying operational performance and working capital benefits, partially offset by a $720 million transition tax payment that was made during the second quarter as well as M&A related payments. Our balance sheet is strong and our net debt leverage of 1.6 times EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same and we continue to invest to drive long-term growth. As James mentioned, we are encouraged by what we are seeing in the marketplace. While we continue to spend our strategic flywheel faster to generate top line led growth, we've also progressed on a margin agenda, as demonstrated by our consistent track record of offsetting cost headwinds to sustain steady gross margins. We have numerous levers available to drive top line growth and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our spend over the long-term. Our all-weather strategy, coupled with the great plans that we have in place to continue to create quality leadership across our portfolio give us good visibility to deliver on our raised 2023 guidance. This is comprised of organic revenue growth of 8% to 9%, which includes positive volume growth while continuing to be led by price mix. There are a few considerations to keep in mind. We expect pricing in developed markets to moderate through the year as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. In developing and emerging markets, we aim to take price with local market inflation. To the extent that intense inflationary markets drive elevated price mix. The impact is oftentimes offset by currency, as it is frequently difficult to hedge our exposure. Due to our reporting calendar, there will be one additional day in the fourth quarter. We now expect comparable currency neutral earnings per share growth of 9% to 11%. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we are updating our currency outlook of an approximate 3 to 4 point headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 4 to 5 point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023. Inflationary pressures are beginning to moderate in some ways, including freight rates that are favorable compared to last year. That said, several commodities that are prevalent in our basket like sugar and juice remain elevated and we have some hedges that we will be rolling off to less favorable rates. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect per case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid-single digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023. Our updated underlying effective tax rate for 2023 is now 19.3%. All-in, we are updating comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus $2.48 in 2022. We continue to expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations less approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments. If you exclude the transition tax payment made in the second quarter and various payments associated with M&A transactions, our implied free cash flow conversion would be within our long-term guidance. This guidance does not include any payments related to our ongoing US income tax dispute with the IRS. As we enter the second half of the year, we continue to build a culture that emphasizes raising the bar in every aspect of how we do business. Thanks to the tremendous ongoing commitment of our system employees around the world, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our guidance for 2023 and drive value for our stakeholders over the long-term. With that operator, we are ready to take questions. Steve, let me take the second piece first. It's fairly straightforward. In the quarter, we benefited from higher equity income and from interest that we earned on our overseas cash, which was in both cases ahead of what we had assumed when we guided at the start of the year. And for the second half of the year, I don't expect either of those two to be as strong. So I do think we'll have a little bit of deleverage in the second half of the year but modest, not a significant variable for your consideration in the second half of the year."

        "content": "Operator: At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to The Coca-Cola Company's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department if they have any questions.\n I would now like to introduce Mrs. Robin Halpern, Vice President Head of Investor Relations. \n Mrs. Halpern, you may now begin. \nRobin Halpern: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer.\n We've posted schedules under financial information in the Investors section of our company website at coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our growth and operating margins.\n In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC report. Following prepared remarks, we will turn the call over for questions. [Operator Instructions].\n Now I'll turn the call over to James. \nJames Quincey: Thanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. 2023 is off to a good start. We continue to execute well and grow amidst the dynamic macro environment. We like to say we have an all-weather strategy, one that enables us to thrive no matter what's happening in the world.\n We pursue excellence globally with an eye towards winning locally as a system. And our brand investments continue to create value for our customers and consumers, leading to our ability to drive quality growth for our stakeholders.\n Today, I'll discuss our first quarter performance and provide some perspective around today's global consumer and macro environment. I'll then reiterate why we are confident in our ability to deliver on our guidance for the full year. And finally, I'll elaborate on how the actions we're taking set us up for success in any environment and how we're driving resilience for our business and continued growth in 2023 and over the long term. John will then discuss our results and go into more detail on the 2023 outlook.\n In the first quarter, pandemic restrictions in parts of the world relaxed, and many supply chain pressures abated. At the same time, inflation and geopolitical tensions persisted. And new concerns emerged around the stability in the banking sector and the magnitude of the potential squeeze on consumers.\n In the face of these factors, we continue to generate momentum as investments in our brands got the year off to a positive start. We remain focused on creating value by meeting the needs of our customers and consumers.\n We delivered 12% organic revenue growth in the quarter. This was primarily driven by pricing actions across markets and revenue growth management initiatives to retain and add consumers.\n We also delivered volume growth of 3%, which is in line with last year versus 2019. We saw growth across developed as well as developing and emerging markets, and we continue to gain both volume and value share for the quarter, including at home and away from home channels. We're encouraged by this momentum and are operating the business with a focus on growth while closely monitoring macro trends for signs of a slowdown. \n As we look around the world today, the consumer picture varies across our markets. In Asia Pacific, the reopening of China has led to an increase in consumer activity, but consumption is still recovering to pre-pandemic levels. India's economy remains resilient with a strong job market and robust consumption. In Japan, consumers are feeling inflationary pressure for the first time in many years.\n In Europe, the recent banking crisis added to last year's energy spike, driving further uncertainty to purchasing behaviors and consumers continue to increasingly seek out affordable and private label options across many FMCG categories.\n In North America, the picture is a mixed bag with unemployment low, gas prices improved and savings holding up, but inflation and higher mortgage rates are top-of-mind concerns for many consumers.\n In many developing and emerging markets in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, consumers continue to face varying levels of inflation and volatility in the macroeconomic conditions. Clearly, there's uncertainty in how the consumer environment may ultimately play out in 2023. But thanks to the hard work of our people and partners, we're a more flexible network enterprise today. And with our enhanced system alignment, we're confident we can win together locally in a wide variety of environments.\n Let's start with the portfolio. We have a growth portfolio of consumer-centric brands across categories, including [ 26 billion-dollar brands ]. Our networked organization is allowing us to raise the bar of innovation and marketing to leverage our loved brands more effectively in the marketplace. We're keeping our streamlined portfolio of brands relevant with consumers and finding innovative ways to offer beverage choices for every occasion.\n In Japan, we recently relaunched our Georgia Coffee brand with a fresh new look and a bright proposition to inspire current consumers and expand Georgia's appeal to a broader audience, complementing Costa's premium ready-to-drink offerings in that market.\n We're expanding our exploration in alcohol ready-to-drink beverages with a keen focus on responsibility. We work with Brown-Forman to roll out Jack and Coke cocktails in the U.S. during the quarter with more markets launching now. It's early days, but the ability to get one of the most popular [indiscernible] in the world in a can is proving to be compelling to retailers and consumers based on preliminary volumes and velocities. We're encouraged by the level of engagement as distribution expands.\n We're driving bigger and bolder innovations that can leverage consumer insights leading to a higher success rate and enduring growth. In North America, we continue to foster brand love for fairlife, which has grown volume double digits for 8 consecutive years. Fairlife became a $1 billion brand last year, and we're building on the momentum of the brand including the success of co-power with fairlife nutrition plan. Launched with a digital-first campaign in the club channel, fairlife nutrition plan has seen strong consumer interest from those looking for high-protein, low-sugar shake that tastes great and is lactose-free. We're planning to expand the product to more channels and packages in the coming months.\n We're working with WPP, our global marketing network partner, and increasingly leveraging digital capabilities to engage consumers through passion points, personalized experiences and collaborations. The Coke Studio concept first drove cultural relevance and brand performance in Pakistan, with the latest season streamed over 1 billion times. We scaled the program to 30 markets last year. And in 2023, it will become an always-on platform across the globe. Connecting consumers' love of music to consumption occasions by spotlighting breakthrough talent, Coke Studio provides a portal to live digital experiences and can be activated using QR codes on our packages.\n Consumers can drink, scan and enjoy their favorite beverage along with music from genres around the world. Working as a network system with our bottlers, we're managing through macroeconomic uncertainty with enhanced capabilities in revenue growth management and integrated execution. We often talk about the many levers of revenue growth management. While the inflationary environment led to proactive pricing increases over the past 18 months, it's important to recognize our RGM capabilities to extend far beyond pricing.\n At its core, revenue growth management is about consumer-centric segmentation, ensuring we have the right product in the right package in the right channel at the right price point, drive transactions and meet consumers where they are.\n Affordability and premiumization are key levers to maintain and expand our consumer base, and we continue to balance affordable offerings with compelling premium propositions to ensure we have beverage options across income levels.\n Affordability is a driver in developing and emerging markets, evidenced by double-digit volume growth in these offerings in Indonesia and Vietnam, helping to drive record sparkling share in Vietnam and driving approximately 3 billion transactions at affordable price points in India this quarter. Premium packages like slim cans and mini cans are seeing strong growth in many markets, including Australia, where mini cans drove 40 million transactions and contributed to share growth in the region.\n Premiumization also includes [indiscernible] occasions. In addition to alcohol, ready-to-drink beverages, we're also participating more broadly in adult alcohol drinking occasions.\n In North America, we've expanded our Simply premium juice brand into the mix of segment with Simply mixology in 3 flavors to serve as a cocktail or mocktail. In Europe, we've relaunched our Kinley and Royal Bliss brands as harmonized platforms to participate in the adult mixer segment.\n For both affordability and premiumization, the value proposition is often messaged at the point of sale, such as the expansion of the value bundle in certain channels in the U.S. and the mini can mini price campaign that drove strong growth in small packages in Japan. RGM, coupled with integrated execution, also drives value for our customers. By providing key insights and offering the right mix of brands, packages, price points and compelling data-driven promotions, we are able to partner with customers that deliver traffic, basket and incidence growth.\n Latin America is a great example of how this came to life in the first quarter, evidenced by revenue growth ahead of transactions and transaction growth ahead of volume. By working closely with key retailers, our system focused on the availability of cold, single-serve beverages in premium brands such as Schweppes and smartwater.\n We introduced refillable packages into new channels, all while driving better in-stock levels and higher consumer traffic in-store, owning accolades from customers. Our business has largely recovered from the effects of the pandemic and remains well equipped to navigate the dynamic macro environment and is emerging with even stronger capabilities and system alignment to deliver vibrant long-term growth for many years to come.\n At the same time, our consumers also care about sustainability. While we strive to grow our business, we also want to be water positive, drive a circular economy for our packaging and grow consumer beverage choices, including low- and no-calorie brands as part of our total beverage strategy. These goals are integral to our business and beneficial for society.\n Our annual business and sustainability will be released soon, including an integrated section on our World without Waste packaging initiatives. We're proud of what we've accomplished so far, recognize there is still opportunity ahead and continue to lead as well as act collectively with other key stakeholders to drive progress on this agenda. I encourage you to learn more about how we're progressing against our targets across various sustainability pillars and priorities to refresh the world and make a difference.\n Before I hand over to John, I'd note that it's early in the year, and there's a fair amount of uncertainty around the operating environment ahead. But our first quarter results give us increased visibility to deliver on our full year 2023 guidance.\n We're executing more efficiently and effectively on a local level, maintaining flexibility on a global level and continuing to reinvest in the business and build the system for the long term. In short, we're expanding the sphere of what we can control. We're well prepared to respond with speed to changing market dynamics as we've demonstrated that we can do. By staying clear on our purpose and remaining consumer-centric, we continue to execute to the sustainable long-term growth.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to John. \nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. We've had a good start to the year with strong first quarter results. Starting with the top line. We grew organic revenues 12%. Unit cases grew 3% with broad-based growth across most markets, driven by investments in the marketplace.\n Concentrate sales were 2 points behind unit cases for the quarter primarily driven by timing of concentrate shipments and 1 less day. Our price/mix growth was 11% for the quarter. Much of this was driven by carryover pricing coming into the base from last year, along with some new pricing actions across operating segments as well as revenue growth management initiatives and favorable channel and package mix.\n Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 120 basis points driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency. Underlying gross margin expansion was driven by a benefit from the phasing of inventory costs, strong organic revenue growth and cycling the timing of M&A integration expenses, partially offset by higher commodity costs.\n Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 40 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by underlying operating margin expansion due to robust top line growth across operating segments, partially offset by increased marketing investments and higher operating costs. Putting it all together, first quarter comparable EPS of $0.68 reflects an increase of 5% year-over-year despite higher-than-expected 7% currency headwinds.\n Free cash flow was negative by approximately $120 million in the quarter. This was largely attributable to the timing of working capital initiatives and the previously discussed M&A-related payments that took place in the quarter.\n Our underlying cash flow generation remains strong, and we feel confident in our cash flow agenda and full year outlook. Our balance [ achieves ] fit for purpose to support our growth agenda, and our net debt leverage of 1.8x EBITDA as of the end of the first quarter is below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x.\n Our capital allocation priorities remain the same. We continue to invest to drive long-term growth and to deliver dividend growth for our shareowners as evidenced by the 5% dividend increase announced in February.\n We remain mindful of maintaining our financial flexibility amidst the ongoing tax dispute with the IRS. We are currently waiting for the tax court to render its final opinion in the case, allowing us to move forward with the appeals process. As previously discussed, we intend to assert our claims on appeal, vigorously defend our position and believe we will ultimately prevail. We will continue to keep you updated.\n As James mentioned, we are encouraged by our first quarter results and are harnessing what we can control to remain resilient in the face of a volatile operating environment. We remain laser-focused on top line-led growth as well as the endurance of the bottom line. And we'll reinvest in our brands with more rigor and discipline using the refreshed resource allocation framework we discussed at CAGNY.\n This approach enables the enterprise to prioritize and put more focus behind country and category combinations that can deliver the best return in the near term while fueling steady progress on our total beverage strategy over time, it also allows us to be more dynamic and to adapt quickly.\n For example, in emerging markets, where commercial beverages are still a small part of daily consumption, we're leading with core sparkling and juice strengths propositions. In developed markets, where consumers are looking for more beverage choices, we're investing behind a broader portfolio of brands and categories, including value-added dairy, enhanced water, tea and coffee.\n Despite the global macro picture remaining uncertain in the months ahead, our planned investments and operational strategy will support the momentum we've seen early in the year and give us good visibility to deliver on our 2023 guidance. This guidance is comprised of organic revenue growth of 7% to 8%, primarily led by price/mix amidst the ongoing inflationary environment, comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 7% to 9%.\n Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we are reiterating our currency outlook of an approximate 2- to 3-point headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 3- to 4-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023.\n Inflationary forces are moderating in some respects. Spot prices have come down in oil and freight rates are more favorable. That said, many commodities were exposed to have been sticky, and we have some advantageous hedges that will be rolling off to less favorable rates during the year.\n Based on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect per case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023. Additionally, we expect wages and inflation in media will continue to remain elevated.\n Despite the increase in the first quarter effective tax rate, we continue to expect our underlying effective tax rate to be 19.5% for 2023. All in, we are reiterating comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5% versus $2.48 in 2022.\n We expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments. I would like to remind you that included in cash from operations are 2 discrete items related to, one, transition tax payments, which will take place in the second quarter; and two, payments associated with M&A transactions. Excluding these, our implied free cash flow conversion would be within our long-term guidance.\n This guidance does not include any payments related to our ongoing U.S. income tax dispute with the IRS. Overall, we don't expect the tax dispute to have a bearing on our ability to deliver on our capital allocation agenda and drive long-term business growth.\n There are some considerations to keep in mind as it pertains to our guidance. We expect price/mix to moderate through the year as we cycle our pricing initiatives from the prior year. The discrete gross margin benefits related to the phasing of inventory costs and cycling the timing of M&A integration expenses this quarter are unlikely to repeat. Given the ongoing backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see higher net interest expense given our effective exposure to floating rate debt.\n And finally, due to our reporting calendar, there will be one additional day in the fourth quarter. With a quarter of good results to start the year and our focus on driving top line-led growth in any macroeconomic environment, we are well positioned to compound quality value by delivering on 2023 guidance.\n Our network structure and aligned system are enabling us to deliver on our 3 key objectives: pursuing excellence globally and winning locally, investing for the long-term health of the business and generating U.S. dollar EPS growth. The strength of our people and great partnerships with our bottlers around the world give us confidence in our ability to win with consumers in the marketplace and deliver value for our stakeholders.\n With that, operator, we are ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. \nDara Mohsenian: So first, just a detailed question. You guys obviously started out with a pretty robust initial outlook for work sales of 7% to 8% for the full year in 2023. Obviously, a strong start in Q1. You kept that full year guidance. So just can you give us a sense, did Q1 come in better than you expected? Was this more expected, why not move on the full year? And within that, can you also comment on away-from-home trends [indiscernible] as we recover from COVID and what you guys are expecting in the balance of the year, including in China, which is probably in a different place in the rest of the world. \nJames Quincey: Sure. Let me start at the back end and come in reverse. So yes, China opening up, certainly a pattern of consumer behavior not unlike when U.S., Europe opened up, so there has been a resumption in consumer activity. There was a rebound of consumption in Chinese New Year, which obviously fell in the first quarter. So we're certainly seeing the performance in China getting better. And we've been focused on bringing back our marketing and increasing availability in some of the rural marketplaces.\n Remember, in Q2, we'll be cycling the toughest part of '22, I think, for China. But net-net, we remain cautiously optimistic. I mean, it's still -- the Chinese business is still below the 2019 level. But we're cautiously optimistic on the rest of the year for China.\n The other part of Q1 and the away from home as much as it seems incredible to remember, Q1 last year was -- we were still talking about Omicron and not everywhere was opened up. So we are seeing in the first quarter this year additional strength in the away-from-home business, so take the U.S. as an example, immediate consumption packages grew ahead of future consumption packages. The away-from-home channels, for example, QSR restaurants, had a good strong quarter the first quarter this year, in part because we're cycling a partially open first quarter.\n And that will logically moderate that as we get into the rest of the year because now we're starting to cycle the opening. So hopefully, that does the 2 pieces.\n Look, overall, first quarter was strong. It was certainly within the bounds of our expectations and our plans. We talk very much in February about how we expected to be able to focus on having volume growth continuing to build the franchise of our beverages across the whole year, but expecting to see pricing moderate from what was similar levels to Q4, which is what we see in Q1, back down to some more normal levels by the end of the year.\n And so good, strong start. And we're maintaining guidance, we still feel confident in our guidance, and we're well equipped. The outlook has a degree of uncertainty in it that's, I think, more elevated than pre-COVID, obviously not COVID-driven. But there's plenty of uncertainty out there in terms of the direction of travel, of inflation, both the consumers' reaction to it and the input side.\n So we have a set of guidance out there that sees both input costs, our own costs and pricing moderating through the year, but there's still a long way to go. So I think take it as we feel good about our guidance. There's a lot left to manage. We have a good strategy, and we're certainly focused on this kind of all-weather results as we go into the rest of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. \nLauren Lieberman: One of the things that stood out to me this quarter was the profitability in North America. So I was just curious if you could comment on that. It looked like margins kind of reached toward a new high watermark. And I was just curious how much of that -- if there was anything onetime or if it has to do with portfolio mix and realization of pricing? \nJames Quincey: Sure. Do you want to do it, John? \nJohn Murphy: Sure. Thanks, Lauren. Yes, on the back of what James just said, a strong start to the year. We expected in Q1 to see North America coming out to [ Gates ], given the carryover pricing that we knew would be a tailwind for the quarter.\n We also saw benefits from immediate consumption been strong through the quarter. And as we look to the rest of the year, we continue to keep in mind our ongoing objectives to expand margins.\n But Q1 was, let's say, we came out of the gate strong, we knew we would. And we look to the rest of the year in line with what James is saying to moderate as we get into the back half of the year on the pricing front and to continue to be laser-focused using our RGM work to stay with the consumer.\n So we feel good about the start. Rest of the year is looking positive. And yes, we'll take into account, I think, some of the trends we're seeing on the macroeconomic and consumer front and manage the -- that environment with the various levers we have. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. \nBonnie Herzog: I had a question on your business in Europe. Organic sales in the quarter were incredibly strong. You're up 23% on a tough comp. So just curious if you could help us unpack this a bit more. Maybe touch on the resilience of the consumer. How big of a factor the mild winter was? And then were there any countries within Europe that were particularly strong, for instance? \nJames Quincey: Yes. Thanks, Bonnie. Look, firstly, EMEA is more than just Europe. That's the first key point. It includes some countries that had some near hyperinflationary effects of Turkey and there's an impact in the first quarter of high inflation in Turkey, which has kind of pushed the price/mix up more than would be normal.\n Secondly, of course, there's some carryover pricing from the inflationary burst that happened in kind of the European Union, certainly U.K. last year. And that will moderate as we go over '23 as is likely to be the Turkish inflation. There's some mix benefits of Western Europe having, as you said, a relatively mild winter. And so despite the pressures on purchasing power, actually, Western Europe had a very good first quarter. And that's good in its own right, but it's also good in a mix effect within EMEA. So kind of everything did pretty well.\n A number of the other Middle Eastern and African countries did well, perhaps with the exception of Nigeria. So it was a strong overall result. Lots of mix in there, and as I said, a bit of an inflationary effect between carryover and Turkey that will moderate in the rest of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. \nBryan Spillane: John, I wanted to just touch back on some of the gross margin comments you made earlier. And I guess, looking at the slide deck, right, there was about 140 basis points of gross margin benefit, underlying gross margin expansion in the quarter.\n Can you just give us some sense of how much, I guess, the inventory phasing and the lapping of the M&A integration costs, just how much of the stuff that, I guess, is kind of more onetime impacted that 140? And I guess as we're thinking about pricing fading through the year, would we be kind of more looking at kind of flattish maybe gross margins as we move through the balance of the year? So if you could just kind of give us a little bit more color on those items would be helpful. \nJohn Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Bryan. So of the 140 basis points, you're correct. The -- included in that is the onetime on the inventory and the cycling of M&A. It's about half of that. The other half comes from -- mainly from the carryover price and some favorable price/mix in the quarter.\n So as you think about the rest of the year, I would keep in mind the following. As I just mentioned in North America, I think it's across the board. Moderation on price, both rate and frequency. I think a greater use of our RGM levers to help to stay with the consumer as we see the consumer in different states, in different parts of the world.\n We will have some FX headwinds similar to what we had in Q1 throughout the year, we -- is our current expectation. We'll have an extra day in the fourth quarter. And so I'd keep in mind that we have interest in our long-term algorithm, an ongoing objective to expand margins, and that remains very much the focus, but you take those items into account for the rest of the year as you think about 2023 full year. \nJames Quincey: I would also say like we've talked about it historically on pricing volume. I would encourage people not to draw correlations through 1 quarter. And you can use full quarters or annuals. Given acquisition relative to the bottlers and the final consumer, I think it's important to kind of average out some of these effects through all the various variables that John mentioned and take a multi-quarter view of what's going on and take that all into account. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. \nStephen Robert Powers: Just maybe first, just a quick clarification. John, I think as you started, you had talked about an expectation of bottom line or below-the-line deleverage on higher interest costs and the like. This quarter, we saw that work in your favor just because of the higher other equity income and just wanted to get an update as to whether you still expect to deleverage on the year or if the first quarter changes that outlook.\n My broader question was back to revenue growth management. And James, you talked about affordability versus premiumization, which has been a theme. I was wondering if you could maybe frame what percentage of the portfolio today is what you classify as affordable versus premium, how those cohorts are growing relative to the totality. And just the relationship between the 2, like would you still be pursuing the affordability opportunity as aggressively if you didn't have the premiumization lever working for you? Are those 2 things related in your mind? Or are they mutually exclusive? \nJames Quincey: Do you want to start? \nJohn Murphy: Yes. Let me take the first part, Steve. Just as you said, the first quarter, we did benefit from the equity income coming in better. And we also had a couple of onetimes on dividends, et cetera, that helped.\n For the rest of the year, no significant change in what we've guided on interest expense. You can expect Q2 and Q3 relative to prior year to be higher impact, given that we really saw the step-up starting in Q4 of last year. So we still, for the full year, expect the same quantum of deleverage as we had indicated in our February guidance. \nJames Quincey: Perhaps I'll take the RGM bit, Steve. I'm not sure I would attach a percentage to it globally. I'm not sure it drives relevance. I think a couple of thoughts, though.\n One, clearly, as over time, there has been an increase in disparity of income in any given country, the need to match the consumer across a broader range of price points has gone up. So you see both more opportunity and more need to have a foot in affordability and the other foot in premium. And so those -- both of the ends of the spectrum have been going up over time as we seek to meet the consumers where they are and where their pockets are and allow them to stay in our franchise.\n So I see it as a need to do more of both. Obviously, what's affordable and what's premium in the U.S. might look different than it does in Africa or China or Western Europe, but the direction of travel is more of both. And the mechanic of delivering on them, again, is different by countries.\n In Latin America, it might be with a refillable PET bottle to get down to affordability. In the U.S., it might be certain package sizes or the level of promos in some of the modern trade channels. Again, premium might look different. It might be returnable glass in Spain. And it might be different categories, for example, fairlife in the U.S. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. \nAndrea Teixeira: James, I appreciate your comment on the puts and takes, especially with the away from home and the easy comps for the QSR in the U.S. in the first quarter. We have been seeing some retailers talk about the weather and also seeing companies talk about weaker recent trends, in particular in the U.S. in March.\n I know to the extent you normally don't give us the exit rate, but particularly now as we see these puts and takes, and of course, your guidance doesn't really imply a continuation of the trends that you saw in the first quarter. So I think, obviously, this start is a pretty good start and give us some more confidence on the rest of the year, but perhaps talk about this intakes and the easy comps in Asia that you alluded to. \nJames Quincey: It's -- I mean, we're 2 weeks into the second quarter. So I think that -- I don't think there's anything particularly productive in it. I mean, they weren't out-of-the-park results in the first couple of weeks, but there was some worse weather in India and the U.S. and the shift of Eastern side. \n I don't think one can draw a lot from a couple of softer weeks in the first 2 weeks of April. The whole -- the performance through the quarter was good. There wasn't a major ski slope from January through to March. And so I think that we saw continued strength.\n I would encourage people as they look out for the rest of the year and think about momentum as I did last year to look at some of the multiyear trends. And last year, I encouraged people to look compared to 2019 on a 3-year CAGR basis because then that helps see through some of the reopenings and closings and all the [ strategies ].\n I would encourage the same thing this year in the sense of the 4-year CAGR to 2019 and see it that way. Look, there's a long way to go. We've started with strong momentum. We had it in January. We had it in March. The consumer is holding up, and we feel good about the strength of our strategy. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore. \nRobert Ottenstein: James, you've had some very interesting packaging innovation and digital engagement with younger consumers trying to keep them, bring them into the CSD portfolio. Just wondering if you could give us any kind of sense of how that's developing? Are you seeing improved brand equity scores with younger consumers, better market share? Any early signs that these innovations targeted to younger demographics, developed markets are working? \nJames Quincey: Sure. Yes, you put your finger on a kind of a nexus of a whole set of innovations. Let me just focus them in on the -- just using Coca-Cola brand, just to start with for a second. I mean, we did the Coke Creations, which was kind of limited edition kind of beyond it's vanilla or it's cherry into kind of stardust and marshmallow. And I think it was much more engaging for consumers.\n Some of the advertising, I mean, we did -- we partnered with OpenAI and ChatGPT and DALL-E to run a promotion where you could design Coke advertising and have it come up on the Times Square billboard. And all of that change, obviously, the bigger scale through the marketing, which has become much more digital over the last 3 years is starting to drive a difference.\n So if I were to take the U.S. where historically, we have been underrecruiting to not say, not recruiting consumers, we can see that the growth in the Coke franchise is not just being driven by increased recruitment, but increased engagement and recruitment of Gen Z. So you're starting to see an impact come through on the aggregate recruiting numbers, on the aggregate engagement with Gen Z and the increase of Gen Z coming into the franchise. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. \nNik Modi: James, I was hoping you can talk about the nonsparkling part of the business, less so from a consumer and product strategy side, but more from a go-to-market with this whole reorganization going on in North America, in particular, is there a better infrastructure do you think for Coke to sell the entire portfolio versus kind of historically how it's been much more kind of predominantly focused on sparkling? Any thoughts on that would be helpful. \nJames Quincey: So let me talk about the portfolio and then the go-to-market. I mean, clearly, the portfolio in North America has been expanding over the last decades, but a lot in the -- a lot recently as well. I think the results you're seeing in North America is actually driven by the overused expression of the [ AN ] strategy. We're seeing growth in soft drinks, good resonance in Coke and Coke Zero but also growth in the rest of the portfolio.\n We talked about in the script how fairlife has been on a multiyear journey, really, really doing well. Obviously, that builds on some of the previous acquisitions. vitaminwater and smartwater doing really well in the quarter. And so you're starting to see the portfolio being built out across the different categories.\n Clearly, it's not all plain sailing in every category. We've talked how we need to stabilize and reinvigorate BODYARMOR in tandem with POWERADE. You're starting to see some growth in the coffee ready-to-drink in North America.\n Now all of that feeds into a set of routes to the market, which are -- there are multiple platforms in the U.S. There have been. Clearly, the biggest piece is the bottlers largely to, obviously, retailers and lots of away-from-home channels, complemented by the chilled route and the fountain route.\n So I think there's much greater focus on getting the portfolio, be the portfolio that works for consumers and drives a winning strategy for the retailers. And then a vastly strengthened bottling system over the last number of years through the refranchising through great work by the bottlers in the U.S. to both increase their capability and increase their rate of investment. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. \nPeter Grom: James, I was hoping to follow up on that a little bit and just kind of get some perspective on the current trends in the sports drink category, specifically here in the U.S. I think you called out BODYARMOR and POWERADE being under some pressure in the release, and you just alluded to that in your response to the next question. So can you maybe just talk about the competitive dynamics in that category and kind of how you see that evolving as we look out over the balance of the year? \nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. Obviously, we've got 2 brands. We've got BODYARMOR and POWERADE. We talked on previous calls where we had not had the greatest integration into the Coke system last year on BODYARMOR. And obviously, there's some new players and new category dynamics.\n We're very focused on stabilizing our portfolio and growing from here. We brought out some product innovation in the first quarter with BODYARMOR Flash I.V. The BODYARMOR Sports water continued to be the fastest-growing premium water and POWERADE Zero sugar.\n So we -- we're starting to see some innovation coming through, some better marketing. There will be some missing package formats going into the marketplace in Q2 with multi-serve multipack versions of BODYARMOR. And so we think we can do well as we've talked about before with BODYARMOR and POWERADE. It's early days, but we see some promising signs to reverting the trend by the end of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities. \nWilliam Chappell: Just a follow up on the still and kind of elasticity. I mean, it seems like sparkling, you have plenty of pricing opportunity from here, but maybe also on juice, water kind of base level, do you see promotions coming back in? Do you see like -- you feel like you're running into a ceiling at some point this year in terms of pricing because especially as you're getting more of a middle and lower-end consumer that's buying some of those products? Any thoughts there would be great. \nJames Quincey: Yes. Look, I think in recent times, the elasticities on water have been stronger than they have on soft drinks and juice somewhere in there as well. And so that clearly consumers are being differentiating by category and brand strength and whether the brand or the category has earned the right to do the pricing even if the pricing is largely cost-driven. So that definitely has been a feature of recent quarters.\n As we look out, as I said, we see pricing moderating, which means in the context of markets like the U.S. or Europe is a reduction in the level of off-cycle price increases. We may, as we go forward, see slightly more promotions as we look for those consumers who are under pressure to offer them slightly better affordability options.\n But we'll be balancing that with investments in premiumization options, whether that be categories or packaging. And so as I talked about in the answer on one of the other questions, we're trying to work both ends of the spectrum here. And I see the need to press harder on both ends as we have done over the last number of years and as we will do in the course of this year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. \nKevin Grundy: Great. We covered a lot of ground. So a couple of cleanups for me, probably both for John. Can you quantify the impact from hyperinflationary pricing in the quarter from Turkey and Argentina? I'm not sure if that's a number that you have at your fingertips.\n And then broadly, investment levels, I think there'd be a view in staples broadly that as gross margin improves, it will lend itself to some degree of reinvestment. Just wanted to get your thoughts on where the organization is now in terms of its satisfaction with overall investment levels.\n I think pre-pandemic, we're sort of at a high 12%. Industry dipped collectively for all the reasons that we know. If I'm not mistaken, you guys are around 8.5% of sales. Where do you see that going? And then maybe just some broader thoughts on adequacy and how you see this progressing as the cost environment lends itself to a greater degree of reinvestment. \nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Kevin. First question on the hyperinflationary, but just a little under 2 points in Q1. I don't have the mirror for the crystal ball for the rest of the year, but you can build that into your assumptions for the rest of the year.\n Regarding investment levels, we've been, I think, very consistent over the last 3 or 4 years and been clear that we will invest as we need to support the portfolio. And on a quarter-to-quarter basis, there are ups and downs on that.\n We did some really good work in '21, '22 to be able to do more with less or to do more with the same. So it's not apples-to-apples in that sense. I think we're getting more value today per dollar of investments than we have ever done before.\n And so when I take that into account plus the absolute levels that we're investing, I think we are in good shape overall. And I think our markets have what they need. And so we continue to be very much of the mindset to have that as a top priority and where necessary and Q1 is a good example, in some cases, to invest ahead of the curve. So all in, I feel good about the rate and the improving effectiveness of our overall spend. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. \nChristopher Carey: Just a couple of cleanups for me as well. Just, John, on a total inflation basis, did you see commodities get a little bit worse through the quarter? And perhaps, can you comment on total inflation, including freight? So just trying to frame the commodity inflation versus total inflation?\n And then from a cash flow standpoint, would you expect free cash flow to be positive in Q2? And any way that you would just discuss the front half versus back half delivery in the context of your full year free cash flow guidance? \nJohn Murphy: Yes, our commodities portfolio, so to speak, is it's going to -- it's a mixed bag in there. On the one hand, we're seeing some moderation in the number of commodities, metals number, for example. We're seeing moderation on ocean and freight in general. But offsetting that for us was we have a pretty meaningful increase in sweeteners and in juices. So that's one consideration.\n The second consideration is we continue to hedge in 2023, and we feel good about the hedges we're putting into place. But they are cycling a set of hedges in 2022 that were more favorable. So I think it's important to keep that in mind.\n And then thirdly, as we go into the rest of the year, as we've alluded to in some of the other questions, we do see some further moderation on the overall cost front. But we do have, as a net of all of that, continued view that we'll have a mid-single-digit increase for the year 2023.\n And on free cash flow, yes, the first -- as we said, the first quarter, we had a couple of discrete items in there that we had highlighted in February. And we've also had a couple of timing items, working capital-related that has affected the net results for the quarter.\n Keep in mind that in the second quarter, we will have the transition tax payments going out. And so for this year, I would expect free cash flow as a result of what's happened in Q1 and what I expect in Q2 to be back weighted towards the second half of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos Laboy from HSBC. \nCarlos Alberto Laboy: To expand on Steve's earlier question, in the emerging markets, refillables, they drive affordability, but it seems they also help you to increase premium pricing for one way and create premium growth. So my question is, where in emerging markets might you see big opportunities or new opportunities to drive affordability gains and revenue management? \nJames Quincey: Yes. Carlos, thanks. Definitely agree with you on the essential idea that if you have a good anchor in affordability options, it allows the portfolio to stretch along the price spectrum with other packaging options and thereby, both satisfying more consumers and drive a more -- a better -- a higher competitive advantage and a more profitable business overall.\n Obviously, the refillables infrastructure takes time to build, not just from a kind of a manufacturing and distribution point of view, but from a retail and consumer habit point of view. But there's still plenty of opportunity in Latin America, which is obviously one of the big bases. It's still a feature of the German market.\n How far that then becomes a feature of other markets is going to be developed over time. We've certainly got some activity in Africa and India, but it doesn't -- as you know, it doesn't change rapidly overnight, but there's definitely big opportunities to use all the thinking behind RGM and all the new and latest technologies to provide packaging options that give price points across this broader range as possible. \nOperator: Our last question will come from Charlie Higgs from Redburn. \nCharlie Higgs: Just a final one on innovation, please. And I think you've relaunched Sprite Zero in the quarter and also POWERADE. Is there any initial feedback you could give on those brands? That'd be very useful. And then also just any thoughts on Coke Zero, which, again, it grew volumes 8% of a comp of 14%. I guess just how much further do you think that brand specifically has to go? \nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean, the reformulations on Sprite Zero and POWERADE are specific to a number of markets. It's not a big call out. They're part of an ongoing program to make sure that we have the best tasting, most effective recipes in any particular market. So I see those as examples of continuing to innovate to stay on the cutting edge of the formula, whether that's taste and enjoyment or delivery on a functional feature in a category like the sports category.\n And as it relates to Coke Zero, we now have many years of very strong volume growth behind Coke Zero. I think there's a huge and massive ongoing runway for Coke Zero to continue to grow. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks. \nJames Quincey: So just to summarize, the year's off to a great start. We continue to win in the marketplace. While it's still early in the year and the macro environment remains uncertain, we're confident in our plans and our ability to leverage our capabilities to adapt to consumer needs and drive top line-led growth. And we have visibility to deliver on our 2023 guidance.\n We're focused on the sizable opportunity ahead of us and are managing the near-term uncertainties to build a Coke system for the long term. Thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning. Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "James Quincey",
            "content": "Thanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. 2023 is off to a good start. We continue to execute well and grow amidst the dynamic macro environment. We like to say we have an all-weather strategy, one that enables us to thrive no matter what's happening in the world.\n We pursue excellence globally with an eye towards winning locally as a system. And our brand investments continue to create value for our customers and consumers, leading to our ability to drive quality growth for our stakeholders.\n Today, I'll discuss our first quarter performance and provide some perspective around today's global consumer and macro environment. I'll then reiterate why we are confident in our ability to deliver on our guidance for the full year. And finally, I'll elaborate on how the actions we're taking set us up for success in any environment and how we're driving resilience for our business and continued growth in 2023 and over the long term. John will then discuss our results and go into more detail on the 2023 outlook.\n In the first quarter, pandemic restrictions in parts of the world relaxed, and many supply chain pressures abated. At the same time, inflation and geopolitical tensions persisted. And new concerns emerged around the stability in the banking sector and the magnitude of the potential squeeze on consumers.\n In the face of these factors, we continue to generate momentum as investments in our brands got the year off to a positive start. We remain focused on creating value by meeting the needs of our customers and consumers.\n We delivered 12% organic revenue growth in the quarter. This was primarily driven by pricing actions across markets and revenue growth management initiatives to retain and add consumers.\n We also delivered volume growth of 3%, which is in line with last year versus 2019. We saw growth across developed as well as developing and emerging markets, and we continue to gain both volume and value share for the quarter, including at home and away from home channels. We're encouraged by this momentum and are operating the business with a focus on growth while closely monitoring macro trends for signs of a slowdown. \n As we look around the world today, the consumer picture varies across our markets. In Asia Pacific, the reopening of China has led to an increase in consumer activity, but consumption is still recovering to pre-pandemic levels. India's economy remains resilient with a strong job market and robust consumption. In Japan, consumers are feeling inflationary pressure for the first time in many years.\n In Europe, the recent banking crisis added to last year's energy spike, driving further uncertainty to purchasing behaviors and consumers continue to increasingly seek out affordable and private label options across many FMCG categories.\n In North America, the picture is a mixed bag with unemployment low, gas prices improved and savings holding up, but inflation and higher mortgage rates are top-of-mind concerns for many consumers.\n In many developing and emerging markets in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, consumers continue to face varying levels of inflation and volatility in the macroeconomic conditions. Clearly, there's uncertainty in how the consumer environment may ultimately play out in 2023. But thanks to the hard work of our people and partners, we're a more flexible network enterprise today. And with our enhanced system alignment, we're confident we can win together locally in a wide variety of environments.\n Let's start with the portfolio. We have a growth portfolio of consumer-centric brands across categories, including [ 26 billion-dollar brands ]. Our networked organization is allowing us to raise the bar of innovation and marketing to leverage our loved brands more effectively in the marketplace. We're keeping our streamlined portfolio of brands relevant with consumers and finding innovative ways to offer beverage choices for every occasion.\n In Japan, we recently relaunched our Georgia Coffee brand with a fresh new look and a bright proposition to inspire current consumers and expand Georgia's appeal to a broader audience, complementing Costa's premium ready-to-drink offerings in that market.\n We're expanding our exploration in alcohol ready-to-drink beverages with a keen focus on responsibility. We work with Brown-Forman to roll out Jack and Coke cocktails in the U.S. during the quarter with more markets launching now. It's early days, but the ability to get one of the most popular [indiscernible] in the world in a can is proving to be compelling to retailers and consumers based on preliminary volumes and velocities. We're encouraged by the level of engagement as distribution expands.\n We're driving bigger and bolder innovations that can leverage consumer insights leading to a higher success rate and enduring growth. In North America, we continue to foster brand love for fairlife, which has grown volume double digits for 8 consecutive years. Fairlife became a $1 billion brand last year, and we're building on the momentum of the brand including the success of co-power with fairlife nutrition plan. Launched with a digital-first campaign in the club channel, fairlife nutrition plan has seen strong consumer interest from those looking for high-protein, low-sugar shake that tastes great and is lactose-free. We're planning to expand the product to more channels and packages in the coming months.\n We're working with WPP, our global marketing network partner, and increasingly leveraging digital capabilities to engage consumers through passion points, personalized experiences and collaborations. The Coke Studio concept first drove cultural relevance and brand performance in Pakistan, with the latest season streamed over 1 billion times. We scaled the program to 30 markets last year. And in 2023, it will become an always-on platform across the globe. Connecting consumers' love of music to consumption occasions by spotlighting breakthrough talent, Coke Studio provides a portal to live digital experiences and can be activated using QR codes on our packages.\n Consumers can drink, scan and enjoy their favorite beverage along with music from genres around the world. Working as a network system with our bottlers, we're managing through macroeconomic uncertainty with enhanced capabilities in revenue growth management and integrated execution. We often talk about the many levers of revenue growth management. While the inflationary environment led to proactive pricing increases over the past 18 months, it's important to recognize our RGM capabilities to extend far beyond pricing.\n At its core, revenue growth management is about consumer-centric segmentation, ensuring we have the right product in the right package in the right channel at the right price point, drive transactions and meet consumers where they are.\n Affordability and premiumization are key levers to maintain and expand our consumer base, and we continue to balance affordable offerings with compelling premium propositions to ensure we have beverage options across income levels.\n Affordability is a driver in developing and emerging markets, evidenced by double-digit volume growth in these offerings in Indonesia and Vietnam, helping to drive record sparkling share in Vietnam and driving approximately 3 billion transactions at affordable price points in India this quarter. Premium packages like slim cans and mini cans are seeing strong growth in many markets, including Australia, where mini cans drove 40 million transactions and contributed to share growth in the region.\n Premiumization also includes [indiscernible] occasions. In addition to alcohol, ready-to-drink beverages, we're also participating more broadly in adult alcohol drinking occasions.\n In North America, we've expanded our Simply premium juice brand into the mix of segment with Simply mixology in 3 flavors to serve as a cocktail or mocktail. In Europe, we've relaunched our Kinley and Royal Bliss brands as harmonized platforms to participate in the adult mixer segment.\n For both affordability and premiumization, the value proposition is often messaged at the point of sale, such as the expansion of the value bundle in certain channels in the U.S. and the mini can mini price campaign that drove strong growth in small packages in Japan. RGM, coupled with integrated execution, also drives value for our customers. By providing key insights and offering the right mix of brands, packages, price points and compelling data-driven promotions, we are able to partner with customers that deliver traffic, basket and incidence growth.\n Latin America is a great example of how this came to life in the first quarter, evidenced by revenue growth ahead of transactions and transaction growth ahead of volume. By working closely with key retailers, our system focused on the availability of cold, single-serve beverages in premium brands such as Schweppes and smartwater.\n We introduced refillable packages into new channels, all while driving better in-stock levels and higher consumer traffic in-store, owning accolades from customers. Our business has largely recovered from the effects of the pandemic and remains well equipped to navigate the dynamic macro environment and is emerging with even stronger capabilities and system alignment to deliver vibrant long-term growth for many years to come.\n At the same time, our consumers also care about sustainability. While we strive to grow our business, we also want to be water positive, drive a circular economy for our packaging and grow consumer beverage choices, including low- and no-calorie brands as part of our total beverage strategy. These goals are integral to our business and beneficial for society.\n Our annual business and sustainability will be released soon, including an integrated section on our World without Waste packaging initiatives. We're proud of what we've accomplished so far, recognize there is still opportunity ahead and continue to lead as well as act collectively with other key stakeholders to drive progress on this agenda. I encourage you to learn more about how we're progressing against our targets across various sustainability pillars and priorities to refresh the world and make a difference.\n Before I hand over to John, I'd note that it's early in the year, and there's a fair amount of uncertainty around the operating environment ahead. But our first quarter results give us increased visibility to deliver on our full year 2023 guidance.\n We're executing more efficiently and effectively on a local level, maintaining flexibility on a global level and continuing to reinvest in the business and build the system for the long term. In short, we're expanding the sphere of what we can control. We're well prepared to respond with speed to changing market dynamics as we've demonstrated that we can do. By staying clear on our purpose and remaining consumer-centric, we continue to execute to the sustainable long-term growth.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to John. Sure. Let me start at the back end and come in reverse. So yes, China opening up, certainly a pattern of consumer behavior not unlike when U.S., Europe opened up, so there has been a resumption in consumer activity. There was a rebound of consumption in Chinese New Year, which obviously fell in the first quarter. So we're certainly seeing the performance in China getting better. And we've been focused on bringing back our marketing and increasing availability in some of the rural marketplaces.\n Remember, in Q2, we'll be cycling the toughest part of '22, I think, for China. But net-net, we remain cautiously optimistic. I mean, it's still -- the Chinese business is still below the 2019 level. But we're cautiously optimistic on the rest of the year for China.\n The other part of Q1 and the away from home as much as it seems incredible to remember, Q1 last year was -- we were still talking about Omicron and not everywhere was opened up. So we are seeing in the first quarter this year additional strength in the away-from-home business, so take the U.S. as an example, immediate consumption packages grew ahead of future consumption packages. The away-from-home channels, for example, QSR restaurants, had a good strong quarter the first quarter this year, in part because we're cycling a partially open first quarter.\n And that will logically moderate that as we get into the rest of the year because now we're starting to cycle the opening. So hopefully, that does the 2 pieces.\n Look, overall, first quarter was strong. It was certainly within the bounds of our expectations and our plans. We talk very much in February about how we expected to be able to focus on having volume growth continuing to build the franchise of our beverages across the whole year, but expecting to see pricing moderate from what was similar levels to Q4, which is what we see in Q1, back down to some more normal levels by the end of the year.\n And so good, strong start. And we're maintaining guidance, we still feel confident in our guidance, and we're well equipped. The outlook has a degree of uncertainty in it that's, I think, more elevated than pre-COVID, obviously not COVID-driven. But there's plenty of uncertainty out there in terms of the direction of travel, of inflation, both the consumers' reaction to it and the input side.\n So we have a set of guidance out there that sees both input costs, our own costs and pricing moderating through the year, but there's still a long way to go. So I think take it as we feel good about our guidance. There's a lot left to manage. We have a good strategy, and we're certainly focused on this kind of all-weather results as we go into the rest of the year. Sure. Do you want to do it, John? Yes. Thanks, Bonnie. Look, firstly, EMEA is more than just Europe. That's the first key point. It includes some countries that had some near hyperinflationary effects of Turkey and there's an impact in the first quarter of high inflation in Turkey, which has kind of pushed the price/mix up more than would be normal.\n Secondly, of course, there's some carryover pricing from the inflationary burst that happened in kind of the European Union, certainly U.K. last year. And that will moderate as we go over '23 as is likely to be the Turkish inflation. There's some mix benefits of Western Europe having, as you said, a relatively mild winter. And so despite the pressures on purchasing power, actually, Western Europe had a very good first quarter. And that's good in its own right, but it's also good in a mix effect within EMEA. So kind of everything did pretty well.\n A number of the other Middle Eastern and African countries did well, perhaps with the exception of Nigeria. So it was a strong overall result. Lots of mix in there, and as I said, a bit of an inflationary effect between carryover and Turkey that will moderate in the rest of the year. I would also say like we've talked about it historically on pricing volume. I would encourage people not to draw correlations through 1 quarter. And you can use full quarters or annuals. Given acquisition relative to the bottlers and the final consumer, I think it's important to kind of average out some of these effects through all the various variables that John mentioned and take a multi-quarter view of what's going on and take that all into account. Do you want to start? Perhaps I'll take the RGM bit, Steve. I'm not sure I would attach a percentage to it globally. I'm not sure it drives relevance. I think a couple of thoughts, though.\n One, clearly, as over time, there has been an increase in disparity of income in any given country, the need to match the consumer across a broader range of price points has gone up. So you see both more opportunity and more need to have a foot in affordability and the other foot in premium. And so those -- both of the ends of the spectrum have been going up over time as we seek to meet the consumers where they are and where their pockets are and allow them to stay in our franchise.\n So I see it as a need to do more of both. Obviously, what's affordable and what's premium in the U.S. might look different than it does in Africa or China or Western Europe, but the direction of travel is more of both. And the mechanic of delivering on them, again, is different by countries.\n In Latin America, it might be with a refillable PET bottle to get down to affordability. In the U.S., it might be certain package sizes or the level of promos in some of the modern trade channels. Again, premium might look different. It might be returnable glass in Spain. And it might be different categories, for example, fairlife in the U.S. It's -- I mean, we're 2 weeks into the second quarter. So I think that -- I don't think there's anything particularly productive in it. I mean, they weren't out-of-the-park results in the first couple of weeks, but there was some worse weather in India and the U.S. and the shift of Eastern side. \n I don't think one can draw a lot from a couple of softer weeks in the first 2 weeks of April. The whole -- the performance through the quarter was good. There wasn't a major ski slope from January through to March. And so I think that we saw continued strength.\n I would encourage people as they look out for the rest of the year and think about momentum as I did last year to look at some of the multiyear trends. And last year, I encouraged people to look compared to 2019 on a 3-year CAGR basis because then that helps see through some of the reopenings and closings and all the [ strategies ].\n I would encourage the same thing this year in the sense of the 4-year CAGR to 2019 and see it that way. Look, there's a long way to go. We've started with strong momentum. We had it in January. We had it in March. The consumer is holding up, and we feel good about the strength of our strategy. Sure. Yes, you put your finger on a kind of a nexus of a whole set of innovations. Let me just focus them in on the -- just using Coca-Cola brand, just to start with for a second. I mean, we did the Coke Creations, which was kind of limited edition kind of beyond it's vanilla or it's cherry into kind of stardust and marshmallow. And I think it was much more engaging for consumers.\n Some of the advertising, I mean, we did -- we partnered with OpenAI and ChatGPT and DALL-E to run a promotion where you could design Coke advertising and have it come up on the Times Square billboard. And all of that change, obviously, the bigger scale through the marketing, which has become much more digital over the last 3 years is starting to drive a difference.\n So if I were to take the U.S. where historically, we have been underrecruiting to not say, not recruiting consumers, we can see that the growth in the Coke franchise is not just being driven by increased recruitment, but increased engagement and recruitment of Gen Z. So you're starting to see an impact come through on the aggregate recruiting numbers, on the aggregate engagement with Gen Z and the increase of Gen Z coming into the franchise. So let me talk about the portfolio and then the go-to-market. I mean, clearly, the portfolio in North America has been expanding over the last decades, but a lot in the -- a lot recently as well. I think the results you're seeing in North America is actually driven by the overused expression of the [ AN ] strategy. We're seeing growth in soft drinks, good resonance in Coke and Coke Zero but also growth in the rest of the portfolio.\n We talked about in the script how fairlife has been on a multiyear journey, really, really doing well. Obviously, that builds on some of the previous acquisitions. vitaminwater and smartwater doing really well in the quarter. And so you're starting to see the portfolio being built out across the different categories.\n Clearly, it's not all plain sailing in every category. We've talked how we need to stabilize and reinvigorate BODYARMOR in tandem with POWERADE. You're starting to see some growth in the coffee ready-to-drink in North America.\n Now all of that feeds into a set of routes to the market, which are -- there are multiple platforms in the U.S. There have been. Clearly, the biggest piece is the bottlers largely to, obviously, retailers and lots of away-from-home channels, complemented by the chilled route and the fountain route.\n So I think there's much greater focus on getting the portfolio, be the portfolio that works for consumers and drives a winning strategy for the retailers. And then a vastly strengthened bottling system over the last number of years through the refranchising through great work by the bottlers in the U.S. to both increase their capability and increase their rate of investment. Yes, sure. Obviously, we've got 2 brands. We've got BODYARMOR and POWERADE. We talked on previous calls where we had not had the greatest integration into the Coke system last year on BODYARMOR. And obviously, there's some new players and new category dynamics.\n We're very focused on stabilizing our portfolio and growing from here. We brought out some product innovation in the first quarter with BODYARMOR Flash I.V. The BODYARMOR Sports water continued to be the fastest-growing premium water and POWERADE Zero sugar.\n So we -- we're starting to see some innovation coming through, some better marketing. There will be some missing package formats going into the marketplace in Q2 with multi-serve multipack versions of BODYARMOR. And so we think we can do well as we've talked about before with BODYARMOR and POWERADE. It's early days, but we see some promising signs to reverting the trend by the end of the year. Yes. Look, I think in recent times, the elasticities on water have been stronger than they have on soft drinks and juice somewhere in there as well. And so that clearly consumers are being differentiating by category and brand strength and whether the brand or the category has earned the right to do the pricing even if the pricing is largely cost-driven. So that definitely has been a feature of recent quarters.\n As we look out, as I said, we see pricing moderating, which means in the context of markets like the U.S. or Europe is a reduction in the level of off-cycle price increases. We may, as we go forward, see slightly more promotions as we look for those consumers who are under pressure to offer them slightly better affordability options.\n But we'll be balancing that with investments in premiumization options, whether that be categories or packaging. And so as I talked about in the answer on one of the other questions, we're trying to work both ends of the spectrum here. And I see the need to press harder on both ends as we have done over the last number of years and as we will do in the course of this year. Yes. Carlos, thanks. Definitely agree with you on the essential idea that if you have a good anchor in affordability options, it allows the portfolio to stretch along the price spectrum with other packaging options and thereby, both satisfying more consumers and drive a more -- a better -- a higher competitive advantage and a more profitable business overall.\n Obviously, the refillables infrastructure takes time to build, not just from a kind of a manufacturing and distribution point of view, but from a retail and consumer habit point of view. But there's still plenty of opportunity in Latin America, which is obviously one of the big bases. It's still a feature of the German market.\n How far that then becomes a feature of other markets is going to be developed over time. We've certainly got some activity in Africa and India, but it doesn't -- as you know, it doesn't change rapidly overnight, but there's definitely big opportunities to use all the thinking behind RGM and all the new and latest technologies to provide packaging options that give price points across this broader range as possible. Sure. I mean, the reformulations on Sprite Zero and POWERADE are specific to a number of markets. It's not a big call out. They're part of an ongoing program to make sure that we have the best tasting, most effective recipes in any particular market. So I see those as examples of continuing to innovate to stay on the cutting edge of the formula, whether that's taste and enjoyment or delivery on a functional feature in a category like the sports category.\n And as it relates to Coke Zero, we now have many years of very strong volume growth behind Coke Zero. I think there's a huge and massive ongoing runway for Coke Zero to continue to grow. So just to summarize, the year's off to a great start. We continue to win in the marketplace. While it's still early in the year and the macro environment remains uncertain, we're confident in our plans and our ability to leverage our capabilities to adapt to consumer needs and drive top line-led growth. And we have visibility to deliver on our 2023 guidance.\n We're focused on the sizable opportunity ahead of us and are managing the near-term uncertainties to build a Coke system for the long term. Thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning. Thank you."

            "name": "John Murphy",
            "content": "Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. We've had a good start to the year with strong first quarter results. Starting with the top line. We grew organic revenues 12%. Unit cases grew 3% with broad-based growth across most markets, driven by investments in the marketplace.\n Concentrate sales were 2 points behind unit cases for the quarter primarily driven by timing of concentrate shipments and 1 less day. Our price/mix growth was 11% for the quarter. Much of this was driven by carryover pricing coming into the base from last year, along with some new pricing actions across operating segments as well as revenue growth management initiatives and favorable channel and package mix.\n Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 120 basis points driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency. Underlying gross margin expansion was driven by a benefit from the phasing of inventory costs, strong organic revenue growth and cycling the timing of M&A integration expenses, partially offset by higher commodity costs.\n Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 40 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by underlying operating margin expansion due to robust top line growth across operating segments, partially offset by increased marketing investments and higher operating costs. Putting it all together, first quarter comparable EPS of $0.68 reflects an increase of 5% year-over-year despite higher-than-expected 7% currency headwinds.\n Free cash flow was negative by approximately $120 million in the quarter. This was largely attributable to the timing of working capital initiatives and the previously discussed M&A-related payments that took place in the quarter.\n Our underlying cash flow generation remains strong, and we feel confident in our cash flow agenda and full year outlook. Our balance [ achieves ] fit for purpose to support our growth agenda, and our net debt leverage of 1.8x EBITDA as of the end of the first quarter is below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x.\n Our capital allocation priorities remain the same. We continue to invest to drive long-term growth and to deliver dividend growth for our shareowners as evidenced by the 5% dividend increase announced in February.\n We remain mindful of maintaining our financial flexibility amidst the ongoing tax dispute with the IRS. We are currently waiting for the tax court to render its final opinion in the case, allowing us to move forward with the appeals process. As previously discussed, we intend to assert our claims on appeal, vigorously defend our position and believe we will ultimately prevail. We will continue to keep you updated.\n As James mentioned, we are encouraged by our first quarter results and are harnessing what we can control to remain resilient in the face of a volatile operating environment. We remain laser-focused on top line-led growth as well as the endurance of the bottom line. And we'll reinvest in our brands with more rigor and discipline using the refreshed resource allocation framework we discussed at CAGNY.\n This approach enables the enterprise to prioritize and put more focus behind country and category combinations that can deliver the best return in the near term while fueling steady progress on our total beverage strategy over time, it also allows us to be more dynamic and to adapt quickly.\n For example, in emerging markets, where commercial beverages are still a small part of daily consumption, we're leading with core sparkling and juice strengths propositions. In developed markets, where consumers are looking for more beverage choices, we're investing behind a broader portfolio of brands and categories, including value-added dairy, enhanced water, tea and coffee.\n Despite the global macro picture remaining uncertain in the months ahead, our planned investments and operational strategy will support the momentum we've seen early in the year and give us good visibility to deliver on our 2023 guidance. This guidance is comprised of organic revenue growth of 7% to 8%, primarily led by price/mix amidst the ongoing inflationary environment, comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 7% to 9%.\n Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we are reiterating our currency outlook of an approximate 2- to 3-point headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 3- to 4-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023.\n Inflationary forces are moderating in some respects. Spot prices have come down in oil and freight rates are more favorable. That said, many commodities were exposed to have been sticky, and we have some advantageous hedges that will be rolling off to less favorable rates during the year.\n Based on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect per case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023. Additionally, we expect wages and inflation in media will continue to remain elevated.\n Despite the increase in the first quarter effective tax rate, we continue to expect our underlying effective tax rate to be 19.5% for 2023. All in, we are reiterating comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5% versus $2.48 in 2022.\n We expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments. I would like to remind you that included in cash from operations are 2 discrete items related to, one, transition tax payments, which will take place in the second quarter; and two, payments associated with M&A transactions. Excluding these, our implied free cash flow conversion would be within our long-term guidance.\n This guidance does not include any payments related to our ongoing U.S. income tax dispute with the IRS. Overall, we don't expect the tax dispute to have a bearing on our ability to deliver on our capital allocation agenda and drive long-term business growth.\n There are some considerations to keep in mind as it pertains to our guidance. We expect price/mix to moderate through the year as we cycle our pricing initiatives from the prior year. The discrete gross margin benefits related to the phasing of inventory costs and cycling the timing of M&A integration expenses this quarter are unlikely to repeat. Given the ongoing backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see higher net interest expense given our effective exposure to floating rate debt.\n And finally, due to our reporting calendar, there will be one additional day in the fourth quarter. With a quarter of good results to start the year and our focus on driving top line-led growth in any macroeconomic environment, we are well positioned to compound quality value by delivering on 2023 guidance.\n Our network structure and aligned system are enabling us to deliver on our 3 key objectives: pursuing excellence globally and winning locally, investing for the long-term health of the business and generating U.S. dollar EPS growth. The strength of our people and great partnerships with our bottlers around the world give us confidence in our ability to win with consumers in the marketplace and deliver value for our stakeholders.\n With that, operator, we are ready to take questions. Sure. Thanks, Lauren. Yes, on the back of what James just said, a strong start to the year. We expected in Q1 to see North America coming out to [ Gates ], given the carryover pricing that we knew would be a tailwind for the quarter.\n We also saw benefits from immediate consumption been strong through the quarter. And as we look to the rest of the year, we continue to keep in mind our ongoing objectives to expand margins.\n But Q1 was, let's say, we came out of the gate strong, we knew we would. And we look to the rest of the year in line with what James is saying to moderate as we get into the back half of the year on the pricing front and to continue to be laser-focused using our RGM work to stay with the consumer.\n So we feel good about the start. Rest of the year is looking positive. And yes, we'll take into account, I think, some of the trends we're seeing on the macroeconomic and consumer front and manage the -- that environment with the various levers we have. Yes. Thanks, Bryan. So of the 140 basis points, you're correct. The -- included in that is the onetime on the inventory and the cycling of M&A. It's about half of that. The other half comes from -- mainly from the carryover price and some favorable price/mix in the quarter.\n So as you think about the rest of the year, I would keep in mind the following. As I just mentioned in North America, I think it's across the board. Moderation on price, both rate and frequency. I think a greater use of our RGM levers to help to stay with the consumer as we see the consumer in different states, in different parts of the world.\n We will have some FX headwinds similar to what we had in Q1 throughout the year, we -- is our current expectation. We'll have an extra day in the fourth quarter. And so I'd keep in mind that we have interest in our long-term algorithm, an ongoing objective to expand margins, and that remains very much the focus, but you take those items into account for the rest of the year as you think about 2023 full year. Yes. Let me take the first part, Steve. Just as you said, the first quarter, we did benefit from the equity income coming in better. And we also had a couple of onetimes on dividends, et cetera, that helped.\n For the rest of the year, no significant change in what we've guided on interest expense. You can expect Q2 and Q3 relative to prior year to be higher impact, given that we really saw the step-up starting in Q4 of last year. So we still, for the full year, expect the same quantum of deleverage as we had indicated in our February guidance. Thanks, Kevin. First question on the hyperinflationary, but just a little under 2 points in Q1. I don't have the mirror for the crystal ball for the rest of the year, but you can build that into your assumptions for the rest of the year.\n Regarding investment levels, we've been, I think, very consistent over the last 3 or 4 years and been clear that we will invest as we need to support the portfolio. And on a quarter-to-quarter basis, there are ups and downs on that.\n We did some really good work in '21, '22 to be able to do more with less or to do more with the same. So it's not apples-to-apples in that sense. I think we're getting more value today per dollar of investments than we have ever done before.\n And so when I take that into account plus the absolute levels that we're investing, I think we are in good shape overall. And I think our markets have what they need. And so we continue to be very much of the mindset to have that as a top priority and where necessary and Q1 is a good example, in some cases, to invest ahead of the curve. So all in, I feel good about the rate and the improving effectiveness of our overall spend. Yes, our commodities portfolio, so to speak, is it's going to -- it's a mixed bag in there. On the one hand, we're seeing some moderation in the number of commodities, metals number, for example. We're seeing moderation on ocean and freight in general. But offsetting that for us was we have a pretty meaningful increase in sweeteners and in juices. So that's one consideration.\n The second consideration is we continue to hedge in 2023, and we feel good about the hedges we're putting into place. But they are cycling a set of hedges in 2022 that were more favorable. So I think it's important to keep that in mind.\n And then thirdly, as we go into the rest of the year, as we've alluded to in some of the other questions, we do see some further moderation on the overall cost front. But we do have, as a net of all of that, continued view that we'll have a mid-single-digit increase for the year 2023.\n And on free cash flow, yes, the first -- as we said, the first quarter, we had a couple of discrete items in there that we had highlighted in February. And we've also had a couple of timing items, working capital-related that has affected the net results for the quarter.\n Keep in mind that in the second quarter, we will have the transition tax payments going out. And so for this year, I would expect free cash flow as a result of what's happened in Q1 and what I expect in Q2 to be back weighted towards the second half of the year."

[Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and, therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola\u2019s Media Relations department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Ms. Robin Halpern, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Halpern, you may now begin.\nRobin Halpern: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I am here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019ve posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website. These reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to this morning to results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide analysis of our growth and operating margins. This call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company\u2019s periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question. Reenter the queue to ask any follow-ups. Now, I will turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. After a good first half of 2024, we navigated through a dynamic external landscape during the third quarter. Our business again proved to be resilient. Volume declined 1% in the quarter driven by a slow start in July. However, our business trends improved each month and, notably, Trademark Coca-Cola volume outperformed during the quarter. Our year-to-date 2024 performance gives us confidence we will deliver at the high end of our previous top line guidance and earnings growth of 5% to 6%, including approximately 9% of currency headwinds. With that as context, I'll start with an update on the global consumer landscape and a review of the third quarter business performance. Then I'll explain how we're delivering on our objectives by staying agile and improving execution of our strategy across each facet of our growth flywheel. John will end by discussing financial details for the quarter, our updated guidance for full year 2024, and some early considerations for 2025. During the quarter, global consumer sentiment and spending in aggregate held up well, and our broader industry continued to expand. In this context, we delivered robust organic revenue growth with value share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels. We also expanded comparable margins. This led to 5% comparable earnings per share growth despite nearly double-digit currency headwinds and the impact of bottler refranchising. We continue to demonstrate staying power as the beverage industry remains attractive with many strong new and existing players. Our system is well positioned to develop the commercial beverage industry in many markets and capture long-term balanced growth. Across the world, we are leveraging our scale and local expertise to navigate varying local market dynamics. In North America, we generated robust top line growth and won value share. Trademark Coca-Cola and sparkling flavors both grew volume. During the quarter and year-to-date, Trademark Coca-Cola and fairlife were the leaders in the beverage industry in at-home retail sales growth. Consumers are responding well to sharper value messaging in away-from-home channels, and we're continuing to drive affordable and premium packages across our total beverage portfolio to realize positive mix. In Latin America, volume was flat during the quarter as we cycled strong growth in the prior year. We had solid revenue growth led by Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Powerade. We also benefited from integrating marketing activations across the region. For example, in Brazil, Rock in Rio reached over 70 million people and led to Trademark Coca-Cola being the most mentioned brand on TikTok. Stepped-up execution by increasing cooler placement and investing in digital capabilities is also driving results. In EMEA, we saw improved performance in Europe and strong growth across many parts of Africa. The performance in Eurasia and Middle East and North Africa unfavorably impacted overall results. In Europe, we grew volume during the quarter and benefited from the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Both Fuze Tea and Powerade continued their strong momentum. And we're continuing to focus on affordable price points, value packages, tailored promotions and premium offerings to drive demand. In Eurasia and Middle East, a confluence of headwinds led to a decline in volume. While it's fair to assume pressure will persist in the near-term, we are taking action. Our system is driving affordability and availability, and we're leaning into the local intrinsics of our business. In Africa, volume declined largely due to pressure in some North African markets. Outside of these markets, we grew volume and gained value share. Our system is investing for the long-term by accelerating refillable offerings, cooler placements and increasing manufacturing capacity. Lastly, in Asia Pacific, despite weakness in China and a couple of markets in Southeast Asia, we grew organic revenue and comparable operating income. In ASEAN and South Pacific, we gained value share led by the Philippines and Australia. The Philippines grew affordable transactions with refillable packages and grew premium transactions with single-serve offerings. Australia prioritized affordability initiatives across our sparkling portfolio and successfully activated the Olympic Games with Powerade. In Japan and South Korea, we had solid volume growth and won value share due to good traction on brand relaunches, which leveraged enhanced taste and refreshed packaging and stepped-up performance in e-commerce channels. In China, a challenging operating environment and strategic reprioritization of our portfolio led to a decline in volume. We're continuing to focus on driving affordability across our core portfolio. Our longer-term growth ambition is unchanged, and we're investing to come out ahead when conditions improve. In India, volume declined in states impacted by higher than normal monsoons. In geographic areas that were unaffected, volume grew mid-single-digits. We remain upbeat about progress in integrated execution and our ability to capture long-term growth opportunities. To sum everything up, while our markets continue to move in many different directions and our agility is being put to the test, our all-weather strategy is working. We're continuing to deliver on our strategy through a combination of world-class marketing and innovation and excellence in revenue growth management and execution. Starting with marketing and innovation. Our refreshed marketing model is integrating digital, live and retail experiences to connect with consumers in unique and personalized ways. The Olympic and Paralympic games, is a great example. We featured our total beverage portfolio, launched fan zones and festivals, and leveraged social channels to increase connections with athletes. Many of our brands offered customized packaging, and our system activated tailored point-of-sale displays with customers around the world. The Olympic and Paralympic Games were activated with customers across over 65 markets, featured nearly 250 influencers, and demonstrated positive engagement scores across our portfolio. Topo Chico is another example. In the U.S., Topo Chico is the number one premium sparkling water brand. We've driven strong consumer demand with a grassroots experiential campaign in 13 cities featuring impactful displays connecting Topo Chico to food, music and art. In Mexico, we're applying a similar playbook. We recently launched Topo Chico's first-ever nationwide experiential activation with the Think Like An Artist campaign. This featured connections with local artists across 69 events in five cities and was amplified through social channels. During the quarter, Topo Chico trademark grew volume nearly 20% globally. Year-to-date volume has increased tenfold compared to pre-acquisition levels in 2016. Our marketing and innovation agenda emphasizes a culture of acting boldly, learning and not being afraid to fail, and scaling successes. Sometimes our innovations don't hit the mark as evidenced by Coca-Cola Spice, which we've discontinued. But our focus on bigger and bolder innovations is paying off. Fuze Tea is a multiyear success and is scaling well across over 80 markets, and Minute Maid Zero Sugars showing promise. Sprite Chill also delivered over $50 million in retail sales after only 21 weeks in the market and has been extended after a successful limited run. We also innovate for different reasons. It can be to generate short-term buzz, such as the third quarter launch of the limited edition product, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Oreo, which is available in over 35 markets, and Fanta Beetlejuice, which is our first-ever global Halloween activation and is offered in nearly 50 markets. Or we might invest for the long term such as our announcement of plans to debut Bacardi Mix with Coca-Cola in 2025. So far, in 2024, overall, we've benefited from strong velocities on our innovation and we're continuing to improve our innovation success rates versus prior year. Moving across our flywheel. Our system is step-changing execution by fully integrating our marketing and commercial plans and investing to grow our customers' businesses. Leveraging data and digitally-enabled solutions, including AI, is a huge opportunity. And we are integrating digital advertising with point-of-sale messaging and offering brand price pack architecture geared to customers' individual needs. When executed efficiently, this approach can deliver promising uplifts in retail sales for our customers. While we're focused on taking our capabilities to the next level, we're also working towards mastering the foundations that move the needle. In 2024, our system increased availability by investing in cold drink equipment and boosted our share of visible cold inventory across markets. In the past 12 months, we created $11 billion in incremental retail sales for customers, which is more than double the next five closest beverage companies combined. From 2018 to 2023, we were the leader in customer value creation for the beverage industry every year. To summarize, we feel good about the momentum of our business. And as we look ahead, our external environment will continue to have many moving pieces. We'll continue to prioritize flexibility to navigate market dynamics locally to deliver on our global objectives. Thanks to the power of our portfolio, our system's unique capabilities and the unwavering dedication of our system employees, we're confident we will be able to deliver on our 2024 guidance and longer-term priorities. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll comment on our third quarter performance, discuss the outlook for the remainder of 2024, and provide some early commentary on 2025. During the third quarter, we grew organic revenues 9%. Unit cases declined 1% having had a poor July, but improving sequentially thereafter during the quarter. Concentrate sales were 1 point behind unit cases for the quarter, driven primarily by the timing of concentrate shipments. Our price/mix growth of 10% was driven by two items. Approximately 7 points of pricing split somewhat evenly between normal pricing actions across our markets and intense inflationary pricing in a handful of markets experiencing currency devaluations, and approximately 3 points of mix across the markets, which was primarily driven by stronger growth in several developed markets versus developing and emerging markets. Excluding the impact from intense inflationary pricing, organic revenue growth during the quarter continued to be at the high end of our long-term growth algorithm. Comparable gross margin was up approximately 70 basis points and comparable operating margin was up approximately 100 basis points. Both were driven by underlying expansion and the benefit from butter refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency headwinds. Putting it all together, third quarter comparable EPS of $0.77 was up 5% year-over-year despite higher-than-expected 9% currency headwinds and 2% headwinds from bottler refranchising. During the quarter, we made a $6 billion deposit with the IRS related to our ongoing tax dispute. We've also filed our appeal with the 11th Circuit Court. We're pleased to move forward with the process. We will vigorously defend our position. We believe we will prevail, and we will continue to keep you updated. Free cash flow, excluding the IRS tax litigation deposit, was approximately $7.6 billion, which is down approximately $290 million versus the prior year due to higher other tax payments, higher capital expenditures and cycling some working capital benefits from the prior year. Our balance sheet is strong, and our net debt leverage of 1.7 times EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. If you include our latest estimate of $6.1 billion related to our fairlife contingent consideration payment, which we expect to make in the first half of 2025, our expected net debt leverage would be at the low end of our target range. As James mentioned, our powerful portfolio, amplified by our system's unique capabilities gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our updated 2024 guidance. We now expect organic revenue growth of approximately 10% and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 14% to 15%. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now anticipate an approximate 5-point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 9-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024. We continue to expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus $2.69 in 2023. While it is too early to provide specific guidance on 2025, we do want to share some considerations based on what we know today. We're encouraged by our underlying performance and believe we're well positioned to deliver on our long-term growth opportunity. We expect pricing from intense inflationary markets to moderate in 2025 and recycling the impact of currency devaluations from these markets in 2024. With respect to our commodity environment, we expect prices on industrial materials to remain relatively stable, while agricultural commodities will continue to face volatility and higher prices. We will continue to invest behind our brands as we have been doing, while at the same time we will leverage a range of productivity levers to drive efficiency and effectiveness across our P&L. We expect elevated net interest expense resulting from the deposit made related to the ongoing IRS tax dispute and upcoming fairlife contingent consideration payment. Regarding currency, if we assume current rates on our hedge positions, there would be an approximate low single-digit currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate mid-single-digit currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2025. Many factors could impact both our currency outlook and broader business between now and when we expect to provide guidance in February. With our all-weather strategy, we've delivered comparable earnings growth for many years now. We have numerous levers to continue to do so. So in summary, successfully executing our strategy in an ever-evolving operating environment, we're confident in our ability to deliver on our objectives in 2024 and over the long-term. We're clear on the direction we are heading in the system. And we continue to invest with our bottling partners to drive sustainable long-term growth. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSteve Powers: Thanks very much. Good morning. So James, it sounds like momentum sequentially improved through the third quarter from a unit case perspective, which is welcome news. I guess given that as you look forward, how confident are you that you can return trends to positive growth in the fourth quarter? And how much of any expected improvement trajectory is within your control through some of the initiatives you detailed in the prepared remarks versus the system being essentially more dependent on a less -- just a less adverse macro backdrop? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Steve. Clearly, we were not as happy as we could have been in the third quarter with volume, and we focused on adapting quickly and saw improvements through the quarter. So July was the bump and things improved in August through September. I largely believe that it's within our control to return to growth. Actually, the macro environment, I'm sure we'll touch on later, is showing a degree of resilience. There are lots of puts and takes, but a degree of resilience. So I think it's firmly about getting our flywheel of the marketing innovation, the price pack and the execution of the system, and that we can get back to growth, which is very much implicit in our algorithm and our expectations going forward through the fourth quarter into 2025.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to focus on the mix component within price mix. You mentioned it was 3% in the quarter. Great result. How sustainable is that as you look going forward out to 2025? And maybe can you talk about some of the key efforts on that front?\nJames Quincey: Yes. Let me break the mix -- I mean, mix has got a lot of different components in it country, category, channel, affordability or premiumization. In the third quarter, there are a couple of pieces of mix that I wanted to call out. One, which I see is enduring and ongoing and one which I see as more temporary. The enduring and ongoing piece is, of course, we're focused on not just driving the growth of affordability options, whether they be smaller packages, smaller multipacks at better entry price points or refillables depending on where you are in the world as a key part of responding to those consumers that are under disposable income pressure, which tends to be a headwind, but also focusing on premium segments whether that be premium waters or fairlife or some of the Coke SKUs to get the mix to be up. And so the more enduring piece is that ongoing management of affordability and premiumizations to drive our mix. The bit that was more temporary, which is relatively atypical in the last number of years, remember that the average price in emerging markets is lower than average price in the developed economies. Typically speaking, the emerging markets grow faster, so mechanically they are a headwind in price mix because they obviously have a lower price. In this quarter, atypically, the emerging markets have grown slower or have declined relative to the major economies, U.S., Europe, Japan, Australia. And so that actually has a kind of automatic stabilizer effect, which is that it makes price/mix go up. And of course, we're expecting, as we go through the fourth quarter into next year, to go to a more normal construct where we'll see decent results in the developed economies and faster growth in the emerging markets, and that will then have a normal shape -- more normal shape to its volume and a more normal shape to its price mix. So I think we feel good about where this is likely to go.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. I would love to hear a bit more about those adapted-quickly items, James, that you kind of spoke to. So believing in our control, there's a lot there, right? So I just would love if we could get some more maybe tangible examples of what you're doing to adapt quickly that is having -- you're able to execute quickly and have a quick payback. And since you teased the macro, let's get your view on the macro environment as well. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean I don't think my view on the macro environment is going to take us too far. It's basically two big thoughts. One, at a global level, the consumer and the economies, I mean, the IMF report came out yesterday, is relatively resilient and relatively stable on a global basis. Clearly, there are a set of puts and takes between geographies, between income levels. But the macros in aggregate are a sum of a shifting set of puts and takes, but resilience in aggregate. Exactly how that will turn out, I'm not sure next year, probably different puts and takes, but again, resilience on overall basis. In terms of the tangible examples, I mean, it's a question where affordability, like, are we pressing hard on making the availability of certain affordable options even more expansive? Have we brought -- bringing forward, for example, investments in cold drink equipment so that we can upscale the availability of cold product, remembering, for example, that the Southern Hemisphere is just about to go into its summer, can we get further faster in terms of doing that, which will then tend to drive more volume growth. Are we applying the right adjustment to the mix of the marketing messaging? And how do we tweak that now that we have a more agile marketing model with the ongoing transformation, we're able to adapt the messaging. So to really get in there and get those things. And then in some parts of the world, it's about adapting the messaging to the situation. I mean some countries, for example, where the economics are very poor, it's not so much about the marketing, it's more about the availability and the entry price points. So we've always got to work with our local bottlers to drive what's the right system answer and really fine-tune our relevance with the consumers the retailers in that country in this moment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks operator. Good morning, James. Good morning, John. I guess a question about North America. And our observation through this quarter or over the summer was just, I guess, a little bit of softness overall in just discretionary spending, so that kind of expressed in small-format stores, convenience and gas, I think also maybe a bit in foodservice. So can you just maybe talk to that? Are you seeing the same thing? And is there maybe just a little bit of a recession, if you will, on impulse purchases right now? And if so, just what do you think changes that?\nJames Quincey: I think it's -- honestly, I think it's more of a mix. There's clearly part of the consumer landscape where there's pressure on disposable income. If you look -- I mean it depends whether you want to take measures of consumer confidence or measures of consumer sentiment. I know that sounds like the same thing, but depending which source you look at, one's going up, one is going down. So there's a mixed bag. I would say there is some softness in aggregate, but it's very marginal in the total industry landscape. The beverage industry is still pretty robust. There's growth in total dollars. Having said that, we talked about in previous quarters there's a set of consumers exhibiting value-seeking behavior, whether they're looking for combo deals when they're in away from home, particularly quick-service restaurants, whether they're looking for going and getting lower price point purchases of beverages, whether that's a smaller pack size or a smaller number of packs in multipack, that's out there. But there's just a -- also strong purchasing power in other segments of the marketplace, which is somewhat offsetting. I mean, witnessed the strong momentum, for example, in fairlife. But net-net, I think the U.S. marketplace has remained pretty resilient given what is -- given the China -- trajectory macroeconomically speaking that we come through.\nOperator: Next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Carey: Hi good morning everyone. Yes, this has been somewhat addressed, but I think I'd maybe be a little bit more specific. The stock is off a bit premarket on what appears to be around 2025 earnings growth given your outlook for FX and net interest expense going into next year. And I think the lesson from this year and really in recent years, has been your ability to overcome these substantial effect headwinds and other headwinds and still deliver on reported EPS growth. James, John, you both expressed some confidence in the prepared remarks on innovation, delivering against longer-term targets. So I guess, can you just touch on maybe some of the lessons of 2024 areas which really allowed you to overcome what was the substantial FX, it still is, headwind this year and still deliver your reported earnings objective, whether pricing RGM innovation, whatever that may be, and what feels durable going into next year? I know you've touched on it, but just trying to get down to what's really driving the stock today. And then maybe importantly, then I'm done, but just the areas where you have a bit more of a heightened focus or a sense things, maybe slowing in Mexico, India, some of these lingering turbulent issues in the Middle East, anything that comes to mind? So basically, just you've got momentum into confronting these headwinds next year, but the environment is also evolving. And I'd just maybe like to put a little bit of a finer bow on that. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure, Chris. I think you're going to win this year's prize for the longest question.\nChris Carey: I expected that.\nJames Quincey: Look, let me start and then I'll -- John will probably want to weigh in too. We have for a number of years and very deliberately chose the expression, the all-weather strategy because as we have all lived, we've been through a lot of very atypical years in the last 5, 7 years. And we wanted to make the point by calling an all-weather strategy, look, we cannot predict like what's going to happen next year. We know some elements, and John will talk about them, but there are many other things that are going to happen. But we're going to pull the levers to get there and drive the business forward, trying to deliver on top line at the end of the top of the algorithm and underlying EPS growth. A couple of things that I think are worth noting about 2024 and its implications into '25. There's a difference, particularly if we talk -- I mean, firstly, FX, as you said, the mid-single-digit call for next year is less than it is this year, although obviously interest is high. There's a difference in FX, if it's coming from the, let's call them, the G10 economies, which are, let's call -- name Europe because it's the simplest example. If there's a big devaluation of the euro, there's not likely to be a lot of pass-through inflation in the short term in the European marketplace, and that's going to be much harder for us to deal with, but not impossible. If there's a big devaluation in an emerging market, you tend to get more immediate pass-through of the inflation. And so you can see that in 2024. In 2024, almost all the FX headwind is a consequence of devaluations in the emerging markets. And actually, the G10 bucket is broadly flat, I believe. And so that you do have -- if it's coming from the emerging markets, there's a little more of a link back to above-normal pricing on the top line, which, again, you see in the year-to-date in 2024. So, there's a piece of next year where we, and John will get into it, where you've got to some extent see G10 is different to the to the emerging markets, and some of the emerging markets stuff is linked to the top line. And then obviously, within that, we have to manage each of the marketplace. Because if there's high inflation, there's likely to be a big push on affordability and a big shift in the marketing and innovation mix. So, there's a set of kind of framework approaches depending on what sort of our problem is occurring in the marketplace. But again, let me finish my thought and then hand over. In the end, we're pursuing all-weather strategy. Some years the headwinds will be greater than others, but we're going to pursue a strategy to get over the line in terms of trying to drive some growth. And there's a lot that can still happen before next year and will come with a complete picture in February. John, do you want to add?\nJohn Murphy: Maybe, Chris, if I could touch upon some of the lessons that we've learned, not just this year but really over the last few years. First one I'd say is it's really important through the thick and thin of all of this is to stay very focused on investing the right way behind our brands and that is something we will continue to do. I think, secondly, in the last couple of years, having an even sharper understanding as to where your profit drivers are underneath the global portfolio at the country casualty level and then making sure that we're over-allocating resources to support those larger profit pools both in the base of the business and as we think about growth going forward is really important. And doing that in partnership with our bottlers around the world and we've seen that being a big source of the momentum over the last couple of years. I think the third area that I would highlight and I know it's a topic across many companies going into 2025, is that you can never take your foot off the productivity accelerator. And in that context, I think the learning is that that you've got to build into your overall way of doing business as opposed to have it as an end-of-year project that you need to kind of deliver something in the next six to 12 weeks to save the quarter. So, we've got a lot of levers we've talked about it in the past that are available to us, whether it's through marketing investment line, our operating investment line, operating expense investment line, or through our supply chain. And we will continue to go after the opportunities that come at us. And so when you take all of those together, I think that's what we see creating that flywheel of growth on the top line, and then the ability to sustain and expand margins down through the P&L from there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBonnie Herzog: Hi, thank you. Good morning. I actually wanted to circle back to North America. Your organic sales growth was very strong at 12%, which caught most of us by surprise. And growth was primarily driven by the double-digit price mix. So, hoping for a little bit more color behind that in terms of rate versus mix in the market. And then ultimately, how sustainable that is and I guess, second, I'd be curious to hear if you believe you've maybe reached a point where you've pushed too far in terms of pricing. And if so, how will you modify your pricing strategy or RGM capabilities going forward. James, you did touch on this, certainly a greater focus on affordability, so maybe an example or two would be helpful to hear. Thanks so much.\nJames Quincey: Sure, Bonnie. Firstly, in North America, Q3, the price/mix, half, in round numbers, half of it is price and half of it is mix. So price closer to rate. The mix is being driven by some of the de-price -- some of the kind of lesser focus on case pack water, but a heavy investments behind brands like fairlife, Topo Chico, some of the nutrition staff, Coca-Cola. And those tend to be mix positive. So there's clearly a consequence, actually John just talked about it, really being choiceful about where we invest behind which brands, in which countries, in which channels. And that's coming through in North America, which is why you got about half of that coming from mix and half of it coming from price or right. Clearly, there's a balance there with some of the affordability actions we're doing, but that's the basic setup. And if we just home in on price for a second, so you're getting roughly half of that in price, and that then starts to look a lot like the trajectory of CPI that has been coming down. And what we see going forward is there'll continue to be inflation in the input costs whether that be labor, particularly some of the agricultural commodities, some of the packaging costs as well, are still going to be increasing in cost, although at a lower rate. So again, we see us heading towards a more normalized level of pricing going into next year and kind of landing in a more normal zone as kind of -- some of that tracks down at kind of similar rates to CPI. Of course, we continue to be very choiceful about where we invest for affordability options and where we invest for premiumization options. I'm not sure, I think mix will always be four or five points. But certainly, we would look for continued growth in the North American business.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nFilippo Falorni: Hi, good morning everyone. I wanted to ask on the margin outlook going forward. This year, you realized very strong gross margin, operating margin expansion, a lot of it driven by the refranchising activity with the underlying kind of being offset by currency. As we think about going forward, you guys both talked about leverage on the productivity line, maybe some inflation in the agricultural commodities, can you talk us through like the balance of the levers for margin expansion into next year? And anything we should be thinking about, assuming no other franchising activity? Thank you.\nJohn Murphy: Sure. Thanks for the question. First of all, it's a huge area of focus and has been. We're currently tracking to have our highest gross margin level since pre-COVID and expect that underlying expansion to continue, notwithstanding, the offsets that you just mentioned. For 2025, as we as we laid out in the script, some of the considerations for 2025 is a more normalized pricing environment. James has touched upon that. We would continue to look to offset the FX headwinds with some underlying expansion through our RGM and cost efficiency efforts. I've highlighted some of the challenges we have on the agricultural commodity front, and we see that being part of just the equation we need to manage. We are, as I said earlier, looking at a number of levers on both the revenue and the cost lines, our ongoing elevation on the RGM front, the optimization of \u2013 on the promotional front within the innovation space, things like simplification of product specs, for example, can free up a lot of dollars. The way we have been working with our very diverse supplier base across the world, not only for certainty of supply, which is a huge priority in a number of markets, but over time to leverage the scale of the system, et cetera. So there's just a lot of opportunity and it's not any one big thing that's going to make or break the numbers. But I think it's our continued ability to bring all of these levers to play that's going to make the difference. And I think that's represented in the consideration set that we framed for 2025.\nFilippo Falorni: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you and good morning, everyone. James, John, you mentioned that volumes improved as you exit the quarter, but implied organic sales growth for Q4 even after you raised, it's closer to, I believe, 6% from 9% in Q3, if my math is correct, and you have the extra two days. I'm hoping to see if you can help us bridge the most recent trends and how to think about Q4. And separately, just a clarification. There are some recent news on potential ban in the sale of CSDs and snacks in schools Mexico. I know that historically the impact of the sugar tax was not relevant at all. But just wanted to hear how you're positioning cases if it materializes? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Let me go in reverse order. I haven't read all the news in Mexico, I'm not sure it's happening yet. But we largely sell a no-sugar set of portfolios recommendation towards schools and that's part of our global approach. So I'm not sure how that matters, or not sure how that's going to impact the business. I'd imagine that's going to be very small, if at all. In terms of Q4, I mean, I would unpack it and say, look, part of what is important here is what is going to be the flow-through from some of these high inflation marketplaces. If you take the impact of high inflation, it's clearly been slowing down or lesser impact as we've gone through the year. And so you're going to see potentially less impact in the fourth quarter from that. In terms of where we're going, in terms of CSDs, yes, clearly, there's going to be a pickup in terms of price -- in terms of inventory, sorry. And I don't think you quite got to the right number yet. I think it's probably implicitly a little higher. But we can certainly follow-up on that one. I think it's going to be a strong outlook. Because at the end of the day, in my simple way of thinking about things, if you take out all the moving pieces in the craziness of what goes on, at the end of the day, if I take out the high-inflation markets out of the price/mix in Q3, you get 6%. Volume was minus 1%, that's 5%. That's right in the range of top end of our growth algorithm, the same as it has been each quarter so far this year and in previous years. And if you just want to look at it in simple terms, excluding high inflation, I'm expecting us to say bang at the top end of our long-term growth algorithm.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: I'm going to go for the award for the shortest question. Since the news is so new with McDonald's and potential food contamination. I think they're your largest customer. Is there anything we should know about how it would impact your business?\nJames Quincey: Kaumil, yes, I think you've got a pretty short question there. Look, I think obviously, hearts go out to the people who have been affected by the contamination. Certainly, we're a big partner of McDonald's, they're a big partner of ours. We'll be helping them in any way we can as they work through whatever is happening here. Clearly, the information is very thin on the ground as it relates to those of us further away from the situation. Certainly, when one looks at what's in the media so far in terms of the states that have been affected, I would say, at this stage, it's not going to be a large, significant impact the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. Your CSD business in the U.S. is performing quite a bit better than it has than a number of years ago. And I'd like to kind of get your sense of the drivers on that? Is it Zero Sugar products? Is it better engagement with younger drinkers? It market share gains? And then more specifically, this year, some of the data that that we're looking at seems to suggest CSDs are retaking market share from energy drinks. So lots of pieces there, but I'd love to get your assessment of what's going on. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Thanks Rob. Well, firstly, I'm tempted to go what's driving the growth of the soft drinks as all of the above, in terms of what we've been doing to make our brands more relevant. I think the North America teams have done a good job across the portfolio, to be fair. I mean if you look at the third quarter. Coke Trademark grew volumetrically speaking. The other sparkling beverages grew volumetrically speaking. I mean, within the Coke Trademark, Coke Original was broadly flat, and Coke Zero was double-digit growth, and even Diet Coke grew. So I think there's been a strong leveraging of the ongoing marketing transformation, paired with an improving set of execution by the bottling system, work on the RGM and the pack mix, and execution in the marketplace, that are bringing greater strength to the sparkling beverage business in North America. It's certainly been the accumulation of many quarters work and it's starting to show through both when you look at the third quarter and also if you were to look at -- if that's an improving trend through the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charlie Higgs from Redburn. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nCharlie Higgs: Yes. Hi, James, John, Robin, hope you are all well. I'd like to dig into the unit case volumes down 1% in Q3 a bit more, please. And if you could maybe just quantify or contextualize some of the consumer hesitancy that's happened in Q3. Was it about the same as Q2 better or worse? And then also some of the impacts from the portfolio trimming you're doing. I'm just trying to get a sense of like the clean volume performance in Q3. And then just building on that, maybe you could touch a bit more on Trademark Coke, Coke Zero accelerating to 11%? Are you confident, James, that that's incremental and not coming from Coke Classic? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: We can break down the volume in lots of different ways. The first and most important piece of the puzzle, I sort of mentioned it earlier, is the relatively atypical makeup of volume in Q3. In other words, there was actually good performance from volume -- in volume terms across the developed economies. So North America, although it was flat, it had growth in the sparkling beverages and it had growth in the kind of the premium stills, if you like, across multiple categories, and we had deprioritized some of the case pack water. So actually North America had a good performance. Europe grew, Japan grew, Australia. And they grow -- not only did they grow, it -- the pressure had actually come from emerging markets. And that pressure in the emerging markets was concentrated in a set of markets, some with temporal factors and some with some ongoing issues. The temporal factors are more -- for example, Mexico was cycling in this quarter a very strong Q3 last year. Brazil continues to be good, but Mexico was cycling strong Q3 last year, which made Latin America looked like it came off. But actually, we still think the momentum is good there. India had a particularly heavy monsoon in a number of states, and that affected the volume in India. Actually, by the way, heavy monsoons tend to be a good predictor of agricultural yield, which would be then better next year. That's clearly going to be a temporary factor and we'd be looking for India to return to growth. Parts of the world that are on the more ongoing pressure are particularly China and the Eurasian markets or Eurasia and the Middle East. Clearly, here, we still see a couple of things going on. One, in China, yes, the economy is kind of not taking off. But some of what's going on with choices we've made. We chose to deprioritize some of water, in equivalent terms, case pack water. And we focused on growth in the sparkling beverages in China, so actually Coke grew volumetrically in the third quarter in Japan. So it's clearly about -- some of it's about the choices we make, but we need to focus more on the things we can control in China to have better marketing, innovation and execution. But we see light at the end of the tunnel and long-term investment opportunities for the China business. The Eurasia business is more of a confluence of factors, the spillover from the Middle East conflict, plus there's a set of markets there that are undergoing quite significant macroeconomic adjustments and that is also coming together to kind of create a relatively big headwind volumetrically speaking.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning. To dig a little bit further into fairlife, I guess maybe the size of it at this point, are we nearing $1 billion? How much impact is it having on mix and kind of the prospects as we look to next year? Can it continue to expand or do you have tougher comparisons? Because it's really been a big driver particularly in the past kind of 12, 18 months and just trying to understand the prospects going forward and how much impact it's now having on North American overall sales? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Bill. Well, for sure, it's going to be $1 billion brand. It's certainly passed that mark a while ago. I think firstly, like one of the most kind of I think standout facts about the North American businesses, and I think we said it in the script, is the two biggest brands in terms of retail dollars added to the North American beverage landscape by any brand across the whole industry is Coca-Cola Trademark and Fairlife. And that shows you, I think the ability to take something that's been around for 138 years and make it continue to be relevant and take something that's not much more than a decade old and make that relevant too. And so yes, it's having an impact on mix because largely we're consolidating a vertically integrated business and so there's a mechanical effect at the revenue line, which is part of that slightly outsized contribution for mix that I talked about earlier, but it's also delivering on the bottom line. But just to allay fears that somehow that means that the rest of the business is not doing well, no. The North America ex-fairlife is also growing top line, gaining, doing well, and growing profits. So both engines are firing, or all the engines are firing, and it's not just one engine, which I think is very important to understand, and it can certainly continue to expand. I mean, clearly next year we're going to be cycling a very strong year, and we are in the process, as previously advertised, about bringing online more capacity than New York plant is being dug out of the ground or built out of the ground as we speak. And so we will be aiming to blend in that capacity. Clearly, it's going to be hard to cycle this year's numbers until we get the capacity, but I think there's huge opportunity and demand in the marketplace. We just need to continue to run, keep it relevant, and bring online the capacity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKevin Grundy: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. James, I was hoping to pivot to the alcohol strategy and learnings there. I think it's gotten a little bit less attention from investors more recently. The company has about a few years in or so to the strategy, extending some of the brands. You have a number of different partners in the space with a number of different trademarks. Maybe comment, number one, sort of broader learning's here a few years in. And then two, which opportunities you think are more scalable globally and can become a more meaningful part of the portfolio. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes. It's a couple of years in, still very early days. I would advertise here a kind of an overall learning that most things take a decade to work out whether they're going to arrive at scale, a minimum 7 years. And that's true, even if you look back at the beverage industry, the most successful of any brands, it was very hard to tell whether we're really breaking through to scale until about year 7 and it took at least till year 10 to get scale and often much longer. So a few years is still relatively early days in terms of really building out something at scale. So that's point number one. Two, we've been taking a measured approach to work out what will work. And we've got some good learnings, and we've pivoted where things didn't work, and we've kind of continued to advance where things are working. I think in terms of -- you kind of -- implicit in the question is like, is one of these going to work and the other is not going to work? I don't think I see this category that way. I don't think there's going to be one killer SKU that is 50% of the market. I think it's going to be much more -- the alcohol industry has more variety and more variety-seeking behaviors. And therefore, I think it's going to be more about us using a combination of some partnered ready-to-drink offerings like Jack and Coke, Bacardi and Coke, Absolut and Sprite, complemented with a set of our own brands, ARTD, like Simply Spiked or Minute Maid, in a portfolio effect. And I think it's going to be about having a robust portfolio of choice, is going to be the approach that is likely to do well in ARTD. And if you look around the world at the few markets, and there are only relatively a few, where ARTD is a meaningful percentage of the beer, relative to beer, then that's the characteristic that stands out. So the question is, can we put together a bundle that could be effective, not just in share terms, which I think is possible, but in terms of making ARTD a relevant size category?\nKevin Grundy: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Moskow from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRobert Moskow: A quick question. You expect price/mix to decelerate next year. Some of it's due to North America, some of it's due to hyperinflationary markets. So do you expect any benefit to volume from that? Like is there elasticity assumption? You did sound very positive about volume into 2025. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes. There is a certain mechanical effect to price/mix and volume. In other words, I'm expecting 2025 to be the inverse of the third quarter. In other words, I would expect the emerging markets to retake their more traditional position of growing faster than the developed economies, which will obviously contribute to volume growth, but instead of -- but it won't contribute to a positive price/mix. So I think there will be some stabilization in that kind of relationship such that next year is going to look more like essentially what this year looked like, which is where you've got some volume growth, a more normal level of volume growth, a more normal level of pricing, with a kind of a top-up of what will still be a residue amount of high-inflationary countries. And that's likely to be where 2025 is heading.\nRobert Moskow: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question today will come from Carlos Laboy from HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nCarlos Laboy: Yes, good morning, everyone. I have a North America-specific question. Can you tell us more about the improving system digital capabilities are being built that you might find most promising as you look forward to accelerating volume and revenue growth? And how are you compelling the bottlers to make investments behind these capabilities?\nJames Quincey: Yes. Sure, Carlos. I mean, from a bottling system point of view, I think in a way, it's the expansion of the digital engagement with the retail system. I mean there was always the electronic ordering in the modern trade, and that's been around a long while. What's really interesting about what's going on is more in the kind of mom-and-pop traditional trade or independent trade part of the marketplace, which is not just the ability to provide a platform, which allows the retailer to engage with the ordering system 24/7 rather than waiting for the pre-seller to turn up. They can engage to add product order -- add to order, they can register service request for the coolers or for merchandising material. But also as we start to get into AI, the system can also start interacting with the retailers with suggested orders and the engagement, not just from the retailer to the bottler in terms of ordering a service that's actually from the bottler to the retailer suggesting orders because of whatever is happening, there might be some events coming up, there might be people like you buy these sorts of things you should add. And so we really see a combination of enhancement to the market developers who are out there. It's not going to go from being a human system to an entirely electronic system. I think it's going to be about the enablement of the humans to be as productive as they can be, whether those are pre-sellers, market developers or the retail operators themselves. And so I think it's very exciting, and the bottlers are leaning in to the investments in this area.\nJames Quincey: So with that, just to conclude, we think we're well positioned to deliver on our ambitions to 2024 and over the long term. We're certainly managing near-term uncertainty as we continue to build our system for long term. And we're confident we will create sustainable value for our stakeholders. Thanks for your interest, your investment in the company, and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Quincey",
            "content": "Thanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. After a good first half of 2024, we navigated through a dynamic external landscape during the third quarter. Our business again proved to be resilient. Volume declined 1% in the quarter driven by a slow start in July. However, our business trends improved each month and, notably, Trademark Coca-Cola volume outperformed during the quarter. Our year-to-date 2024 performance gives us confidence we will deliver at the high end of our previous top line guidance and earnings growth of 5% to 6%, including approximately 9% of currency headwinds. With that as context, I'll start with an update on the global consumer landscape and a review of the third quarter business performance. Then I'll explain how we're delivering on our objectives by staying agile and improving execution of our strategy across each facet of our growth flywheel. John will end by discussing financial details for the quarter, our updated guidance for full year 2024, and some early considerations for 2025. During the quarter, global consumer sentiment and spending in aggregate held up well, and our broader industry continued to expand. In this context, we delivered robust organic revenue growth with value share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels. We also expanded comparable margins. This led to 5% comparable earnings per share growth despite nearly double-digit currency headwinds and the impact of bottler refranchising. We continue to demonstrate staying power as the beverage industry remains attractive with many strong new and existing players. Our system is well positioned to develop the commercial beverage industry in many markets and capture long-term balanced growth. Across the world, we are leveraging our scale and local expertise to navigate varying local market dynamics. In North America, we generated robust top line growth and won value share. Trademark Coca-Cola and sparkling flavors both grew volume. During the quarter and year-to-date, Trademark Coca-Cola and fairlife were the leaders in the beverage industry in at-home retail sales growth. Consumers are responding well to sharper value messaging in away-from-home channels, and we're continuing to drive affordable and premium packages across our total beverage portfolio to realize positive mix. In Latin America, volume was flat during the quarter as we cycled strong growth in the prior year. We had solid revenue growth led by Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Powerade. We also benefited from integrating marketing activations across the region. For example, in Brazil, Rock in Rio reached over 70 million people and led to Trademark Coca-Cola being the most mentioned brand on TikTok. Stepped-up execution by increasing cooler placement and investing in digital capabilities is also driving results. In EMEA, we saw improved performance in Europe and strong growth across many parts of Africa. The performance in Eurasia and Middle East and North Africa unfavorably impacted overall results. In Europe, we grew volume during the quarter and benefited from the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Both Fuze Tea and Powerade continued their strong momentum. And we're continuing to focus on affordable price points, value packages, tailored promotions and premium offerings to drive demand. In Eurasia and Middle East, a confluence of headwinds led to a decline in volume. While it's fair to assume pressure will persist in the near-term, we are taking action. Our system is driving affordability and availability, and we're leaning into the local intrinsics of our business. In Africa, volume declined largely due to pressure in some North African markets. Outside of these markets, we grew volume and gained value share. Our system is investing for the long-term by accelerating refillable offerings, cooler placements and increasing manufacturing capacity. Lastly, in Asia Pacific, despite weakness in China and a couple of markets in Southeast Asia, we grew organic revenue and comparable operating income. In ASEAN and South Pacific, we gained value share led by the Philippines and Australia. The Philippines grew affordable transactions with refillable packages and grew premium transactions with single-serve offerings. Australia prioritized affordability initiatives across our sparkling portfolio and successfully activated the Olympic Games with Powerade. In Japan and South Korea, we had solid volume growth and won value share due to good traction on brand relaunches, which leveraged enhanced taste and refreshed packaging and stepped-up performance in e-commerce channels. In China, a challenging operating environment and strategic reprioritization of our portfolio led to a decline in volume. We're continuing to focus on driving affordability across our core portfolio. Our longer-term growth ambition is unchanged, and we're investing to come out ahead when conditions improve. In India, volume declined in states impacted by higher than normal monsoons. In geographic areas that were unaffected, volume grew mid-single-digits. We remain upbeat about progress in integrated execution and our ability to capture long-term growth opportunities. To sum everything up, while our markets continue to move in many different directions and our agility is being put to the test, our all-weather strategy is working. We're continuing to deliver on our strategy through a combination of world-class marketing and innovation and excellence in revenue growth management and execution. Starting with marketing and innovation. Our refreshed marketing model is integrating digital, live and retail experiences to connect with consumers in unique and personalized ways. The Olympic and Paralympic games, is a great example. We featured our total beverage portfolio, launched fan zones and festivals, and leveraged social channels to increase connections with athletes. Many of our brands offered customized packaging, and our system activated tailored point-of-sale displays with customers around the world. The Olympic and Paralympic Games were activated with customers across over 65 markets, featured nearly 250 influencers, and demonstrated positive engagement scores across our portfolio. Topo Chico is another example. In the U.S., Topo Chico is the number one premium sparkling water brand. We've driven strong consumer demand with a grassroots experiential campaign in 13 cities featuring impactful displays connecting Topo Chico to food, music and art. In Mexico, we're applying a similar playbook. We recently launched Topo Chico's first-ever nationwide experiential activation with the Think Like An Artist campaign. This featured connections with local artists across 69 events in five cities and was amplified through social channels. During the quarter, Topo Chico trademark grew volume nearly 20% globally. Year-to-date volume has increased tenfold compared to pre-acquisition levels in 2016. Our marketing and innovation agenda emphasizes a culture of acting boldly, learning and not being afraid to fail, and scaling successes. Sometimes our innovations don't hit the mark as evidenced by Coca-Cola Spice, which we've discontinued. But our focus on bigger and bolder innovations is paying off. Fuze Tea is a multiyear success and is scaling well across over 80 markets, and Minute Maid Zero Sugars showing promise. Sprite Chill also delivered over $50 million in retail sales after only 21 weeks in the market and has been extended after a successful limited run. We also innovate for different reasons. It can be to generate short-term buzz, such as the third quarter launch of the limited edition product, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Oreo, which is available in over 35 markets, and Fanta Beetlejuice, which is our first-ever global Halloween activation and is offered in nearly 50 markets. Or we might invest for the long term such as our announcement of plans to debut Bacardi Mix with Coca-Cola in 2025. So far, in 2024, overall, we've benefited from strong velocities on our innovation and we're continuing to improve our innovation success rates versus prior year. Moving across our flywheel. Our system is step-changing execution by fully integrating our marketing and commercial plans and investing to grow our customers' businesses. Leveraging data and digitally-enabled solutions, including AI, is a huge opportunity. And we are integrating digital advertising with point-of-sale messaging and offering brand price pack architecture geared to customers' individual needs. When executed efficiently, this approach can deliver promising uplifts in retail sales for our customers. While we're focused on taking our capabilities to the next level, we're also working towards mastering the foundations that move the needle. In 2024, our system increased availability by investing in cold drink equipment and boosted our share of visible cold inventory across markets. In the past 12 months, we created $11 billion in incremental retail sales for customers, which is more than double the next five closest beverage companies combined. From 2018 to 2023, we were the leader in customer value creation for the beverage industry every year. To summarize, we feel good about the momentum of our business. And as we look ahead, our external environment will continue to have many moving pieces. We'll continue to prioritize flexibility to navigate market dynamics locally to deliver on our global objectives. Thanks to the power of our portfolio, our system's unique capabilities and the unwavering dedication of our system employees, we're confident we will be able to deliver on our 2024 guidance and longer-term priorities. With that, I'll turn the call over to John. Thanks, Steve. Clearly, we were not as happy as we could have been in the third quarter with volume, and we focused on adapting quickly and saw improvements through the quarter. So July was the bump and things improved in August through September. I largely believe that it's within our control to return to growth. Actually, the macro environment, I'm sure we'll touch on later, is showing a degree of resilience. There are lots of puts and takes, but a degree of resilience. So I think it's firmly about getting our flywheel of the marketing innovation, the price pack and the execution of the system, and that we can get back to growth, which is very much implicit in our algorithm and our expectations going forward through the fourth quarter into 2025. Yes. Let me break the mix -- I mean, mix has got a lot of different components in it country, category, channel, affordability or premiumization. In the third quarter, there are a couple of pieces of mix that I wanted to call out. One, which I see is enduring and ongoing and one which I see as more temporary. The enduring and ongoing piece is, of course, we're focused on not just driving the growth of affordability options, whether they be smaller packages, smaller multipacks at better entry price points or refillables depending on where you are in the world as a key part of responding to those consumers that are under disposable income pressure, which tends to be a headwind, but also focusing on premium segments whether that be premium waters or fairlife or some of the Coke SKUs to get the mix to be up. And so the more enduring piece is that ongoing management of affordability and premiumizations to drive our mix. The bit that was more temporary, which is relatively atypical in the last number of years, remember that the average price in emerging markets is lower than average price in the developed economies. Typically speaking, the emerging markets grow faster, so mechanically they are a headwind in price mix because they obviously have a lower price. In this quarter, atypically, the emerging markets have grown slower or have declined relative to the major economies, U.S., Europe, Japan, Australia. And so that actually has a kind of automatic stabilizer effect, which is that it makes price/mix go up. And of course, we're expecting, as we go through the fourth quarter into next year, to go to a more normal construct where we'll see decent results in the developed economies and faster growth in the emerging markets, and that will then have a normal shape -- more normal shape to its volume and a more normal shape to its price mix. So I think we feel good about where this is likely to go. Sure. I mean I don't think my view on the macro environment is going to take us too far. It's basically two big thoughts. One, at a global level, the consumer and the economies, I mean, the IMF report came out yesterday, is relatively resilient and relatively stable on a global basis. Clearly, there are a set of puts and takes between geographies, between income levels. But the macros in aggregate are a sum of a shifting set of puts and takes, but resilience in aggregate. Exactly how that will turn out, I'm not sure next year, probably different puts and takes, but again, resilience on overall basis. In terms of the tangible examples, I mean, it's a question where affordability, like, are we pressing hard on making the availability of certain affordable options even more expansive? Have we brought -- bringing forward, for example, investments in cold drink equipment so that we can upscale the availability of cold product, remembering, for example, that the Southern Hemisphere is just about to go into its summer, can we get further faster in terms of doing that, which will then tend to drive more volume growth. Are we applying the right adjustment to the mix of the marketing messaging? And how do we tweak that now that we have a more agile marketing model with the ongoing transformation, we're able to adapt the messaging. So to really get in there and get those things. And then in some parts of the world, it's about adapting the messaging to the situation. I mean some countries, for example, where the economics are very poor, it's not so much about the marketing, it's more about the availability and the entry price points. So we've always got to work with our local bottlers to drive what's the right system answer and really fine-tune our relevance with the consumers the retailers in that country in this moment. I think it's -- honestly, I think it's more of a mix. There's clearly part of the consumer landscape where there's pressure on disposable income. If you look -- I mean it depends whether you want to take measures of consumer confidence or measures of consumer sentiment. I know that sounds like the same thing, but depending which source you look at, one's going up, one is going down. So there's a mixed bag. I would say there is some softness in aggregate, but it's very marginal in the total industry landscape. The beverage industry is still pretty robust. There's growth in total dollars. Having said that, we talked about in previous quarters there's a set of consumers exhibiting value-seeking behavior, whether they're looking for combo deals when they're in away from home, particularly quick-service restaurants, whether they're looking for going and getting lower price point purchases of beverages, whether that's a smaller pack size or a smaller number of packs in multipack, that's out there. But there's just a -- also strong purchasing power in other segments of the marketplace, which is somewhat offsetting. I mean, witnessed the strong momentum, for example, in fairlife. But net-net, I think the U.S. marketplace has remained pretty resilient given what is -- given the China -- trajectory macroeconomically speaking that we come through. Sure, Chris. I think you're going to win this year's prize for the longest question. Look, let me start and then I'll -- John will probably want to weigh in too. We have for a number of years and very deliberately chose the expression, the all-weather strategy because as we have all lived, we've been through a lot of very atypical years in the last 5, 7 years. And we wanted to make the point by calling an all-weather strategy, look, we cannot predict like what's going to happen next year. We know some elements, and John will talk about them, but there are many other things that are going to happen. But we're going to pull the levers to get there and drive the business forward, trying to deliver on top line at the end of the top of the algorithm and underlying EPS growth. A couple of things that I think are worth noting about 2024 and its implications into '25. There's a difference, particularly if we talk -- I mean, firstly, FX, as you said, the mid-single-digit call for next year is less than it is this year, although obviously interest is high. There's a difference in FX, if it's coming from the, let's call them, the G10 economies, which are, let's call -- name Europe because it's the simplest example. If there's a big devaluation of the euro, there's not likely to be a lot of pass-through inflation in the short term in the European marketplace, and that's going to be much harder for us to deal with, but not impossible. If there's a big devaluation in an emerging market, you tend to get more immediate pass-through of the inflation. And so you can see that in 2024. In 2024, almost all the FX headwind is a consequence of devaluations in the emerging markets. And actually, the G10 bucket is broadly flat, I believe. And so that you do have -- if it's coming from the emerging markets, there's a little more of a link back to above-normal pricing on the top line, which, again, you see in the year-to-date in 2024. So, there's a piece of next year where we, and John will get into it, where you've got to some extent see G10 is different to the to the emerging markets, and some of the emerging markets stuff is linked to the top line. And then obviously, within that, we have to manage each of the marketplace. Because if there's high inflation, there's likely to be a big push on affordability and a big shift in the marketing and innovation mix. So, there's a set of kind of framework approaches depending on what sort of our problem is occurring in the marketplace. But again, let me finish my thought and then hand over. In the end, we're pursuing all-weather strategy. Some years the headwinds will be greater than others, but we're going to pursue a strategy to get over the line in terms of trying to drive some growth. And there's a lot that can still happen before next year and will come with a complete picture in February. John, do you want to add? Sure, Bonnie. Firstly, in North America, Q3, the price/mix, half, in round numbers, half of it is price and half of it is mix. So price closer to rate. The mix is being driven by some of the de-price -- some of the kind of lesser focus on case pack water, but a heavy investments behind brands like fairlife, Topo Chico, some of the nutrition staff, Coca-Cola. And those tend to be mix positive. So there's clearly a consequence, actually John just talked about it, really being choiceful about where we invest behind which brands, in which countries, in which channels. And that's coming through in North America, which is why you got about half of that coming from mix and half of it coming from price or right. Clearly, there's a balance there with some of the affordability actions we're doing, but that's the basic setup. And if we just home in on price for a second, so you're getting roughly half of that in price, and that then starts to look a lot like the trajectory of CPI that has been coming down. And what we see going forward is there'll continue to be inflation in the input costs whether that be labor, particularly some of the agricultural commodities, some of the packaging costs as well, are still going to be increasing in cost, although at a lower rate. So again, we see us heading towards a more normalized level of pricing going into next year and kind of landing in a more normal zone as kind of -- some of that tracks down at kind of similar rates to CPI. Of course, we continue to be very choiceful about where we invest for affordability options and where we invest for premiumization options. I'm not sure, I think mix will always be four or five points. But certainly, we would look for continued growth in the North American business. Let me go in reverse order. I haven't read all the news in Mexico, I'm not sure it's happening yet. But we largely sell a no-sugar set of portfolios recommendation towards schools and that's part of our global approach. So I'm not sure how that matters, or not sure how that's going to impact the business. I'd imagine that's going to be very small, if at all. In terms of Q4, I mean, I would unpack it and say, look, part of what is important here is what is going to be the flow-through from some of these high inflation marketplaces. If you take the impact of high inflation, it's clearly been slowing down or lesser impact as we've gone through the year. And so you're going to see potentially less impact in the fourth quarter from that. In terms of where we're going, in terms of CSDs, yes, clearly, there's going to be a pickup in terms of price -- in terms of inventory, sorry. And I don't think you quite got to the right number yet. I think it's probably implicitly a little higher. But we can certainly follow-up on that one. I think it's going to be a strong outlook. Because at the end of the day, in my simple way of thinking about things, if you take out all the moving pieces in the craziness of what goes on, at the end of the day, if I take out the high-inflation markets out of the price/mix in Q3, you get 6%. Volume was minus 1%, that's 5%. That's right in the range of top end of our growth algorithm, the same as it has been each quarter so far this year and in previous years. And if you just want to look at it in simple terms, excluding high inflation, I'm expecting us to say bang at the top end of our long-term growth algorithm. Kaumil, yes, I think you've got a pretty short question there. Look, I think obviously, hearts go out to the people who have been affected by the contamination. Certainly, we're a big partner of McDonald's, they're a big partner of ours. We'll be helping them in any way we can as they work through whatever is happening here. Clearly, the information is very thin on the ground as it relates to those of us further away from the situation. Certainly, when one looks at what's in the media so far in terms of the states that have been affected, I would say, at this stage, it's not going to be a large, significant impact the business. Yes. Thanks Rob. Well, firstly, I'm tempted to go what's driving the growth of the soft drinks as all of the above, in terms of what we've been doing to make our brands more relevant. I think the North America teams have done a good job across the portfolio, to be fair. I mean if you look at the third quarter. Coke Trademark grew volumetrically speaking. The other sparkling beverages grew volumetrically speaking. I mean, within the Coke Trademark, Coke Original was broadly flat, and Coke Zero was double-digit growth, and even Diet Coke grew. So I think there's been a strong leveraging of the ongoing marketing transformation, paired with an improving set of execution by the bottling system, work on the RGM and the pack mix, and execution in the marketplace, that are bringing greater strength to the sparkling beverage business in North America. It's certainly been the accumulation of many quarters work and it's starting to show through both when you look at the third quarter and also if you were to look at -- if that's an improving trend through the year. We can break down the volume in lots of different ways. The first and most important piece of the puzzle, I sort of mentioned it earlier, is the relatively atypical makeup of volume in Q3. In other words, there was actually good performance from volume -- in volume terms across the developed economies. So North America, although it was flat, it had growth in the sparkling beverages and it had growth in the kind of the premium stills, if you like, across multiple categories, and we had deprioritized some of the case pack water. So actually North America had a good performance. Europe grew, Japan grew, Australia. And they grow -- not only did they grow, it -- the pressure had actually come from emerging markets. And that pressure in the emerging markets was concentrated in a set of markets, some with temporal factors and some with some ongoing issues. The temporal factors are more -- for example, Mexico was cycling in this quarter a very strong Q3 last year. Brazil continues to be good, but Mexico was cycling strong Q3 last year, which made Latin America looked like it came off. But actually, we still think the momentum is good there. India had a particularly heavy monsoon in a number of states, and that affected the volume in India. Actually, by the way, heavy monsoons tend to be a good predictor of agricultural yield, which would be then better next year. That's clearly going to be a temporary factor and we'd be looking for India to return to growth. Parts of the world that are on the more ongoing pressure are particularly China and the Eurasian markets or Eurasia and the Middle East. Clearly, here, we still see a couple of things going on. One, in China, yes, the economy is kind of not taking off. But some of what's going on with choices we've made. We chose to deprioritize some of water, in equivalent terms, case pack water. And we focused on growth in the sparkling beverages in China, so actually Coke grew volumetrically in the third quarter in Japan. So it's clearly about -- some of it's about the choices we make, but we need to focus more on the things we can control in China to have better marketing, innovation and execution. But we see light at the end of the tunnel and long-term investment opportunities for the China business. The Eurasia business is more of a confluence of factors, the spillover from the Middle East conflict, plus there's a set of markets there that are undergoing quite significant macroeconomic adjustments and that is also coming together to kind of create a relatively big headwind volumetrically speaking. Thanks, Bill. Well, for sure, it's going to be $1 billion brand. It's certainly passed that mark a while ago. I think firstly, like one of the most kind of I think standout facts about the North American businesses, and I think we said it in the script, is the two biggest brands in terms of retail dollars added to the North American beverage landscape by any brand across the whole industry is Coca-Cola Trademark and Fairlife. And that shows you, I think the ability to take something that's been around for 138 years and make it continue to be relevant and take something that's not much more than a decade old and make that relevant too. And so yes, it's having an impact on mix because largely we're consolidating a vertically integrated business and so there's a mechanical effect at the revenue line, which is part of that slightly outsized contribution for mix that I talked about earlier, but it's also delivering on the bottom line. But just to allay fears that somehow that means that the rest of the business is not doing well, no. The North America ex-fairlife is also growing top line, gaining, doing well, and growing profits. So both engines are firing, or all the engines are firing, and it's not just one engine, which I think is very important to understand, and it can certainly continue to expand. I mean, clearly next year we're going to be cycling a very strong year, and we are in the process, as previously advertised, about bringing online more capacity than New York plant is being dug out of the ground or built out of the ground as we speak. And so we will be aiming to blend in that capacity. Clearly, it's going to be hard to cycle this year's numbers until we get the capacity, but I think there's huge opportunity and demand in the marketplace. We just need to continue to run, keep it relevant, and bring online the capacity. Yes. It's a couple of years in, still very early days. I would advertise here a kind of an overall learning that most things take a decade to work out whether they're going to arrive at scale, a minimum 7 years. And that's true, even if you look back at the beverage industry, the most successful of any brands, it was very hard to tell whether we're really breaking through to scale until about year 7 and it took at least till year 10 to get scale and often much longer. So a few years is still relatively early days in terms of really building out something at scale. So that's point number one. Two, we've been taking a measured approach to work out what will work. And we've got some good learnings, and we've pivoted where things didn't work, and we've kind of continued to advance where things are working. I think in terms of -- you kind of -- implicit in the question is like, is one of these going to work and the other is not going to work? I don't think I see this category that way. I don't think there's going to be one killer SKU that is 50% of the market. I think it's going to be much more -- the alcohol industry has more variety and more variety-seeking behaviors. And therefore, I think it's going to be more about us using a combination of some partnered ready-to-drink offerings like Jack and Coke, Bacardi and Coke, Absolut and Sprite, complemented with a set of our own brands, ARTD, like Simply Spiked or Minute Maid, in a portfolio effect. And I think it's going to be about having a robust portfolio of choice, is going to be the approach that is likely to do well in ARTD. And if you look around the world at the few markets, and there are only relatively a few, where ARTD is a meaningful percentage of the beer, relative to beer, then that's the characteristic that stands out. So the question is, can we put together a bundle that could be effective, not just in share terms, which I think is possible, but in terms of making ARTD a relevant size category? Yes. There is a certain mechanical effect to price/mix and volume. In other words, I'm expecting 2025 to be the inverse of the third quarter. In other words, I would expect the emerging markets to retake their more traditional position of growing faster than the developed economies, which will obviously contribute to volume growth, but instead of -- but it won't contribute to a positive price/mix. So I think there will be some stabilization in that kind of relationship such that next year is going to look more like essentially what this year looked like, which is where you've got some volume growth, a more normal level of volume growth, a more normal level of pricing, with a kind of a top-up of what will still be a residue amount of high-inflationary countries. And that's likely to be where 2025 is heading. Yes. Sure, Carlos. I mean, from a bottling system point of view, I think in a way, it's the expansion of the digital engagement with the retail system. I mean there was always the electronic ordering in the modern trade, and that's been around a long while. What's really interesting about what's going on is more in the kind of mom-and-pop traditional trade or independent trade part of the marketplace, which is not just the ability to provide a platform, which allows the retailer to engage with the ordering system 24/7 rather than waiting for the pre-seller to turn up. They can engage to add product order -- add to order, they can register service request for the coolers or for merchandising material. But also as we start to get into AI, the system can also start interacting with the retailers with suggested orders and the engagement, not just from the retailer to the bottler in terms of ordering a service that's actually from the bottler to the retailer suggesting orders because of whatever is happening, there might be some events coming up, there might be people like you buy these sorts of things you should add. And so we really see a combination of enhancement to the market developers who are out there. It's not going to go from being a human system to an entirely electronic system. I think it's going to be about the enablement of the humans to be as productive as they can be, whether those are pre-sellers, market developers or the retail operators themselves. And so I think it's very exciting, and the bottlers are leaning in to the investments in this area. So with that, just to conclude, we think we're well positioned to deliver on our ambitions to 2024 and over the long term. We're certainly managing near-term uncertainty as we continue to build our system for long term. And we're confident we will create sustainable value for our stakeholders. Thanks for your interest, your investment in the company, and for joining us this morning."

            "name": "John Murphy",
            "content": "Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll comment on our third quarter performance, discuss the outlook for the remainder of 2024, and provide some early commentary on 2025. During the third quarter, we grew organic revenues 9%. Unit cases declined 1% having had a poor July, but improving sequentially thereafter during the quarter. Concentrate sales were 1 point behind unit cases for the quarter, driven primarily by the timing of concentrate shipments. Our price/mix growth of 10% was driven by two items. Approximately 7 points of pricing split somewhat evenly between normal pricing actions across our markets and intense inflationary pricing in a handful of markets experiencing currency devaluations, and approximately 3 points of mix across the markets, which was primarily driven by stronger growth in several developed markets versus developing and emerging markets. Excluding the impact from intense inflationary pricing, organic revenue growth during the quarter continued to be at the high end of our long-term growth algorithm. Comparable gross margin was up approximately 70 basis points and comparable operating margin was up approximately 100 basis points. Both were driven by underlying expansion and the benefit from butter refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency headwinds. Putting it all together, third quarter comparable EPS of $0.77 was up 5% year-over-year despite higher-than-expected 9% currency headwinds and 2% headwinds from bottler refranchising. During the quarter, we made a $6 billion deposit with the IRS related to our ongoing tax dispute. We've also filed our appeal with the 11th Circuit Court. We're pleased to move forward with the process. We will vigorously defend our position. We believe we will prevail, and we will continue to keep you updated. Free cash flow, excluding the IRS tax litigation deposit, was approximately $7.6 billion, which is down approximately $290 million versus the prior year due to higher other tax payments, higher capital expenditures and cycling some working capital benefits from the prior year. Our balance sheet is strong, and our net debt leverage of 1.7 times EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. If you include our latest estimate of $6.1 billion related to our fairlife contingent consideration payment, which we expect to make in the first half of 2025, our expected net debt leverage would be at the low end of our target range. As James mentioned, our powerful portfolio, amplified by our system's unique capabilities gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our updated 2024 guidance. We now expect organic revenue growth of approximately 10% and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 14% to 15%. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now anticipate an approximate 5-point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 9-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024. We continue to expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus $2.69 in 2023. While it is too early to provide specific guidance on 2025, we do want to share some considerations based on what we know today. We're encouraged by our underlying performance and believe we're well positioned to deliver on our long-term growth opportunity. We expect pricing from intense inflationary markets to moderate in 2025 and recycling the impact of currency devaluations from these markets in 2024. With respect to our commodity environment, we expect prices on industrial materials to remain relatively stable, while agricultural commodities will continue to face volatility and higher prices. We will continue to invest behind our brands as we have been doing, while at the same time we will leverage a range of productivity levers to drive efficiency and effectiveness across our P&L. We expect elevated net interest expense resulting from the deposit made related to the ongoing IRS tax dispute and upcoming fairlife contingent consideration payment. Regarding currency, if we assume current rates on our hedge positions, there would be an approximate low single-digit currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate mid-single-digit currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2025. Many factors could impact both our currency outlook and broader business between now and when we expect to provide guidance in February. With our all-weather strategy, we've delivered comparable earnings growth for many years now. We have numerous levers to continue to do so. So in summary, successfully executing our strategy in an ever-evolving operating environment, we're confident in our ability to deliver on our objectives in 2024 and over the long-term. We're clear on the direction we are heading in the system. And we continue to invest with our bottling partners to drive sustainable long-term growth. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions. Maybe, Chris, if I could touch upon some of the lessons that we've learned, not just this year but really over the last few years. First one I'd say is it's really important through the thick and thin of all of this is to stay very focused on investing the right way behind our brands and that is something we will continue to do. I think, secondly, in the last couple of years, having an even sharper understanding as to where your profit drivers are underneath the global portfolio at the country casualty level and then making sure that we're over-allocating resources to support those larger profit pools both in the base of the business and as we think about growth going forward is really important. And doing that in partnership with our bottlers around the world and we've seen that being a big source of the momentum over the last couple of years. I think the third area that I would highlight and I know it's a topic across many companies going into 2025, is that you can never take your foot off the productivity accelerator. And in that context, I think the learning is that that you've got to build into your overall way of doing business as opposed to have it as an end-of-year project that you need to kind of deliver something in the next six to 12 weeks to save the quarter. So, we've got a lot of levers we've talked about it in the past that are available to us, whether it's through marketing investment line, our operating investment line, operating expense investment line, or through our supply chain. And we will continue to go after the opportunities that come at us. And so when you take all of those together, I think that's what we see creating that flywheel of growth on the top line, and then the ability to sustain and expand margins down through the P&L from there. Sure. Thanks for the question. First of all, it's a huge area of focus and has been. We're currently tracking to have our highest gross margin level since pre-COVID and expect that underlying expansion to continue, notwithstanding, the offsets that you just mentioned. For 2025, as we as we laid out in the script, some of the considerations for 2025 is a more normalized pricing environment. James has touched upon that. We would continue to look to offset the FX headwinds with some underlying expansion through our RGM and cost efficiency efforts. I've highlighted some of the challenges we have on the agricultural commodity front, and we see that being part of just the equation we need to manage. We are, as I said earlier, looking at a number of levers on both the revenue and the cost lines, our ongoing elevation on the RGM front, the optimization of \u2013 on the promotional front within the innovation space, things like simplification of product specs, for example, can free up a lot of dollars. The way we have been working with our very diverse supplier base across the world, not only for certainty of supply, which is a huge priority in a number of markets, but over time to leverage the scale of the system, et cetera. So there's just a lot of opportunity and it's not any one big thing that's going to make or break the numbers. But I think it's our continued ability to bring all of these levers to play that's going to make the difference. And I think that's represented in the consideration set that we framed for 2025."

Today's call is being recorded.[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Robin Halpern, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Halpern, you may now begin.\nRobin Halpern: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We've posted schedules under financial information in the Investors section of our Company website. These reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to this morning to result as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our growth and operating margins. This call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the Company's periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question. Reenter the queue to ask follow-ups. Now, I will turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks Robin, and good morning everyone. After a good start of the year, we continued our momentum in the second quarter. In a world with a wide spectrum of market dynamics, our all-weather strategy is working. We're winning in the marketplace by leveraging our scale and continuing to foster a growth mindset. Given our strong year-to-date results, we are raising both our top-line and our bottom line guidance today. This morning, I'll start by discussing the current operating environment and reviewing our second quarter performance, then I'll explain how we're enhancing our capabilities to drive more effective and efficient operations, including leveraging digital and tech-enabled innovations to ultimately contribute to our earnings growth. Finally, John will discuss our financial results and the raised 2024 guidance. In the second quarter, we grew volume, generated strong organic revenue growth and expanded margins while continuing to invest in our business, we also gained value share. This culminated in 7% comparable earnings per share growth despite 10% currency headwinds and 2% headwinds from bottler refranchising. Overall, our industry remains attractive and is expanding. We believe we're well positioned to capture the vast opportunities available to us. Across the world, we're continuing to navigate many varying market dynamics locally to deliver our global objectives. In Asia Pacific, we had strong performance across most of our footprints. In ASEAN and South Pacific, the refranchising of the Philippines is off to a good start. In the Philippines, we grew volume by double digits and drove strong value share gains by increasing focus on affordable packages, including accessible price points and refillable offerings. Growth across ASEAN and South Pacific was driven by strong end-to-end execution across our sparkling portfolio. Our business in India recovered nicely from a slower start to the year, driven by Sprite and Fanta, as well as strong local brands such as Thumbs Up and Maaza. Strong end-to-end execution across our growth flywheel led to double-digit volume growth. In China, consumer confidence remains subdued. We continue to focus on our core business and invest behind profitable long term growth. Lastly, in Japan and South Korea, we generated volume growth during the quarter and won value share. We successfully relaunched Ayataka, a much loved local tea brand in Japan, and we're also benefiting from stronger execution in e-commerce channels. In EMEA, the external environment remains mixed. In Europe, we saw pressure in our away from home business due to some reduced foot traffic and adverse weather in Western Europe. To capture value, we're investing in several highly anticipated activations, including music festivals, the Euro 2024 Football Championship, and of course, the Paris Olympics. We're increasing our focus on brands with strong momentum across our total beverage portfolio, including Fuze Tea and Powerade, and on promising sparkling innovations such as Coke Lemon and Reformulated Sprite. In Eurasia and Middle east, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty continue to impact our business. We're working closely with our local partners to navigate these headwinds while investing for the longer term. In Africa, despite multiple currency devaluations, strong integrated execution led to robust performance across our markets. For example, in Nigeria, our system quickly responded to the intense inflationary environment by focusing on affordable packages, including accessible price points and refillable offerings, and increasing outlet coverage to win both volume and value share. Across Africa, we grew volume in mid-single digits and similarly won both volume and value share. In North America, we generated robust topline and bottom line growth and one value share. Our volume decline was driven by softness in away from home channels. To offset this, we're partnering with foodservice customers to market food and drink combo meals to drive traffic and beverage incidents. Excluding mainstream packaged water, at-home volumes held up well. Fairlife and Trademark Coke finished number one and number two as the at-home retail sales growth leaders for the industry during the quarter. Our juice business also had a strong quarter and recent innovations including Sprite Chill and Topo Chico Sabores, are off to solid starts. In Latin America, volume momentum continued, led by strength in Mexico and Brazil. Growth was driven across our entire total beverage portfolio. Coca Cola Zero Sugar had a standout quarter with over 20% volume growth, and we're continuing to take integrated execution to the next level by increasing investments behind cold drink equipment to win share of visible inventory and create additional consumer demand. Finally, in global ventures, despite pressures in key markets such as the United Kingdom and China, we generated organic revenue growth and expanded margins. Costa is driving loyalty through targeted promotions like treat drop and innocent gain value share in Europe. Putting it all together, despite an ever changing external environment, our business remains very resilient. The power of our portfolio, amplified by our system's unique capabilities is a clear advantage. While we're delivering on our near term commitments, we're also building capabilities and innovating across our flywheel to become a more agile, effective and efficient organization. Starting with marketing and innovations. Last year, we stood up Studio X, which is our digital and organizational ecosystem that integrates marketing capabilities and connects them to our global network structure. We're producing tailored content at scale and with speed and are able to measure impact in real time. We're also refining our innovation process to prioritize bigger and bolder bets, and we're removing barriers to deliver a more holistic approach, shorten the time to launch and improve success rates. We know that innovations that grow in the second year have a much greater odds for multiyear success and deliver far greater impact. So we focused on sustaining investment and have consistently improved second year performance success rates in each of the past four years. Continued innovation successes include Sprite and Fanta reformulations, Fuze Tea in Europe and Minute Maid Zero Sugar in North America, among many others. As a result of these combined initiatives, we have greatly improved our ability to rapidly produce and deliver marketing content, integrate activations with timely innovations and scale successes to drive the greatest impact. One example from the second quarter, Coca-Cola's partnership with Marvel, which featured nearly 40 different limited edition collectible graphics and QR codes on our packaging to connect consumers with unique augmented reality experiences. We collaborated closely with Marvel Studios and the Walt Disney Company and tapped into the best-in-class animation and activation to quickly scale to over 50 markets. As a result of this and other growth initiatives, Trademark Coca-Cola grew volume and won volume and value share during the quarter. Our marketing and innovation transformation journey contributed to Trademark Coke winning creative brand of the year for the first time ever at the Cannes Lions in June. We won 18 different awards at Cannes Lions. Beyond marketing and innovation, we're flexing our muscle in revenue growth management and integrated execution to sustain competitive advantage. Even in markets with very well developed capabilities, there's potential to be even better. For example, Mexico is one of the markets at the forefront of revenue growth management, and has the highest cold drink equipment density in the world. During the quarter, we drove affordability with refillables and premiumization with single-serve transactions. Our system also added over 80,000 coolers year-to-date. Through these and similar initiatives, we grew volume mid-single digits during the quarter, continuing the momentum from the past few quarters. Each day, consumers enjoy approximately 2.2 billion servings of our products translating into about 800 billion servings annually. This kind of scale gives us unique insights into the consumer, which helps us to better tailor offerings. Emerging technologies, including those enhanced by AI, have the potential to create value for retailers and consumers. For example, we're piloting an AI-based price pack channel optimization tool, across several markets that evaluates opportunities, to better tailor solutions to drive incremental volume and revenue. Early results show that the tool helps improve both our offerings, and speed to market. Our system is also piloting an AI-driven initiative to push personalized messages, to retailers with suggested items based on previous orders and market data. Initial pilots indicate that retailers who receive the messages, are over 30% more likely to purchase recommended SKUs, which results in incremental sales for our retailers and the system. We're just scratching the surface of what's possible, and we're taking steps to seize opportunities down the road. To sum it all, while we recognize there's still much work to be done, to capture the vast opportunities available; we're encouraged by our year-to-date results and efforts to improve, every aspect of how we do business. As we look forward to the second half of the year, the external backdrop remains uncertain, including some signs of pressure in various consumer segments across developed markets. However, thanks to the power of our portfolio, and the unwavering dedication of our system employees, we are confident we will deliver on our updated 2024 guidance and longer-term commitments. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we delivered strong results. We grew organic revenues 15%. This consisted of 2% unit case growth. Concentrate sales were ahead of volume by four points, driven primarily by timing of concentrate shipments, and some disruptions in the global supply chain that we partly expect, to reverse next quarter. Our price/mix growth of 9% in the quarter was primarily driven by two items: one, approximately five points of intense inflationary pricing, across a handful of markets to offset significant currency devaluation. And two, an array of pricing and mix actions across our markets. Excluding the impacts from concentrate shipment timing and pricing from markets with intense inflation. Organic revenue growth during the quarter was at the high end of our long-term growth algorithm. Comparable gross margin was up approximately 200 basis points, driven by underlying expansion, and the benefit from bottler refranchising partially offset by currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 120 basis points. Comparable operating margin expansion was less than comparable gross margin expansion, due to less benefit from bottler refranchising and greater currency headwinds to comparable operating margin. Putting it all together, second quarter comparable EPS of $0.84 was up 7% year-over-year despite 10% currency headwinds and 2% headwind from bottler refranchising. Free cash flow was approximately $3.3 billion, down approximately $700 million versus the prior year, due to higher tax payments, cycling working capital benefits from the prior year and higher capital expenditures. We continue to take actions, to achieve a fit for purpose balance sheet that, will best support our growth agenda. During the quarter, we raised approximately $4 billion in cash by issuing long-term debt for general corporate purposes. This may include pre-funding upcoming payments related to the IRS tax case and the Fairlife contingent consideration. With respect to our IRS tax case, which we continue to vigorously defend. We're making progress to our next steps, and we expect we will be able to move forward an appeal by the end of the year. Given the continued outperformance of Fairlife, we recorded a charge of $1.3 billion during the quarter. Our estimated final payment related to this acquisition is $5.3 billion, which will be made in 2025. We are encouraged by Fairlife's performance and the value it has created for our company. So far this year, we've realized nearly $3 billion in gross proceeds from bottler refranchising and streamlining our equity investments. We'll continue to prioritize higher growth businesses, and take passive capital off the table. Return on invested capital is 24%, up approximately five points from three years ago. Our balance sheet is strong, as demonstrated by our net debt leverage of 1.5 times EBITDA, which is well below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times. We have ample capacity to pursue our capital allocation agenda, which prioritizes investing to drive further growth, continuing to support our dividend and staying dynamic, agile and opportunistic. As James mentioned, we're proactively managing our portfolio to deliver on our commitments. Our updated 2024 guidance reflects the momentum of our business in the first half of the year, and our confidence in our ability to execute on our plans during the second half of this year. We now expect organic revenue growth of 9% to 10%, and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 13% to 15%. Bottler refranchising is still expected to be a four to five-point headwind, to comparable net revenues. And we now expect a one to two-point headwind, to comparable earnings per share. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now anticipate an approximate five to six-point currency headwind, to comparable net revenues and an approximate eight to nine-point currency headwind, to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024. This increase in currency headwind is driven by a small number of intensive treasury markets, while the rest of the currency basket is relatively neutral to our results. All in, we now expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus $2.69 in 2023. There are some considerations to keep in mind. We expect unit cases and concentrate shipments to be relatively in line with each other for the full year 2024. Please keep in mind there are two extra days in the fourth quarter. Taking everything into consideration, we expect earnings growth during the remainder of 2024, will be weighted towards the fourth quarter. To summarize, we're encouraged by our track record and the underlying momentum of our business. Our system remains incredibly focused and motivated to drive growth. We're continuing to drive quality top line growth, expand margins, grow comparable earnings per share and improve the return profile of our business. And we're confident we will deliver on our guidance, and longer-term objectives. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hi, good morning. It'd be helpful to get an update on North America, given questions around consumer spending. Can you just discuss any demand impact you're seeing on your business, any variance in channel performance and how that informs your view going forward? And then also as we transition to a more normalized cost environment, can you give us any perspective on what's a more sustained price mix run rate going forward in North America? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. No problem, Dara. Firstly, overall, it'd be fair to say that the consumer sentiment in aggregate is actually pretty strong, pretty resilient. Within that, there are some softer spots, particularly, I think, which has been relatively put out there already some softness in away-from-home channels, with a little lower traffic and some increase in value seeking for combo meals. So definitely, there's a piece of the lower income consumers, which are either going out slightly less. But when they do go somewhere looking for greater value through combo meals. And then, of course, in the at-home channels, there's a slightly greater focus by those consumers on getting kind of value deals or promo deals. Having said that, there are just as much consumers spending on more premium categories or more premium price points and experiences. So that's all aggregating out at a sort of resilience, for the average overall consumer. Within that, I think we've done very well. We've seen strong growth across the portfolio. We saw a strong growth in Coke trademark in Fairlife, in Topo Chico and juices itself and in aggregate, we won value share in the quarter. So broad-based growth, some hotspots in terms of demand up demand down. But overall resilience for the consumer. And as you look out, the first thing that I think is worth underlining in North America, in particular, is the nature of the price mix. Remember that our North American business, a typically compared to the other parts of the world, we consolidate a set of vertically integrated businesses and a set of franchise kind of concentrate businesses, such that the growth of a channel or a category can produce a mix effect independent of pricing in the marketplace. As you look at the 11 points of price mix in the second quarter in North America, it's important to understand that, only half of that is actually price. The other half is mix. So when the juice drinks and Fairlife and the juice business grows, Topo Chico grows and Dasani is weaker, you get a mechanical business mix effect that, makes the price mix look like it's gone up, but it hasn't really in the marketplace. So think of it as half of it is business mix, and half of it is real pricing in the marketplace, which gets you to a much more logical match, to the level of inflation that's going out - going on in the marketplace in general, such that I think in North America and actually overall in general, around the world, excluding the high - the intense inflation markets John mentioned in the comments. We see that inflation is largely coming into the landing zone, yes, central banks would like to squeeze out another point or so. But generally, we're getting there, and I think that's reflected in our price mix. We still have input costs that are going up, typically, the agricultural ones rather than the metal, or commodity-based ones. But in the end, our strategy remains yes, there'll be cost inflation, yes, we'll look to put it through. Yes, we'll work on productivity. But any pricing we're going to take, we're going to have to earn with the marketing and the innovation and the execution. But it is, as I said earlier, approaching the normalization zone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks so much. I'd love to have a similar conversation about Western Europe because James, you mentioned a bit on some -- also slowness in away from home. But the summer sports kind of has already kicked off, June was certainly part of it. And so the weather has been challenging, but maybe a little surprising to see the softness in the unit case volume in EMEA. So I'd love some - just a similar run through as you just did in North America on some of the dynamics, particularly in Western Europe? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. So let me first just separate Europe from EMEA, which obviously includes the Middle East and Africa. Africa had a strong second quarter. Volume - good volume growth, building on good volume growth. In the first quarter, price mix. Obviously, there's a lot of swings and roundabouts macro-economically going on in Africa, but actually net-net, the Africa business had a really good quarter, winning volume and value share, managing through the inflation and growth on -- good volume growth and good price growth. The flip side is Middle East. Obviously, the conflict is continuing to affect the business in that part of the world. So there's some headwinds there. And then, if you come to Europe within EMEA, Europe was overall not where we'd like it to be. We'd like to see a little more growth coming out of the European business. And really, it's a complete mix across the countries in Europe. There's more pressure on the away from home in the West than the East. Yes, some of the sporting programs have certainly help, whether it was UEFA that's already happened or Olympics, which is imminently going to start. The sporting has helped, but there's been some pressure on the away from home, as I said in the West, and so the immediate consumption packs have been growing slower there. But the strong programs, but not yet enough to offset the weather in some of the countries, and the same general effect as the U.S. in terms of the lower income consumers seeking a value, and doing less away from home trips. So big picture, Europe, not too dissimilar from the U.S., perhaps a little worse weather and a little more sporting events, but in an aggregate sense, very similar.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBryan Spillane: Hi. Thanks operator. Good morning everyone. John, just a question for you, two points maybe related to the concentrate shipments. One is, I don't think you've talked about expecting that, they'll line up by the end of the year. But I guess, can you talk a little bit about what's driving this? How much of it is the Red Sea and I don't know, just its maybe more difficult to get stuff around versus, just kind of the regular timing differences. And I guess what's underneath this is, should we expect a little bit more volatility in the near term, just around shipments versus units just simply, because the world's a little bit unsettled right now. And the second, if you can just give us a perspective on how much margin gross margin benefited, from the excess shipments in the quarter? Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Okay. Thanks, Bryan. So on the first question, yes, we had number of events during the quarter that affected that relationship between unit cases and concentrate. You mentioned a couple of them, the ingestion and the Red Sea and Singapore - in LatAm, we had some restocking in the wake of the floods in Brazil, and in our India operations. We had some stocking up to anticipate some future demand. So a range of factors, none of them with a threat - a common threat to them. Our guidance assumes a more normal second half of the year. But as you rightly highlighted, there is likely to be something ahead of us that, we have not anticipated. And if that were to happen, we'd certainly we certainly advise. But our goal is over the longer haul, is to continue to have cases and gallons in line. And with regards to the gross margin impact, there's a slight benefit on both the gross and operating margins related to the stocking, but it's in the tens of basis points and again, reflected in our guidance a year ago, with that leveling out that we expect.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBonnie Herzog: All right, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I did want to ask a little bit more about your away-from-home business, James, which you did touch on. I guess I was hoping to hear how much your business in this channel decelerated in Q2 versus Q1 and what your outlook is for the remainder of the year? And then assuming growth in the channel moderates further, how do we think about the impact this may have on your top line and margins? And maybe just touch on any initiatives you've implemented to accelerate growth in this channel moving forward. I think that would be helpful? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. Thanks, Bonnie. I don't think it would be worth saying as a big deceleration going on as we come into the second quarter from the first quarter. If you just stand back a bit and look at what happened, and I think we were already calling out some softness in away from home, in the back end of last year. And so, I would characterize it more as there's been a slow build, from the back half of last year through the first and the second quarter. First and second quarter may be a little more negative than the back half of last year. But really, it's been a kind of a slow softening rather than anything major and abrupt and it's not like accelerating off a cliff. It's kind of a slow softening it's kind of just running at a softness level when thinking about away from home in the U.S. And then in terms of what we're doing about it, which is obviously the key question, is we've really got - being more focused. On how can we make sure that we bring to bear in the away-from-home channels in a sense, all the thinking that we have historically done on affordability, and price pack architecture in some of the mom-and-pop and line at home channels, to make sure working with our partners across the different channels that we can provide, whether it's the meal combos, or whatever format of offerings. So that there's a laddering of pricing to allow people to stay within the category and the channel. And so, those are rolling out as we speak. We expect to see them making an impact in the years to go.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nStephen Powers: Thank you and good morning. Maybe, John, just to maybe put a wrap around the margin driver conversation and the impact of mix and concentrate timing, et cetera. Year-to-date, the underlying margin performance, both in the quarter and year-to-date, I guess, has been strong. As I'm penciling it outright, I don't - doesn't feel like you're expecting a material difference in the underlying margin performance of the business in the back half despite the slower concentrate sales and some of the macro drivers going, to play that back and confirm that? And if there are any material differences, maybe you could just help us as to what are the other drivers?\nJohn Murphy: Sure, Steve, thanks. So on gross margin, just to maybe highlight the big drivers typically our underlying performance any structural changes we have in the quarter, most of which nowadays as relates to our refranchising activity and then had a currency impact. So year-to-date, we're reflecting almost 200 basis points of increase. And that's primarily driven by structural and underlying with some offset on currency. And for the second half of the year, typically, the margin profile in the second half of the year is slightly lower than the first half. But I would say the overall trends in the second half of the year will be similar, to what we've seen in the first half. And maybe just to step it down on one - down to the operating margin line, not dissimilar. We have had more benefit on the underlying margin in the first half of the year than on structural. And then the second half of the year, I expect it to be more even. And yet, as we've discussed in prior calls, we sort of reserve the right to stay flexible in the event that we make investment decisions that linked to what's happening in our many markets around the world. But overall direction of travel on both the gross and operating line is our margin profile to be strengthening and to be pretty much in line with some of the previous conversations we've had on this topic.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nFilippo Falorni: Hi, good morning everyone. I wanted to ask about the Latin America business. It continues to be a very strong driver of your total company growth with very strong unit case volume. Still very strong price mix. There was obviously some temporary impact with the flooding in Brazil. But just curious a, what is working well? I know your baller relationship have improved significantly over the last couple of years. And also just a general sense of how the consumer is behaving in your key markets, Brazil, Mexico and some of the other countries.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Sure, Filippo. Yes. Latin America had another strong result in the quarter, sustained the volume momentum, as you mentioned, clearly being driven from Mexico and Brazil. It's a pretty broad-based category success story, including not just Coke trademark, but now Coke Zero at 20% volume growth. Obviously, part of this is a long-term capability and momentum building approach with our bottlers in Latin America, really bringing together all of the components of the strategy that we talk about, whether it be the marketing transformation, the focus on innovation, the execution of price packaging in the marketplace, particularly in markets like Latin America, making sure we both have premiumization and opportunities. But also critically important affordability options, whether that be with regular packaging or returnable packaging, but really making sure we have ways of keeping people in the franchise and all executed by the bottling system which has really doubled down, not just on traditional execution, and putting more cool doors out there, but the digitization of their relationships with the retailers. So really, representation of what is possible when all the elements of the strategy of the system are executed in the marketplace. I think it's worth noting that, obviously, yes, strong volume performance of 5%. Please do take in mind that the price mix is heavily affected by the Argentinian high inflation and two-thirds of the price mix is actually, due to Argentina. So that leaves you about roughly 6% for normal inverted e-commerce pricing for the rest of the countries. Nevertheless, a very strong result. In Latin America, very pleasing and looking forward to seeing that continue into the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask a question on just balance sheet cash flow, specifically around Fairlife. Clearly, it's a positive development that Fairlife continues to do so well. The liability does, however, continue to grow. John, can you just maybe comment on what you can do, to perhaps limit the negative impact from raising additional capital to cover fair life, to cover the escrow payment, and specifically from a cash flow perspective in the next 12 to 18 months. And perhaps just an overall view, on how you see net interest expense versus income trending as you have some of these major payments ahead? Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Sure, Chris, thank you. Well, firstly is we're very pleased with the performance of Fairlife, and the end is in sight relative to the overall construct of the deal we have in place there. With regard to the broader free cash flow conversation, yes the sources we have are cash from operations. And in the short-term, as we continue to re-franchise some of our businesses from the proceeds that come in from that. During the second quarter, we also went into the debt market and we issued some long-term debt. And so, it's really a combination of those three that we are managing very closely, to deal with the end of this year and into 2025, on the outflows that we see. Balance sheet remains strong. We go into 2025 with a clear line of sight as to what needs to be taken care of. And yet, as we have discussed on many occasions, relative to our overall capital allocation strategy. We will continue to invest in the business as appropriate, to support the dividend file. We take care of the Fairlife acquisition and the tax payment that is, is on the horizon with relative to the IRS tax case. So all in all, it's going to be an interesting 18 months to work through. But we feel very confident that the work we've done today prepares us well to manage through it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, good morning. So James, on the price mix in North America, you mentioned about half of the 11.3 in my mix and the other pretty much pricing, but still quite driven by innovation. Can you talk about the cadence of what you expect moving ahead? Of course, you've done amazing well in the team there in terms of the marketing campaigns, and marketing and around packaging and all of that RGM playbook that you have. The booking ahead, is there any additional gains you expect, and how we should be thinking? I guess, broadly, even not only in North America, but also in Brazil and Mexico, how to think of additional gains in there and as well as in India? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure, I mean, absolutely, we're going to continue to press ahead with the marketing, with the innovation, with the price factor, with the execution. That's the way we earn the right to take a reasonable level of pricing. Clearly, some of the inflationary effects and some of the mix effects, are likely to become more subdued as we go into the back half of the years. So I'm not expecting, for example in North America, half of it is from mix and half of it is from core pricing. I think the mixed piece will start to train down over time and in part it does so, because it starts cycling itself. And so I think it's, the key for me is to look through the kind of the mix and the inflation effects and thinking about core pricing. And if you do that as an overall company level and look at the second quarter in its totality. Again there's, as I said, a big piece of it was inflation. You take it out and you're at the 4-ish percent in core pricing, offer 2% volume. There you are right in the sweet spot of the top end of the algorithm that, we've been looking to deliver on. So I think, the kind of the central assumption is a kind of landing zone for these effects like inflation and mix and starting to see more of the price mix being the core actions across the strategy flywheels driving the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi, you delivered 2% case volume growth, and we look across sort of the rest of staples. We're seeing quite a bit of slowdown in volumes. I think you're positive everywhere with the exception maybe of North America. Can you maybe just talk a bit more as you provided your operating environment views, but also AI innovation, new sports, sporting events, these types of things. What should we be looking at over the medium term in terms of volume growth?\nJames Quincey: Yes, so we as from a strategy perspective, have taken the approach over the last number of years, it cannot say even longer, that it's critically important, particularly when times get tougher to try and keep as many consumers in the franchise as possible, rather than trying to re-recruit them at some later stage. And they're in our focus not just on marketing innovation, but affordability within the price pack architecture. So clearly an objective of ours is not to see negative volumes, and to make sure we keep people in and use all the elements to do that. And so, as you say, we've got 2%. In the corridor, we've got - we've had a run right there. We've talked in the past, it remains true today that the central long-term growth algorithm, we're looking for a revenue of 4% to 6%, and we've set ourselves the ambition of staying in the 5% to 6% range, with a balance of volume and price mix. So that's essentially a way of, you know, if you've split that you're saying 2% to 3% in volume and 2% to 3% in price. We were kind of in that range in the quarter with the 2% volume. So I think in the long run, we'll continue to pursue that. Talked earlier this year that, in the shorter term, it's likely to be slightly more price and slightly less volume, which was kind of exactly what happened in the second quarter. So it would not surprise me, as we go through the rest of the year that that remains true, that we see slightly less volume than the kind of standard algorithm, and slightly more price - as pricing tends towards, inflation tends towards the landing zone. And I think that's likely to be true as we go through - the rest of the summer, hopefully the weather gets a bit better. But we're likely to see that slightly less volume, slightly more price. And probably a repetition of where that volume's coming from in terms of the rest of the year, the positives largely being the developing economies, Latin America, India, Africa, Southeast Asia, and to some extent Japan, and the kind of weighing on it a little, the kind of parts of North America and Europe channel and income specific and some of the disruptions from the Middle East. But net-net, we think we've got a strong strategy that's playing out and is winning. And we're confident that we can drive that to get the balanced algorithm of growth, through the rest of this year, for our guidance and into the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRob Ottenstein: Great, thank you very much. I'd like to go back to North America, but look at it more on a category basis [technical difficulty] that I can think of sparkling is doing better than energy as a sector. I'd love to get your thoughts on maybe what the drivers are there. Second, sports strengths, how your new strategy is working, combining Powerade and BODYARMOR under one management team. And then third, any other particular things that you're seeing on the category side that are worth noting? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure Robert. So definitely North America had a good second quarter. The standouts in terms of growth, clearly, actually what's interesting is actually if you look at the Nielsen Universe, and you look at which two trademarks provided most dollar retail growth in Q2, and the answer is Fairlife and Coca-Cola. And so, in a way, you can see that as a sort of microcosm for the overall strategy working. You've got broad ends of the portfolio working and it's being executed in the marketplace and driving really substantial growth. So good performance by Fairlife, good performance by the overall Coca-Cola with growth obviously being led by Coca-Cola Zero. In the sports category, getting better. We had some positive volume growth in BODYARMOR and Powerade. And we're really starting to see, the kind of stabilization with the marketing and the innovation, and some packed price work going on there. We're not yet gaining all the share we want again, but we've stabilized and starting to turn the corner with some of those innovations on Zero and Flash I.V. and Powerade power. So a good kind of step forward and turning the corner and clearly looking to do better. I'm not sure there's much more to say, great quarter and long may at last.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPeter Grom: Thanks operator and good morning. I guess I just wanted to follow-up on Robert's questions specifically on energy drinks Sprite. I mean, it's one of the few categories where we've seen a pretty notable change here. So, do you have any perspective James on what maybe driving the weaker performance. And then as you look ahead, would you anticipate maybe some of this pressure to be short-lived? Is there something you're seeing that would suggest this weakness can persist through the balance of the year and into maybe '25? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Well I think therefore. You need to kind of break it up a bit. I mean firstly look, we've had a great partnership with Monster, created tremendous value for Monster for us Coca-Cola and for the bottling partners. Clearly in the case of the U.S., there's been what happens in every category when people create a category, and there's one or two brands. People look for the white spaces and start to innovate, and start to bring new news to the category. I think that's what's happening in energy, particularly in the US. And so, I think working with Monster that will respond to the evolution of the way, the consumers looking at the category. I think it's also important to understand that the energy category, is one of the categories that responds to an overall consumer needs state, of being fueled for their lives. And so, from a company point of view, we see that as something where we bring multiple brands, to bear against that needs state. And each brand in each category needs to play its part in kind of delivering on that. Each one has to do their own work to do it. But I think there's more to be done across the board, including in the Monster energy portfolio. We're working with them on that. And then I think internationally, there's robust growth in the energy category and making good progress around the world in different ways and different forms. So I think, one has to kind of pull apart energy category and look at it kind of geographically, to see that overall it's still got some good growth, and there's different jobs to be done in different parts of the world.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charlie Higgs from Redburn. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nCharlie Higgs: Hi James, John. Hope you're both well. I've got a question on Asia Pacific. The performance in Q2, please. Where volumes are up 3% and price mixed is down 3%. Can you maybe just talk a bit more about the volumes up 3%, and specifically how China performed, and what you're seeing on the ground there in China in Q2. And then the price mix down 3%, is that purely just negative geographic mix from India and Philippines, also in Japan, or was there negative pricing within that? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. I'll take it in reverse order, Charlie. Yes, the negative pricing is more than driven by the mix effect. So core pricing is positive if you went operating unit-by-operating unit, but overall Asia price mix is negative, because of the way the mathematics of the thing works. But the central answer there is it's more than just geography mix. Geography mix is consuming core pricing and taking it down to minus 3%. Then if I go back to the performance of the different operating units, clearly the big swing in Asia-Pacific is driven by the bounce back of India. You'll remember that in the first quarter, India had a soft first quarter. The second quarter was very strong. And so that produces obviously a big swing in the results. So India had a good double-digit growth of volume in the second quarter. Still very bullish on India. Still very realistic in terms of it won't be a straight line into the future, but they certainly had a good quarter in the second quarter. We also saw good volume growth across Southeast Asia, including also volume growth across Japan and South Korea. Volumes were negative in the China operating unit. There's two parts to this story. The first is, yes, there's a general macro softness as the overall economy works through some of the structural issues around real estate, pricing, et cetera, et cetera. But within the things that we control, we have essentially been prioritizing and restructuring where we invest across the category portfolio. And focusing more on sparkling and juice drinks and teas. And deprioritizing what is essentially case-packed water, where we - don't make money in China. So the overall volumes were negative in China, but that's entirely driven by the de-prioritization of the water. And actually, I think the sparkling volume was slightly positive in China for the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Question for John, please, just kind of building on some of the questions earlier on cash flow. Can we get an update, please, on timing of potential bottler re-franchising? I think it's probably largely a question on CCBA, and understanding that market conditions may potentially dictate. But can you help us how you're currently thinking about potential timing there? And then as you're thinking about value creation for shareholders, how much does EPS solution come into that? We hear that from shareholders sometimes, if at all, as you're thinking about moving forward with that? Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: So regarding the timing, we're not giving out dates as to when we expect the refranchising process to finish, we're staying very thoughtful, disciplined in recruiting new partners in the areas that are still outstanding. And so, there's good work underway, but no imminent decisions and we'll advise as that work bear fruition. But I think the overall message is, we continue to be very clear internally on the path forward. And we'll expect over the couple of years to have the both of the refranchising, John, if not all of us. With regard to the impact on EPS dilution, it's a mechanical effect that comes from the broader strategic decisions that, we've - that we believe are right for the Coca-Cola Company, and over time for the Coca-Cola system. The refranchising work that started back in the mid-teens is demonstrating time and again that the overall system benefits, when there's a step change in overall performance. And with that step change, we benefit over the longer haul to - as you've seen this year, there is a mechanical impact on the EPS line. But longer term, we think that the broader value proposition of the Coca-Cola Company is staying very focused on what we do best, and having a balance sheet then that's designed to support what we do best, working in partnership with great partners around the world, is the recipe for us to ease and exceed our long-term growth model.\nOperator: Our last question today will come from Robert Moskow from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks for the question Maybe I missed it, but did you make any commentary about your intentions on marketing investment for the year, whether anything has changed since the start of the year. I think you talked about maybe some surgical efforts in certain markets in certain categories. But can I assume that there's no signal here that, needs to be incremental investment to improve volume?\nJames Quincey: Let me attack the answer in a different way. Our bias is to lean in and invest where we see opportunities. And to the extent that we continue to see opportunities, we continue to invest. And if we see more opportunity, we'll invest more. And the contrary is also true. If we see softness that doesn't warrant certain level of investment, then we will look to pull back. Having said that, there's nothing particularly in the guidance that's trying to tell you, is changing radically in one direction or the other. Yes, we continue to see the need for marketing pressure. It's not a fixed sum that, is not subject to inflation. But there's nothing in the guidance that's trying to tell you something radically different. It's very much we continue to invest and drive the top line, and we see the two marching together. Okay. Thanks, Robert. That was the last question. So to summarize, we're building a culture that emphasizes improving every aspect of how we do business. We have lots of opportunities in front of us. We think we're well positioned to capture these opportunities, and we're confident that we will successfully execute our strategy and create value for - our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest. Your investment in our company and for joining us this morning. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

            "name": "James Quincey",
            "content": "Thanks Robin, and good morning everyone. After a good start of the year, we continued our momentum in the second quarter. In a world with a wide spectrum of market dynamics, our all-weather strategy is working. We're winning in the marketplace by leveraging our scale and continuing to foster a growth mindset. Given our strong year-to-date results, we are raising both our top-line and our bottom line guidance today. This morning, I'll start by discussing the current operating environment and reviewing our second quarter performance, then I'll explain how we're enhancing our capabilities to drive more effective and efficient operations, including leveraging digital and tech-enabled innovations to ultimately contribute to our earnings growth. Finally, John will discuss our financial results and the raised 2024 guidance. In the second quarter, we grew volume, generated strong organic revenue growth and expanded margins while continuing to invest in our business, we also gained value share. This culminated in 7% comparable earnings per share growth despite 10% currency headwinds and 2% headwinds from bottler refranchising. Overall, our industry remains attractive and is expanding. We believe we're well positioned to capture the vast opportunities available to us. Across the world, we're continuing to navigate many varying market dynamics locally to deliver our global objectives. In Asia Pacific, we had strong performance across most of our footprints. In ASEAN and South Pacific, the refranchising of the Philippines is off to a good start. In the Philippines, we grew volume by double digits and drove strong value share gains by increasing focus on affordable packages, including accessible price points and refillable offerings. Growth across ASEAN and South Pacific was driven by strong end-to-end execution across our sparkling portfolio. Our business in India recovered nicely from a slower start to the year, driven by Sprite and Fanta, as well as strong local brands such as Thumbs Up and Maaza. Strong end-to-end execution across our growth flywheel led to double-digit volume growth. In China, consumer confidence remains subdued. We continue to focus on our core business and invest behind profitable long term growth. Lastly, in Japan and South Korea, we generated volume growth during the quarter and won value share. We successfully relaunched Ayataka, a much loved local tea brand in Japan, and we're also benefiting from stronger execution in e-commerce channels. In EMEA, the external environment remains mixed. In Europe, we saw pressure in our away from home business due to some reduced foot traffic and adverse weather in Western Europe. To capture value, we're investing in several highly anticipated activations, including music festivals, the Euro 2024 Football Championship, and of course, the Paris Olympics. We're increasing our focus on brands with strong momentum across our total beverage portfolio, including Fuze Tea and Powerade, and on promising sparkling innovations such as Coke Lemon and Reformulated Sprite. In Eurasia and Middle east, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty continue to impact our business. We're working closely with our local partners to navigate these headwinds while investing for the longer term. In Africa, despite multiple currency devaluations, strong integrated execution led to robust performance across our markets. For example, in Nigeria, our system quickly responded to the intense inflationary environment by focusing on affordable packages, including accessible price points and refillable offerings, and increasing outlet coverage to win both volume and value share. Across Africa, we grew volume in mid-single digits and similarly won both volume and value share. In North America, we generated robust topline and bottom line growth and one value share. Our volume decline was driven by softness in away from home channels. To offset this, we're partnering with foodservice customers to market food and drink combo meals to drive traffic and beverage incidents. Excluding mainstream packaged water, at-home volumes held up well. Fairlife and Trademark Coke finished number one and number two as the at-home retail sales growth leaders for the industry during the quarter. Our juice business also had a strong quarter and recent innovations including Sprite Chill and Topo Chico Sabores, are off to solid starts. In Latin America, volume momentum continued, led by strength in Mexico and Brazil. Growth was driven across our entire total beverage portfolio. Coca Cola Zero Sugar had a standout quarter with over 20% volume growth, and we're continuing to take integrated execution to the next level by increasing investments behind cold drink equipment to win share of visible inventory and create additional consumer demand. Finally, in global ventures, despite pressures in key markets such as the United Kingdom and China, we generated organic revenue growth and expanded margins. Costa is driving loyalty through targeted promotions like treat drop and innocent gain value share in Europe. Putting it all together, despite an ever changing external environment, our business remains very resilient. The power of our portfolio, amplified by our system's unique capabilities is a clear advantage. While we're delivering on our near term commitments, we're also building capabilities and innovating across our flywheel to become a more agile, effective and efficient organization. Starting with marketing and innovations. Last year, we stood up Studio X, which is our digital and organizational ecosystem that integrates marketing capabilities and connects them to our global network structure. We're producing tailored content at scale and with speed and are able to measure impact in real time. We're also refining our innovation process to prioritize bigger and bolder bets, and we're removing barriers to deliver a more holistic approach, shorten the time to launch and improve success rates. We know that innovations that grow in the second year have a much greater odds for multiyear success and deliver far greater impact. So we focused on sustaining investment and have consistently improved second year performance success rates in each of the past four years. Continued innovation successes include Sprite and Fanta reformulations, Fuze Tea in Europe and Minute Maid Zero Sugar in North America, among many others. As a result of these combined initiatives, we have greatly improved our ability to rapidly produce and deliver marketing content, integrate activations with timely innovations and scale successes to drive the greatest impact. One example from the second quarter, Coca-Cola's partnership with Marvel, which featured nearly 40 different limited edition collectible graphics and QR codes on our packaging to connect consumers with unique augmented reality experiences. We collaborated closely with Marvel Studios and the Walt Disney Company and tapped into the best-in-class animation and activation to quickly scale to over 50 markets. As a result of this and other growth initiatives, Trademark Coca-Cola grew volume and won volume and value share during the quarter. Our marketing and innovation transformation journey contributed to Trademark Coke winning creative brand of the year for the first time ever at the Cannes Lions in June. We won 18 different awards at Cannes Lions. Beyond marketing and innovation, we're flexing our muscle in revenue growth management and integrated execution to sustain competitive advantage. Even in markets with very well developed capabilities, there's potential to be even better. For example, Mexico is one of the markets at the forefront of revenue growth management, and has the highest cold drink equipment density in the world. During the quarter, we drove affordability with refillables and premiumization with single-serve transactions. Our system also added over 80,000 coolers year-to-date. Through these and similar initiatives, we grew volume mid-single digits during the quarter, continuing the momentum from the past few quarters. Each day, consumers enjoy approximately 2.2 billion servings of our products translating into about 800 billion servings annually. This kind of scale gives us unique insights into the consumer, which helps us to better tailor offerings. Emerging technologies, including those enhanced by AI, have the potential to create value for retailers and consumers. For example, we're piloting an AI-based price pack channel optimization tool, across several markets that evaluates opportunities, to better tailor solutions to drive incremental volume and revenue. Early results show that the tool helps improve both our offerings, and speed to market. Our system is also piloting an AI-driven initiative to push personalized messages, to retailers with suggested items based on previous orders and market data. Initial pilots indicate that retailers who receive the messages, are over 30% more likely to purchase recommended SKUs, which results in incremental sales for our retailers and the system. We're just scratching the surface of what's possible, and we're taking steps to seize opportunities down the road. To sum it all, while we recognize there's still much work to be done, to capture the vast opportunities available; we're encouraged by our year-to-date results and efforts to improve, every aspect of how we do business. As we look forward to the second half of the year, the external backdrop remains uncertain, including some signs of pressure in various consumer segments across developed markets. However, thanks to the power of our portfolio, and the unwavering dedication of our system employees, we are confident we will deliver on our updated 2024 guidance and longer-term commitments. With that, I'll turn the call over to John. Yes, sure. No problem, Dara. Firstly, overall, it'd be fair to say that the consumer sentiment in aggregate is actually pretty strong, pretty resilient. Within that, there are some softer spots, particularly, I think, which has been relatively put out there already some softness in away-from-home channels, with a little lower traffic and some increase in value seeking for combo meals. So definitely, there's a piece of the lower income consumers, which are either going out slightly less. But when they do go somewhere looking for greater value through combo meals. And then, of course, in the at-home channels, there's a slightly greater focus by those consumers on getting kind of value deals or promo deals. Having said that, there are just as much consumers spending on more premium categories or more premium price points and experiences. So that's all aggregating out at a sort of resilience, for the average overall consumer. Within that, I think we've done very well. We've seen strong growth across the portfolio. We saw a strong growth in Coke trademark in Fairlife, in Topo Chico and juices itself and in aggregate, we won value share in the quarter. So broad-based growth, some hotspots in terms of demand up demand down. But overall resilience for the consumer. And as you look out, the first thing that I think is worth underlining in North America, in particular, is the nature of the price mix. Remember that our North American business, a typically compared to the other parts of the world, we consolidate a set of vertically integrated businesses and a set of franchise kind of concentrate businesses, such that the growth of a channel or a category can produce a mix effect independent of pricing in the marketplace. As you look at the 11 points of price mix in the second quarter in North America, it's important to understand that, only half of that is actually price. The other half is mix. So when the juice drinks and Fairlife and the juice business grows, Topo Chico grows and Dasani is weaker, you get a mechanical business mix effect that, makes the price mix look like it's gone up, but it hasn't really in the marketplace. So think of it as half of it is business mix, and half of it is real pricing in the marketplace, which gets you to a much more logical match, to the level of inflation that's going out - going on in the marketplace in general, such that I think in North America and actually overall in general, around the world, excluding the high - the intense inflation markets John mentioned in the comments. We see that inflation is largely coming into the landing zone, yes, central banks would like to squeeze out another point or so. But generally, we're getting there, and I think that's reflected in our price mix. We still have input costs that are going up, typically, the agricultural ones rather than the metal, or commodity-based ones. But in the end, our strategy remains yes, there'll be cost inflation, yes, we'll look to put it through. Yes, we'll work on productivity. But any pricing we're going to take, we're going to have to earn with the marketing and the innovation and the execution. But it is, as I said earlier, approaching the normalization zone. Yes, sure. So let me first just separate Europe from EMEA, which obviously includes the Middle East and Africa. Africa had a strong second quarter. Volume - good volume growth, building on good volume growth. In the first quarter, price mix. Obviously, there's a lot of swings and roundabouts macro-economically going on in Africa, but actually net-net, the Africa business had a really good quarter, winning volume and value share, managing through the inflation and growth on -- good volume growth and good price growth. The flip side is Middle East. Obviously, the conflict is continuing to affect the business in that part of the world. So there's some headwinds there. And then, if you come to Europe within EMEA, Europe was overall not where we'd like it to be. We'd like to see a little more growth coming out of the European business. And really, it's a complete mix across the countries in Europe. There's more pressure on the away from home in the West than the East. Yes, some of the sporting programs have certainly help, whether it was UEFA that's already happened or Olympics, which is imminently going to start. The sporting has helped, but there's been some pressure on the away from home, as I said in the West, and so the immediate consumption packs have been growing slower there. But the strong programs, but not yet enough to offset the weather in some of the countries, and the same general effect as the U.S. in terms of the lower income consumers seeking a value, and doing less away from home trips. So big picture, Europe, not too dissimilar from the U.S., perhaps a little worse weather and a little more sporting events, but in an aggregate sense, very similar. Yes, sure. Thanks, Bonnie. I don't think it would be worth saying as a big deceleration going on as we come into the second quarter from the first quarter. If you just stand back a bit and look at what happened, and I think we were already calling out some softness in away from home, in the back end of last year. And so, I would characterize it more as there's been a slow build, from the back half of last year through the first and the second quarter. First and second quarter may be a little more negative than the back half of last year. But really, it's been a kind of a slow softening rather than anything major and abrupt and it's not like accelerating off a cliff. It's kind of a slow softening it's kind of just running at a softness level when thinking about away from home in the U.S. And then in terms of what we're doing about it, which is obviously the key question, is we've really got - being more focused. On how can we make sure that we bring to bear in the away-from-home channels in a sense, all the thinking that we have historically done on affordability, and price pack architecture in some of the mom-and-pop and line at home channels, to make sure working with our partners across the different channels that we can provide, whether it's the meal combos, or whatever format of offerings. So that there's a laddering of pricing to allow people to stay within the category and the channel. And so, those are rolling out as we speak. We expect to see them making an impact in the years to go. Yes. Sure, Filippo. Yes. Latin America had another strong result in the quarter, sustained the volume momentum, as you mentioned, clearly being driven from Mexico and Brazil. It's a pretty broad-based category success story, including not just Coke trademark, but now Coke Zero at 20% volume growth. Obviously, part of this is a long-term capability and momentum building approach with our bottlers in Latin America, really bringing together all of the components of the strategy that we talk about, whether it be the marketing transformation, the focus on innovation, the execution of price packaging in the marketplace, particularly in markets like Latin America, making sure we both have premiumization and opportunities. But also critically important affordability options, whether that be with regular packaging or returnable packaging, but really making sure we have ways of keeping people in the franchise and all executed by the bottling system which has really doubled down, not just on traditional execution, and putting more cool doors out there, but the digitization of their relationships with the retailers. So really, representation of what is possible when all the elements of the strategy of the system are executed in the marketplace. I think it's worth noting that, obviously, yes, strong volume performance of 5%. Please do take in mind that the price mix is heavily affected by the Argentinian high inflation and two-thirds of the price mix is actually, due to Argentina. So that leaves you about roughly 6% for normal inverted e-commerce pricing for the rest of the countries. Nevertheless, a very strong result. In Latin America, very pleasing and looking forward to seeing that continue into the future. Sure, I mean, absolutely, we're going to continue to press ahead with the marketing, with the innovation, with the price factor, with the execution. That's the way we earn the right to take a reasonable level of pricing. Clearly, some of the inflationary effects and some of the mix effects, are likely to become more subdued as we go into the back half of the years. So I'm not expecting, for example in North America, half of it is from mix and half of it is from core pricing. I think the mixed piece will start to train down over time and in part it does so, because it starts cycling itself. And so I think it's, the key for me is to look through the kind of the mix and the inflation effects and thinking about core pricing. And if you do that as an overall company level and look at the second quarter in its totality. Again there's, as I said, a big piece of it was inflation. You take it out and you're at the 4-ish percent in core pricing, offer 2% volume. There you are right in the sweet spot of the top end of the algorithm that, we've been looking to deliver on. So I think, the kind of the central assumption is a kind of landing zone for these effects like inflation and mix and starting to see more of the price mix being the core actions across the strategy flywheels driving the business. Yes, so we as from a strategy perspective, have taken the approach over the last number of years, it cannot say even longer, that it's critically important, particularly when times get tougher to try and keep as many consumers in the franchise as possible, rather than trying to re-recruit them at some later stage. And they're in our focus not just on marketing innovation, but affordability within the price pack architecture. So clearly an objective of ours is not to see negative volumes, and to make sure we keep people in and use all the elements to do that. And so, as you say, we've got 2%. In the corridor, we've got - we've had a run right there. We've talked in the past, it remains true today that the central long-term growth algorithm, we're looking for a revenue of 4% to 6%, and we've set ourselves the ambition of staying in the 5% to 6% range, with a balance of volume and price mix. So that's essentially a way of, you know, if you've split that you're saying 2% to 3% in volume and 2% to 3% in price. We were kind of in that range in the quarter with the 2% volume. So I think in the long run, we'll continue to pursue that. Talked earlier this year that, in the shorter term, it's likely to be slightly more price and slightly less volume, which was kind of exactly what happened in the second quarter. So it would not surprise me, as we go through the rest of the year that that remains true, that we see slightly less volume than the kind of standard algorithm, and slightly more price - as pricing tends towards, inflation tends towards the landing zone. And I think that's likely to be true as we go through - the rest of the summer, hopefully the weather gets a bit better. But we're likely to see that slightly less volume, slightly more price. And probably a repetition of where that volume's coming from in terms of the rest of the year, the positives largely being the developing economies, Latin America, India, Africa, Southeast Asia, and to some extent Japan, and the kind of weighing on it a little, the kind of parts of North America and Europe channel and income specific and some of the disruptions from the Middle East. But net-net, we think we've got a strong strategy that's playing out and is winning. And we're confident that we can drive that to get the balanced algorithm of growth, through the rest of this year, for our guidance and into the future. Yes, sure Robert. So definitely North America had a good second quarter. The standouts in terms of growth, clearly, actually what's interesting is actually if you look at the Nielsen Universe, and you look at which two trademarks provided most dollar retail growth in Q2, and the answer is Fairlife and Coca-Cola. And so, in a way, you can see that as a sort of microcosm for the overall strategy working. You've got broad ends of the portfolio working and it's being executed in the marketplace and driving really substantial growth. So good performance by Fairlife, good performance by the overall Coca-Cola with growth obviously being led by Coca-Cola Zero. In the sports category, getting better. We had some positive volume growth in BODYARMOR and Powerade. And we're really starting to see, the kind of stabilization with the marketing and the innovation, and some packed price work going on there. We're not yet gaining all the share we want again, but we've stabilized and starting to turn the corner with some of those innovations on Zero and Flash I.V. and Powerade power. So a good kind of step forward and turning the corner and clearly looking to do better. I'm not sure there's much more to say, great quarter and long may at last. Sure. Well I think therefore. You need to kind of break it up a bit. I mean firstly look, we've had a great partnership with Monster, created tremendous value for Monster for us Coca-Cola and for the bottling partners. Clearly in the case of the U.S., there's been what happens in every category when people create a category, and there's one or two brands. People look for the white spaces and start to innovate, and start to bring new news to the category. I think that's what's happening in energy, particularly in the US. And so, I think working with Monster that will respond to the evolution of the way, the consumers looking at the category. I think it's also important to understand that the energy category, is one of the categories that responds to an overall consumer needs state, of being fueled for their lives. And so, from a company point of view, we see that as something where we bring multiple brands, to bear against that needs state. And each brand in each category needs to play its part in kind of delivering on that. Each one has to do their own work to do it. But I think there's more to be done across the board, including in the Monster energy portfolio. We're working with them on that. And then I think internationally, there's robust growth in the energy category and making good progress around the world in different ways and different forms. So I think, one has to kind of pull apart energy category and look at it kind of geographically, to see that overall it's still got some good growth, and there's different jobs to be done in different parts of the world. Yes, sure. I'll take it in reverse order, Charlie. Yes, the negative pricing is more than driven by the mix effect. So core pricing is positive if you went operating unit-by-operating unit, but overall Asia price mix is negative, because of the way the mathematics of the thing works. But the central answer there is it's more than just geography mix. Geography mix is consuming core pricing and taking it down to minus 3%. Then if I go back to the performance of the different operating units, clearly the big swing in Asia-Pacific is driven by the bounce back of India. You'll remember that in the first quarter, India had a soft first quarter. The second quarter was very strong. And so that produces obviously a big swing in the results. So India had a good double-digit growth of volume in the second quarter. Still very bullish on India. Still very realistic in terms of it won't be a straight line into the future, but they certainly had a good quarter in the second quarter. We also saw good volume growth across Southeast Asia, including also volume growth across Japan and South Korea. Volumes were negative in the China operating unit. There's two parts to this story. The first is, yes, there's a general macro softness as the overall economy works through some of the structural issues around real estate, pricing, et cetera, et cetera. But within the things that we control, we have essentially been prioritizing and restructuring where we invest across the category portfolio. And focusing more on sparkling and juice drinks and teas. And deprioritizing what is essentially case-packed water, where we - don't make money in China. So the overall volumes were negative in China, but that's entirely driven by the de-prioritization of the water. And actually, I think the sparkling volume was slightly positive in China for the quarter. Let me attack the answer in a different way. Our bias is to lean in and invest where we see opportunities. And to the extent that we continue to see opportunities, we continue to invest. And if we see more opportunity, we'll invest more. And the contrary is also true. If we see softness that doesn't warrant certain level of investment, then we will look to pull back. Having said that, there's nothing particularly in the guidance that's trying to tell you, is changing radically in one direction or the other. Yes, we continue to see the need for marketing pressure. It's not a fixed sum that, is not subject to inflation. But there's nothing in the guidance that's trying to tell you something radically different. It's very much we continue to invest and drive the top line, and we see the two marching together. Okay. Thanks, Robert. That was the last question. So to summarize, we're building a culture that emphasizes improving every aspect of how we do business. We have lots of opportunities in front of us. We think we're well positioned to capture these opportunities, and we're confident that we will successfully execute our strategy and create value for - our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest. Your investment in our company and for joining us this morning. Thank you."

            "name": "John Murphy",
            "content": "Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we delivered strong results. We grew organic revenues 15%. This consisted of 2% unit case growth. Concentrate sales were ahead of volume by four points, driven primarily by timing of concentrate shipments, and some disruptions in the global supply chain that we partly expect, to reverse next quarter. Our price/mix growth of 9% in the quarter was primarily driven by two items: one, approximately five points of intense inflationary pricing, across a handful of markets to offset significant currency devaluation. And two, an array of pricing and mix actions across our markets. Excluding the impacts from concentrate shipment timing and pricing from markets with intense inflation. Organic revenue growth during the quarter was at the high end of our long-term growth algorithm. Comparable gross margin was up approximately 200 basis points, driven by underlying expansion, and the benefit from bottler refranchising partially offset by currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 120 basis points. Comparable operating margin expansion was less than comparable gross margin expansion, due to less benefit from bottler refranchising and greater currency headwinds to comparable operating margin. Putting it all together, second quarter comparable EPS of $0.84 was up 7% year-over-year despite 10% currency headwinds and 2% headwind from bottler refranchising. Free cash flow was approximately $3.3 billion, down approximately $700 million versus the prior year, due to higher tax payments, cycling working capital benefits from the prior year and higher capital expenditures. We continue to take actions, to achieve a fit for purpose balance sheet that, will best support our growth agenda. During the quarter, we raised approximately $4 billion in cash by issuing long-term debt for general corporate purposes. This may include pre-funding upcoming payments related to the IRS tax case and the Fairlife contingent consideration. With respect to our IRS tax case, which we continue to vigorously defend. We're making progress to our next steps, and we expect we will be able to move forward an appeal by the end of the year. Given the continued outperformance of Fairlife, we recorded a charge of $1.3 billion during the quarter. Our estimated final payment related to this acquisition is $5.3 billion, which will be made in 2025. We are encouraged by Fairlife's performance and the value it has created for our company. So far this year, we've realized nearly $3 billion in gross proceeds from bottler refranchising and streamlining our equity investments. We'll continue to prioritize higher growth businesses, and take passive capital off the table. Return on invested capital is 24%, up approximately five points from three years ago. Our balance sheet is strong, as demonstrated by our net debt leverage of 1.5 times EBITDA, which is well below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times. We have ample capacity to pursue our capital allocation agenda, which prioritizes investing to drive further growth, continuing to support our dividend and staying dynamic, agile and opportunistic. As James mentioned, we're proactively managing our portfolio to deliver on our commitments. Our updated 2024 guidance reflects the momentum of our business in the first half of the year, and our confidence in our ability to execute on our plans during the second half of this year. We now expect organic revenue growth of 9% to 10%, and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 13% to 15%. Bottler refranchising is still expected to be a four to five-point headwind, to comparable net revenues. And we now expect a one to two-point headwind, to comparable earnings per share. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now anticipate an approximate five to six-point currency headwind, to comparable net revenues and an approximate eight to nine-point currency headwind, to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024. This increase in currency headwind is driven by a small number of intensive treasury markets, while the rest of the currency basket is relatively neutral to our results. All in, we now expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus $2.69 in 2023. There are some considerations to keep in mind. We expect unit cases and concentrate shipments to be relatively in line with each other for the full year 2024. Please keep in mind there are two extra days in the fourth quarter. Taking everything into consideration, we expect earnings growth during the remainder of 2024, will be weighted towards the fourth quarter. To summarize, we're encouraged by our track record and the underlying momentum of our business. Our system remains incredibly focused and motivated to drive growth. We're continuing to drive quality top line growth, expand margins, grow comparable earnings per share and improve the return profile of our business. And we're confident we will deliver on our guidance, and longer-term objectives. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions. Okay. Thanks, Bryan. So on the first question, yes, we had number of events during the quarter that affected that relationship between unit cases and concentrate. You mentioned a couple of them, the ingestion and the Red Sea and Singapore - in LatAm, we had some restocking in the wake of the floods in Brazil, and in our India operations. We had some stocking up to anticipate some future demand. So a range of factors, none of them with a threat - a common threat to them. Our guidance assumes a more normal second half of the year. But as you rightly highlighted, there is likely to be something ahead of us that, we have not anticipated. And if that were to happen, we'd certainly we certainly advise. But our goal is over the longer haul, is to continue to have cases and gallons in line. And with regards to the gross margin impact, there's a slight benefit on both the gross and operating margins related to the stocking, but it's in the tens of basis points and again, reflected in our guidance a year ago, with that leveling out that we expect. Sure, Steve, thanks. So on gross margin, just to maybe highlight the big drivers typically our underlying performance any structural changes we have in the quarter, most of which nowadays as relates to our refranchising activity and then had a currency impact. So year-to-date, we're reflecting almost 200 basis points of increase. And that's primarily driven by structural and underlying with some offset on currency. And for the second half of the year, typically, the margin profile in the second half of the year is slightly lower than the first half. But I would say the overall trends in the second half of the year will be similar, to what we've seen in the first half. And maybe just to step it down on one - down to the operating margin line, not dissimilar. We have had more benefit on the underlying margin in the first half of the year than on structural. And then the second half of the year, I expect it to be more even. And yet, as we've discussed in prior calls, we sort of reserve the right to stay flexible in the event that we make investment decisions that linked to what's happening in our many markets around the world. But overall direction of travel on both the gross and operating line is our margin profile to be strengthening and to be pretty much in line with some of the previous conversations we've had on this topic. Sure, Chris, thank you. Well, firstly is we're very pleased with the performance of Fairlife, and the end is in sight relative to the overall construct of the deal we have in place there. With regard to the broader free cash flow conversation, yes the sources we have are cash from operations. And in the short-term, as we continue to re-franchise some of our businesses from the proceeds that come in from that. During the second quarter, we also went into the debt market and we issued some long-term debt. And so, it's really a combination of those three that we are managing very closely, to deal with the end of this year and into 2025, on the outflows that we see. Balance sheet remains strong. We go into 2025 with a clear line of sight as to what needs to be taken care of. And yet, as we have discussed on many occasions, relative to our overall capital allocation strategy. We will continue to invest in the business as appropriate, to support the dividend file. We take care of the Fairlife acquisition and the tax payment that is, is on the horizon with relative to the IRS tax case. So all in all, it's going to be an interesting 18 months to work through. But we feel very confident that the work we've done today prepares us well to manage through it. So regarding the timing, we're not giving out dates as to when we expect the refranchising process to finish, we're staying very thoughtful, disciplined in recruiting new partners in the areas that are still outstanding. And so, there's good work underway, but no imminent decisions and we'll advise as that work bear fruition. But I think the overall message is, we continue to be very clear internally on the path forward. And we'll expect over the couple of years to have the both of the refranchising, John, if not all of us. With regard to the impact on EPS dilution, it's a mechanical effect that comes from the broader strategic decisions that, we've - that we believe are right for the Coca-Cola Company, and over time for the Coca-Cola system. The refranchising work that started back in the mid-teens is demonstrating time and again that the overall system benefits, when there's a step change in overall performance. And with that step change, we benefit over the longer haul to - as you've seen this year, there is a mechanical impact on the EPS line. But longer term, we think that the broader value proposition of the Coca-Cola Company is staying very focused on what we do best, and having a balance sheet then that's designed to support what we do best, working in partnership with great partners around the world, is the recipe for us to ease and exceed our long-term growth model."

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions]  \n I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department if they have any questions.\n I would now like to introduce Ms. Robin Halpern, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Halpern, you may now begin. \nRobin Halpern: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. \n We've posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website. These reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to this morning to results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our growth and operating margins.\n This call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC report. Following prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. [Operator Instructions]\n Now I will turn the call over to James. \nJames Quincey: Thanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a good start this year as our first quarter results continued the momentum we've been building by executing our all-weather strategy. The operating backdrop differed greatly across our markets once again, but our powerful portfolio, coupled with our systems capabilities, equip us with the agility we need to deliver on our 2024 guidance, which we are updating today.\n This morning, I'll discuss the drivers in the quarter and how we use our scale and growth mindset to deliver these strong results. Then I'll highlight how we continue to meet consumer needs and grow our total beverage portfolio. Finally, John will discuss our financial results and updated 2024 guidance.\n In the first quarter, we grew volume and expanded comparable margins, and we continued to invest across the business. We're managing currency fluctuations to deliver earnings growth as shown by the 7% comparable earnings per share growth despite 9% currency headwinds, and we gained value share in both at-home and away-from-home channels.\n Across the world, we're continuing to win in the market by leveraging our scale and relying on our local expertise of our bottling partners. In Asia Pacific, momentum continued across a large portion of our business, including Japan and South Korea, Philippines and Thailand. We gained traction in Indonesia with a return to volume growth. India's momentum was impacted by some temporary factors that recovered at the end of March.\n In China, retail sales growth continues to improve, but consumer confidence is still below 2019 levels. We remain optimistic about the many opportunities ahead of us, and we're stepping up our execution in a number of ways. For example, greater focus on our core business for a more segmented market approach and more surgical horizontal market and execution.\n In EMEA, we're seeing gradual improvement in macro trends in Europe, leading to improved consumer confidence. We paired Sprite with spicy new locations to drive momentum in away-from-home channels. Fuze Tea and POWERADE also generated strong performance, and Jack Daniels and Coca-Cola expanded to 6 more European markets during the quarter.\n Africa saw continued volume momentum from last quarter, while navigating a number of markets with significant currency devaluations. Geopolitical and economic challenges in Eurasia and the Middle East continue to affect our business in the region. We are working closely with local partners to manage these challenging dynamics, and we're committed to investing behind the strength of our brands for the long term.\n North America volume had a slow start to the quarter before posting sequential improvement in each of the last 2 months of the quarter and elasticities remain favorable, leading to ongoing share gains. The launch of Coke Spiced featured compelling in-store displays. Across our sparkling softdrink brands, Zero Sugar sugar performance was strong, and we introduced 12-ounce slim cans to further drive premiumization. Value-added dairy continued across fairlife and Core Power in sports drinks, notwithstanding the noncash impairment charge that John will speak to in more detail.\n We believe our 2-brand strategy with POWERADE and BODYARMOR is gaining traction, and we've seen improved share trends. While we still have work to do, the stepped up execution by our dedicated sales force in driving improved on-shelf execution and we're encouraged by the continued growth in sports water and the more recent BODYARMOR innovations, including Zero Sugar and Flash I.V.\n While inflation has moderated and wages continue to trend upward in North America, we're closely monitoring consumer sentiment and traffic trends between at-home and away-from-home consumption. In Latin America, volume momentum continued. Performance was driven by strength in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia, while Argentina continued to experience high inflationary conditions. We have quality leadership across our portfolio in Latin America, with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar continuing its strong performance. Sparkling flavors, sports, juices and alcohol ready-to-drink also performed well during the quarter.\n Commercial initiatives are driving improved shelf space and basket incidence supported by ongoing outlet digitization. We have suggested order capabilities in digital platforms that reach more than 3 million customers in the region.\n Across developed markets, the overall inflationary environment is normalizing. However, across developing emerging markets, there continues to be a handful of markets that are experiencing intense inflation, which is driving elevated pricing, offset by incremental currency headwinds. We're proactively managing these volatile environments, and we feel confident we have the playbook to navigate challenges locally, while continuing our momentum at a consolidated level.\n We're continuing to spin our strategic flywheel faster across total beverage portfolio. And as discussed at CAGNY, we're building loved brands and innovating and delivering bigger, bolder bets. In the first quarter, we launched K-Wave as part of the Coke Creations platform in markets across 5 operating units. K-Wave celebrates Korean pop or K-pop fans, includes a global collaboration with 3 K-pop groups and an AI-based fan experience. Our growing number of Coke Creations are different with each iteration and, by design, are only available for a limited time. This generates buzz and excitement building relevance for the brand and reconsideration for Coke with Gen Z drinkers.\n We also know that sometimes the most successful lasting innovation is simply improving the taste of existing drinks. Using our deep in-house flavor expertise and understanding of the science of taste, we have worked to refine the recipes for Fanta and Sprite to meet consumer preferences across many markets. These changes bring new consumers to our brands as well as remind current consumers what drew them to their favorite beverages in the first place.\n The strong Fanta performance in markets from Brazil to Germany to the U.S. this quarter is largely due to this type of innovation, which was supported by marketing messages focused on taste and on tying the brand to snacking occasions at local festivals, like Carnival in Brazil.  \n Elsewhere in our total beverage portfolio, Minute Maid Zero Sugar kicked off its global campaign in North America, leveraging influencers, social media and connected commerce activations with key customers. We're building on our innovations by driving awareness and excitement through an increasingly digital marketing media mix. \n Our total beverage portfolio plays a lead role, as shown by the New Guy campaign in the U.S. this quarter, which featured multiple grounds across categories. Innovation is woven into the fabric of our culture, and we're encouraged by our innovation pipeline as we look forward to the rest of 2024.\n Moving across the flywheel, we're leaning into integrated execution to drive basket incidence and create incremental value for customers. We work closely with our bottling partners and went bigger with in-store displays to inspire transactions around key events like NCAA March Madness in the U.S., and we'll do this again later this summer with the Olympic and Paralympic Games. As a system to improve quality availability, we increased outlets by 2%, added more than 600,000 cooler doors and increased our share of cold space and overall shelf space in stores.\n We benefited from global scale, while maintaining local relevance by tying our brands to regional meals occasions. For example, in Japan, we've associated Coke with Wagyu and Yakiniku through the path to purchase, using end-to-end consumer messaging and partnering with key customers in the modern trade and convenience retail. We have seen strong Coca-Cola revenue growth in Japan.\n While we continue to grow our business, we also strive to positively impact the communities we serve. We do this by focusing on the issues that matter most to our system, and we share our status and learnings each year when we publish our business' sustainability report. Putting it all together, it's early in the year, but we're off to a good start. We have confidence we will achieve our guidance for the year.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to John. \nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results marked a continuation of the underlying momentum in our business, driven by a strong and focused system. We delivered another quarter of volume growth, even as we cycled strong results. Additionally, we completed the refranchising of several bottlers during the quarter, leading to further comparable margin expansion.\n We progressed on our refranchising agenda, while making sure we best position our system to deliver long-term growth, and we earn a fair return on our investments. We continue to invest behind our portfolio with discipline and flexibility, thanks to our enhanced resource allocation agenda.\n During the quarter, we grew organic revenues 11%. We had 1% unit case growth. Concentrate sales were behind unit case volume by 3 points, driven by 1 less day in the quarter and the timing of concentrate shipments, primarily in Mexico and the Middle East. \n Our price/mix growth of 13% in the quarter was driven by approximately 6 points of intense inflationary pricing across a handful of markets to offset significant currency devaluation, pricing actions across a number of markets and a couple of points of favorable mix.\n Excluding impacts from intense inflationary pricing, organic revenue growth in the first quarter was at the high end of our long-term growth algorithm. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 130 basis points driven by underlying expansion and a benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency headwinds.\n Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 60 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong top line growth and bottler refranchising, partially offset by currency headwinds and an increase in marketing investments. Markets experiencing intense inflation represent only a single-digit contribution to our volume, but continue to have an outsized impact on the shape of our P&L.\n Putting it all together, first quarter comparable EPS of $0.72 was up 7% year-over-year, including 9% currency headwinds, which were driven by currency devaluation in markets experiencing intense inflation. Free cash flow was approximately $160 million, an increase from the prior year.\n Before moving on, I want to discuss 2 items that are included in our first quarter reported results, a $765 million charge related to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability for our acquisition of fairlife. Our final payment related to the fairlife acquisition will take place in 2025. This payment has grown as fairlife has outperformed. We continue to be encouraged by our ability to scale fairlife organically.\n Secondly, a noncash impairment charge of $760 million related to BODYARMOR. While we are taking a charge to reflect revised projections and a higher discount rate since the acquisition date of BODYARMOR, we believe in the power of our 2 sports brand strategy with POWERADE and BODYARMOR. We're taking actions to help create long-term value, and we're seeing signs that this strategy is working.\n Our balance sheet remains strong and our net debt leverage of 1.6x EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. This gives us ample capacity for potential upcoming payments in 2024 related to the IRS tax case, which we continue to vigorously defend, and the upcoming fairlife payment in 2025.\n We continue to remain consistent in our approach to prioritizing our capital allocation. We're committed to investing to drive growth and to support our dividend, which we have raised for 62 consecutive years.\n We're confident our business model has the flexibility to allow us to deliver on our overall objectives. Our updated 2024 guidance reflects the underlying momentum of our business, and we now expect organic revenue growth of 8% to 9%, and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 11% to 13%. Our revised top line guidance is solely driven by higher-than-expected inflationary pricing in a handful of markets, which we expect to moderate throughout the year.\n Bottler refranchising is still expected to be a 4- to 5-point headwind to comparable net revenues and a 2-point headwind to comparable earnings per share, but will have a positive impact on both our margins and the return profile of our business. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate 4- to 5-point currency headwind to comparable net revenues, and an approximate 7 to 8-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024.\n This increase in currency headwind is driven by intense inflationary markets, while the rest of the currency basket is relatively neutral to our results.\n Our underlying effective tax rate for 2024 is now expected to be 19%. All in, we continue to expect comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5% versus $2.69 in 2023. There are some considerations to keep in mind. We estimate the ongoing conflict in the Middle East had approximately 1 point of impact on volume growth during the first quarter of 2024. It's unclear how long this impact will last. The cadence of structural impact will be larger in the second and third quarters due to the timing of transaction closing during the first quarter and the seasonality of the businesses we refranchised.\n Finally, there will be 2 additional days in the fourth quarter. To sum it up, and as James said, the year has started off well. We remain focused on the execution of our all-weather strategy. And thanks to the partnership of our system and the ongoing dedication of our people, we're confident we can create value for our stakeholders and deliver on our guidance for the year. And as we said at CAGNY, we're primed for performance in 2024 and over the long term.\n With that, operator, we are ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. \nBryan Spillane: John, I wanted to ask a question about gross margins. In the quarter, there was about a 100 basis point tailwind from structural benefits and then also -- or structural change and then, I think, 60 basis points benefit underlying. If we kind of take that first quarter performance and kind of think about it over the balance of the year, can you just give us some context of how we should be thinking how much of that we should extrapolate going forward? \n Maybe what some of the headwinds, tailwinds would be? But just given the gross margins were so much better, our gross profit dollars were so much better than we were all modeling. I just want to kind of get a sense of how much of that we should bank in our estimates going forward. \nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Bryan. So as we think about the full year, we're going to continue to have a tailwind from the refranchising work that we have discussed. And so I think that's going to flow through throughout the year. We expect to continue to have some expansion as reflected in our ongoing and the growth model, driven by both positive impacts and some productivity fee. The input horizon is more normalized. We do have some elevation on juice and sugar, which we'll continue to have. But the net of it all is that we'll have some tailwinds in the underlying area.\n Currency will continue to be a headwind, and you can kind of extrapolate that out for the year. So the net of it all is it will be primarily driven by the refranchising efforts positively, some underlying expansion, offset by the currency headwind. And as we reflected in our guidance, the top line growth continues to be a primary driver and the quality therein will -- I think will ensure that on a sustained basis, that expansion. Albeit not as potentially aggressive every quarter, but that expansion will be in our favor going forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. \nDara Mohsenian: So I was just hoping you could give a bit of a deeper dive into North America, a, just wanted to get an update on what you're seeing from the consumer? Any channel shifts in terms of away-from-home versus at-home and the sequential improvement you discussed within Q1, is that something that's expected to continue going forward? And then just b, price/mix was very strong at 7% in North America, can you unpack that between mix and pricing and just how you think about the balance between pricing mix and volume going forward in the balance of the year in North America? \nJames Quincey: Sure. Overall, in terms of the consumer and how that fed into the channels, the U.S. still remains in good shape. There is some purchasing power compression in the lower-income echelons. And I think it's quite clear that there's some behavioral shift there looking for value. I think that has led to a marginal channel weighting or shift, if you like, with slightly more at-home volume versus away-from-home. \n I would emphasize this is at the periphery rather than a big shift. But the margin, slightly more value seeking, slightly more at-home, slightly less away-from-home. And so we've been stepping up our RGM efforts, our packaging efforts and executing against that, so that we have continued to gain share in the quarter.\n As it relates to pricing, of the 7 points in the first quarter, approximately 2 of those are mix or timing related, the rest is pricing, and we expect that to moderate as the year goes on. And we expect to see 2024 be in a much more normal year in terms of pricing, it's largely going to be as it was pre-COVID. So we're expecting to see 2024 end up with a much more balanced growth equation over the rest of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. \nLauren Lieberman: I wanted to talk a little bit about how the company manages when the dollar is strong. So outside of the markets with extreme inflation, we know from a strategic standpoint, of course, the ongoing RGM efforts and pack and channel and so on. But just sort of from a more tactical standpoint, when you're in a strengthening dollar environment, I was curious if you could share a bit more about how you manage that at a local level. Because the delivery of dollar-based EPS has become a key focus and hallmark, frankly, in the last couple of years, and I thought a bit more color on how you go about that in a more tactical sense could be helpful. \nJames Quincey: Sure. So markets outside the U.S. will roughly break down into 2 types. There'll be those perhaps typified by Europe, Japan, Australia, some of the obvious ones, where the competition and the economic dynamics of the marketplace are predominantly local currency. And so in these markets, our approach is to compete locally in the local currency given the cost structures in those areas. And we generally marry that with a long-term currency hedging or selling forward program, such that we can have a clear anticipation during the course of the year as to what that's likely to turn into.\n So that's one set of markets. And we essentially have put ourselves in a position through the hedging program that we can compete locally and do what's necessary to continue to win in those marketplaces, which is generally what happens. \n The second bucket of countries, and that's much more apparent in recent quarters than even historically, where you have higher -- whether you want to say the chicken and the egg, a higher level of devaluation and a higher level of inflation. These tend to be more emerging market economies where there is less availability of economically attractive hedging programs. And so we tend to have hedged them.\n But also given the elevated nature of the dynamic between the inflation and devaluation, we do -- we obviously are competing locally. So for example, in the Argentinas of the world, we're competing predominantly locally to win in that marketplace and set ourselves out for the long term. And the inflation -- it's very cyclical as these markets cycle through higher inflation and high devaluation. \n Sometimes, the dollar value of those businesses shoots up. And sometimes it shoots down. At the moment, they're in as of shooting down in dollar terms. So they're declining in dollar terms, even though they're growing a lot in currency neutral. But we look at it on a long-term basis to win using the RGM and all the other investments we make in the business. And of course, they're not all in sync with each other. So it's a portfolio management question.  \n And then overlay that is, of course, a corporate approach in terms of prioritization, where and how to invest, whether it's a lean in and lean in with what sorts of investments, such that we are able to deliver on our corporate level commitment to make sure that the end of it, the sum of all the competing locally, is more than the sum of the parts, such that we can deliver a consistent level of U.S. dollar EPS growth. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. \nStephen Robert Powers: James and John, you both mentioned incremental progress on the 2-brand strategy and sports drinks with BODYARMOR and POWERADE. I was hoping you could expand a bit more on what you're seeing there that gives you that encouragement and what you see as the key initiatives for that strategy as we go forward. \nJames Quincey: Sure. Clearly, we haven't progressed as fast as we would like with regard to BODYARMOR, notwithstanding the step-up in the discount rate, and that's reflected, as John talked earlier, in the charge. Notwithstanding that, we do see long-term value in the dual strategy, particularly in the U.S. between POWERADE and BODYARMOR. We're off to a good start with some of the plans the Zero Calorie version is ahead of expectations. The Flash I.V. has got some double-digit share. And the Sport Water version is one of the fastest-growing premium water brands.\n So some product innovation is getting some traction, a new partnership with NHL on the marketing front. And on the execution front, a stepping up of the merchandising and sales force focused directed just at the sports drinks category, which is helping improve the share trend in the category. Although not at the rate we had hoped initially, but we think we are in good shape going forward. Obviously, we'll have an opportunity with the Olympics to really continue to step that up. So plans in place across the product innovation, the marketing and the execution, and we think this will come to fruition over the course of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. \nBonnie Herzog: I was hoping for a little more color on your performance in Asia in the quarter, and then whether it met your expectations or possibly fell short. Also, you mentioned that declines in China more than offset growth in some of your key markets in the region. So maybe just hoping for a little bit more color on your business in China, and how quickly you expect the market will recover, again, given the broader macro challenges in the region. \nJames Quincey: Sure. We'll let us go around Asia quickly. I mean China, we are cycling in the first quarter a very strong Chinese New Year first quarter from 2023. So I think we had a solid a solid quarter in China. We focus very well on having a good Chinese New with sparkling, which was good. We deprioritized some of the lower-value water in order to do so. And as we commented earlier, the Chinese confidence isn't as strongly rebounded as some of the other markets versus 2019. And so we see an overall environment where there'll be growth, perhaps not at the top historic levels, but there'll be growth.\n And so we're there we're very much focused on what we can control and the things we need to do. There's still huge opportunities in the Chinese marketplace, notwithstanding the macros. And there's a lot we can execute against in the marketing, in the innovation, in the execution in the marketplace, in the stores and with RGM. So there's a lot for us to achieve that's within our control in China.\n In the rest of Asia, we had a good quarter in Japan and South Korea. Good share gains, really starting to pick up the pace. Also, likewise, we had a strong performance in the Philippines, which is an important market for us, and so that was good in the quarter. The one that was atypical or at least compared to recent quarters was India had a slower start in January and February. As we've talked in previous calls, we're very bullish on the long-term prospects for the Indian business. \n And we're also very clear it's not going to be a straight line of metronomically consistent growth. And so it wasn't in the first quarter. It was a little softer January, February, but March and April have now bounced back. And so we expect to see India continue to have a strong year this year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. \nAndrea Teixeira: So can you comment on EMEA? You called out Nigeria, Germany and South Africa growing unit case and driving the growth in volumes. But if my math is correct, ex-inflationary countries, your price/mix in the rest of EMEA was about 7%. So can you comment on the state of the consumer there similar to what you said about the U.S.? And if you feel the 7% price/mix is more stable countries, sustainable going forward? \nJames Quincey: Sure. EMEA, also this quarter had a whole series of moving pieces. As you started on price/mix, clearly, there's a number of countries in there with very high inflation. Not just Nigeria, but also Turkey and somewhat mathematically unlikely, some of the smaller African countries given the level of inflation can also make a difference to the pricing lever in the EMEA segment. So the EMEA segment has a substantive piece of pricing that is the inflationary marketplaces, including many markets you wouldn't normally suspect.\n And so that's a roundabout way of saying, actually, the -- in Europe, our pricing is much more normalized. And a bit like the U.S., we both see improved macros. Actually, I think that, today, a number of the markets came out and said they've come out of recession from the previous quarters. Like the U.S., we see the lower income consumers remaining under pressure. And at the margin, slightly more shift towards value-orientated channels, at-home orientated channels and lesser from the away-from-home. And clearly, that's related to our focus, not just on the marketing and the innovation with the RGM and affordability and driving premiumization.\n So Europe, not too dissimilar a story compared to the U.S. But the EMEA segment mix is in both the Middle East conflict and quite a number of the high-inflation countries. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. \nChristopher Carey: So I want to ask about brand Coca-Cola, Trademark Coca-Cola relative to the sparkling flavor businesses. I think unit case for sparkling flavors outperformed trademark Coca-Cola in 2021 and in 2022, but this normalized into the back half of 2023. That's continued into Q1 of this year. So can you just perhaps expand on whether there's anything distinct that's occurring here between brand or Trademark Coca-Cola and sparkling flavors, regional considerations, brand considerations? I just think it's noteworthy, given the relative outperformance, that has just turned the other way a little bit. So any context would be helpful. \nJames Quincey: Yes. Look, clearly, both Trademark Coke, original taste, Coke Zero, have been having a good run over the last number of years and really focused on performance. But also perhaps unlike in times more recently passed, Sprite and Fanta have also been doing well. This has been a intentional focus for the company and the bottling system, which historically, we have looked at and managed sparkling altogether. \n And very deliberately a number of years ago, we separated to really focus in on Coke, Coke Trademark on its own with all the innovations, whether they be things like the K-Wave innovations, or continuing to focus on Coke Zero with updated -- the updated formulas or focusing on original case Coke with the Marvel activations that's just coming out. A real focus on Coke, and that has been part of what has driven success over the last number of years. And ultimately, for the company to do well, Coke has to do well. It's the kind of a mathematical certainty, and that has certainly been what's driving this.\n And then the separation of Sprite, Fanta and some of the regional brands particularly perhaps some of the Indian soft drink brands like Thums Up, have really got their own deserved focus. Actually, if you put all the flavored sparkling brands together, they would be one of their own big FMCG companies in their own right. \n And so really, what you're seeing is this focus on the formulas of Fanta and Sprite, really doing much better and being teamed up each time we've brought it to marketplace with a full marketing package. For example, Fanta in the U.S. had a good run as we updated the formula and relaunched the marketing.\n And so I think the -- it's been doing really well. I think the only a place where we've not succeeded, particularly with some of the flavors are in the Chinese marketplace, for example, given -- and that's really a Sprite question there. That we need to continue to focus on to do better with Sprite in China. But otherwise, Fanta, Sprite and particularly the Indian flavor brands have done very well, and of course, Coke is a pretty broad-based success story. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. \nFilippo Falorni: I wanted to ask on the Latin America business. Clearly, there's a lot of impact from hyperinflation in the market, but the volume trends continue to remain very solid in the region from a unit case standpoint. So maybe can you talk about the consumer environment there. And do you think that you can continue to see volume good in Latin America going forward in some of your key initiatives in the region? \nJames Quincey: Yes. So the simple answer is yes. We believe the businesses can continue to grow in Latin America, both in volume and revenue terms. It's been a long-term success part of the business with a very strong system between ourselves and the bottlers focused on the marketing, the innovation, the execution on the RGM. \n We'll continue to build on the recent year's momentum. Performance this quarter was strong in -- particularly in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia. Obviously, Argentina was impacted by the macroeconomic conditions. But we have a very tight system. We're very focused on what needs to be done and continuing to invest in capacity in order to continue to unlock the volume growth. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. \nPeter Grom: I had a question as it pertains to the fairlife liability. Clearly, this is a sign that the underlying business is doing extremely well, but we've also seen kind of the value of this liability increased quite a bit over the last year or so. As we look ahead, is there anything you can share any guardrails you can provide in terms of how we should think about the liability changing as we move through the balance of the year and into '25? \nJohn Murphy: So the liability is very much linked to the ultimate performance. And as we close out this quarter, we're reflecting our latest and best estimates as to what that will be. The momentum of the business has been very strong. And actually, I think it's going to continue. And if anything, there may be some more upside. But for now, we're reflecting our best estimates for what that liability ultimately would be. Just to keep in mind that the liability will be -- it's an early 2025 ending to it. And we'll update as we go through this year in the event that the projections evolve. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities. \nWilliam Chappell: Just a little bit more question on the innovation side. Certainly, it's been an innovative company over the past 4 or 5 years and more new products out there. But it's tough to kind of track some of these products that have been launched that are still on the shelf a year or 2 years later. So I guess the question is, are there things in place in terms of percentage of sales should come from new products in a certain region in a year or a number of new products that need to be launched per year? I understand you wanting to be more innovative, but just trying to -- what kind of guardrails or what kind of accountability there is around that kind of innovation. \nJames Quincey: Sure. I think the first thing is to bear in mind a certain segmentation of the innovation. And what I mean by that is you've got a strong focus on a part of the innovation that's around renovation of the core. So you get into kind of a question, okay, well, is the new Coke Zero formula or the updated Fanta formula backed with the new marketing campaign, is that -- you're going to count that as innovation or not. So the first thing is to understand that there's different types of innovation at play here all driving the business. One being. In a sense, the renovation of core brands.\n Secondly, our launch is intended to be ins and outs. So some of the Coke Creations, where really the focus is on reengaging with consumers in a novel way to drive relevance of the core brand. So you're not expecting it into the last. And then, of course, there are things we're putting into the marketplace that are new innovations, whether it would be something like a Minute Maid Zero Sugar or something like the Absolut SPRITE or the Jack Daniels and Coke. So these things -- and then, of course, you've got nonproduct-based innovation, like it's a new bottle size or a new can size. So we track across all these things.\n As it relates to product innovation, we have a very clear set of metrics on whether it's still growing on the fifth quarter after its launch. So is it cycling itself and continuing to accelerate. So there's a lot of cliometrics. But we do not set ourselves an artificial strategy objective of it has to be X percent from innovation. As it happens, about 25% of the growth comes from innovation, but it is not set that way. \n In the end, we are not setting ourselves up to sell what we make. We've got to sell what the consumers want to buy. So it's about doing justice to every brand and every idea and every package and every channel, and then service that resulting demand. If that is led by a great new innovation or by 138th year of classic Coke, then that's the answer. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos Laboy from HSBC. \nCarlos Alberto Laboy: James, market development is a culture, right, it's a philosophy. And it seems to me that so much of what you're doing and what you talked about today is intended to get shelf replenishers to become better market developers for faster growth. Can you speak to how this evolution is going in the system? Are there any regions or countries that stand out for momentum in this system transformation of moving towards richer market development and to less shelf replenishment order taking? \nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. Look, I think each part of the world is in its journey to continue to add value to the retail. Because in the end, this is about, together with the bottlers, making sure that we are adding value to the retailers business. Our objective at the retail level is to grow the beverage category faster than the average of their business, and for us to grow our portfolio of brands faster than the beverage category. \n And to do that, we've got to add more value, and that takes different forms in different places. And so as that happens, for example, the pre-sellers, they move from just order taking to account development. As AI comes in, it generates a suggested order for the retail outlet that is demonstrably more efficient in helping the retailer drive sales and then allows the salesperson to do more account development and to expand on different ideas.\n So at each stage, it's about taking the system capabilities to the next level so that we can continue to add value for the retailer. Everything that was done in the past starts to become the price of entry in the future, and so we need to keep adding value. And so I think there's a strong growth in capabilities all around the world specifically focused on the channel structure that the bottlers have in any given market. \nJohn Murphy: And if I may just add, James, I think one of the big changes in the last 3 to 5 years is that the ambition that we share, respectively, with all of our bottling partners is much more at the high end of what it should be than scattered. So I think that's -- and then it's working backwards from there as to what does it take to deliver that ambition. And yes, some are further along than others, but it's the ambition is that starting point that I think is helping to drive the progress that we're seeing each quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Moskow from TD Cowen. \nRobert Moskow: Just a couple of clarifying questions. James, I think on the last earnings call, you were very clear that you view the business... \nJames Quincey: You have to speak up. We can't hear you. \nRobert Moskow: My apologies. Can you hear me now? \nJames Quincey: Yes. \nRobert Moskow: I think last quarter, you spoke very specifically about the business being a 2% unit volume grower. Given the timing impact, is that still how you would view this year? And then secondly, can you be more specific about those timing differences in Mexico and I think the Middle East between units and concentrate? What causes those discrepancies? And do they naturally reverse in the coming quarter? \nJames Quincey: Sure. Yes, timing differences naturally reverse between concentrate units and unit cases. Partly, it happens when there is a different number of days in the quarter, then we have the -- we use the 445 system for all sorts of reasons. And what that causes sometimes is different numbers of shipping days in quarters. And so you undersell when you got less days, like the first quarter. And of course, in the fourth quarter this year when there's 2 extra days, there'll be way more concentrate units than there were cases, relatively speaking. So over the course of time, these anomalies or differences reverse themselves or average themselves out.\n And then as regards to the 2% volume, yes, look, I have a very strong view that the -- our overall ambition to see our revenue grow at the top end of the algorithm, I'm leaving aside the intense inflation countries for the sake of the argument at the moment, we want to grow at that 5% to 6% range. And we want that to have a balanced contribution from volume and price/mix. So implicitly, looking for 2% to 3% on volume. And I think we talked last quarter that in the current circumstances, that's likely to be slightly less volume and slightly more prices, as price inflation normalizes. And so I think that 2% is still pretty good number.\n It's certainly been the average growth rate in volume. If you take a compound number over the last number of years, you're going to get something like a 2%. So that seems to be the momentum we're driving. And that -- if you strip away the inflation and the weirdness in the first quarter, what you see is, you got that 1% volume, which given the Middle East headwind of 1% and actually recycling the strongest quarter last year, you can say it's a good volume number. It has good underlying price/mix in the normal countries. So the kind of the normal performance is right at the top end of the algorithm there, and then that feeds its way through to 7% EPS growth. So I think right in there, the main business, notwithstanding the kind of peripheral noise, is humming away right in line with where we said we wanted to be. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore ISI. \nRobert Ottenstein: I'd just like to drill down both on the U.S. and the volume question. Can you talk about your expectations for volume growth in North America this year? What it will take to get volume growth, is a function of more the economy, more the comps, more of the sectors? And tied to the sectors or categories, I think you mentioned that tea, coffee and water were very weak. Any color around that? \nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean, clearly, in the case of the U.S., we've commented in previous calls, that our expectation would be modest, flat to modest growth in volume on a long-term basis in North America with good pricing. Clearly, that remains our overall ambition. Whether we get from the flat to something more positive in the rest of the year will obviously be a combination of what we execute against and the trajectory of the purchasing power of the economy in the balance of the year. But we're very focused on continuing to build the business, drive the revenue and continue to win in the marketplace. And we'll see where that nets out, too.\n And then in the case of where we were doing well and where not clearly, we had a strong quarter in terms of sparkling, in terms of some of the other categories in North America. Dairy, obviously, the fairlife additional charge, as John talked about, as the earnout is in its last year, very strong quarter on dairy, very strong on sparkling, actually good on juice. \n The water and the tea, and obviously, to some extent, obviously, the sports categories, were a little softer. Some of it on the water was selling less of the kind of the case pack water. And tea, I think it was very much a question, we just need to focus a little more on some of what needs to be done there. But it was more on the kind of the Fuze Tea end of the spectrum rather than the Gold Peak end of the spectrum, which tends to do better. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Callum Elliott from Bernstein. \nCallum Elliott: Great. So I have a slightly longer-term question on gross margins. In 2015, your gross margin was 61%, I think. And you had published a slide at CAGNY in 2016, showing that you expected gross margins to get to 68%, post the refranchising that had been announced at the time. Today, we're still around 60% over the past 12 months. Recognizing you guys weren't in your current seats in 2016 when that slide was published, but my question is what's happened? \n I'm sure you'll point to M&A cost per BODYARMOR CCBA, et cetera, but I don't think they come close to explaining the 800 basis points of delta and I don't think that FX explains the gap either. But so what else is it? And has refranchising maybe just has not been as margin accretive as you expected? Or is there some kind of other structural drag that haven't been anticipated back in 2016? \nJohn Murphy: Yes. Actually, I think it does explain what's happened. I don't have the breakdown in front of me. But at the gross margin level, when you take into account the impact of currency, of some of the bottlers acquisitions that came back into our portfolio, that we're now in the process of refranchising and some of the other acquisitions, I think they have had a mechanical impact. And we can come back with a little bit more color on that. And then I think when you look at the operating income and how it flows down into operating income line, the primary driver are these items. So yes, I don't have it in front of me. We can follow up in a bit more detail. But yes, that's the story. \nOperator: Our last question will come from Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research. \nBrett Cooper: Just wanted to ask on your digital experience in B2B. And if you do any quantification as to when you win B2B or you get B2B into more particular retailers? What happens to your space, your share of the category performance and its relative to a base? I think it's not so much a question of the 8% increase in the quarter, but looking back over time. \nJames Quincey: I don't know if something was up with the line today that was very kind of broken up. But I think, Brett, you were asking about the digital experiences in B2B and what happens in shares in the category. There are multiple -- B2B is not a singular thing and the digital version of B2B is not a singular thing. There is a vast amount of B2B business that has been done for many years with direct order transfers, largely to large store modern retailers where order replenishment has a long-standing track record. And this is really focused on the efficiency of making sure the shelf is not out of stock from products. And it's more a process of support to what already goes on. And so actually, you see it's enabling the physical presence in the kind of the analog world, if you like.\n Of course, there's other types of B2B, for example, in the mom-and-pop stores, where we have moved heavily from a you have to wait for the pre-seller to appear type of relationship with the mom-and-pop stores to where that is complemented by some sort of ordering and relationship platform. They come in multiple guises, depending on where you are in the world, and the relative need and cost efficiency of doing so. But those platforms allow retailers effectively to be able to order, make additional orders 24/7, maybe even book servicing for their cold drink equipment, follow loyalty programs, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a lot of different types of B2B relationships.\n Generally speaking, they are supportive of us continuing to grow the relationship and to continue to do well. And -- but they are enabling rather than consumer facing, so the kind of the share is a little trickier to determine.\n Okay. I think that was the last one. To summarize, first quarter of the year, strong start, and we're confident we can continue to create value for the stakeholders and shareowners and deliver on our 2024 guidance. We'll continue to manage through the many different types of environments out there, but focus on leveraging our capabilities to drive what we can control to make sure we get growth.\n So thank you for your interest, your investment in the company and joining us this morning. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Quincey",
            "content": "Thanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a good start this year as our first quarter results continued the momentum we've been building by executing our all-weather strategy. The operating backdrop differed greatly across our markets once again, but our powerful portfolio, coupled with our systems capabilities, equip us with the agility we need to deliver on our 2024 guidance, which we are updating today.\n This morning, I'll discuss the drivers in the quarter and how we use our scale and growth mindset to deliver these strong results. Then I'll highlight how we continue to meet consumer needs and grow our total beverage portfolio. Finally, John will discuss our financial results and updated 2024 guidance.\n In the first quarter, we grew volume and expanded comparable margins, and we continued to invest across the business. We're managing currency fluctuations to deliver earnings growth as shown by the 7% comparable earnings per share growth despite 9% currency headwinds, and we gained value share in both at-home and away-from-home channels.\n Across the world, we're continuing to win in the market by leveraging our scale and relying on our local expertise of our bottling partners. In Asia Pacific, momentum continued across a large portion of our business, including Japan and South Korea, Philippines and Thailand. We gained traction in Indonesia with a return to volume growth. India's momentum was impacted by some temporary factors that recovered at the end of March.\n In China, retail sales growth continues to improve, but consumer confidence is still below 2019 levels. We remain optimistic about the many opportunities ahead of us, and we're stepping up our execution in a number of ways. For example, greater focus on our core business for a more segmented market approach and more surgical horizontal market and execution.\n In EMEA, we're seeing gradual improvement in macro trends in Europe, leading to improved consumer confidence. We paired Sprite with spicy new locations to drive momentum in away-from-home channels. Fuze Tea and POWERADE also generated strong performance, and Jack Daniels and Coca-Cola expanded to 6 more European markets during the quarter.\n Africa saw continued volume momentum from last quarter, while navigating a number of markets with significant currency devaluations. Geopolitical and economic challenges in Eurasia and the Middle East continue to affect our business in the region. We are working closely with local partners to manage these challenging dynamics, and we're committed to investing behind the strength of our brands for the long term.\n North America volume had a slow start to the quarter before posting sequential improvement in each of the last 2 months of the quarter and elasticities remain favorable, leading to ongoing share gains. The launch of Coke Spiced featured compelling in-store displays. Across our sparkling softdrink brands, Zero Sugar sugar performance was strong, and we introduced 12-ounce slim cans to further drive premiumization. Value-added dairy continued across fairlife and Core Power in sports drinks, notwithstanding the noncash impairment charge that John will speak to in more detail.\n We believe our 2-brand strategy with POWERADE and BODYARMOR is gaining traction, and we've seen improved share trends. While we still have work to do, the stepped up execution by our dedicated sales force in driving improved on-shelf execution and we're encouraged by the continued growth in sports water and the more recent BODYARMOR innovations, including Zero Sugar and Flash I.V.\n While inflation has moderated and wages continue to trend upward in North America, we're closely monitoring consumer sentiment and traffic trends between at-home and away-from-home consumption. In Latin America, volume momentum continued. Performance was driven by strength in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia, while Argentina continued to experience high inflationary conditions. We have quality leadership across our portfolio in Latin America, with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar continuing its strong performance. Sparkling flavors, sports, juices and alcohol ready-to-drink also performed well during the quarter.\n Commercial initiatives are driving improved shelf space and basket incidence supported by ongoing outlet digitization. We have suggested order capabilities in digital platforms that reach more than 3 million customers in the region.\n Across developed markets, the overall inflationary environment is normalizing. However, across developing emerging markets, there continues to be a handful of markets that are experiencing intense inflation, which is driving elevated pricing, offset by incremental currency headwinds. We're proactively managing these volatile environments, and we feel confident we have the playbook to navigate challenges locally, while continuing our momentum at a consolidated level.\n We're continuing to spin our strategic flywheel faster across total beverage portfolio. And as discussed at CAGNY, we're building loved brands and innovating and delivering bigger, bolder bets. In the first quarter, we launched K-Wave as part of the Coke Creations platform in markets across 5 operating units. K-Wave celebrates Korean pop or K-pop fans, includes a global collaboration with 3 K-pop groups and an AI-based fan experience. Our growing number of Coke Creations are different with each iteration and, by design, are only available for a limited time. This generates buzz and excitement building relevance for the brand and reconsideration for Coke with Gen Z drinkers.\n We also know that sometimes the most successful lasting innovation is simply improving the taste of existing drinks. Using our deep in-house flavor expertise and understanding of the science of taste, we have worked to refine the recipes for Fanta and Sprite to meet consumer preferences across many markets. These changes bring new consumers to our brands as well as remind current consumers what drew them to their favorite beverages in the first place.\n The strong Fanta performance in markets from Brazil to Germany to the U.S. this quarter is largely due to this type of innovation, which was supported by marketing messages focused on taste and on tying the brand to snacking occasions at local festivals, like Carnival in Brazil.  \n Elsewhere in our total beverage portfolio, Minute Maid Zero Sugar kicked off its global campaign in North America, leveraging influencers, social media and connected commerce activations with key customers. We're building on our innovations by driving awareness and excitement through an increasingly digital marketing media mix. \n Our total beverage portfolio plays a lead role, as shown by the New Guy campaign in the U.S. this quarter, which featured multiple grounds across categories. Innovation is woven into the fabric of our culture, and we're encouraged by our innovation pipeline as we look forward to the rest of 2024.\n Moving across the flywheel, we're leaning into integrated execution to drive basket incidence and create incremental value for customers. We work closely with our bottling partners and went bigger with in-store displays to inspire transactions around key events like NCAA March Madness in the U.S., and we'll do this again later this summer with the Olympic and Paralympic Games. As a system to improve quality availability, we increased outlets by 2%, added more than 600,000 cooler doors and increased our share of cold space and overall shelf space in stores.\n We benefited from global scale, while maintaining local relevance by tying our brands to regional meals occasions. For example, in Japan, we've associated Coke with Wagyu and Yakiniku through the path to purchase, using end-to-end consumer messaging and partnering with key customers in the modern trade and convenience retail. We have seen strong Coca-Cola revenue growth in Japan.\n While we continue to grow our business, we also strive to positively impact the communities we serve. We do this by focusing on the issues that matter most to our system, and we share our status and learnings each year when we publish our business' sustainability report. Putting it all together, it's early in the year, but we're off to a good start. We have confidence we will achieve our guidance for the year.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to John. Sure. Overall, in terms of the consumer and how that fed into the channels, the U.S. still remains in good shape. There is some purchasing power compression in the lower-income echelons. And I think it's quite clear that there's some behavioral shift there looking for value. I think that has led to a marginal channel weighting or shift, if you like, with slightly more at-home volume versus away-from-home. \n I would emphasize this is at the periphery rather than a big shift. But the margin, slightly more value seeking, slightly more at-home, slightly less away-from-home. And so we've been stepping up our RGM efforts, our packaging efforts and executing against that, so that we have continued to gain share in the quarter.\n As it relates to pricing, of the 7 points in the first quarter, approximately 2 of those are mix or timing related, the rest is pricing, and we expect that to moderate as the year goes on. And we expect to see 2024 be in a much more normal year in terms of pricing, it's largely going to be as it was pre-COVID. So we're expecting to see 2024 end up with a much more balanced growth equation over the rest of the year. Sure. So markets outside the U.S. will roughly break down into 2 types. There'll be those perhaps typified by Europe, Japan, Australia, some of the obvious ones, where the competition and the economic dynamics of the marketplace are predominantly local currency. And so in these markets, our approach is to compete locally in the local currency given the cost structures in those areas. And we generally marry that with a long-term currency hedging or selling forward program, such that we can have a clear anticipation during the course of the year as to what that's likely to turn into.\n So that's one set of markets. And we essentially have put ourselves in a position through the hedging program that we can compete locally and do what's necessary to continue to win in those marketplaces, which is generally what happens. \n The second bucket of countries, and that's much more apparent in recent quarters than even historically, where you have higher -- whether you want to say the chicken and the egg, a higher level of devaluation and a higher level of inflation. These tend to be more emerging market economies where there is less availability of economically attractive hedging programs. And so we tend to have hedged them.\n But also given the elevated nature of the dynamic between the inflation and devaluation, we do -- we obviously are competing locally. So for example, in the Argentinas of the world, we're competing predominantly locally to win in that marketplace and set ourselves out for the long term. And the inflation -- it's very cyclical as these markets cycle through higher inflation and high devaluation. \n Sometimes, the dollar value of those businesses shoots up. And sometimes it shoots down. At the moment, they're in as of shooting down in dollar terms. So they're declining in dollar terms, even though they're growing a lot in currency neutral. But we look at it on a long-term basis to win using the RGM and all the other investments we make in the business. And of course, they're not all in sync with each other. So it's a portfolio management question.  \n And then overlay that is, of course, a corporate approach in terms of prioritization, where and how to invest, whether it's a lean in and lean in with what sorts of investments, such that we are able to deliver on our corporate level commitment to make sure that the end of it, the sum of all the competing locally, is more than the sum of the parts, such that we can deliver a consistent level of U.S. dollar EPS growth. Sure. Clearly, we haven't progressed as fast as we would like with regard to BODYARMOR, notwithstanding the step-up in the discount rate, and that's reflected, as John talked earlier, in the charge. Notwithstanding that, we do see long-term value in the dual strategy, particularly in the U.S. between POWERADE and BODYARMOR. We're off to a good start with some of the plans the Zero Calorie version is ahead of expectations. The Flash I.V. has got some double-digit share. And the Sport Water version is one of the fastest-growing premium water brands.\n So some product innovation is getting some traction, a new partnership with NHL on the marketing front. And on the execution front, a stepping up of the merchandising and sales force focused directed just at the sports drinks category, which is helping improve the share trend in the category. Although not at the rate we had hoped initially, but we think we are in good shape going forward. Obviously, we'll have an opportunity with the Olympics to really continue to step that up. So plans in place across the product innovation, the marketing and the execution, and we think this will come to fruition over the course of the year. Sure. We'll let us go around Asia quickly. I mean China, we are cycling in the first quarter a very strong Chinese New Year first quarter from 2023. So I think we had a solid a solid quarter in China. We focus very well on having a good Chinese New with sparkling, which was good. We deprioritized some of the lower-value water in order to do so. And as we commented earlier, the Chinese confidence isn't as strongly rebounded as some of the other markets versus 2019. And so we see an overall environment where there'll be growth, perhaps not at the top historic levels, but there'll be growth.\n And so we're there we're very much focused on what we can control and the things we need to do. There's still huge opportunities in the Chinese marketplace, notwithstanding the macros. And there's a lot we can execute against in the marketing, in the innovation, in the execution in the marketplace, in the stores and with RGM. So there's a lot for us to achieve that's within our control in China.\n In the rest of Asia, we had a good quarter in Japan and South Korea. Good share gains, really starting to pick up the pace. Also, likewise, we had a strong performance in the Philippines, which is an important market for us, and so that was good in the quarter. The one that was atypical or at least compared to recent quarters was India had a slower start in January and February. As we've talked in previous calls, we're very bullish on the long-term prospects for the Indian business. \n And we're also very clear it's not going to be a straight line of metronomically consistent growth. And so it wasn't in the first quarter. It was a little softer January, February, but March and April have now bounced back. And so we expect to see India continue to have a strong year this year. Sure. EMEA, also this quarter had a whole series of moving pieces. As you started on price/mix, clearly, there's a number of countries in there with very high inflation. Not just Nigeria, but also Turkey and somewhat mathematically unlikely, some of the smaller African countries given the level of inflation can also make a difference to the pricing lever in the EMEA segment. So the EMEA segment has a substantive piece of pricing that is the inflationary marketplaces, including many markets you wouldn't normally suspect.\n And so that's a roundabout way of saying, actually, the -- in Europe, our pricing is much more normalized. And a bit like the U.S., we both see improved macros. Actually, I think that, today, a number of the markets came out and said they've come out of recession from the previous quarters. Like the U.S., we see the lower income consumers remaining under pressure. And at the margin, slightly more shift towards value-orientated channels, at-home orientated channels and lesser from the away-from-home. And clearly, that's related to our focus, not just on the marketing and the innovation with the RGM and affordability and driving premiumization.\n So Europe, not too dissimilar a story compared to the U.S. But the EMEA segment mix is in both the Middle East conflict and quite a number of the high-inflation countries. Yes. Look, clearly, both Trademark Coke, original taste, Coke Zero, have been having a good run over the last number of years and really focused on performance. But also perhaps unlike in times more recently passed, Sprite and Fanta have also been doing well. This has been a intentional focus for the company and the bottling system, which historically, we have looked at and managed sparkling altogether. \n And very deliberately a number of years ago, we separated to really focus in on Coke, Coke Trademark on its own with all the innovations, whether they be things like the K-Wave innovations, or continuing to focus on Coke Zero with updated -- the updated formulas or focusing on original case Coke with the Marvel activations that's just coming out. A real focus on Coke, and that has been part of what has driven success over the last number of years. And ultimately, for the company to do well, Coke has to do well. It's the kind of a mathematical certainty, and that has certainly been what's driving this.\n And then the separation of Sprite, Fanta and some of the regional brands particularly perhaps some of the Indian soft drink brands like Thums Up, have really got their own deserved focus. Actually, if you put all the flavored sparkling brands together, they would be one of their own big FMCG companies in their own right. \n And so really, what you're seeing is this focus on the formulas of Fanta and Sprite, really doing much better and being teamed up each time we've brought it to marketplace with a full marketing package. For example, Fanta in the U.S. had a good run as we updated the formula and relaunched the marketing.\n And so I think the -- it's been doing really well. I think the only a place where we've not succeeded, particularly with some of the flavors are in the Chinese marketplace, for example, given -- and that's really a Sprite question there. That we need to continue to focus on to do better with Sprite in China. But otherwise, Fanta, Sprite and particularly the Indian flavor brands have done very well, and of course, Coke is a pretty broad-based success story. Yes. So the simple answer is yes. We believe the businesses can continue to grow in Latin America, both in volume and revenue terms. It's been a long-term success part of the business with a very strong system between ourselves and the bottlers focused on the marketing, the innovation, the execution on the RGM. \n We'll continue to build on the recent year's momentum. Performance this quarter was strong in -- particularly in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia. Obviously, Argentina was impacted by the macroeconomic conditions. But we have a very tight system. We're very focused on what needs to be done and continuing to invest in capacity in order to continue to unlock the volume growth. Sure. I think the first thing is to bear in mind a certain segmentation of the innovation. And what I mean by that is you've got a strong focus on a part of the innovation that's around renovation of the core. So you get into kind of a question, okay, well, is the new Coke Zero formula or the updated Fanta formula backed with the new marketing campaign, is that -- you're going to count that as innovation or not. So the first thing is to understand that there's different types of innovation at play here all driving the business. One being. In a sense, the renovation of core brands.\n Secondly, our launch is intended to be ins and outs. So some of the Coke Creations, where really the focus is on reengaging with consumers in a novel way to drive relevance of the core brand. So you're not expecting it into the last. And then, of course, there are things we're putting into the marketplace that are new innovations, whether it would be something like a Minute Maid Zero Sugar or something like the Absolut SPRITE or the Jack Daniels and Coke. So these things -- and then, of course, you've got nonproduct-based innovation, like it's a new bottle size or a new can size. So we track across all these things.\n As it relates to product innovation, we have a very clear set of metrics on whether it's still growing on the fifth quarter after its launch. So is it cycling itself and continuing to accelerate. So there's a lot of cliometrics. But we do not set ourselves an artificial strategy objective of it has to be X percent from innovation. As it happens, about 25% of the growth comes from innovation, but it is not set that way. \n In the end, we are not setting ourselves up to sell what we make. We've got to sell what the consumers want to buy. So it's about doing justice to every brand and every idea and every package and every channel, and then service that resulting demand. If that is led by a great new innovation or by 138th year of classic Coke, then that's the answer. Yes, sure. Look, I think each part of the world is in its journey to continue to add value to the retail. Because in the end, this is about, together with the bottlers, making sure that we are adding value to the retailers business. Our objective at the retail level is to grow the beverage category faster than the average of their business, and for us to grow our portfolio of brands faster than the beverage category. \n And to do that, we've got to add more value, and that takes different forms in different places. And so as that happens, for example, the pre-sellers, they move from just order taking to account development. As AI comes in, it generates a suggested order for the retail outlet that is demonstrably more efficient in helping the retailer drive sales and then allows the salesperson to do more account development and to expand on different ideas.\n So at each stage, it's about taking the system capabilities to the next level so that we can continue to add value for the retailer. Everything that was done in the past starts to become the price of entry in the future, and so we need to keep adding value. And so I think there's a strong growth in capabilities all around the world specifically focused on the channel structure that the bottlers have in any given market. You have to speak up. We can't hear you. Yes. Sure. Yes, timing differences naturally reverse between concentrate units and unit cases. Partly, it happens when there is a different number of days in the quarter, then we have the -- we use the 445 system for all sorts of reasons. And what that causes sometimes is different numbers of shipping days in quarters. And so you undersell when you got less days, like the first quarter. And of course, in the fourth quarter this year when there's 2 extra days, there'll be way more concentrate units than there were cases, relatively speaking. So over the course of time, these anomalies or differences reverse themselves or average themselves out.\n And then as regards to the 2% volume, yes, look, I have a very strong view that the -- our overall ambition to see our revenue grow at the top end of the algorithm, I'm leaving aside the intense inflation countries for the sake of the argument at the moment, we want to grow at that 5% to 6% range. And we want that to have a balanced contribution from volume and price/mix. So implicitly, looking for 2% to 3% on volume. And I think we talked last quarter that in the current circumstances, that's likely to be slightly less volume and slightly more prices, as price inflation normalizes. And so I think that 2% is still pretty good number.\n It's certainly been the average growth rate in volume. If you take a compound number over the last number of years, you're going to get something like a 2%. So that seems to be the momentum we're driving. And that -- if you strip away the inflation and the weirdness in the first quarter, what you see is, you got that 1% volume, which given the Middle East headwind of 1% and actually recycling the strongest quarter last year, you can say it's a good volume number. It has good underlying price/mix in the normal countries. So the kind of the normal performance is right at the top end of the algorithm there, and then that feeds its way through to 7% EPS growth. So I think right in there, the main business, notwithstanding the kind of peripheral noise, is humming away right in line with where we said we wanted to be. Sure. I mean, clearly, in the case of the U.S., we've commented in previous calls, that our expectation would be modest, flat to modest growth in volume on a long-term basis in North America with good pricing. Clearly, that remains our overall ambition. Whether we get from the flat to something more positive in the rest of the year will obviously be a combination of what we execute against and the trajectory of the purchasing power of the economy in the balance of the year. But we're very focused on continuing to build the business, drive the revenue and continue to win in the marketplace. And we'll see where that nets out, too.\n And then in the case of where we were doing well and where not clearly, we had a strong quarter in terms of sparkling, in terms of some of the other categories in North America. Dairy, obviously, the fairlife additional charge, as John talked about, as the earnout is in its last year, very strong quarter on dairy, very strong on sparkling, actually good on juice. \n The water and the tea, and obviously, to some extent, obviously, the sports categories, were a little softer. Some of it on the water was selling less of the kind of the case pack water. And tea, I think it was very much a question, we just need to focus a little more on some of what needs to be done there. But it was more on the kind of the Fuze Tea end of the spectrum rather than the Gold Peak end of the spectrum, which tends to do better. I don't know if something was up with the line today that was very kind of broken up. But I think, Brett, you were asking about the digital experiences in B2B and what happens in shares in the category. There are multiple -- B2B is not a singular thing and the digital version of B2B is not a singular thing. There is a vast amount of B2B business that has been done for many years with direct order transfers, largely to large store modern retailers where order replenishment has a long-standing track record. And this is really focused on the efficiency of making sure the shelf is not out of stock from products. And it's more a process of support to what already goes on. And so actually, you see it's enabling the physical presence in the kind of the analog world, if you like.\n Of course, there's other types of B2B, for example, in the mom-and-pop stores, where we have moved heavily from a you have to wait for the pre-seller to appear type of relationship with the mom-and-pop stores to where that is complemented by some sort of ordering and relationship platform. They come in multiple guises, depending on where you are in the world, and the relative need and cost efficiency of doing so. But those platforms allow retailers effectively to be able to order, make additional orders 24/7, maybe even book servicing for their cold drink equipment, follow loyalty programs, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a lot of different types of B2B relationships.\n Generally speaking, they are supportive of us continuing to grow the relationship and to continue to do well. And -- but they are enabling rather than consumer facing, so the kind of the share is a little trickier to determine.\n Okay. I think that was the last one. To summarize, first quarter of the year, strong start, and we're confident we can continue to create value for the stakeholders and shareowners and deliver on our 2024 guidance. We'll continue to manage through the many different types of environments out there, but focus on leveraging our capabilities to drive what we can control to make sure we get growth.\n So thank you for your interest, your investment in the company and joining us this morning."

            "name": "John Murphy",
            "content": "Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results marked a continuation of the underlying momentum in our business, driven by a strong and focused system. We delivered another quarter of volume growth, even as we cycled strong results. Additionally, we completed the refranchising of several bottlers during the quarter, leading to further comparable margin expansion.\n We progressed on our refranchising agenda, while making sure we best position our system to deliver long-term growth, and we earn a fair return on our investments. We continue to invest behind our portfolio with discipline and flexibility, thanks to our enhanced resource allocation agenda.\n During the quarter, we grew organic revenues 11%. We had 1% unit case growth. Concentrate sales were behind unit case volume by 3 points, driven by 1 less day in the quarter and the timing of concentrate shipments, primarily in Mexico and the Middle East. \n Our price/mix growth of 13% in the quarter was driven by approximately 6 points of intense inflationary pricing across a handful of markets to offset significant currency devaluation, pricing actions across a number of markets and a couple of points of favorable mix.\n Excluding impacts from intense inflationary pricing, organic revenue growth in the first quarter was at the high end of our long-term growth algorithm. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 130 basis points driven by underlying expansion and a benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency headwinds.\n Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 60 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong top line growth and bottler refranchising, partially offset by currency headwinds and an increase in marketing investments. Markets experiencing intense inflation represent only a single-digit contribution to our volume, but continue to have an outsized impact on the shape of our P&L.\n Putting it all together, first quarter comparable EPS of $0.72 was up 7% year-over-year, including 9% currency headwinds, which were driven by currency devaluation in markets experiencing intense inflation. Free cash flow was approximately $160 million, an increase from the prior year.\n Before moving on, I want to discuss 2 items that are included in our first quarter reported results, a $765 million charge related to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability for our acquisition of fairlife. Our final payment related to the fairlife acquisition will take place in 2025. This payment has grown as fairlife has outperformed. We continue to be encouraged by our ability to scale fairlife organically.\n Secondly, a noncash impairment charge of $760 million related to BODYARMOR. While we are taking a charge to reflect revised projections and a higher discount rate since the acquisition date of BODYARMOR, we believe in the power of our 2 sports brand strategy with POWERADE and BODYARMOR. We're taking actions to help create long-term value, and we're seeing signs that this strategy is working.\n Our balance sheet remains strong and our net debt leverage of 1.6x EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. This gives us ample capacity for potential upcoming payments in 2024 related to the IRS tax case, which we continue to vigorously defend, and the upcoming fairlife payment in 2025.\n We continue to remain consistent in our approach to prioritizing our capital allocation. We're committed to investing to drive growth and to support our dividend, which we have raised for 62 consecutive years.\n We're confident our business model has the flexibility to allow us to deliver on our overall objectives. Our updated 2024 guidance reflects the underlying momentum of our business, and we now expect organic revenue growth of 8% to 9%, and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 11% to 13%. Our revised top line guidance is solely driven by higher-than-expected inflationary pricing in a handful of markets, which we expect to moderate throughout the year.\n Bottler refranchising is still expected to be a 4- to 5-point headwind to comparable net revenues and a 2-point headwind to comparable earnings per share, but will have a positive impact on both our margins and the return profile of our business. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate 4- to 5-point currency headwind to comparable net revenues, and an approximate 7 to 8-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024.\n This increase in currency headwind is driven by intense inflationary markets, while the rest of the currency basket is relatively neutral to our results.\n Our underlying effective tax rate for 2024 is now expected to be 19%. All in, we continue to expect comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5% versus $2.69 in 2023. There are some considerations to keep in mind. We estimate the ongoing conflict in the Middle East had approximately 1 point of impact on volume growth during the first quarter of 2024. It's unclear how long this impact will last. The cadence of structural impact will be larger in the second and third quarters due to the timing of transaction closing during the first quarter and the seasonality of the businesses we refranchised.\n Finally, there will be 2 additional days in the fourth quarter. To sum it up, and as James said, the year has started off well. We remain focused on the execution of our all-weather strategy. And thanks to the partnership of our system and the ongoing dedication of our people, we're confident we can create value for our stakeholders and deliver on our guidance for the year. And as we said at CAGNY, we're primed for performance in 2024 and over the long term.\n With that, operator, we are ready to take questions. Thanks, Bryan. So as we think about the full year, we're going to continue to have a tailwind from the refranchising work that we have discussed. And so I think that's going to flow through throughout the year. We expect to continue to have some expansion as reflected in our ongoing and the growth model, driven by both positive impacts and some productivity fee. The input horizon is more normalized. We do have some elevation on juice and sugar, which we'll continue to have. But the net of it all is that we'll have some tailwinds in the underlying area.\n Currency will continue to be a headwind, and you can kind of extrapolate that out for the year. So the net of it all is it will be primarily driven by the refranchising efforts positively, some underlying expansion, offset by the currency headwind. And as we reflected in our guidance, the top line growth continues to be a primary driver and the quality therein will -- I think will ensure that on a sustained basis, that expansion. Albeit not as potentially aggressive every quarter, but that expansion will be in our favor going forward. So the liability is very much linked to the ultimate performance. And as we close out this quarter, we're reflecting our latest and best estimates as to what that will be. The momentum of the business has been very strong. And actually, I think it's going to continue. And if anything, there may be some more upside. But for now, we're reflecting our best estimates for what that liability ultimately would be. Just to keep in mind that the liability will be -- it's an early 2025 ending to it. And we'll update as we go through this year in the event that the projections evolve. And if I may just add, James, I think one of the big changes in the last 3 to 5 years is that the ambition that we share, respectively, with all of our bottling partners is much more at the high end of what it should be than scattered. So I think that's -- and then it's working backwards from there as to what does it take to deliver that ambition. And yes, some are further along than others, but it's the ambition is that starting point that I think is helping to drive the progress that we're seeing each quarter. Yes. Actually, I think it does explain what's happened. I don't have the breakdown in front of me. But at the gross margin level, when you take into account the impact of currency, of some of the bottlers acquisitions that came back into our portfolio, that we're now in the process of refranchising and some of the other acquisitions, I think they have had a mechanical impact. And we can come back with a little bit more color on that. And then I think when you look at the operating income and how it flows down into operating income line, the primary driver are these items. So yes, I don't have it in front of me. We can follow up in a bit more detail. But yes, that's the story."
