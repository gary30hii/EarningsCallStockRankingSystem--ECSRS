A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Tom Long. You may begin.\nTom Long: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer fourth quarter 2020 earnings call, and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019m also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team, who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw our press release we issued earlier this afternoon, as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21-E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs, as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our Annual Report or Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2020, which we expect to be filed in the next several days. I\u2019ll also refer to adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow or DCF, and distribution coverage ratio, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You\u2019ll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'll start with our recent announcement. We were excited to announce that we have entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Enable Midstream Partners in a credit accretive all-equity transaction valued at $7.2 billion. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to free cash flow post distributions, have a positive impact on our credit metrics and add significant fee-based cash flows from fixed fee contracts. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Enable unitholders will receive 0.8595 ET common units for each Enable unit and exchange ratio representing an at-the-market transaction based on the 10-day VWAP of ET and Enable common units on February 12, 2021. In addition, each outstanding Enable\u2019s Series A preferred unit will be exchanged for 0.0265 Series G preferred units of Energy Transfer. These assets are a great fit to our system and will be very complementary. We expect this consolidation to provide increased scale in the Mid-Continet, Ark-La-Tex regions and improved connectivity for our natural gas and NGL transportation businesses. Through this acquisition, we will be adding substantial gathering and processing assets in the Anadarko Basin, which gives us the opportunity to enhance our ability to provide an integrated end-to-end midstream solution utilizing our downstream fractionation and export platform on the Gulf Coast. And the addition of Enable\u2019s crude gathering assets in the Bakken will help ensure wellhead to market connectivity via our Bakken pipeline system. Enable\u2019s transportation and storage assets are also expected to enhance our access to core markets with consistent sources of demand and bolster our portfolio with the addition of long-term firm contracts anchored by large investment-grade customers. Pro forma for the acquisition, we continue to expect to generate approximately 95% fee-based cash flows. In addition, we expect the combined company to generate more than $100 million of annual run rate cost and efficiency synergies, excluding potential financial and commercial synergies. The combination of Energy Transfer\u2019s and Enable\u2019s complementary assets will allow the combined company to leverage its extensive infrastructure to pursue additional commercial opportunities and achieve cost savings while enhancing our ability to serve customers. The transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors of Energy Transfer and Enable and Enable\u2019s two largest unitholders, OGE Energy Corp. and CenterPoint Energy Inc., have entered into support agreements that require them to provide their consent to the transaction upon SEC effectiveness of the Form S4 registration statement for this transaction. As these two unitholders own approximately 79% of the outstanding common units of Enable, no additional unitholder votes will be necessary upon receipt of these consents. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2021, subject to HSR and other customary closing conditions. We view this acquisition as a strategic opportunity to expand our scale and midstream connectivity, while remaining consistent with our goals of improving our financial position through deleveraging. Now I just want to briefly touch upon the unprecedented winter weather conditions we're currently seeing across the country. Just like the majority of our peers, we're experiencing impacts to our operations related to the extremely cold temperatures. But we believe our operations team is second to none, and their efforts over the last few days have been remarkable. They are in constant communication with our commercial teams, and are trying to do what is best for our customers, particularly those serving human needs, customers and electric generation facilities. The situation is changing constantly. And our team is addressing these challenges on an hour-by-hour basis as best as possible. Next, turning to a few of our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 highlights. For the full-year 2020, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $10.53 billion, which came in just above the top-end of our guidance range. DCF attributable to the partners of ET, as adjusted, was $5.74 billion, which resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $3.27 billion. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of approximately $215 million after distributions of $2.47 billion and growth capital of approximately $3.05 billion. As we discussed on previous calls during 2020, we implemented cost reduction measures throughout our corporate offices and field operations. For full-year 2020, we achieved G&A and OpEx savings of over $500 million. We expect about $300 million to $350 million of this to be reoccurring in 2021. Operationally, we moved a record number of NGLs through our pipelines for full-year 2020, primarily driven by our Mariner East and Texas NGL pipeline systems. And our fractionation volumes also reached a new high during 2020. Due to additional ramp up of volumes on Frac VII, which went into service in February of 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed construction of our 50,000 barrel per day LPG expansion at Marcus Hook terminal. Also during the fourth quarter, we were excited to complete the majority of our LPG expansions at our Nederland export terminal. And in January 2021, we announced that we loaded our first very large ethane carrier with 911,000 barrels under our orbit joint venture with Satellite. Briefly taking a look at guidance for 2021. Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $10.6 billion to $11 billion. Compared to 2020, we expect to see strong growth from our NGL segment, as increased export activities drive higher demand across our NGL system and we expect a positive contribution from NGL and gas prices. This growth will be partially offset by some headwinds related to crude spreads as well as a decrease from certain contract expirations. This guidance is for the existing Energy Transfer business excluding any contribution from Enable. We expect to provide pro forma financial information in the S4 when it is filed in the next few weeks. And for growth capital, we now expect 2021 growth capital expenditures to be approximately $1.45 million. This number includes approximately $250 million of 2020 plan capital that has been deferred into 2021. When accounting for this are updated 2021 capital guidance represents a further reduction of approximately $100 million to what had been previously communicated. We continue to focus on discipline in regards to all spending and all committed to aligning capital outlay with customer needs. Our 2021 growth capital expenditures are primarily made up of several projects within our NGL and refined products. Crude in midstream segments, additional model marination storage, BG facilities at niederlande and our Cushing to niederlande project. In addition to expanding our presence in the northeast and on the Gulf Coast, this spin will improve our opportunities around our existing assets, further strengthening our footprint in key basins, we continue to expect to spend approximately 500 to $700 million per year in 2022 and 2023. For 2021, we continue to expect to generate a significant amount of excess cash flow. This will be directly used to pay down debt balances and maturities as we continue to focus on accelerating debt reduction and achieving our leverage target of four to four and a half times on a rating agency basis. Once we have reached our leverage target, we will look to return additional capital to unitholders in the form of unit buybacks and or distribution increases with the mix depended upon our analysis of market conditions at the time. I'll now walk through recent developments on our major growth projects and we'll start with the DAPL. As you may recall, the District Court ruled last March that the Army Corps needed to prepare an environmental impact statement for the Dakota access pipeline, and then rolled in August that the easement that Dakota access received from the Army Corps at Lake Oahe be vacated and the pipeline shut down. The Army Corps appealed both of these decisions. And in January, the DC Court of Appeals affirmed the decision requiring the Army Corps to prepare an EIS, but overturn the decision to shut down the pipeline. Separately, the District Court is considering a motion filed by the tribes for an injunction for the purpose of shutting down the pipeline. Briefing was completed on this motion in early January, but the District Court has not ruled on this motion. Following the DC Court of Appeals decision that I just referred to the District Court ordered a status conference to discuss the injunction motion and the Army Corps position related to the vacated easement in light of the DC Court of Appeals decision. On February 9, the Army Corps requested that the status conference be postponed until April 9, and the District Court approved the motion. In the midst of these legal proceedings the Army Corps initiated the EIS process in September of last year, and we expect that the EIS will be completed by the end of this year. The pipeline remains in service and like all of our assets will continue to operate safely and efficiently. We do not see a scenario where the pipeline will be shut in we are still in America with Rule of Law. The Army Corps gave us guidance early on in the permit process, about the best locations to construct the pipeline to have the least impact on the environment. DAPL has been one of the most scrutinized, politicized, yet safest pipelines ever built in our country. It has been safely flowing for almost four years and is critical to this country for jobs, for tax revenue and for energy security and independence. Next, the TED Collins link will significantly increase the utilization of existing assets by repurposing our Eagle bond pipeline that was previously bringing barrels out of the Permian, while providing market connectivity between our Nederland and Houston terminals. It will ultimately allow us to transport up to 275,000 barrels of crude oil from West Texas and Nederland to our Houston terminal and is expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our cushing to Nederland project will provide the ability to move crude barrels from our White Cliffs pipeline and cushing storage assets through our existing Permian Express 1 pipeline system, and third-party pipelines to our Nederland terminal on the Gulf Coast. Upon completion in the second quarter of 2021, we will be able to transport between 65,000 and 120,000 barrels per day of crude oil from the DJ Basin in cushing area to Nederland. Now let's turn to our Mariner system. Fourth quarter 2020 NGL volumes through the Mariner East pipeline system increased more than 30% over the fourth quarter of 2019. Utilization of our Mariner pipelines and our Marcus Hook Terminal remained strong in the fourth quarter across all products. The system continues to demonstrate flexible optionality for shippers including the ability to handle ethane spot cargoes, as well as provide multiple local market connections for ethane, propane and butane. As I mentioned earlier on the call and December 2020, we commissioned 180 miles of [ME2X] from Delmont, Pennsylvania to Cornwall Pennsylvania And also placed our 50,000 barrels per day LPG expansion at the Marcus Hook terminal into service. And we now expect the next significant phase of the Mariner East projects to be in service in the second quarter of 2021. The completion of the next phase of Mariner East will also give us the ability to initiate service on Pennsylvania access, which will bring refined products from the Midwest supply regions through our Allegheny Access pipeline system into Pennsylvania into markets in the Northeast. This project will require minimal capital, which is already included in our budget, and we expect through time that it will add significant revenue and synergies with our existing refined products, pipelines and terminal assets. It is also expected to be in service in the second quarter of 2021. The final phase of the Mariner East pipeline is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2021. We also anticipate transporting natural gasoline through Mariner East beginning early in the second quarter of 2021. The Mariner system in conjunction with the Marcus Hook terminal continues to provide the most efficient transportation route for liquids in the Northeast, and provides customers the optimal way to reach the highest price markets for the product. As I mentioned earlier, during the fourth quarter, we completed expansions of our LPG facilities, along with the construction of a new 20-inch pipeline that directly links our fractionation and storage assets and Mont Belvieu, Texas, to our Nederland export terminals on the US Gulf Coast. The completion of these projects takes our LPG export capacity from the Gulf Coast to approximately 500,000 barrels per day for which we have significant demand. And finally, construction of our 180,000 barrels per day Orbit ethane export joint venture with Satellite petrochemical was completed at the end of 2020. We loaded our first very large ethane carrier with 911,000 barrels under this joint venture in 2021. The Seri Everest, the world's largest VLEC, departed from Orbit's newly constructed export facilities at our Nederland terminal as the largest single shipment of ethane today. We expect the next ship to arrive and Nederland for loading in March. With the completion of our LPG and Orbit expansions, we now have four separate NGL pipelines for ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline that connect our Mont Belvieu facilities to dedicated chilling storage and marine loading facilities at our Nederland terminal support enormous international demand for NGL exports. In addition, the completion of these expansion projects at are Nederland terminal as well as our expansion at our Marcus Hook terminal brings our total NGL export capacity to just over 1 million barrels per day. Next, just an update on our environmental activities. Last week, we announced that we have created an alternative energy group to focus on pursuing alternative energy projects and reducing our environmental footprint in a manner that makes economic sense. Tom Mason will be heading up this group and in this role he will be coordinating various initiatives within the partnership focused on renewable energy projects, such as solar and wind farms, either as a power purchaser or in partnership with third-party developers, and will also look to develop renewable diesel and renewable natural gas opportunities. These potential projects could involve the utilization of existing pipelines through our extensive pipeline system, which consists of more than 90,000 miles of pipelines crossing 38 states. Today, nearly 20% of the electrical energy we purchase off the grid and generate from solar panels originates from renewables. In November, we announced that we had entered into our first ever dedicated solar contract that will deliver 28 megawatts of low cost clean power to energy transfer under a 15-year power purchase agreement. Also, we're in advanced discussions to support a significantly larger solar project with a long-term power purchase agreement. As we think about emission reductions, our patented dual drive compression technology offers the industry a compression solution that helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2020, this technology allowed us to reduce scope one CO2 emissions by more than 630,000 tons. We have also implemented carbon capture sequestration at several of our existing trading and processing facilities that are already allowing us to sequester more than 85,000 metric tons of CO2 on an annual basis. And we are also actively pursuing numerous other carbon capture and sequestration projects related to our gathering and processing facilities that we believe will generate attractive returns through structures that would provide third-parties with the benefit of Federal tax credits and provide us with annual cash flows with very low capital requirements. Just touching briefly on our EHS metrics for 2020. Our total recordable incident rate or TRIR was a record low of 0.87 compared to 0.94 in 2019. And we worked over 17 million hours. We're extremely pleased with our team's ability reduced this metric, which speaks to their efforts and strong focus on safety and environmental compliance, as well as the reliability of our assets. Now, let's take a little closer look at our fourth quarter results. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $2.59 billion compared to $2.77 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019. This was primarily the result of volume growth on the Mariner system, the acquisition of new assets and lower operating expenses across all of our core operating segments, which were offset by decline in volumes in the crude and midstream segments as well as reduce optimization gains in the crude and NGL businesses. DCF attributable to the partners as adjusted was $1.36 billion for the fourth quarter compared to $1.51 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019. This is primarily due to the decrease in adjusted EBITDA. And on January 28, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $15.25 per ET common unit, or $0.61 on an annualized basis. This distribution will be paid on February the 19th to unitholders of record as of the close of business on February the 8th. Now turning to our results by segment, we'll start with NGL and refined products adjusted EBITDA was $703 million compared to $743 million for the same period last year. This decrease was primarily due to lower optimization gains from the sale of NGL components at Mont Belvieu, as well as lower margins from butane and gasoline blending, which were partially offset by higher fee-based margins from our Mariner system and Nederland terminal. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly-owned and joint venture pipelines increased to 1.4 million barrels per day, compared to 1.3 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to increased volumes on our Mariner East pipeline system, as well as increased throughput on our Texas NGL pipeline system as a result of higher export volumes feeding into our Nederland terminal from the initiation of service on our propane export pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2020. On our fractionators, average fractionated volumes increased to 825,000 barrels per day, compared to 734,000 barrels per day for the fourth quarter of 2019. For a crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $517 million, compared to $676 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to lower volumes on the back end in Texas crude pipelines as a result of lower production and reduced demand due to COVID-19 lower rates on our Texas crude pipelines, as well as a decrease in our crude oil acquisition and marketing businesses, primarily related to less favorable pricing conditions. For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $390 million compared to $397 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. This was primarily due to volume declines in lower NGL pricing, which were partially offset by reduced expenses. Gathered gas volumes were $12.6 million MMBTUs per day, compared to $14 million MMBTUs per day for the same period last year. Lower volumes in South Texas and in the Northeast were partially offset by volume growth in the Permian and Ark-La-Tex as well as the addition of assets acquired in 2019 in the Mid-continent, and Panhandle region. In our interstate segment adjusted EBITDA was $448 million compared to $434 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. This was primarily the result of reduced operating expenses, SG&A expenses and increase margin from the Transwestern Panhandle and Rover Systems due to increased demand in firm transportation. These were partially offset by scheduled contract rates stepped down in January 2020 at our Lake Charles LNG facility, as well as contract explorations on Tiger. In our interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $233 million compared to $222 million in the fourth quarter of last year, primarily due to higher physical storage margin from withdrawals and higher realized gains from our hedging activities, as well as reduced operating expenses. For 2021, we expect to have less exposure to spreads as we have locked in additional volumes under long-term contracts with third-parties. Let's look at CapEx, for the full-year, December 31, 2020, Energy Transfer spent $3.05 billion on organic growth projects primarily in the NGL and refined products and midstream segments. This excludes SUN and USAC CapEx. And we currently expect our 2021 growth capital expenditures to be approximately $1.45 billion and growth capital in 2022 and 2023 to be between $500 million and $700 million per year. Looking briefly at our liquidity position. As of December 31, 2020, total available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities was approximately $2.79 billion. And our leverage ratio was 4.31 times for the credit facility. For 2021, we have debt maturities of $1.4 billion, which will be more than covered with our retained cash flow. In conclusion, we believe there is increasing value to have a strong existing asset base, and will continue to strategically enhance our footprint and improve our industry leading franchise. Looking ahead, we are extremely excited about the acquisition of Enable, which will be credit accretive and provide meaningful incremental cash flows post distributions. In addition, these complimentary assets will enhance our midstream infrastructure and provide increased connectivity throughout the Mid-continent and Gulf Coast. We're also very excited about our NGL projects that we brought online in the fourth quarter and in the first month of 2021. And believe we are well positioned to help meet increasing demand for NGL exports. We are focused on exercising capital discipline as we work to create more financial flexibility, generate additional excess cash flow and lessen our cost of capital. And we remain committed to our investment grade rating and accelerating our deleveraging by immediately using excess cash flow to pay down debt. We're also taking new steps to expand our efforts to develop alternative energy projects when they make economic sense and to further our commitment to reducing our environmental impact. Energy Transfer\u2019s best-in-class assets and extensive geographical footprint positions the partnership to respond to changing market conditions and for continued long-term success. Operator, please open the line up for our first question.\nOperator: At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment please, while we pole for questions. Our first question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good afternoon.\nTom Long: Good afternoon.\nJeremy Tonet: I hope that everyone is well with weather and everything happening in Texas. Just wanted to get kind of a broader portfolio question out there with regards to \u2013 the higher commodity prices would seem to potentially induce greater producer activity. And just wondering, how your producer conversations might have been evolving recently on that front with higher commodity prices there? And then just wondering as well, the recent weather, if that \u2013 if you see any kind of lingering impacts in the quarter just if you could walk through how you think that could be an offset there?\nMackie McCrea: You bet, I can take that, Tom. Certainly, the last four or five days has hopefully opened up the reality of the necessity of natural gas for electric generation for our country and especially here in Texas and Oklahoma and surrounding states. Yes, commodity prices had continued - have grown over the last two or three months, crude oil has continued to increase. We've got a higher demand, a lot of the vaccines everything over the country. But what this really does, what's happened over the last four or five days, I mean, if, for example, if you ask Oklahoma, would you guys wish I had more gas, because they can't run \u2013 they can\u2019t generate enough electricity to - similar to Texas to provide the necessary electricity to run homes and for the LDCs to provide gas to their residential. So it's a tough situation. But we already had seen the corner kind of turning with some of our producers. Some of them have said things publicly, some of them haven't said it publicly how they're going to increase kind of their spending in light of crude oil increases. And no doubt what's transpired over the last few days, we're going to see an increase in gas prices. We've been at kind of historical levels for the last number of years above the five-year average and storage, for example. And we don't know where it's going to end up when it does settles after all this, but it'll be hard to believe it's not going to be at a lower level, it's been a long time. So heaven forbid, if another cold front hits in a week or two because there\u2019s - storage is going to be running at very low level. So the value of oil and gas is going to do nothing but increase, we believe, we do believe this is going to help producers to go out and bring their ducks on and start bringing more rigs in like they've kind of been doing over the last four or five months. So as I start out saying, this has really opened my eyes, I think of the country of the necessity of oil and gas and especially natural gas in this instance to provide fuel for our electric generation facilities throughout the country really.\nJeremy Tonet: Certainly highlights the value of hydrocarbons there, as you said. Maybe shifting gears a little bit. In the press release this morning, I think, ET had mentioned the $100 million of annual run rate cost and efficiency synergies. And talked about, I guess, connecting now the Anadarko footprint to the Gulf Coast \u2013 your Gulf Coast footprint there. I was just wondering if you could expand a lot more on the map. The synergies you see there on the map, it looks like it lines up nicely, but just hoping for some more color would be helpful? Thanks.\nMackie McCrea: So \u2013 yes.\nTom Long: Yes, Jerry. Go ahead, Mackie. Go ahead.\nMackie McCrea: Well, I was going to let you kind of talk about the $100 million of synergies. But if you're talking about just the commercial synergies, gosh, we haven't really even began to evaluate and fully appreciate what we're going to recognize from this acquisition. It's an absolutely incredible acquisition at a very unique time when I just said the necessity for natural gas is going to nothing but grow not only in this country, but around the world. And these assets are the most significant assets in the State of Oklahoma and throughout the Ark-La-Tex, they fit very well with our assets. And everybody knows there's large pipeline that brings rich gas down into the fourth basin that delivers into our processing plants and then feeds into our downstream pipelines. There's a lot of opportunities over in Western Oklahoma and Texas, Panhandle where we can create significant efficiency between these assets. There's large intrastate pipelines that feed across the State and into Bennington that connect into our interstate pipelines. And then we have significant synergies from Carthage and throughout Louisiana. And we have some new opportunities with MRT and in new deliveries to the north. So, as I mentioned, we really haven't totally quantified from a commercial standpoint. What all is going to happen with this and all the benefits that we're going to see. But - and there's a lot from commercial, I mean, I'm sorry from competitive standpoint we won't really talk about, but we certainly will also have the ability to move natural gas liquids from the tailgate a lot of these Enable plants into our NGL system to feed down to Mont Belvieu to keep our fracs for many years to come.\nTom Long: Exciting, exciting news for us.\nJeremy Tonet: Great. Thanks for that and wishing the best to all of you and your families.\nTom Long: You too.\nOperator: And our next question is from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nShneur Gershuni: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Glad to see you're all warm and well. Maybe just to clarify your response to Jeremy's question before I jump into my two. So the $100 million in synergies is cost-related and, Mackie, you're seeing incremental commercial revenue-type opportunities that you haven't actually put on paper yet? Is that the correct answer?\nMackie McCrea: That's correct.\nShneur Gershuni: Okay, perfect. Awesome. Just starting off with, with guidance here. I was wondering if I'm not sure if it's an accurate term question here. But if you can talk around \u2013 talk about the sensitivities around achieving potentially the high end of your guidance, billion dollars? Is that really just driven based on commodity prices in spreads? Or is there some flex in your guidance volumetrically or elsewhere that would allow you to achieve the high end of your guidance?\nMackie McCrea: Well, Tom, I can start from a commercial perspective and I've kind of alluded to that earlier. We did see volumes kind of struggle, especially in Eagle Ford and few other areas, as we went through the fourth quarter of 2020. However, we started to kind of see the light at the end of the tunnel, and we started to see rigs start moving in throughout last year. And we as we've entered into 2021, there has been some public statements made, where producers have announced they're going to increase their capital budget, not a lot, but some. And then we've had conversations with a bunch of producers that are now anticipating spending more than what they've even made public. Of course, we can't share that. But anyway, there's a lot of optimism because of what's happening to the markets and the demand growing and the value of oil and gas increasing that we are very confident that drilling is going to pick up. In addition to that, we are excited about our NGL projects. We have a lot of that in our budget. However, we are going to be able to squeeze out even more volume out of both our Marcus Hook facility and out of Nederland. So we're very optimistic on being able to really capitalize and maximize our ability to export around the world out of those significant terminals. So we really see some upside there. And then we've also, of course, seen some upside just over the last four or five days, we've seen some, when you the one thing that everybody's recognizing I've already said, we all know on this call how important fossil fuels are for this country in this world. But what's really important to is to be able to get the fossil fuels to the market. And if there's one thing Energy Transfer does better than anybody especially in Texas and really throughout the country is to move molecules from the source to where they go. And so we've been able to benefit over the last four or five days of being one of the major providers of transportation across the state from both not only West Texas, but also from the Carthage area where there can be large volumes come in and out of those areas. And we're able to move those down to what we've really focused on. And that's getting gas to the human needs customers. So a lot of the sales both on purchases that we're making and others are making on our system, and the sales that we're making out of our storage facilities and we have one of the most significant source facilities in the state, just north of Houston. And we've been maximizing our withdrawals and capitalizing on very strong commodity prices because we already had all that gas in the ground ready to come out in this type of situation. And it's really paid-off even though our state as well as much a nation is struggling and a lot of people don't have electricity and gas, a lot of them do. And it's because of our ability to bring a lot of gas out of our storage facilities in other areas on our pipeline system and deliver them to all these power plants that are generating this electricity.\nShneur Gershuni: Thank you for the thorough answer there. And maybe a follow up question with respect to the Enable transaction. I recognize that most of the rating agencies today you have basically opined kind of unchanged as to where it stands. You noted in your prepared remarks and in the slide deck that it's supposed to be leveraged accretive. Just wondering on the margin if you can comment about what was the feedback from the agencies, does the larger sized Energy Transfer, improve your standing with the agencies? Does the dilution of the potential DAPL outcome help you at all the fact that you're going to have a higher regulated percentage of earnings? Just kind of curious on how the transaction was perceived? Even if we can see specifically a change announced today, does it move the chains up the field at all? I'm just wondering if you can speculate about this.\nTom Long: Yes, we did have very good conversations with all three of them, I think you touched upon the fact that all three have put out little reports on this. And I think it's fair to say that it was slightly positive, I think the analogy you used, kind of moving the change down the field a little bit. Clearly, all the stuff that Mackie just covered of how excited we are about the additional opportunities we're looking at, we were very conservative and how we really looked at this. We think that as we get in and bring more of the commercial teams, over the fence, operation teams et cetera. And move further into this, that we're going to be able to get back with the agencies of, possibly even improved type numbers. But right now, we feel like the $100 million was right down the middle of the fairway, likewise we are looking for more but the agencies it was, I think, very good discussions with all three.\nShneur Gershuni: Perfect. Thank you very much. And definitely stay safe and stay warm in this weather.\nTom Long: Thank you.\nMackie McCrea: You too.\nOperator: Our next question is from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nChristine Cho: Thank you. Good evening. Maybe if I could start-off with the Enable deal. Would you say that the deal has more commercial synergies on the gas side or the NGL side from a financial perspective? And you noted fractionation and exports, in the press release is an opportunity. But could there also be NGL takeaway? And would there be like, what would be the timing? Would any of that be immediate or do you have to wait for third-party contracts?\nMackie McCrea: This is Mackie again. I'll start with that, Tom. Well, there is certainly some confidentiality, issues with statements we can make around contracts, of course, and all that kind of stuff. But I'll start with gas, there is significant gas opportunities there, as we've already talked about, just with how their pipelines feed into our pipelines, both upstream and downstream, where we can actually utilize plants up in the fourth base and more efficiently in the pipelines more efficiently. So a lot of upside around the natural gas side and the gas gathering side. As far as the NGL side. More of the opportunities that we see or down the road a little bit as contracts roll-off. But as they do, we'll be able to connect the dots so to speak to where we can move those barrels down into our significant Lone Star system where we have a 30 inch that runs out of fourth basin area all the way down Mont Belvieu. So we'll be able to bring significant volumes, not only from in the Enable cryos, but also from other cryos. And so we really see the NGL side more of a big benefit several years down the road, and then extending for many years after that. Whereas the natural gas to gas gathering the processing and the natural gas side is more immediate benefits and synergies that we see.\nChristine Cho: Okay, that's great. And then actually, if I can move on to DAPL, does that status conference hearing need to happen in order for the District Court to make a decision? I wasn't sure if the two were independent of each other or not. And how does it work at the Army Corps? If they need to tell the court what their action is going to be? Who necessarily decides it within the Army Corps? Is it the chief or is there someone else or is there some sort of committee? Any insight into that process would be helpful?\nTom Long: Tom Mason?\nTom Mason: Yes, Tom Mason, General Counsel. With respect to your first question, it's unclear whether the two are dependent on each other. The judge could rule on the injunction motion without having the status conference, I think he probably wants to wait until that conference or after for various reasons. And so it just little bit hard to predict. But I would say that there's more likely he would wait until after that status conference, even, some period after that. So he may not rule for a long time we still know. On the second question, it's clear as to what who's making the decision. So the Army Corps, I think we they've been very professional throughout the last five years of our dealings with them. And they, if left alone from political interference, I think we will continue to make good decisions as they proceed.\nChristine Cho: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good evening everyone. Hope everyone's doing well. Maybe just to stay on, on Dakota Access and the Army Corps. Do you know if the Army Corps under the new administration is going to incorporate climate change analysis into the EIS? And if so, is that factored into your timeline that you provide it for when you think EIS gets completed?\nTom Mason: This time Tom Mason again. We really don't know and obviously, the Biden administration is put out a deck of orders to talk about agencies evaluating climate change in the number of decision making. I don't know this will affect the EIS process, at all. It's too early to tell on that.\nMichael Blum: Okay, and then just have a quick question on the Enable transaction. Are you contemplating possibly rationalizing any processing capacity in the Mid-continent? It seems like there's a lot of excess capacity there. And then sort of related to that perhaps, with this transaction, do you see anything as non-core that you might look to monetize some assets?\nTom Long: Michael, this is Tom, I'll run with this. And Mackie, if you want to add something. As we went through this process, we saw these assets as actually is very complimentary. So I can say that we have that mapping identified as far as divestitures, whether it be for, or even identified as non-core as we say here right now.\nMichael Blum: Great, thank you.\nTom Long: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein, please, proceed with your question.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Okay. I'm glad that you guys all have power. One on the Enable deal, as the bucking crew gathering system already moving down DAPL or would those be new volumes for DAPL?\nTom Long: I don't know, I'm not 100% sure. All of that's moving us. I think the vast majority of it is, but I'm not sure if 100% of it is.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Okay, that makes sense. And then just wanted to dig a little bit more about some of the major assumptions and the 2021 guide. So I guess most importantly, are there any kind of numbers that you could give around what you're expecting for U.S. crude production growth or Permian crude production growth year-on-year to just kind of level set versus other people's guidance?\nTom Long: And I'm sorry, the question is, what's our projections for Permian crude growth?\nJean Ann Salisbury: Yes or U.S. growth from 2020 to 2021 that drives your guidance?\nTom Long: Yes, we're pretty conservative. When you look at kind of across the board on that right now, for example, the Permian crudes around for 4.1 million-ish, maybe a little more than that. We don't expect it to get more than about 4.4 million barrels a day by the end of the year. But there's a lot of good things happening. For example, if you look at just a year ago, if you look at the floating crude around the world, there was about 90 million barrels. In July of last year, there was 230 million barrels, and now we're back down to about 90 million barrels. As we keep saying earlier on this call, we're very optimistic about the turnaround in the market growth. So we do think that pricing will increase production. As far as total U.S. growth, I don't know I don't really have an estimate on that. Other than probably a summer type growth where it might be a 2% or 3% type number.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Okay, that makes sense. And then just a couple other assumptions in the 2021 guide. Is DAPL expansion in there?\nTom Long: Yes, DAPL is included. Absolutely.\nJean Ann Salisbury: And then last, DAPL expansion?\nTom Long: Yes.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Okay, great. And then last one is on have you received all of the Bakken crude MBC and flex payments from kind of earlier this year, or did some of those go into 2021 guidance?\nTom Long: No, none of those are rolled over. Yes, we will get on all those in 2020.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Next question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lapides: Hi, guys, actually, a couple of questions. First of all, on crude spreads are obviously de-minimis right now in a lot of different places. But just curious in the other businesses, especially given what's happening gas over the last four or five days, where do you see potential dramatic changes relative to what you realized in 2020, in terms of optimization revenues, whether up or down?\nMackie McCrea: Well, it\u2019s Mackie again. As I mentioned earlier, because of the nature of our assets, and how we operate them and where they're located, especially our storage facilities, we feel very fortunate to be able to have gas in storage at a time when it's needed in a big way and to be able to come out at whatever the market prices are at that time. And unfortunately, from that standpoint, prices are really strong, they're kind of at historical levels, especially as you get up into Oklahoma and we've heard prices, over $1,200 a MCF up there. But anyway, in Texas alone, our assets are doing exceptionally well. At tough time we hate what's going on around the country in this state. But we're doing everything we possibly can to pull gas out of storage and deliver it to the power plants into the LDCs. And also to find gas, Waha or Carthage bring as much as we can in off Tiger and other pipelines to feed our need here in the state. Because we're really short of gas because so much gas is shut in from the producers, especially out in West Texas. From a financial standpoint, we're doing pretty well, because of the nature of our assets, where they sit and how we're able to perform in this type of situation.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And then you all have talked in the -- and you put out the release last week about kind of the increased attention on kind of alternative energy of renewable energy related. And I can understand pretty quickly what your competitive advantage or how you would utilize existing assets for things like renewable diesel or renewable natural gas? What is your competitive advantage to do more traditional renewables like wind or solar? Like, what do you bring in that table necessarily that other potential developers of that can't bring themselves?\nMackie McCrea: Yes. So on the first part of your question, I guess the point you're making is with our inter and interstate systems, we are able to move around renewables because yes, okay, we have LDCs that are asking for today on interstates, but not a lot. I mean, a wind, we're struggling with wind quite honestly, it's hard for us to figure out how to make that work. And we're not going to do anything that doesn't make good economic sense for unitholders. Solar is different if we can go out and acquire solar in areas where there's a lot of sunshine, like out in West Texas and, and also in other parts of Texas, we'll certainly do that. Because when we were doing it, we're a large consumer of electricity throughout the country, but especially in Texas and when you can build in a solar priced, very inexpensive supply of electricity. It just makes sense. So that's really our fit. I don't know if we'll ever get involved as far as investing in a solar project because the returns are so much, there's so much less than what we can achieve with other opportunities we have. But we certainly will support solar projects that will provide us with 10, 15 years of what we believe to be very inexpensive power.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you guys. Much appreciated.\nOperator: Our next question is from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Stanley: Hi, thanks. First, just wanted to confirm there's no lockup period or anything on the unit CenterPoint and OGE will receive in the transaction.\nTom Long: That is correct, Keith.\nKeith Stanley: Okay, great. And the 2021 guidance so you reference the lower crude spreads and contract expirations as a driver for the year. Do you expect that to continue to be a driver in 2022 and beyond or are we most of the way there now on Permian crude margins kind of resetting to market conditions.\nMackie McCrea: Yes, I think where the spreads have kind of fallen to now it's about as low as they can go. As we've mentioned on prior calls and conversations, so we're doing a lot to figure out a way to make as much of the value stream as we can all the way from the wellheads out in New Mexico and West Texas, all the way to the refineries up and in the main continent, by utilizing our permit express assets and our Mid Valley assets. So, we are believing that we're kind of at the bottom as far as the spreads go, but we also are continue to work with others to evaluate things that we could possibly do together. And we're looking at converting some of our assets, our crude assets to other uses, that would be more profitable and more efficient for our company. But yes, we've kind of seen it, get about as bad as they can get, and you're down to not much spread across the state, but we're doing everything we can to take advantage of that. In fact, we've kind of got a new team, that's, that's heading that up. It's running our crew group and very pleased on just the early results, just this year, where we've increased our cross-haul, fairly significantly from where we kind of ended up in the fourth quarter of next year. There's a lot of crude companies out there battling for the crude that is available out in the Permian Basin, we're probably a 1 million, 1.5 million barrels less out there than where we thought we'd be a year and a half ago. And there's more capacity built, of course, significantly more than it was a year and a half ago. So we're all scrambling for less barrels, but there's no company that can take the barrel, so many different places, like we can. So we feel like we've got to get advantage and we're going to take advantage of that.\nKeith Stanley: Thanks for that color. If I could sneak in one other quick one and appreciate the commentary on the company doing pretty well through this unfortunate event in Texas. On the electricity side, just a curious question, do you typically buy power in Texas at spot market rates or are you more on fixed rate type contracts for your electricity needs?\nMackie McCrea: With a variety, in fact, fortunately, we have quite a bit of our megawatts hedged, which has been extremely fortunate today, during the last four or five days, and then we have a variety of different ways we do buy a lot on a day-to-day basis. And we do have some packages bought for different terms. So it's kind of a myriad of different ways we buy it.\nKeith Stanley: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Pearce Hammond with Simmons Energy. Please proceed with your question.\nPearce Hammond: Yes, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. Investor sentiment, specifically EMT investors. It's kind of moved away from the scoop stack play in Oklahoma and toward the Permian over the past few years. And so as it pertains to the Enable acquisition, what gets you comfortable with the scoop stack assets and continued producer activity on those assets over the longer term or essentially, what do you think investors not fully understand or appreciate about the Enable assets? Thank you.\nMackie McCrea: Tom you want to take that.\nTom Long: Yes. Mackie. I think the bottom line, the way we look at it is the reserves are there. So if we see something like what happened during the pandemic in the whole country's hit, certainly that will flow down a lot quicker than, say the Permian Basin. But as we see commodity prices recover, and especially the levels that we have now, where we see natural gas prices, not going just higher the rest of this year because of what's happened in the calendar reality of the demand for natural gas, but there's going to be growing demand for natural gas around the world. I mean, it's the cleanest, best way to fuel enormous amounts of electricity. And it's just going to be something that we are very optimistic, and our big believers is going to be a big growth area for the world, including the U.S. of course, and the reserves are there. I mean, the reserves are in this scoop and in the stack, they're in Oklahoma base and they're over by the Panhandle and as long as commodity prices stay up, and at reasonable levels, we think that's an area where rig will move backhanding and grow production for many years to come. It doesn't take a lot of rigs, I'm sure Enable has said this and we'll say, it doesn't take a lot of rigs on their system to provide volume growth for their system. So if we get back any kind of type of normality of where we were a year and a half ago, we're going to see tremendous growth through those assets. So, we're very excited about owning these in the future because of the need for natural gas and oil, in our opinion for many years to come.\nPearce Hammond: Well, thank you Mackie. Appreciate it.\nMackie McCrea: You bet.\nTom Long: Operator, the last of our questions. Well, it looks like maybe we lost the operator. I'll go ahead for those that are still on and we're still connected. Thank all of you for your support. We thank you for joining us today. And we clearly look forward to talking to you about a lot of the exciting stuff that we have happening and of course that will continue to file our S4 just as soon as possible and have more information to be able to share with you. Thanks, everyone. Stay safe, stay warm.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Long",
            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer fourth quarter 2020 earnings call, and thank you for joining us today. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team, who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw our press release we issued earlier this afternoon, as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21-E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs, as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our Annual Report or Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2020, which we expect to be filed in the next several days. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow or DCF, and distribution coverage ratio, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'll start with our recent announcement. We were excited to announce that we have entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Enable Midstream Partners in a credit accretive all-equity transaction valued at $7.2 billion. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to free cash flow post distributions, have a positive impact on our credit metrics and add significant fee-based cash flows from fixed fee contracts. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Enable unitholders will receive 0.8595 ET common units for each Enable unit and exchange ratio representing an at-the-market transaction based on the 10-day VWAP of ET and Enable common units on February 12, 2021. In addition, each outstanding Enable's Series A preferred unit will be exchanged for 0.0265 Series G preferred units of Energy Transfer. These assets are a great fit to our system and will be very complementary. We expect this consolidation to provide increased scale in the Mid-Continet, Ark-La-Tex regions and improved connectivity for our natural gas and NGL transportation businesses. Through this acquisition, we will be adding substantial gathering and processing assets in the Anadarko Basin, which gives us the opportunity to enhance our ability to provide an integrated end-to-end midstream solution utilizing our downstream fractionation and export platform on the Gulf Coast. And the addition of Enable's crude gathering assets in the Bakken will help ensure wellhead to market connectivity via our Bakken pipeline system. Enable's transportation and storage assets are also expected to enhance our access to core markets with consistent sources of demand and bolster our portfolio with the addition of long-term firm contracts anchored by large investment-grade customers. Pro forma for the acquisition, we continue to expect to generate approximately 95% fee-based cash flows. In addition, we expect the combined company to generate more than $100 million of annual run rate cost and efficiency synergies, excluding potential financial and commercial synergies. The combination of Energy Transfer's and Enable's complementary assets will allow the combined company to leverage its extensive infrastructure to pursue additional commercial opportunities and achieve cost savings while enhancing our ability to serve customers. The transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors of Energy Transfer and Enable and Enable's two largest unitholders, OGE Energy Corp. and CenterPoint Energy Inc., have entered into support agreements that require them to provide their consent to the transaction upon SEC effectiveness of the Form S4 registration statement for this transaction. As these two unitholders own approximately 79% of the outstanding common units of Enable, no additional unitholder votes will be necessary upon receipt of these consents. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2021, subject to HSR and other customary closing conditions. We view this acquisition as a strategic opportunity to expand our scale and midstream connectivity, while remaining consistent with our goals of improving our financial position through deleveraging. Now I just want to briefly touch upon the unprecedented winter weather conditions we're currently seeing across the country. Just like the majority of our peers, we're experiencing impacts to our operations related to the extremely cold temperatures. But we believe our operations team is second to none, and their efforts over the last few days have been remarkable. They are in constant communication with our commercial teams, and are trying to do what is best for our customers, particularly those serving human needs, customers and electric generation facilities. The situation is changing constantly. And our team is addressing these challenges on an hour-by-hour basis as best as possible. Next, turning to a few of our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 highlights. For the full-year 2020, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $10.53 billion, which came in just above the top-end of our guidance range. DCF attributable to the partners of ET, as adjusted, was $5.74 billion, which resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $3.27 billion. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of approximately $215 million after distributions of $2.47 billion and growth capital of approximately $3.05 billion. As we discussed on previous calls during 2020, we implemented cost reduction measures throughout our corporate offices and field operations. For full-year 2020, we achieved G&A and OpEx savings of over $500 million. We expect about $300 million to $350 million of this to be reoccurring in 2021. Operationally, we moved a record number of NGLs through our pipelines for full-year 2020, primarily driven by our Mariner East and Texas NGL pipeline systems. And our fractionation volumes also reached a new high during 2020. Due to additional ramp up of volumes on Frac VII, which went into service in February of 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed construction of our 50,000 barrel per day LPG expansion at Marcus Hook terminal. Also during the fourth quarter, we were excited to complete the majority of our LPG expansions at our Nederland export terminal. And in January 2021, we announced that we loaded our first very large ethane carrier with 911,000 barrels under our orbit joint venture with Satellite. Briefly taking a look at guidance for 2021. Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $10.6 billion to $11 billion. Compared to 2020, we expect to see strong growth from our NGL segment, as increased export activities drive higher demand across our NGL system and we expect a positive contribution from NGL and gas prices. This growth will be partially offset by some headwinds related to crude spreads as well as a decrease from certain contract expirations. This guidance is for the existing Energy Transfer business excluding any contribution from Enable. We expect to provide pro forma financial information in the S4 when it is filed in the next few weeks. And for growth capital, we now expect 2021 growth capital expenditures to be approximately $1.45 million. This number includes approximately $250 million of 2020 plan capital that has been deferred into 2021. When accounting for this are updated 2021 capital guidance represents a further reduction of approximately $100 million to what had been previously communicated. We continue to focus on discipline in regards to all spending and all committed to aligning capital outlay with customer needs. Our 2021 growth capital expenditures are primarily made up of several projects within our NGL and refined products. Crude in midstream segments, additional model marination storage, BG facilities at niederlande and our Cushing to niederlande project. In addition to expanding our presence in the northeast and on the Gulf Coast, this spin will improve our opportunities around our existing assets, further strengthening our footprint in key basins, we continue to expect to spend approximately 500 to $700 million per year in 2022 and 2023. For 2021, we continue to expect to generate a significant amount of excess cash flow. This will be directly used to pay down debt balances and maturities as we continue to focus on accelerating debt reduction and achieving our leverage target of four to four and a half times on a rating agency basis. Once we have reached our leverage target, we will look to return additional capital to unitholders in the form of unit buybacks and or distribution increases with the mix depended upon our analysis of market conditions at the time. I'll now walk through recent developments on our major growth projects and we'll start with the DAPL. As you may recall, the District Court ruled last March that the Army Corps needed to prepare an environmental impact statement for the Dakota access pipeline, and then rolled in August that the easement that Dakota access received from the Army Corps at Lake Oahe be vacated and the pipeline shut down. The Army Corps appealed both of these decisions. And in January, the DC Court of Appeals affirmed the decision requiring the Army Corps to prepare an EIS, but overturn the decision to shut down the pipeline. Separately, the District Court is considering a motion filed by the tribes for an injunction for the purpose of shutting down the pipeline. Briefing was completed on this motion in early January, but the District Court has not ruled on this motion. Following the DC Court of Appeals decision that I just referred to the District Court ordered a status conference to discuss the injunction motion and the Army Corps position related to the vacated easement in light of the DC Court of Appeals decision. On February 9, the Army Corps requested that the status conference be postponed until April 9, and the District Court approved the motion. In the midst of these legal proceedings the Army Corps initiated the EIS process in September of last year, and we expect that the EIS will be completed by the end of this year. The pipeline remains in service and like all of our assets will continue to operate safely and efficiently. We do not see a scenario where the pipeline will be shut in we are still in America with Rule of Law. The Army Corps gave us guidance early on in the permit process, about the best locations to construct the pipeline to have the least impact on the environment. DAPL has been one of the most scrutinized, politicized, yet safest pipelines ever built in our country. It has been safely flowing for almost four years and is critical to this country for jobs, for tax revenue and for energy security and independence. Next, the TED Collins link will significantly increase the utilization of existing assets by repurposing our Eagle bond pipeline that was previously bringing barrels out of the Permian, while providing market connectivity between our Nederland and Houston terminals. It will ultimately allow us to transport up to 275,000 barrels of crude oil from West Texas and Nederland to our Houston terminal and is expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our cushing to Nederland project will provide the ability to move crude barrels from our White Cliffs pipeline and cushing storage assets through our existing Permian Express 1 pipeline system, and third-party pipelines to our Nederland terminal on the Gulf Coast. Upon completion in the second quarter of 2021, we will be able to transport between 65,000 and 120,000 barrels per day of crude oil from the DJ Basin in cushing area to Nederland. Now let's turn to our Mariner system. Fourth quarter 2020 NGL volumes through the Mariner East pipeline system increased more than 30% over the fourth quarter of 2019. Utilization of our Mariner pipelines and our Marcus Hook Terminal remained strong in the fourth quarter across all products. The system continues to demonstrate flexible optionality for shippers including the ability to handle ethane spot cargoes, as well as provide multiple local market connections for ethane, propane and butane. As I mentioned earlier on the call and December 2020, we commissioned 180 miles of [ME2X] from Delmont, Pennsylvania to Cornwall Pennsylvania And also placed our 50,000 barrels per day LPG expansion at the Marcus Hook terminal into service. And we now expect the next significant phase of the Mariner East projects to be in service in the second quarter of 2021. The completion of the next phase of Mariner East will also give us the ability to initiate service on Pennsylvania access, which will bring refined products from the Midwest supply regions through our Allegheny Access pipeline system into Pennsylvania into markets in the Northeast. This project will require minimal capital, which is already included in our budget, and we expect through time that it will add significant revenue and synergies with our existing refined products, pipelines and terminal assets. It is also expected to be in service in the second quarter of 2021. The final phase of the Mariner East pipeline is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2021. We also anticipate transporting natural gasoline through Mariner East beginning early in the second quarter of 2021. The Mariner system in conjunction with the Marcus Hook terminal continues to provide the most efficient transportation route for liquids in the Northeast, and provides customers the optimal way to reach the highest price markets for the product. As I mentioned earlier, during the fourth quarter, we completed expansions of our LPG facilities, along with the construction of a new 20-inch pipeline that directly links our fractionation and storage assets and Mont Belvieu, Texas, to our Nederland export terminals on the US Gulf Coast. The completion of these projects takes our LPG export capacity from the Gulf Coast to approximately 500,000 barrels per day for which we have significant demand. And finally, construction of our 180,000 barrels per day Orbit ethane export joint venture with Satellite petrochemical was completed at the end of 2020. We loaded our first very large ethane carrier with 911,000 barrels under this joint venture in 2021. The Seri Everest, the world's largest VLEC, departed from Orbit's newly constructed export facilities at our Nederland terminal as the largest single shipment of ethane today. We expect the next ship to arrive and Nederland for loading in March. With the completion of our LPG and Orbit expansions, we now have four separate NGL pipelines for ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline that connect our Mont Belvieu facilities to dedicated chilling storage and marine loading facilities at our Nederland terminal support enormous international demand for NGL exports. In addition, the completion of these expansion projects at are Nederland terminal as well as our expansion at our Marcus Hook terminal brings our total NGL export capacity to just over 1 million barrels per day. Next, just an update on our environmental activities. Last week, we announced that we have created an alternative energy group to focus on pursuing alternative energy projects and reducing our environmental footprint in a manner that makes economic sense. Tom Mason will be heading up this group and in this role he will be coordinating various initiatives within the partnership focused on renewable energy projects, such as solar and wind farms, either as a power purchaser or in partnership with third-party developers, and will also look to develop renewable diesel and renewable natural gas opportunities. These potential projects could involve the utilization of existing pipelines through our extensive pipeline system, which consists of more than 90,000 miles of pipelines crossing 38 states. Today, nearly 20% of the electrical energy we purchase off the grid and generate from solar panels originates from renewables. In November, we announced that we had entered into our first ever dedicated solar contract that will deliver 28 megawatts of low cost clean power to energy transfer under a 15-year power purchase agreement. Also, we're in advanced discussions to support a significantly larger solar project with a long-term power purchase agreement. As we think about emission reductions, our patented dual drive compression technology offers the industry a compression solution that helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2020, this technology allowed us to reduce scope one CO2 emissions by more than 630,000 tons. We have also implemented carbon capture sequestration at several of our existing trading and processing facilities that are already allowing us to sequester more than 85,000 metric tons of CO2 on an annual basis. And we are also actively pursuing numerous other carbon capture and sequestration projects related to our gathering and processing facilities that we believe will generate attractive returns through structures that would provide third-parties with the benefit of Federal tax credits and provide us with annual cash flows with very low capital requirements. Just touching briefly on our EHS metrics for 2020. Our total recordable incident rate or TRIR was a record low of 0.87 compared to 0.94 in 2019. And we worked over 17 million hours. We're extremely pleased with our team's ability reduced this metric, which speaks to their efforts and strong focus on safety and environmental compliance, as well as the reliability of our assets. Now, let's take a little closer look at our fourth quarter results. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $2.59 billion compared to $2.77 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019. This was primarily the result of volume growth on the Mariner system, the acquisition of new assets and lower operating expenses across all of our core operating segments, which were offset by decline in volumes in the crude and midstream segments as well as reduce optimization gains in the crude and NGL businesses. DCF attributable to the partners as adjusted was $1.36 billion for the fourth quarter compared to $1.51 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019. This is primarily due to the decrease in adjusted EBITDA. And on January 28, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $15.25 per ET common unit, or $0.61 on an annualized basis. This distribution will be paid on February the 19th to unitholders of record as of the close of business on February the 8th. Now turning to our results by segment, we'll start with NGL and refined products adjusted EBITDA was $703 million compared to $743 million for the same period last year. This decrease was primarily due to lower optimization gains from the sale of NGL components at Mont Belvieu, as well as lower margins from butane and gasoline blending, which were partially offset by higher fee-based margins from our Mariner system and Nederland terminal. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly-owned and joint venture pipelines increased to 1.4 million barrels per day, compared to 1.3 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to increased volumes on our Mariner East pipeline system, as well as increased throughput on our Texas NGL pipeline system as a result of higher export volumes feeding into our Nederland terminal from the initiation of service on our propane export pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2020. On our fractionators, average fractionated volumes increased to 825,000 barrels per day, compared to 734,000 barrels per day for the fourth quarter of 2019. For a crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $517 million, compared to $676 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to lower volumes on the back end in Texas crude pipelines as a result of lower production and reduced demand due to COVID-19 lower rates on our Texas crude pipelines, as well as a decrease in our crude oil acquisition and marketing businesses, primarily related to less favorable pricing conditions. For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $390 million compared to $397 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. This was primarily due to volume declines in lower NGL pricing, which were partially offset by reduced expenses. Gathered gas volumes were $12.6 million MMBTUs per day, compared to $14 million MMBTUs per day for the same period last year. Lower volumes in South Texas and in the Northeast were partially offset by volume growth in the Permian and Ark-La-Tex as well as the addition of assets acquired in 2019 in the Mid-continent, and Panhandle region. In our interstate segment adjusted EBITDA was $448 million compared to $434 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. This was primarily the result of reduced operating expenses, SG&A expenses and increase margin from the Transwestern Panhandle and Rover Systems due to increased demand in firm transportation. These were partially offset by scheduled contract rates stepped down in January 2020 at our Lake Charles LNG facility, as well as contract explorations on Tiger. In our interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $233 million compared to $222 million in the fourth quarter of last year, primarily due to higher physical storage margin from withdrawals and higher realized gains from our hedging activities, as well as reduced operating expenses. For 2021, we expect to have less exposure to spreads as we have locked in additional volumes under long-term contracts with third-parties. Let's look at CapEx, for the full-year, December 31, 2020, Energy Transfer spent $3.05 billion on organic growth projects primarily in the NGL and refined products and midstream segments. This excludes SUN and USAC CapEx. And we currently expect our 2021 growth capital expenditures to be approximately $1.45 billion and growth capital in 2022 and 2023 to be between $500 million and $700 million per year. Looking briefly at our liquidity position. As of December 31, 2020, total available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities was approximately $2.79 billion. And our leverage ratio was 4.31 times for the credit facility. For 2021, we have debt maturities of $1.4 billion, which will be more than covered with our retained cash flow. In conclusion, we believe there is increasing value to have a strong existing asset base, and will continue to strategically enhance our footprint and improve our industry leading franchise. Looking ahead, we are extremely excited about the acquisition of Enable, which will be credit accretive and provide meaningful incremental cash flows post distributions. In addition, these complimentary assets will enhance our midstream infrastructure and provide increased connectivity throughout the Mid-continent and Gulf Coast. We're also very excited about our NGL projects that we brought online in the fourth quarter and in the first month of 2021. And believe we are well positioned to help meet increasing demand for NGL exports. We are focused on exercising capital discipline as we work to create more financial flexibility, generate additional excess cash flow and lessen our cost of capital. And we remain committed to our investment grade rating and accelerating our deleveraging by immediately using excess cash flow to pay down debt. We're also taking new steps to expand our efforts to develop alternative energy projects when they make economic sense and to further our commitment to reducing our environmental impact. Energy Transfer's best-in-class assets and extensive geographical footprint positions the partnership to respond to changing market conditions and for continued long-term success. Operator, please open the line up for our first question. Good afternoon. Yes, Jerry. Go ahead, Mackie. Go ahead. Exciting, exciting news for us. You too. Yes, we did have very good conversations with all three of them, I think you touched upon the fact that all three have put out little reports on this. And I think it's fair to say that it was slightly positive, I think the analogy you used, kind of moving the change down the field a little bit. Clearly, all the stuff that Mackie just covered of how excited we are about the additional opportunities we're looking at, we were very conservative and how we really looked at this. We think that as we get in and bring more of the commercial teams, over the fence, operation teams et cetera. And move further into this, that we're going to be able to get back with the agencies of, possibly even improved type numbers. But right now, we feel like the $100 million was right down the middle of the fairway, likewise we are looking for more but the agencies it was, I think, very good discussions with all three. Thank you. Tom Mason? Michael, this is Tom, I'll run with this. And Mackie, if you want to add something. As we went through this process, we saw these assets as actually is very complimentary. So I can say that we have that mapping identified as far as divestitures, whether it be for, or even identified as non-core as we say here right now. Thank you. I don't know, I'm not 100% sure. All of that's moving us. I think the vast majority of it is, but I'm not sure if 100% of it is. And I'm sorry, the question is, what's our projections for Permian crude growth? Yes, we're pretty conservative. When you look at kind of across the board on that right now, for example, the Permian crudes around for 4.1 million-ish, maybe a little more than that. We don't expect it to get more than about 4.4 million barrels a day by the end of the year. But there's a lot of good things happening. For example, if you look at just a year ago, if you look at the floating crude around the world, there was about 90 million barrels. In July of last year, there was 230 million barrels, and now we're back down to about 90 million barrels. As we keep saying earlier on this call, we're very optimistic about the turnaround in the market growth. So we do think that pricing will increase production. As far as total U.S. growth, I don't know I don't really have an estimate on that. Other than probably a summer type growth where it might be a 2% or 3% type number. Yes, DAPL is included. Absolutely. Yes. No, none of those are rolled over. Yes, we will get on all those in 2020. That is correct, Keith. Yes. Mackie. I think the bottom line, the way we look at it is the reserves are there. So if we see something like what happened during the pandemic in the whole country's hit, certainly that will flow down a lot quicker than, say the Permian Basin. But as we see commodity prices recover, and especially the levels that we have now, where we see natural gas prices, not going just higher the rest of this year because of what's happened in the calendar reality of the demand for natural gas, but there's going to be growing demand for natural gas around the world. I mean, it's the cleanest, best way to fuel enormous amounts of electricity. And it's just going to be something that we are very optimistic, and our big believers is going to be a big growth area for the world, including the U.S. of course, and the reserves are there. I mean, the reserves are in this scoop and in the stack, they're in Oklahoma base and they're over by the Panhandle and as long as commodity prices stay up, and at reasonable levels, we think that's an area where rig will move backhanding and grow production for many years to come. It doesn't take a lot of rigs, I'm sure Enable has said this and we'll say, it doesn't take a lot of rigs on their system to provide volume growth for their system. So if we get back any kind of type of normality of where we were a year and a half ago, we're going to see tremendous growth through those assets. So, we're very excited about owning these in the future because of the need for natural gas and oil, in our opinion for many years to come. Operator, the last of our questions. Well, it looks like maybe we lost the operator. I'll go ahead for those that are still on and we're still connected. Thank all of you for your support. We thank you for joining us today. And we clearly look forward to talking to you about a lot of the exciting stuff that we have happening and of course that will continue to file our S4 just as soon as possible and have more information to be able to share with you. Thanks, everyone. Stay safe, stay warm."

            "content": "Yes, Tom Mason, General Counsel. With respect to your first question, it's unclear whether the two are dependent on each other. The judge could rule on the injunction motion without having the status conference, I think he probably wants to wait until that conference or after for various reasons. And so it just little bit hard to predict. But I would say that there's more likely he would wait until after that status conference, even, some period after that. So he may not rule for a long time we still know. On the second question, it's clear as to what who's making the decision. So the Army Corps, I think we they've been very professional throughout the last five years of our dealings with them. And they, if left alone from political interference, I think we will continue to make good decisions as they proceed. This time Tom Mason again. We really don't know and obviously, the Biden administration is put out a deck of orders to talk about agencies evaluating climate change in the number of decision making. I don't know this will affect the EIS process, at all. It's too early to tell on that."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Mackie McCrea",
            "content": "You bet, I can take that, Tom. Certainly, the last four or five days has hopefully opened up the reality of the necessity of natural gas for electric generation for our country and especially here in Texas and Oklahoma and surrounding states. Yes, commodity prices had continued - have grown over the last two or three months, crude oil has continued to increase. We've got a higher demand, a lot of the vaccines everything over the country. But what this really does, what's happened over the last four or five days, I mean, if, for example, if you ask Oklahoma, would you guys wish I had more gas, because they can't run \u2013 they can't generate enough electricity to - similar to Texas to provide the necessary electricity to run homes and for the LDCs to provide gas to their residential. So it's a tough situation. But we already had seen the corner kind of turning with some of our producers. Some of them have said things publicly, some of them haven't said it publicly how they're going to increase kind of their spending in light of crude oil increases. And no doubt what's transpired over the last few days, we're going to see an increase in gas prices. We've been at kind of historical levels for the last number of years above the five-year average and storage, for example. And we don't know where it's going to end up when it does settles after all this, but it'll be hard to believe it's not going to be at a lower level, it's been a long time. So heaven forbid, if another cold front hits in a week or two because there's - storage is going to be running at very low level. So the value of oil and gas is going to do nothing but increase, we believe, we do believe this is going to help producers to go out and bring their ducks on and start bringing more rigs in like they've kind of been doing over the last four or five months. So as I start out saying, this has really opened my eyes, I think of the country of the necessity of oil and gas and especially natural gas in this instance to provide fuel for our electric generation facilities throughout the country really. So \u2013 yes. Well, I was going to let you kind of talk about the $100 million of synergies. But if you're talking about just the commercial synergies, gosh, we haven't really even began to evaluate and fully appreciate what we're going to recognize from this acquisition. It's an absolutely incredible acquisition at a very unique time when I just said the necessity for natural gas is going to nothing but grow not only in this country, but around the world. And these assets are the most significant assets in the State of Oklahoma and throughout the Ark-La-Tex, they fit very well with our assets. And everybody knows there's large pipeline that brings rich gas down into the fourth basin that delivers into our processing plants and then feeds into our downstream pipelines. There's a lot of opportunities over in Western Oklahoma and Texas, Panhandle where we can create significant efficiency between these assets. There's large intrastate pipelines that feed across the State and into Bennington that connect into our interstate pipelines. And then we have significant synergies from Carthage and throughout Louisiana. And we have some new opportunities with MRT and in new deliveries to the north. So, as I mentioned, we really haven't totally quantified from a commercial standpoint. What all is going to happen with this and all the benefits that we're going to see. But - and there's a lot from commercial, I mean, I'm sorry from competitive standpoint we won't really talk about, but we certainly will also have the ability to move natural gas liquids from the tailgate a lot of these Enable plants into our NGL system to feed down to Mont Belvieu to keep our fracs for many years to come. That's correct. Well, Tom, I can start from a commercial perspective and I've kind of alluded to that earlier. We did see volumes kind of struggle, especially in Eagle Ford and few other areas, as we went through the fourth quarter of 2020. However, we started to kind of see the light at the end of the tunnel, and we started to see rigs start moving in throughout last year. And we as we've entered into 2021, there has been some public statements made, where producers have announced they're going to increase their capital budget, not a lot, but some. And then we've had conversations with a bunch of producers that are now anticipating spending more than what they've even made public. Of course, we can't share that. But anyway, there's a lot of optimism because of what's happening to the markets and the demand growing and the value of oil and gas increasing that we are very confident that drilling is going to pick up. In addition to that, we are excited about our NGL projects. We have a lot of that in our budget. However, we are going to be able to squeeze out even more volume out of both our Marcus Hook facility and out of Nederland. So we're very optimistic on being able to really capitalize and maximize our ability to export around the world out of those significant terminals. So we really see some upside there. And then we've also, of course, seen some upside just over the last four or five days, we've seen some, when you the one thing that everybody's recognizing I've already said, we all know on this call how important fossil fuels are for this country in this world. But what's really important to is to be able to get the fossil fuels to the market. And if there's one thing Energy Transfer does better than anybody especially in Texas and really throughout the country is to move molecules from the source to where they go. And so we've been able to benefit over the last four or five days of being one of the major providers of transportation across the state from both not only West Texas, but also from the Carthage area where there can be large volumes come in and out of those areas. And we're able to move those down to what we've really focused on. And that's getting gas to the human needs customers. So a lot of the sales both on purchases that we're making and others are making on our system, and the sales that we're making out of our storage facilities and we have one of the most significant source facilities in the state, just north of Houston. And we've been maximizing our withdrawals and capitalizing on very strong commodity prices because we already had all that gas in the ground ready to come out in this type of situation. And it's really paid-off even though our state as well as much a nation is struggling and a lot of people don't have electricity and gas, a lot of them do. And it's because of our ability to bring a lot of gas out of our storage facilities in other areas on our pipeline system and deliver them to all these power plants that are generating this electricity. You too. This is Mackie again. I'll start with that, Tom. Well, there is certainly some confidentiality, issues with statements we can make around contracts, of course, and all that kind of stuff. But I'll start with gas, there is significant gas opportunities there, as we've already talked about, just with how their pipelines feed into our pipelines, both upstream and downstream, where we can actually utilize plants up in the fourth base and more efficiently in the pipelines more efficiently. So a lot of upside around the natural gas side and the gas gathering side. As far as the NGL side. More of the opportunities that we see or down the road a little bit as contracts roll-off. But as they do, we'll be able to connect the dots so to speak to where we can move those barrels down into our significant Lone Star system where we have a 30 inch that runs out of fourth basin area all the way down Mont Belvieu. So we'll be able to bring significant volumes, not only from in the Enable cryos, but also from other cryos. And so we really see the NGL side more of a big benefit several years down the road, and then extending for many years after that. Whereas the natural gas to gas gathering the processing and the natural gas side is more immediate benefits and synergies that we see. Well, it's Mackie again. As I mentioned earlier, because of the nature of our assets, and how we operate them and where they're located, especially our storage facilities, we feel very fortunate to be able to have gas in storage at a time when it's needed in a big way and to be able to come out at whatever the market prices are at that time. And unfortunately, from that standpoint, prices are really strong, they're kind of at historical levels, especially as you get up into Oklahoma and we've heard prices, over $1,200 a MCF up there. But anyway, in Texas alone, our assets are doing exceptionally well. At tough time we hate what's going on around the country in this state. But we're doing everything we possibly can to pull gas out of storage and deliver it to the power plants into the LDCs. And also to find gas, Waha or Carthage bring as much as we can in off Tiger and other pipelines to feed our need here in the state. Because we're really short of gas because so much gas is shut in from the producers, especially out in West Texas. From a financial standpoint, we're doing pretty well, because of the nature of our assets, where they sit and how we're able to perform in this type of situation. Yes. So on the first part of your question, I guess the point you're making is with our inter and interstate systems, we are able to move around renewables because yes, okay, we have LDCs that are asking for today on interstates, but not a lot. I mean, a wind, we're struggling with wind quite honestly, it's hard for us to figure out how to make that work. And we're not going to do anything that doesn't make good economic sense for unitholders. Solar is different if we can go out and acquire solar in areas where there's a lot of sunshine, like out in West Texas and, and also in other parts of Texas, we'll certainly do that. Because when we were doing it, we're a large consumer of electricity throughout the country, but especially in Texas and when you can build in a solar priced, very inexpensive supply of electricity. It just makes sense. So that's really our fit. I don't know if we'll ever get involved as far as investing in a solar project because the returns are so much, there's so much less than what we can achieve with other opportunities we have. But we certainly will support solar projects that will provide us with 10, 15 years of what we believe to be very inexpensive power. Yes, I think where the spreads have kind of fallen to now it's about as low as they can go. As we've mentioned on prior calls and conversations, so we're doing a lot to figure out a way to make as much of the value stream as we can all the way from the wellheads out in New Mexico and West Texas, all the way to the refineries up and in the main continent, by utilizing our permit express assets and our Mid Valley assets. So, we are believing that we're kind of at the bottom as far as the spreads go, but we also are continue to work with others to evaluate things that we could possibly do together. And we're looking at converting some of our assets, our crude assets to other uses, that would be more profitable and more efficient for our company. But yes, we've kind of seen it, get about as bad as they can get, and you're down to not much spread across the state, but we're doing everything we can to take advantage of that. In fact, we've kind of got a new team, that's, that's heading that up. It's running our crew group and very pleased on just the early results, just this year, where we've increased our cross-haul, fairly significantly from where we kind of ended up in the fourth quarter of next year. There's a lot of crude companies out there battling for the crude that is available out in the Permian Basin, we're probably a 1 million, 1.5 million barrels less out there than where we thought we'd be a year and a half ago. And there's more capacity built, of course, significantly more than it was a year and a half ago. So we're all scrambling for less barrels, but there's no company that can take the barrel, so many different places, like we can. So we feel like we've got to get advantage and we're going to take advantage of that. With a variety, in fact, fortunately, we have quite a bit of our megawatts hedged, which has been extremely fortunate today, during the last four or five days, and then we have a variety of different ways we do buy a lot on a day-to-day basis. And we do have some packages bought for different terms. So it's kind of a myriad of different ways we buy it. Tom you want to take that. You bet."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Enable Midstream Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Matt Beasley, Senior Director of Investor Relations, thank you, Mr. Beasley please go ahead.\nMatt Beasley: Thank you and good morning everyone. Presenting on this morning\u2019s call are Rod Sailor, our President and CEO and John Laws, our Chief Financial Officer. To achieve social distancing and limit travel, we only have a small group joining the call in the room today. But we also have other members of the management team on the phone to answer your questions. Earlier this morning, we issued our earnings press release and filed our Form 10-Q with the SEC. Our earnings press release, Form 10-Q filing and the presentation that accompanies this call are all available in the Investor Relations section of our website. We will also be posting a replay of today\u2019s call to the site. Today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws. Actual results could differ materially from our projections and the discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ from projections can be found in our SEC filings. We will also be referencing non-GAAP financial measures on today\u2019s call, which we have reconciled to the nearest GAAP measures in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation. We invite you to review the disclaimers of this presentation for both forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. With that, we will get started and I will turn the call over to Rod Sailor.\nRod Sailor: Thanks, Matt. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I would like to begin my remarks on Slide 4 with a few high level business updates. As you may recall from our last earnings call, the impact from shut-in production this year has been less than we anticipated. And I am pleased to now report that all production that was offline due to depressed commodity prices is back online. In our transportation and storage segment, we recently received the FERC\u2019s environmental assessment for our Gulf Run Pipeline, a key milestone for that project. Earlier today, we released our inaugural sustainability report demonstrating our commitment to transparency and sustainable business practices. I plan to share some highlights from the report with you at the end of today\u2019s call. Our COVID-19 safety protocols remain in place and we continue to monitor local, state and federal guidelines and recommendations from health organizations. To-date, the pandemic has not impacted our ability to maintain safe and reliable operations. Finally, I want to once again emphasize that we continue to benefit from our significant scale, diversified assets, integrated systems, unique market solutions and a strong base of firm demand driven transportation and storage contracts. I will now cover a few financial highlights on the next slide. Due in part to lower than expected impacts for producer volume curtailments this year I am pleased to report that we now anticipate performing in the upper half of our previous 2020 outlook ranges for adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. If it weren\u2019t for the non-cash impairment of our investment in the SESH joint venture, we would have expected to perform in the upper half of our 2020 outlook for net income. Due to our business performance and the actions we took to reduce distributions, capital and operating costs in response to the industry downturn earlier this year, we have seen DCF exceed distributions by $293 million, allowing us to fully fund our expansion capital program, while decreasing total debt by almost $100 million. We remain focused on the aspects of our business that we can control, including our cost structure. Our progress on cost reduction initiatives, includes annualized savings of $21 million for aligning our organizational structure to the current industry environment, including the impact of planned retirements and eliminating open positions, $14 million for producing rental compression and treater assets and $2 million from optimizing our processing fleet by putting plants in standby operations and implementing crewless operations in select plants. As we look forward to 2021, we remain focused on capital discipline and will continue to prioritize contracted long-term transportation and storage projects and contracted capital efficient gathering and processing projects. Finally, while some producers have faced credit challenges in the current commodity price environment, we have not experienced any meaningful credit losses during this cycle. Now, turning to the next slide, Enable\u2019s Gulf Run Pipeline project is a key energy infrastructure project serving growing LNG markets. The project is backed by a 20-year commitment from Golden Pass LNG, a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil. The project will help add to the global supply of LNG, which should support the displacement of higher carbon intensity fuels worldwide. We continue to advance the project and just last week on schedule the FERC issued the project\u2019s environmental assessment. We anticipate finalizing the project scope and financing plans in the coming months and we continue to believe that we will have a number of financing options for the project given its firm demand-driven revenues and strong customer base. Turning to our transportation and storage commercial highlights on the next slide, the segment continues to benefit from its firm fee-based contracts and the segment is anchored by large investment grade utilities. Our integrated systems serve as a crucial link between supply and downstream markets and we continue to have success contracting capacity. From September, we have contracted or extended almost 1.5 million dekatherms per day of transportation capacity with an average volume weighted contract life of over 5 years. On our EGP system, the mass project has received all required regulatory approvals and construction has begun. The project is backed by a firm 5-year commitment for 100,000 dekatherms per day and we anticipate placing it in service in the second quarter of 2021. On our MRT system, the southbound expansion project is in service and the project is backed by a firm 5-year commitment for 80,000 dekatherms per day. Finally, despite recent contract explorations, our SESH joint venture with Enbridge remains a critical artery serving utility markets in the southeast. Turning to our gathering and processing commercial highlights on the next slide. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have seen all production that was shut-in due to depressed commodity prices come back online and we have experienced no noticeable production performance degradation from these wells. Producers remain active on our gathering footprint with 6 rigs currently drilling wells expected to be connected to Enable\u2019s gathering systems. Substantial DUC inventories have been built behind both our Anadarko and Williston Basin systems, with approximately 175 DUCs between both systems. These DUCs provide an inventory of wells with the lower economic hurdle to be completed, because they do not require drilling capital investment. On our Anadarko crude oil and condensate gathering system, we recently completed an extension of that system into McLean County, Oklahoma increasing the system\u2019s reach and ability to add new customers. In the Haynesville shale, significant increases in natural gas forward curves should benefit our producers in the play and further support continued drilling activity. Finally, we added a new customer to our Williston Basin system and recently completed a connection to a 7-well pad for that customer. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss third quarter results.\nJohn Laws: Thank you, Rod and good morning everyone. I will now cover a few of our key operational and financial metrics for the quarter. As always, you can find a more detailed and comprehensive overview of our financial and operational results in our third quarter earnings release and in our 10-Q, both of which were released earlier this morning. Turning to our operational performance overview slide, our natural gas gathered, processed and transported volumes saw decreases compared to the third quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of lower gathered volumes across all basins, inclusive of continued producer shut-ins in the Anadarko basin that ended in the third quarter. Our crude oil and condensate volumes increased compared to the third quarter of 2019 as a result of higher production in the Anadarko basin offset by lower production in the Williston basin. Turning to our financial results on the next slide, we saw lower revenues, gross margin and net income for the third quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2019 primarily as a result of lower volumes and lower prices. While net income benefited from lower O&M and G&A expenses and lower interest expense as Rod mentioned earlier, net income was impacted by non-cash impairment of our investment in our SESH joint venture. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF were both lower for the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2019 primarily as a result of lower volumes and lower prices partially offset by lower O&M and G&A expenses. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF exclude the non-cash impacts from changes in the fair value of derivatives in the SESH. DCF also benefited from lower adjusted interest expense and lower maintenance capital expenditures for the third quarter. After considering the distributions declared, Enable\u2019s distributable cash flow exceeded distributions declared by $75 million fully funding our expansion capital expenditures for the quarter. While this year has had some unexpected challenges, this was yet another quarter of continued execution for Enable. As Rod mentioned earlier, we now expect to achieve the upper half of the outlook we provided during our first quarter 2020 earnings call for adjusted EBITDA in DCF and excluding the third quarter 2020 non-cash impairment of our SESH investment, Enable would have expected to achieve the upper half of our net income range. The business has generated significant cash flows this year to fully fund our distribution and capital program while reducing total debt levels and we remain focused on further optimizing our cost structure and aligning it with the industry environment. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Rod.\nRod Sailor: Thanks, John. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, Enable issued its inaugural sustainability report earlier this morning. You can find the report under the sustainability section of our website at enablemidstream.com. Sustainable business practices are deeply embedded across our business and we have a long history of operating in a safe, efficient and responsible manner. At Enable, part of our mission is to partner in the success of our employees, customers, investors and communities. As you read our report, you will find just some of the ways Enable has demonstrated and continues to uphold that partnership commitment. Some of the report\u2019s highlights include our conservation efforts for vulnerable species, including Enable\u2019s participation in the American Burying Beetle oil and gas industry conservation plan, a species that was recently down-listed from endangered to threatened status. Enable\u2019s award winning Integrated Vegetation Management program, along our rights of way, our pipeline inspection program that inspected almost twice the miles of pipeline in 2019 as required by current regulations. The commitments we have made to minimize methane emissions across Enable\u2019s operations through [indiscernible] methane emissions commitments, community partnerships, including Enable\u2019s Safety Partner Program honoring first responders, a program to build or refurbish community basketball courts and a program to support STEM-focused educational initiatives. We also support community organizations by offering our employees 16 company-paid volunteer hours each year. In 2019, Enable employees recorded over 22,000 volunteer hours, including over 15,000 company-paid hours. Finally, our comprehensive contractor safety initiative has helped contribute to a reduction of reported contractor incidents from 22 in 2015 to 3 in 2019. We aligned the report with the voluntary Sustainability Accounting Standards Board or SASB reporting standards for midstream companies allowing for better comparisons of Enable\u2019s sustainability performance. I am proud of our team\u2019s work on our inaugural report, but note that this is only one more step on our sustainability journey. We welcome your feedback and look forward to updating you on our progress. Before we open the call up for questions, I wanted to say that management will not be commenting on strategic alternatives for Enable. Since CenterPoint announced its business review, there has been published speculation related to possible actions by both sponsors. It is not the first time a sponsor has announced such a review or that has been reported that they are considering options with respect to their ownership interest in us over the years since our formation. As has been the case over that period, we have declined to comment on such reports and we will continue in that tradition today. We will now open the call up for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nRod Sailor: Hey, good morning.\nJeremy Tonet: Just want to start off with SESH here if I could, just want to see what factors fed into the impairment now and just updated thoughts as far as re-contracting is concerned on the pipe and how you think about discounting or what approaches you might take to kind of secure contract there and what type of contract tenor would make sense? And then there is debt at the JV level as well, so just wondering how you think about leverage there? Is the debt cheap enough to buy in? Would that make sense at all to reduce leverage just any of these different factors would be helpful for your thoughts?\nRod Sailor: Yes, it\u2019s Rod, excuse me and I will start with sort of the first question on SESH re-contracting and again, we had a large contract or a law. But again, we still expect to enter into discussions with that and other counterparties, about re-contracting. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to really talk about anything other than again we expect, because as I said, in my opening remarks, we think sessions is a vital piece to the transportation artery into the continuing growing Florida market. So we \u2013 again, we have continued to expect to realize value on re-contracting there. I will turn it over to John to maybe talk a little bit about the other part of that question.\nJohn Laws: Yes, sure. Jeremy, it\u2019s John. Just to follow-up there. I think the drivers of the impairment now really do relate to the timing of the re-contracting. And when we believe some of that might take place as you know that, that contract that Rod alluded to rolled in early September was not re-contracted all that capacity just yet. And as we said we are in the midst of doing so, but the accounting rules really do require you to look at things on a basis that does contemplate some of that timing. And with our view of those accounting rules and how we have interpreted those, that\u2019s what drove the time to the impact. As it relates to the debt at the SESH level that\u2019s really not anything that we thought about doing anything with here in the near-term, those notes do not mature until 2024.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. And just want to be clarifying the point as far as re-contracting, did you \u2013 have you guys re-contracted any portion of it so far that rolled?\nJohn Laws: We are in the midst of re-contracting. We have done some short-term things here and we are in the midst of re-contracting some things now that and we will leave it at that.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And just want to see what your crystal ball might say as far as 2021 is concerned and really thinking more on the natural gas side, we have seen some good strength into \u201821 with the strip there. So, it seems like that could be levels that could incentivize some activity across parts of your footprint. So, anything you can share with us as far as producer activities or what you are seeing out there, particularly in the gas side or even on the rest of your footprint as well. Any color would be helpful?\nJohn Laws: Yes, Jeremy, it\u2019s John, I will start and then may have others come in here as well. So, look, I think what you have observed here in the gas trip has certainly been something that we have been very interested in, I think as we continue to have dialogue with our producers, particularly those that have more gas exposure, dry gas exposure, that continues to do, we are very interested, just last quarter in the [indiscernible] that we reported record volumes on that system that are there. And so we continue to be encouraged by the activity that we have seen in some of the leaner gas or drier gas areas as well as what the strip and the curve is showing for some of these producers on a go forward basis. So, look, I think in terms of current rig activity, we reported 6 rigs running across our footprint today, we expect those to continue to run and the DUCs that we have in and across our footprint in the Anadarko, we expect the economics here to continue to support activity on a go forward basis, but we will wait and see how producers evolve and finalize their plans as they roll into completing their budget season here over the next couple of months.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. One last one, if I could just with, I think on Slide 5, you talked about cost reductions here. And just wondering so I am thinking about sustainability of that into \u201821 or other opportunities there, just any thoughts on that would be helpful?\nJohn Laws: Jeremy, we have made really good progress on the goals that we announced in early April for 2020. We are on track there and expect to continue to be on track to meet the goals and objectives that we had set for ourselves in the company in early April.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. I will stop there. Thank you.\nRod Sailor: Thanks, Jeremy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal from Seaport Global. Your line is open. \nSunil Sibal: Yes. Hi, good morning, guys and thanks for taking my question. So, just to follow-up on SESH, how should we be thinking about the distributions from SESH going forward? Are there any kind of restrictions in terms of the debt structure there that would impact the distributions that you receive from that entity?\nRod Sailor: There are no restrictions per se at the entity to think about and the distributions on a go forward basis will continue to be a function of the entity\u2019s free cash flow.\nSunil Sibal: Okay. So there are no restrictive covenants for holding back cash there, right?\nRod Sailor: No, that\u2019s correct.\nSunil Sibal: Got it. Thanks for that. And then just a broader question, we have seen a fair bit of upstream consolidation in Permian, which is probably could accelerate in other basins too, how do you view your asset position specifically in the mid comp with regard to that and then more specifically, with regard to midstream consolidation, do you see any opportunities for Enable? Thanks.\nRod Sailor: Yes, it\u2019s Rod. I will take that. Again, yes we have been watching the upstream consolidations. Look, there are a number of smaller or less well capitalized E&P companies along our footprint, specifically in the Anadarko would not be surprising and we would expect some consolidations just based on forward strip, and I think the need for everybody to think about cash flow costs and those things. So we are not surprises today, we haven\u2019t seen anything that\u2019s been of an impact on our \u2013 on any of our system. As you talk about midstream consolidation, we have said in the past that we believe that scope and scale matter on the midstream side of the business and that will likely lead to some consolidation, probably starting with some of the smaller and private players and we will continue to watch that environment. But again stating we do believe scope and scale matter in the midstream side.\nSunil Sibal: Okay, got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Moreen from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nGabe Moreen: Good morning, guys. Quick question on Gulf Run, can you talk about how negotiations or discussions are going with potentially attracting third-party volumes to that project? And then maybe you can walk us through the timeline there in terms of capital spend \u201821 versus \u201822 and beyond just how we should be thinking about that?\nRod Sailor: Yes. As it relates to \u2013 I will take the first part of that question. Again, as it relates to commercial discussions, I hate to sound like a broken record, but we have continued to have a number of discussions with potential counterparties clearly in this environment. Those discussions have been somewhat muted. We have continued to move along with our plan and we will evaluate it. We are evaluating a number of potential financing options both with financial and strategic players that will also lead us down to the proper scoping of that project in the near future. John, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything?\nJohn Laws: Yes. No, I think that\u2019s right, and Gabe, ultimately the total quantum of CapEx will be a function of the finalized scope. But as we have said in the past and with late \u201822 or early \u201823 start date, it\u2019s not a particularly long way of pipe and so we would expect that most of that capital would probably be concentrated in the second half of that build cycle. So you were kind of thinking for \u201821 and \u201822, I would expect that we would see more of that capital, majority of that capital show up in \u201822 as opposed to \u201821.\nGabe Moreen: Thanks. And then, if can follow-up on the shifting to the oil side of things just what you are seeing from completion crews there with TI trading where it is your outlook, you think in terms of Gulf completions, you can be flat from here into \u201821 so just curious there?\nJohn Laws: Yes, won\u2019t get too much into expectation for \u201821, as I mentioned, really important for us there to hear from the producers and their finalized budgets, which is the process that they are going through here at the moment. I think what we intended to do is show you a little bit of how we think about the inherent backlog that\u2019s there in terms of the DUCs that are on our system. And you can see that there are a substantial number of DUCs out there that we have reported in each of the Anadarko as well as the Bakken. And so, that\u2019s ready inventory that\u2019s out there and available for producers to complete in a lower bar from a commodity price standpoint and an all-in half cycle return economics that are there and available. So, we speak inherent capability in terms of what\u2019s out there, in terms of the DUCs that are out there to come online and add good volumes to the system that we just unfortunately we need to leave it at that for the moment as it relates to \u201821.\nGabe Moreen: Thanks, John. And then not to probe again on \u201821, but a two-pronged question on CapEx, can you talk about where you think you might end up coming in on the growth CapEx side of things for \u201820 and EXCO front? Is there any reason to think that growth CapEx for \u201821 should be different than the ranges laid out in \u201820?\nJohn Laws: We won\u2019t comment on \u201821, Gabe, but thanks for the preface there. I think, on CapEx we have not pointed specifically to a spot and a range there, but we are doing everything that you would expect us to be doing in terms of optimizing the capital spend that we will have show up in 2020 and again prioritized around those things that Rod mentioned, which are our committed transportation and storage projects that we have got underway and good returning and capital efficient gathering and processing arrangements that we have with producers that are bringing volumes online to the system.\nGabe Moreen: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ned Baramov from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nNed Baramov: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just one from me. Could you maybe talk about ethane recoveries across your system, it seems produced NGL volumes, the increase from the prior quarter and part of this is driven by the higher processing volumes across the system, but I presume some of the increase is also a function of ethane recoveries, so any thoughts there?\nRod Sailor: Yes, no, I think that\u2019s right. We did see some higher recoveries of ethane in the quarter. And look I think that, that\u2019s something that on our system, we have the ability to flex into and out of ethane recovery really as it relates to our plants and what we see across the system, I think as we have seen gas prices strengthen, you see a little bit of E&P falloff, we may see something different in the fourth quarter, but we did see and have seen throughout the course of the year, floating into and out of ethane rejection and recovery.\nNed Baramov: Thanks. That\u2019s all I had.\nRod Sailor: Thanks, Ned.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sailor for any closing remarks.\nRod Sailor: Thank you all so much for joining us on the call today. In closing, I want to recognize our employees for their hard work, dedication and continued focus on safety during these challenging times. I thank everybody on the call again for your interest in Enable and I hope you all remain safe and healthy. Please have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. The conference has now concluded. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Laws",
            "content": "Thank you, Rod and good morning everyone. I will now cover a few of our key operational and financial metrics for the quarter. As always, you can find a more detailed and comprehensive overview of our financial and operational results in our third quarter earnings release and in our 10-Q, both of which were released earlier this morning. Turning to our operational performance overview slide, our natural gas gathered, processed and transported volumes saw decreases compared to the third quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of lower gathered volumes across all basins, inclusive of continued producer shut-ins in the Anadarko basin that ended in the third quarter. Our crude oil and condensate volumes increased compared to the third quarter of 2019 as a result of higher production in the Anadarko basin offset by lower production in the Williston basin. Turning to our financial results on the next slide, we saw lower revenues, gross margin and net income for the third quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2019 primarily as a result of lower volumes and lower prices. While net income benefited from lower O&M and G&A expenses and lower interest expense as Rod mentioned earlier, net income was impacted by non-cash impairment of our investment in our SESH joint venture. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF were both lower for the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2019 primarily as a result of lower volumes and lower prices partially offset by lower O&M and G&A expenses. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF exclude the non-cash impacts from changes in the fair value of derivatives in the SESH. DCF also benefited from lower adjusted interest expense and lower maintenance capital expenditures for the third quarter. After considering the distributions declared, Enable's distributable cash flow exceeded distributions declared by $75 million fully funding our expansion capital expenditures for the quarter. While this year has had some unexpected challenges, this was yet another quarter of continued execution for Enable. As Rod mentioned earlier, we now expect to achieve the upper half of the outlook we provided during our first quarter 2020 earnings call for adjusted EBITDA in DCF and excluding the third quarter 2020 non-cash impairment of our SESH investment, Enable would have expected to achieve the upper half of our net income range. The business has generated significant cash flows this year to fully fund our distribution and capital program while reducing total debt levels and we remain focused on further optimizing our cost structure and aligning it with the industry environment. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Rod. Yes, sure. Jeremy, it's John. Just to follow-up there. I think the drivers of the impairment now really do relate to the timing of the re-contracting. And when we believe some of that might take place as you know that, that contract that Rod alluded to rolled in early September was not re-contracted all that capacity just yet. And as we said we are in the midst of doing so, but the accounting rules really do require you to look at things on a basis that does contemplate some of that timing. And with our view of those accounting rules and how we have interpreted those, that's what drove the time to the impact. As it relates to the debt at the SESH level that's really not anything that we thought about doing anything with here in the near-term, those notes do not mature until 2024. We are in the midst of re-contracting. We have done some short-term things here and we are in the midst of re-contracting some things now that and we will leave it at that. Yes, Jeremy, it's John, I will start and then may have others come in here as well. So, look, I think what you have observed here in the gas trip has certainly been something that we have been very interested in, I think as we continue to have dialogue with our producers, particularly those that have more gas exposure, dry gas exposure, that continues to do, we are very interested, just last quarter in the [indiscernible] that we reported record volumes on that system that are there.

Jeremy, we have made really good progress on the goals that we announced in early April for 2020. We are on track there and expect to continue to be on track to meet the goals and objectives that we had set for ourselves in the company in early April. Yes. No, I think that's right, and Gabe, ultimately the total quantum of CapEx will be a function of the finalized scope. But as we have said in the past and with late \u201822 or early \u201823 start date, it's not a particularly long way of pipe and so we would expect that most of that capital would probably be concentrated in the second half of that build cycle.

            "name": "Rod Sailor",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I would like to begin my remarks on Slide 4 with a few high level business updates. As you may recall from our last earnings call, the impact from shut-in production this year has been less than we anticipated. And I am pleased to now report that all production that was offline due to depressed commodity prices is back online. In our transportation and storage segment, we recently received the FERC's environmental assessment for our Gulf Run Pipeline, a key milestone for that project. Earlier today, we released our inaugural sustainability report demonstrating our commitment to transparency and sustainable business practices. I plan to share some highlights from the report with you at the end of today's call. Our COVID-19 safety protocols remain in place and we continue to monitor local, state and federal guidelines and recommendations from health organizations. To-date, the pandemic has not impacted our ability to maintain safe and reliable operations. Finally, I want to once again emphasize that we continue to benefit from our significant scale, diversified assets, integrated systems, unique market solutions and a strong base of firm demand driven transportation and storage contracts. I will now cover a few financial highlights on the next slide. Due in part to lower than expected impacts for producer volume curtailments this year I am pleased to report that we now anticipate performing in the upper half of our previous 2020 outlook ranges for adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. If it weren't for the non-cash impairment of our investment in the SESH joint venture, we would have expected to perform in the upper half of our 2020 outlook for net income. Due to our business performance and the actions we took to reduce distributions, capital and operating costs in response to the industry downturn earlier this year, we have seen DCF exceed distributions by $293 million, allowing us to fully fund our expansion capital program, while decreasing total debt by almost $100 million. We remain focused on the aspects of our business that we can control, including our cost structure. Our progress on cost reduction initiatives, includes annualized savings of $21 million for aligning our organizational structure to the current industry environment, including the impact of planned retirements and eliminating open positions, $14 million for producing rental compression and treater assets and $2 million from optimizing our processing fleet by putting plants in standby operations and implementing crewless operations in select plants. As we look forward to 2021, we remain focused on capital discipline and will continue to prioritize contracted long-term transportation and storage projects and contracted capital efficient gathering and processing projects. Finally, while some producers have faced credit challenges in the current commodity price environment, we have not experienced any meaningful credit losses during this cycle. Now, turning to the next slide, Enable's Gulf Run Pipeline project is a key energy infrastructure project serving growing LNG markets. The project is backed by a 20-year commitment from Golden Pass LNG, a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil. The project will help add to the global supply of LNG, which should support the displacement of higher carbon intensity fuels worldwide. We continue to advance the project and just last week on schedule the FERC issued the project's environmental assessment. We anticipate finalizing the project scope and financing plans in the coming months and we continue to believe that we will have a number of financing options for the project given its firm demand-driven revenues and strong customer base. Turning to our transportation and storage commercial highlights on the next slide, the segment continues to benefit from its firm fee-based contracts and the segment is anchored by large investment grade utilities. Our integrated systems serve as a crucial link between supply and downstream markets and we continue to have success contracting capacity. From September, we have contracted or extended almost 1.5 million dekatherms per day of transportation capacity with an average volume weighted contract life of over 5 years. On our EGP system, the mass project has received all required regulatory approvals and construction has begun. The project is backed by a firm 5-year commitment for 100,000 dekatherms per day and we anticipate placing it in service in the second quarter of 2021. On our MRT system, the southbound expansion project is in service and the project is backed by a firm 5-year commitment for 80,000 dekatherms per day. Finally, despite recent contract explorations, our SESH joint venture with Enbridge remains a critical artery serving utility markets in the southeast. Turning to our gathering and processing commercial highlights on the next slide. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have seen all production that was shut-in due to depressed commodity prices come back online and we have experienced no noticeable production performance degradation from these wells. Producers remain active on our gathering footprint with 6 rigs currently drilling wells expected to be connected to Enable's gathering systems. Substantial DUC inventories have been built behind both our Anadarko and Williston Basin systems, with approximately 175 DUCs between both systems. These DUCs provide an inventory of wells with the lower economic hurdle to be completed, because they do not require drilling capital investment. On our Anadarko crude oil and condensate gathering system, we recently completed an extension of that system into McLean County, Oklahoma increasing the system's reach and ability to add new customers. In the Haynesville shale, significant increases in natural gas forward curves should benefit our producers in the play and further support continued drilling activity. Finally, we added a new customer to our Williston Basin system and recently completed a connection to a 7-well pad for that customer. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss third quarter results. Thanks, John. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, Enable issued its inaugural sustainability report earlier this morning. You can find the report under the sustainability section of our website at enablemidstream.com. Sustainable business practices are deeply embedded across our business and we have a long history of operating in a safe, efficient and responsible manner. At Enable, part of our mission is to partner in the success of our employees, customers, investors and communities. As you read our report, you will find just some of the ways Enable has demonstrated and continues to uphold that partnership commitment. Some of the report's highlights include our conservation efforts for vulnerable species, including Enable's participation in the American Burying Beetle oil and gas industry conservation plan, a species that was recently down-listed from endangered to threatened status. Enable's award winning Integrated Vegetation Management program, along our rights of way, our pipeline inspection program that inspected almost twice the miles of pipeline in 2019 as required by current regulations. The commitments we have made to minimize methane emissions across Enable's operations through [indiscernible] methane emissions commitments, community partnerships, including Enable's Safety Partner Program honoring first responders, a program to build or refurbish community basketball courts and a program to support STEM-focused educational initiatives. We also support community organizations by offering our employees 16 company-paid volunteer hours each year. In 2019, Enable employees recorded over 22,000 volunteer hours, including over 15,000 company-paid hours. Finally, our comprehensive contractor safety initiative has helped contribute to a reduction of reported contractor incidents from 22 in 2015 to 3 in 2019. We aligned the report with the voluntary Sustainability Accounting Standards Board or SASB reporting standards for midstream companies allowing for better comparisons of Enable's sustainability performance. I am proud of our team's work on our inaugural report, but note that this is only one more step on our sustainability journey. We welcome your feedback and look forward to updating you on our progress. Before we open the call up for questions, I wanted to say that management will not be commenting on strategic alternatives for Enable. Since CenterPoint announced its business review, there has been published speculation related to possible actions by both sponsors. It is not the first time a sponsor has announced such a review or that has been reported that they are considering options with respect to their ownership interest in us over the years since our formation. As has been the case over that period, we have declined to comment on such reports and we will continue in that tradition today. We will now open the call up for your questions. Hey, good morning. Yes, it's Rod, excuse me and I will start with sort of the first question on SESH re-contracting and again, we had a large contract or a law. But again, we still expect to enter into discussions with that and other counterparties, about re-contracting. So I don't think it's appropriate to really talk about anything other than again we expect, because as I said, in my opening remarks, we think sessions is a vital piece to the transportation artery into the continuing growing Florida market. So we \u2013 again, we have continued to expect to realize value on re-contracting there. I will turn it over to John to maybe talk a little bit about the other part of that question. Thanks, Jeremy. There are no restrictions per se at the entity to think about and the distributions on a go forward basis will continue to be a function of the entity's free cash flow. No, that's correct. Yes, it's Rod. I will take that. Again, yes we have been watching the upstream consolidations. Look, there are a number of smaller or less well capitalized E&P companies along our footprint, specifically in the Anadarko would not be surprising and we would expect some consolidations just based on forward strip, and I think the need for everybody to think about cash flow costs and those things. So we are not surprises today, we haven't seen anything that's been of an impact on our \u2013 on any of our system. As you talk about midstream consolidation, we have said in the past that we believe that scope and scale matter on the midstream side of the business and that will likely lead to some consolidation, probably starting with some of the smaller and private players and we will continue to watch that environment. But again stating we do believe scope and scale matter in the midstream side. Yes. As it relates to \u2013 I will take the first part of that question. Again, as it relates to commercial discussions, I hate to sound like a broken record, but we have continued to have a number of discussions with potential counterparties clearly in this environment. Those discussions have been somewhat muted. We have continued to move along with our plan and we will evaluate it. We are evaluating a number of potential financing options both with financial and strategic players that will also lead us down to the proper scoping of that project in the near future. John, I don't know if you want to add anything? Yes, no, I think that's right. We did see some higher recoveries of ethane in the quarter. And look I think that, that's something that on our system, we have the ability to flex into and out of ethane recovery really as it relates to our plants and what we see across the system, I think as we have seen gas prices strengthen, you see a little bit of E&P falloff, we may see something different in the fourth quarter, but we did see and have seen throughout the course of the year, floating into and out of ethane rejection and recovery. Thanks, Ned. Thank you all so much for joining us on the call today. In closing, I want to recognize our employees for their hard work, dedication and continued focus on safety during these challenging times. I thank everybody on the call again for your interest in Enable and I hope you all remain safe and healthy. Please have a great day."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Marian, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Enable Midstream Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]  Mr. Matt Beasley. You may begin your conference.\nMatt Beasley: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Presenting on this morning's call are Rod Sailor, our President and CEO; and John Laws, our Chief Financial Officer. To achieve social distancing and limit travel, we only have a small group joining the call in the room today. But, we also have other members of the management team on the phone to answer your questions. Earlier this morning, we issued our earnings press release and filed our Form 10-Q with the SEC. Our earnings press release, Form 10-Q filing and the presentation that accompanies this call are all available in the Investor Relations section of our website. We will also be posting a replay of today's call to the site. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws. Actual results could differ materially from our projections and the discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ from projections can be found in our SEC filings. We will also be referencing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, which we have reconciled to the nearest GAAP measures in the appendix of today's presentation. We invite you to review the disclaimers of this presentation for both forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. With that, we'll get started, and I will turn the call over to Rod Sailor.\nRod Sailor: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I would like to begin my remarks on Slide four with a few high level business updates. First, our COVID-19 safety protocols remain in place, and we continue to monitor local, state and federal guidelines and recommendations from health organizations. Today, the pandemic has not impacted our ability to maintain safe and reliable operations.  Since early May, we have seen a substantial increase in crude oil prices, due in part to this increase the crude focus shut-ins as we saw during the second quarter, were not as significant as previously anticipated. With the outlook for higher future prices we've seen some new gas wells in the stack shut-in and we expect those shut ins may continue through the third quarter. Based on current commodity prices, our latest discussions with our customers and progress on our costs and capital reduction initiatives, we are reaffirming all aspects of our outlook for 2020 provided on our first quarter earnings call. Finally, despite industry challenges Enable continues to benefit from its strong balance sheet, significant scale and key operating basins and our overall diversified asset portfolio of gathering and processing systems interconnected with natural gas transportation and storage systems.  I will now cover a few financial highlights on the next slide. First, our distributable cash flow exceeded our declared distributions by $76 million for the quarter fully funding our expansion capital expenditures. As I mentioned, we have made good progress executing on our expansion capital and cost reductions we announced in early April. On the cost front, we recently took steps to align our organizational structure for the current industry environment, reducing staffing levels. While building for flexibility in the future. This organizational restructuring resulted in a reduction of 165 positions across the company, including the impact of planned retirements and eliminating open positions. We also have achieved cost savings from releasing leased assets by redeploying existing assets and optimizing operating processing plant assets to match current volumes.  As I've said before, we are limiting our capital expenditures to contracted long-term transportation storage projects, and contracted capital efficient gathering and processing projects. For our Gulf Run project we continue to have commercial discussions to increase the firm commitments to the project. We expect those discussions will continue through the second half of the year. Once concluded, we will finalize the scope and execute our funding plans. Well, some producers have faced credit challenges in the current commodity price environment, we have not experienced any meaningful credit losses during the cycle.  In our gathering and processing segment, we are typically a net payer for our natural gas processing customers, which helps mitigate our credit exposure. And we generally have the right to request adequate assurance from non credit worthy counterparties. Our credit profile is also supported by a strong base of large investment grade utility customers in our transportation and storage segments.  Finally, we repurchased approximately 22 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes during the quarter for approximately $17 million plus accrued interest. We will continue to evaluate opportunistic note repurchases based on market conditions and available liquidity.  Turning to our commercial highlights on the next slide. We contracted or extended almost 1 million decatherms per day of transportation capacity during the quarter, including our previously announced recontracted capacity with EGT's largest customer CERC. The contracted term for the majority of the renewed CERC capacity is nine years. And the effective date of the new contracts will be April 1st, 2021. The CERC contracts, along with our recent MRT contract extensions and our 20 year Gulf Run commitment from Golden Pass L&G demonstrate the strength of Enable\u2019s integrated transportation systems and significantly extend the partnerships weighted average contract life. The Gulf Run project is proceeding on schedule and FERC\u2019s current schedule anticipates and environmental assessment will be issued by the end of October, subject to FERC approval we still anticipate placing the project into service in late 2022. EGT mass natural gas transportation project remains on schedule for anticipated second quarter 2021 startup. We also recently received a five year commitment for 80,000 decatherms per day of firm capacity on MRT\u2019s southbound expansion project with an anticipated fourth quarter 2020 in service date.  Finally, our joint venture pipeline SESH has upcoming contract explorations with the key shipper later this quarter; we believe SESH plays a key role in serving markets in the Southeast with a load factor of well over 90% in recent years and we are focused on re-contracting this capacity. Turning to our gathering and processing commercial highlights. As I mentioned in my opening remarks shut in volumes for the second quarter were less than we had anticipated. Wells curtailed to the scoop and stack plays due to lower crude prices are substantially back online, but we have seen some shut ins in the gassier part of the stack due to anticipated higher natural gas prices. We expect these shut-ins of approximately 0.2 TBTU per day, to continue through the third quarter. To the Williston basin all but two pads are now back online, importantly to date, we have not experienced any significant degradation in well performance from the production that is coming back online. We have seen continued investment from producers in the Haynesville shale plays and the plays long-term outlook remains strong. Rigs also remain active in the Anadarko and Williston basins, building ducks to support future volumes.  I will now turn the call over to John to discuss second quarter results. \nJohn Laws: Thank you, Rod and good morning, everyone. I'll now cover a few of our key operational and financial metrics for the quarter. As always, you can find a more detailed and comprehensive overview of our financial and operational results on our second quarter earnings release and in our 10-Q both of which were released earlier this morning. You can see the impacts of recent production shut-ins on the operational performance overview slide.  Our natural gas gathered processed and transported volumes saw decreases compared to the second quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of production shut-ins in the Anadarko basin. The decreases in our natural gas gathered volumes were partially offset by higher natural gas gathered volumes in the Ark-La-Tex Basin has a result of continued drilling activity in the Haynesville shale play. Our crude oil and condensate volumes were also lower as a result of the shut-ins in both the Anadarko and Williston basins, as Rod mentioned, the shut-ins we saw for the quarter were lower than what we assumed in the financial outlook we provided in May. Turning to our financial results on the next slide we saw lower revenues, gross margin and net income for the second quarter of 2020, compared to the second quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of the lower volumes and prices and changes in the fair value of derivatives as a result of increasing commodity prices from first quarter of 2020 to the second quarter of 2020. Net income was also impacted by an increase in O&M and G&A expenses for the quarter primarily as a result of a non-cash loss on retirement of an Ark-La-Tex gathering system. Decreases in our adjusted EBITDA and DCF results were impacted by lower prices and volumes. But these measures exclude the non-cash impacts from the changes in the fair value of derivatives in the non-cash loss on retirement of assets. DCF also benefited from lower adjusted interest expense and lower maintenance capital expenditures for the quarter. After considering the distributions declared Enable\u2019s distributable cash flow exceeded distributions declared by $76 million, fully funding our $26 million of expansion capital expenditures for the quarter. This was yet another quarter of continued execution for Enable albeit against a different plan than what we had envisioned at the beginning of the year. And as Rob mentioned earlier in the call, we are reaffirming the outlook we provided last quarter, and we still expect to fully fund our anticipated expansion capital expenditures for the year while reducing total debt levels.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rod. \nRod Sailor : Thanks, John, as I said before, Enable is a strong company that is built for the long-term. We believe we entered this downturn from a position of strength. Our large scale, fully integrated mid-stream platforms is a critical link between production and downstream markets. Our contracts are primarily fee based, and we expect over 90% of gross margin for the balance of the year to be fee based or hedged. In our transportation and storage segment, we continue to develop new capital efficient projects and re-contract capacity.  In our gathering and processing segment, we are aligned with key producers in key producing basins and recent long-term natural gas outlooks from Wood McKinsey support long-term growth in the scoop, stack and Haynesville plays. We took decisive action earlier this year to strengthen the company and we will continue to take the necessary actions to position Enable for success in 2020 and beyond.  We will now open the call for your questions.\nOperator:\n.:\nGabe Moreen: Quick question my connection\u2019s kind of poor so hopefully you can hear me. I wanted to know your expectations sort of in some of the stack on the dry gas coming back. Has that come back entirely? And then also, you mentioned record volumes in the Ark-La-Tex trajectory for the back half of the year, if you can, you can speak to that a little bit too?\nRod Sailor: First on the stack, primarily the shut-ins that we talked about on the first quarter call, were largely in the scoop area, the more they're more crude -- more crude focused areas. And as we said about in the release, and as we said on this call, what we've seen just with the price dynamics look like they're strengthening the back half and early 2021. We have now seen some, as the scoop crude and gas has come back online. We've seen some of our stack wells, get shut in and again, as we said right now we would anticipate that this stay, those volumes to stay curtailed for the third quarter. I believe you were breaking up a little bit, but I believe the back half of your question was around the Haynesville. And again, we continue to see those volumes growing through the year. And so I think that that was your question. \nGabe Moreen: Can you talk about MRT's Southbound project? Was that new? And then also sequentially, it looks like the amount of contracted capacity on the interstate side has declined lately and what the impact was. \nRod Sailor: We did announce the expansion ourselves on, oh, I'm sorry. \nJohn Laws: That's right. So I think as Rod was saying, we got the southbound contracts that is what we were talking about before we entered and got everything finalized with the MRT agreement. We did have some ability to close out. So that is new. It is new for this year, but it had been contemplated in the first quarter, when we talked about the contribution that we were expecting from the rate case in future years, I think if you think about the sequential reductions, we did have just to remind you some of the time back that we had talked about in aggregate volumes on MRT from some of the larger customers there, but again, much of that was replaced with the new rates that we talked about in the first quarter. And then we also had expiration online CP earlier this year has shown up in the sequential numbers as well.  So nothing really new from a development standpoint and what we had otherwise contemplated and really no capital per se de minimus capital on the southbound expansion if that was your question.\nGabe Moreen : That\u2019s really helpful. And last one from me is just on -- there's some language in the queue about the DAPL shutdown or potential shutdown and the impact on the Williston in the last couple of pads still being off-line, is that waiting on a DAPL decision? And if DAPL does go off-line, your view in terms of how volumes look there. \nRod Sailor: I would say we, we feel like we have outlets for all of our crude, outside of DAPL capacity, but I would say that again, if DAPL were to be shut down, that's going to put pressure on the entire basin and that would likely result in some curtailments but again, right now, we believe that again, the two pads that are offline that's not related to DAPL. \nOperator: Our next question is from Colton Bean with Tudor Pickering Holt. Your line is open.\nColton Bean: Just looking at the full year guide to 900 million and 960 million adjusted EBITDA versus first half at a little over 500, can you speak more to your expectations for the back half of the year? Is it seems like the guide would imply flat to down versus Q2. \nJohn Laws: And I think, we're at as we affirmed on the call this morning, our range is, we really wouldn't point directionally anywhere kind of north of the midpoint. We're comfortable with the range as it sits today. \nColton Bean: Understood. And then you mentioned you're still in commercial discussions around Gulf Run. Any preliminary thoughts on how you might fund that projects and whether the existing commitments are sufficient to attract or to attract project financing?\nRod Sailor: Yes, again, we've got a lot of -- as John has mentioned in the past go on options around the Gulf Run funding. I think we need to, as soon as we said on the call, it is wise. We still have some commercial discussions going on. We need to get those settled, we would anticipate that we'd have everything wrapped up by the end of the year on that as the answer a project financing, yes, we've got really strong contracts and currently very good credit quality behind that. That is an option we did look at, along with some others. Some other discussions we're having both with financials and other players.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Your line is open. \nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning, just wanted to kind of pick up with the guidance, questions before here, and you said you won't anything north of the middle of the range? And I guess just trying to think of how that ties to I guess, rigs running on your areas that kind of assuming, you have the current, drilling activity levels stay consistent from these what you've seen in July with the seven rigs here or is that assuming kind of rigs decline just trying to get a feeling for those signposts there?\nRod Sailor: Yes, I'll say a few words and then turn it over to John, Jeremy. But, I mean, again, as we said, we continue to see activity along our system specifically in the Anadarko and the Haynesville. In Anadarko, we're not seeing a lot of completions primarily what we're seeing is duck counts grow in the Anadarko and in the Bakken area. And again, there's still some uncertainty around price. And that's why we're guiding the way that again, that's the way we\u2019re guiding and John may add.\nJohn Laws: I think that\u2019s well said. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Thanks for that. And during the quarter, I think you guys made some bond repurchases out there just wondering if that's something we should expect to continue seeing happen with the kind of to the latest with the rating agencies there. And I guess your thoughts on retaining investment grid?\nJohn Laws: Three part question there as it relates to the repurchases. Those were opportunistic in nature, through the second quarter at least before we started early spreads are very wide. Those bonds and the complex was trading at a pretty deep discount. We saw meaningful recovery, of course through the quarter, but we were able to take advantage of a little bit of that discount on an opportunistic basis. I think you should continue to expect us to think about and act opportunistically, if that makes sense. But where we're at from a rating agency standpoint is not dissimilar from where we've where been in the past, ratings have all recently been affirmed media negative outlooks at S&P and Fitch. But I think we're continuing to work towards, the efforts that we've described for you this year, earlier in the second quarter around the actions and initiatives that we taken to preserve liquidity and flexibility, through the year and for the future. So, the agencies are well aware of that they they've commented on that and interact there. So our dialogue here hasn't changed and we continue to make good progress on the commitments that we've made on cost, improving liquidity and maintaining that capital discipline as well. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it makes sense. In just the last one if I could, I wanted to get your thoughts with regards to some M&A activity we seen in midstream recently, we saw Berkshire kind of make a big purchase in this space. And, wondered if you thought there you guys own transmission assets, kind of similar a similar stature that, and just also, I guess, with the two new additions board, wondering if there'd be any kind of review, strategic outlook for Enable at this point. \nRod Sailor: Well, I think as we've said in the past, we look at a number of things all the time, we're very active in understanding what transactions are taking place in the market. So probably be the only answer I would give is it relates to some of the M&A activities that we've seen. I would say as to the new board members, they were appointed yesterday, getting two very strong industry individuals have a lot of upstream and midstream experience, very well regarded in the space and we look forward to working with them, but as soon as it has any change in the direction that we're going in. \nOperator: Our next question is from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your line is open.\nShneur Gershuni: Good morning. Maybe just a follow up on the last question with respect to kind of the new board members and so forth, it sort of seems every couple of years, this sort of seems to be a discussion about your GP intent with respect to their holdings and so forth. It's just, is this therapy as of late, is that similar to the ones we heard a couple of years ago? Or does the current environment, the fact that you kind of distribution earlier this year sort of accelerated and sort of change the pace or interest in trying to sort of resolve the entire GP versus LP relationships with Enable? \nRod Sailor: Well, I think if you're addressing that, how CenterPoint views their investments and Enable, I think that's a question better asked of CenterPoint and their management. \nShneur Gershuni: Got it. Moving into Gulf Run you talked about one of your earlier responses that you've got financing options. If you were to go down in key route, would you want to retain operating control or be willing to give up operational control? If it was with a larger partner of sorts? \nRod Sailor: Well I would say this way again, generally our predisposition is to own and operate our assets, we think that where Gulf Run sits and again the ability to bring gas in from the garbage and perennial sides that gives us a lot of optionality around our system. But again, we'll evaluate all options and we would never out of term just dismiss any options. If we think that it brings more value to Enable than any other any other option. \nShneur Gershuni: Okay. And maybe for my follow up on, how should we think about the Haynesville production for the second half of \u201820 into \u201821? Just kind of what we're seeing with gas prices and so forth. You've got an MVC contract rolling off, will that impact production volumes, just kind of wondering if you talked about puts and takes, and we sort of think about?\nJohn Laws: Yes, the MVCs have rolled up on that system. And we continue to see volumes grow. And it's our belief that, again, appraisers are very significantly hedged. They've done a great job and maximizing -- minimizing well costs and maximizing the returns around the Haynesville production and we would continue as we sit here today to see it growing into 2021. So, we're not given any guidance on 2021 yet. \nOperator: And your next question is from Anil Duval with Seaport Global Security. Your line is open. \nAnil Duval: Good morning guys, and hopefully everybody is safe. And thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about SESH and especially with regard to the competitiveness of that natural gas in the Florida market?\nRod Sailor: Sure. Good morning. Look, I think the way that we think about SESH is. SESH comes off as sort of the eastern end of our line CP system and there's a number of other interconnection points and feeds down into the end of the Gulfstream, air Gulfstream delivery point and on into the foreign markets, we think that that pathway is a cost advantage pathway is one that has served the Florida and Southeast power markets for a long time and we believe that we'll continue to do so, as the call for generation over time, we expect to continue to grow out of that area in that basin. So, we see it as a very competitive alternative for southeast power market.\nAnil Duval: As you look at re-contracting, can you give us a sense of the range of options that we should think about in terms of terms or the rates as you get process?\nJohn Laws: I stopped short of going exactly there we are in active discussions with a number of parties around how we think about re-contracting. And when I say we, I mean, the SESH joint venture. And so those are those are competitively and commercially sensitive. But, again, I'll go back to we do believe that this is a competitive source of supply for those markets, and we think there's a good long-term viability for that asset. \nAnil Duval: In terms of the timing, are there any regulatory restrictions or things that we should be aware of in terms of resolving that re-contracting? \nRod Sailor: Not that I'm aware of.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alex Kania with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. \nAlex Kania : Good morning. Two questions for you. I think first is, I mean, could you talk a little bit about the cadence of O&M cuts? It looked like it was a little bit higher than Q1 just the one in G&A, through the constant things and then maybe if you could talk a little bit more about the flex points, on when you might want to look at look harder at additional contracts, I guess, as you mentioned there as well as environment where that will make sense or do things need to get worse. And the second question would just be on, I guess, following up on SESH, as well as putting into context with CenterPoint, they were calling the queue. There's a provision where I guess Enbridge could buy because actually have an option to buy SESH. In the event that the CenterPoints just kind of have a lower interest in the business, what are the mechanics of how that would look?\nRod Sailor: On your cost cuts, we started after our announcement back in late March to start cutting, costs, we've gone through, as we said in the release, some redesign and we're largely through that process. We've now identified and achieved the majority of the cuts that we talked about for 2020 some of those especially around headcount reductions with full year effect in 2021. We've still got some work to do to achieve all of the cost cuts that we talked about in our release for 2021. But I think we're on track for those and we're going through them. And so again, I think you can continue to see our O&M coming in line with the cost cuts, come in line with what we announced in late March, early April.\nJohn Laws: And Alex this is John, just want to make sure you took note in the O&M and G&A numbers for this quarter, there was a $17 million loss on retirement embedded in the quarter. And then as related to SESH you\u2019re right there is a mechanism in there at the end of the day, there are, it's not quite as straightforward as you might think it\u2019s complex. There are a number of triggers that one would have to work through in order to understand if the test had been satisfied to trigger the repurchase option. And then the repurchase to the extent there would be one with, would be a fair market value in any event.\nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sailor for any closing remarks. \nRod Sailor: Thank you all very much, and in closing I want to recognize our employees for hard work, dedication, and continued focus on safety during these challenging times. I want to thank everyone on the call for your interest in Enable and hope you all remain safe and healthy and have a great day. \nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may not disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Rod and good morning, everyone. I'll now cover a few of our key operational and financial metrics for the quarter. As always, you can find a more detailed and comprehensive overview of our financial and operational results on our second quarter earnings release and in our 10-Q both of which were released earlier this morning. You can see the impacts of recent production shut-ins on the operational performance overview slide.  Our natural gas gathered processed and transported volumes saw decreases compared to the second quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of production shut-ins in the Anadarko basin. The decreases in our natural gas gathered volumes were partially offset by higher natural gas gathered volumes in the Ark-La-Tex Basin has a result of continued drilling activity in the Haynesville shale play. Our crude oil and condensate volumes were also lower as a result of the shut-ins in both the Anadarko and Williston basins, as Rod mentioned, the shut-ins we saw for the quarter were lower than what we assumed in the financial outlook we provided in May. Turning to our financial results on the next slide we saw lower revenues, gross margin and net income for the second quarter of 2020, compared to the second quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of the lower volumes and prices and changes in the fair value of derivatives as a result of increasing commodity prices from first quarter of 2020 to the second quarter of 2020. Net income was also impacted by an increase in O&M and G&A expenses for the quarter primarily as a result of a non-cash loss on retirement of an Ark-La-Tex gathering system. Decreases in our adjusted EBITDA and DCF results were impacted by lower prices and volumes. But these measures exclude the non-cash impacts from the changes in the fair value of derivatives in the non-cash loss on retirement of assets. DCF also benefited from lower adjusted interest expense and lower maintenance capital expenditures for the quarter. After considering the distributions declared Enable's distributable cash flow exceeded distributions declared by $76 million, fully funding our $26 million of expansion capital expenditures for the quarter.

            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I would like to begin my remarks on Slide four with a few high level business updates. First, our COVID-19 safety protocols remain in place, and we continue to monitor local, state and federal guidelines and recommendations from health organizations. Today, the pandemic has not impacted our ability to maintain safe and reliable operations.  Since early May, we have seen a substantial increase in crude oil prices, due in part to this increase the crude focus shut-ins as we saw during the second quarter, were not as significant as previously anticipated. With the outlook for higher future prices we've seen some new gas wells in the stack shut-in and we expect those shut ins may continue through the third quarter. Based on current commodity prices, our latest discussions with our customers and progress on our costs and capital reduction initiatives, we are reaffirming all aspects of our outlook for 2020 provided on our first quarter earnings call. Finally, despite industry challenges Enable continues to benefit from its strong balance sheet, significant scale and key operating basins and our overall diversified asset portfolio of gathering and processing systems interconnected with natural gas transportation and storage systems.  I will now cover a few financial highlights on the next slide. First, our distributable cash flow exceeded our declared distributions by $76 million for the quarter fully funding our expansion capital expenditures. As I mentioned, we have made good progress executing on our expansion capital and cost reductions we announced in early April. On the cost front, we recently took steps to align our organizational structure for the current industry environment, reducing staffing levels. While building for flexibility in the future. This organizational restructuring resulted in a reduction of 165 positions across the company, including the impact of planned retirements and eliminating open positions. We also have achieved cost savings from releasing leased assets by redeploying existing assets and optimizing operating processing plant assets to match current volumes.  As I've said before, we are limiting our capital expenditures to contracted long-term transportation storage projects, and contracted capital efficient gathering and processing projects. For our Gulf Run project we continue to have commercial discussions to increase the firm commitments to the project. We expect those discussions will continue through the second half of the year. Once concluded, we will finalize the scope and execute our funding plans. Well, some producers have faced credit challenges in the current commodity price environment, we have not experienced any meaningful credit losses during the cycle.  In our gathering and processing segment, we are typically a net payer for our natural gas processing customers, which helps mitigate our credit exposure. And we generally have the right to request adequate assurance from non credit worthy counterparties. Our credit profile is also supported by a strong base of large investment grade utility customers in our transportation and storage segments.  Finally, we repurchased approximately 22 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes during the quarter for approximately $17 million plus accrued interest. We will continue to evaluate opportunistic note repurchases based on market conditions and available liquidity.  Turning to our commercial highlights on the next slide. We contracted or extended almost 1 million decatherms per day of transportation capacity during the quarter, including our previously announced recontracted capacity with EGT's largest customer CERC. The contracted term for the majority of the renewed CERC capacity is nine years. And the effective date of the new contracts will be April 1st, 2021. The CERC contracts, along with our recent MRT contract extensions and our 20 year Gulf Run commitment from Golden Pass L&G demonstrate the strength of Enable's integrated transportation systems and significantly extend the partnerships weighted average contract life. The Gulf Run project is proceeding on schedule and FERC's current schedule anticipates and environmental assessment will be issued by the end of October, subject to FERC approval we still anticipate placing the project into service in late 2022. EGT mass natural gas transportation project remains on schedule for anticipated second quarter 2021 startup. We also recently received a five year commitment for 80,000 decatherms per day of firm capacity on MRT's southbound expansion project with an anticipated fourth quarter 2020 in service date.  Finally, our joint venture pipeline SESH has upcoming contract explorations with the key shipper later this quarter; we believe SESH plays a key role in serving markets in the Southeast with a load factor of well over 90% in recent years and we are focused on re-contracting this capacity. Turning to our gathering and processing commercial highlights. As I mentioned in my opening remarks shut in volumes for the second quarter were less than we had anticipated. Wells curtailed to the scoop and stack plays due to lower crude prices are substantially back online, but we have seen some shut ins in the gassier part of the stack due to anticipated higher natural gas prices. We expect these shut-ins of approximately 0.2 TBTU per day, to continue through the third quarter. To the Williston basin all but two pads are now back online, importantly to date, we have not experienced any significant degradation in well performance from the production that is coming back online. We have seen continued investment from producers in the Haynesville shale plays and the plays long-term outlook remains strong. Rigs also remain active in the Anadarko and Williston basins, building ducks to support future volumes.  I will now turn the call over to John to discuss second quarter results. Thanks, John, as I said before, Enable is a strong company that is built for the long-term. We believe we entered this downturn from a position of strength. Our large scale, fully integrated mid-stream platforms is a critical link between production and downstream markets. Our contracts are primarily fee based, and we expect over 90% of gross margin for the balance of the year to be fee based or hedged. In our transportation and storage segment, we continue to develop new capital efficient projects and re-contract capacity.  In our gathering and processing segment, we are aligned with key producers in key producing basins and recent long-term natural gas outlooks from Wood McKinsey support long-term growth in the scoop, stack and Haynesville plays. We took decisive action earlier this year to strengthen the company and we will continue to take the necessary actions to position Enable for success in 2020 and beyond.  We will now open the call for your questions. First on the stack, primarily the shut-ins that we talked about on the first quarter call, were largely in the scoop area, the more they're more crude -- more crude focused areas. And as we said about in the release, and as we said on this call, what we've seen just with the price dynamics look like they're strengthening the back half and early 2021. We have now seen some, as the scoop crude and gas has come back online. We've seen some of our stack wells, get shut in and again, as we said right now we would anticipate that this stay, those volumes to stay curtailed for the third quarter. I believe you were breaking up a little bit, but I believe the back half of your question was around the Haynesville. And again, we continue to see those volumes growing through the year. And so I think that that was your question. We did announce the expansion ourselves on, oh, I'm sorry. I would say we, we feel like we have outlets for all of our crude, outside of DAPL capacity, but I would say that again, if DAPL were to be shut down, that's going to put pressure on the entire basin and that would likely result in some curtailments but again, right now, we believe that again, the two pads that are offline that's not related to DAPL. Yes, again, we've got a lot of -- as John has mentioned in the past go on options around the Gulf Run funding. I think we need to, as soon as we said on the call, it is wise. We still have some commercial discussions going on. We need to get those settled, we would anticipate that we'd have everything wrapped up by the end of the year on that as the answer a project financing, yes, we've got really strong contracts and currently very good credit quality behind that. That is an option we did look at, along with some others. Some other discussions we're having both with financials and other players. Yes, I'll say a few words and then turn it over to John, Jeremy. But, I mean, again, as we said, we continue to see activity along our system specifically in the Anadarko and the Haynesville. In Anadarko, we're not seeing a lot of completions primarily what we're seeing is duck counts grow in the Anadarko and in the Bakken area. And again, there's still some uncertainty around price. And that's why we're guiding the way that again, that's the way we're guiding and John may add. Well, I think as we've said in the past, we look at a number of things all the time, we're very active in understanding what transactions are taking place in the market. So probably be the only answer I would give is it relates to some of the M&A activities that we've seen. I would say as to the new board members, they were appointed yesterday, getting two very strong industry individuals have a lot of upstream and midstream experience, very well regarded in the space and we look forward to working with them, but as soon as it has any change in the direction that we're going in. Well, I think if you're addressing that, how CenterPoint views their investments and Enable, I think that's a question better asked of CenterPoint and their management. Well I would say this way again, generally our predisposition is to own and operate our assets, we think that where Gulf Run sits and again the ability to bring gas in from the garbage and perennial sides that gives us a lot of optionality around our system. But again, we'll evaluate all options and we would never out of term just dismiss any options. If we think that it brings more value to Enable than any other any other option. Sure. Good morning. Look, I think the way that we think about SESH is. SESH comes off as sort of the eastern end of our line CP system and there's a number of other interconnection points and feeds down into the end of the Gulfstream, air Gulfstream delivery point and on into the foreign markets, we think that that pathway is a cost advantage pathway is one that has served the Florida and Southeast power markets for a long time and we believe that we'll continue to do so, as the call for generation over time, we expect to continue to grow out of that area in that basin. So, we see it as a very competitive alternative for southeast power market. Not that I'm aware of. On your cost cuts, we started after our announcement back in late March to start cutting, costs, we've gone through, as we said in the release, some redesign and we're largely through that process. We've now identified and achieved the majority of the cuts that we talked about for 2020 some of those especially around headcount reductions with full year effect in 2021. We've still got some work to do to achieve all of the cost cuts that we talked about in our release for 2021. But I think we're on track for those and we're going through them. And so again, I think you can continue to see our O&M coming in line with the cost cuts, come in line with what we announced in late March, early April. Thank you all very much, and in closing I want to recognize our employees for hard work, dedication, and continued focus on safety during these challenging times. I want to thank everyone on the call for your interest in Enable and hope you all remain safe and healthy and have a great day."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Enable Midstream Partners First Quarter 2020 Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Enable's Senior Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Matt Beasley. Mr. Beasley, you may begin, sir.\nMatt Beasley: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Presenting on this morning's call are Rod Sailor, our President and CEO; and John Laws, our Chief Financial Officer. To achieve social distancing and limit travel, we only have a small group joining the call in the room today. But, we also have other members of the management team on the phone to answer your questions. Earlier this morning, we issued our earnings press release and filed our Form 10-Q with the SEC. Our earnings press release, Form 10-Q filing and the presentation that accompanies this call are all available in the Investor Relations section of our website. We will also be posting a replay of today's call to the site. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws. Actual results could differ materially from our projections and the discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ from projections can be found in our SEC filings. We will also be referencing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, which we have reconciled to the nearest GAAP measures in the appendix of today's presentation. We invite you to review the disclaimers of this presentation for both forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. With that, we'll get started, and I will turn the call over to Rod Sailor.\nRod Sailor: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. You can see on slide 4, the key topics we plan to cover this morning. As always, Enable is committed to protecting the health and safety of our employees, customers, and communities where we live and work while maintaining continuity and providing vital energy infrastructure services. Second, we plan to spend time today covering the current market environment and its impact on Enable, the significant demand reductions as a result of COVID-19, as well as the supply impacts from actions taken by Russia and Saudi Arabia have resulted in a significant drop in crude prices, which has impacted companies across the energy value chain. The U.S. rig count has dropped almost 50% since early March, and we are starting to see production curtailed in plays across the U.S. to include certain areas of our footprint. During times of market volatility, we believe Enable benefits from its strong balance sheet, significant scale in key operating basins, and our overall diversified asset portfolio of gathering and processing systems interconnected with natural gas, transportation and storage systems. Third, we have quickly responded to this new market environment by reducing our capital expenditures and operating costs. And we are committed to further action as needed to make sure Enable remains strong in 2020 and beyond. Fourth, despite the challenging business environment, we continue to execute on our strategic objectives and we have several key project and contracting updates to share today. Finally, while the market has changed quickly, we know it is important to provide an updated view for 2020. And John will share our updated outlook for the year, at the end of the call. The next slide highlights our response to COVID-19. As the coronavirus began to spread in the U.S., we quickly implemented our business continuity program, allowing us to continue operating our assets and executing on our business objectives. Following the local, state and federal guidelines, and recommendations from health organizations, most of our employees have been working remotely, and we have implemented social distancing practices for the field and other functions unable to work remotely. I am pleased to report that business operations are running smoothly and there have been no COVID-19-related impacts to systems operation or critical business functions, a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employees. To promote physical and mental wellbeing, we are offering multiple support resources to our employees and their families. And we recently committed to make donations to hunger relief organizations in communities across our footprint. Turning to the next slide. As the implications of economic downturn and dramatic commodity price declines became apparent, we quickly announced actions designed to position the company well for the challenges of 2020. These actions included a 50% reduction in our distribution, as well as significant costs and capital reductions, which in total should result in approximately $450 million of additional cash flow on an annualized basis, which can be deployed back into the business to fund capital expenditures and reduce debt. From a capital standpoint, we are limiting our capital expenditures to contracted long-term transportation and storage projects and contracted capital efficient gathering and processing projects. We're also looking for cost reduction opportunities across the business and have already identified significant savings, including idling of certain facilities, deferral of non-critical projects, lower materials and supplies costs as a result of reduced activity, and lower equipment rental costs as we turn back underutilized rental compressor units and replace rental units with unused equity units. Enable is now well-positioned to fully fund its business in 2020, while reducing total debt levels. And we are committed to taking further actions as needed should challenging market conditions persist. As we look at producer activity for the balance of the year, we expect most new well connects will be focused in the Haynesville shale on our Ark-La-Tex system with more limited activity in the Anadarko and Williston Basins. Given significant declines in the demand for crude and the associated reduction in crude prices, we anticipate some amount of near-term production curtailment in the Anadarko and Williston Basins, and we have updated our outlook to reflect curtailments through June. Turning to the next slide. Enable continues to benefit from a diversified asset portfolio. Our transportation and storage segment is anchored by firm contracts with high-quality customers, providing stability during volatile market environments. With a more constructive outlook for natural gas prices further out the curve, we are seeing increased producer interest in growing and completing wells in leaner gas plays, particularly in the Anadarko Basin. And as I just mentioned, we expect producers will continue to drill and complete wells in the Haynesville shale in the Ark-La-Tex Basin. Over the long term, Enable is well-positioned from both a producer operating cost and wellhead pricing perspective. Based on recent third-party research, our gathering footprint includes plays with very competitive operating cost profiles. We also offer unique market solutions to our producers, and many of our producers hold downstream capacity commitments that facilitate moving production to premium markets. The next slide highlights several key project and contract updates. First, we recently received FERC approval on MRT\u2019s rate case settlements. These settlements established rates for service on the MRT system that provide a return on MRT\u2019s historical investments, recovery of the pipeline's ongoing operating costs and rate certainty for customers. We recognized a onetime $17 million revenue benefit in 2020 related to 2019 billings, and we estimate a $7 million benefit on an ongoing basis. Our Gulf Run Pipeline project is proceeding on schedule. We recently filed certificate applications with the FERC on February 28th, and FERC will now conduct an environmental assessment of the project. The project scope filed in the application would provide approximately 1.7 Bcf per day of capacity, which could both accommodate Golden Pass's 1.1 Bcf per day commitment and allow for additional capacity subscriptions that may develop from ongoing discussions, at an estimated total cost for the filed scope of approximately $640 million. The project will be appropriately sized to meet contracted customer capacity commitments, and we estimate a capital cost of approximately $500 million to meet Golden Pass's current 1.1 Bcf per day commitment. Subject to FERC approval, we still anticipate placing the project into service in late 2022. Our MASS natural gas transportation project also remains on schedule for its anticipated second quarter 2021 startup. The project leverages Enable\u2019s existing infrastructure to provide access to emerging Gulf Coast markets and growing Southeast demand markets and is backed by a firm fee-based agreement. On the contracting front, EGT recently recontracted substantial capacity with its largest customer CenterPoint Energy Resources Corporation. The contracted term for the majority of the renewed capacity is nine years and the effective date of the new contracts will be April 1, 2021. We were also recently awarded a three-year renewal for approximately 150,000 dekatherms per day from a utility on the EOIT system. And we recently contracted 100,000 dekatherms per day of capacity for two years, starting in 2021 on EGT's Line CP. Finally, we continue to evaluate asset optimization opportunities, and we recently closed on the sale of EGT's undivided 1/12th interest in the Bistineau Storage Facility. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss first quarter results and our updated 2020 outlook.\nJohn Laws: Thank you, Rod, and good morning, everyone. My remarks will cover our first quarter 2020 operational and financial results at a high level as well as an updated outlook for 2020. As always, you can find a more detailed and comprehensive overview of our financial and operational results in our first quarter earnings release and in our 10-Q, both of which were released earlier this morning. Turning to the operational performance overview slide. We saw a slight decrease in natural gas gathered volumes as a result of lower volumes in the Anadarko and Arkoma Basins offset by volume increases in the Ark-La-Tex Basin. We saw an increase in crude and condensate gathered volumes driven by volume growth in the Anadarko, net of lower gathered volumes in the Williston. Finally, the slight decrease in transported volumes was primarily related to lower gathered volumes. Turning to the financial results on the next slide. Our decline in net income was primarily driven by non-cash impairments that we recognized in our gathering and processing segment during the quarter, offset by revenue increases from FERC's approval of our MRT rate case settlements. The slight decrease in adjusted EBITDA was driven by lower gross margins after adjusting for non-cash items, including an adjustment related to the change in fair value of commodity derivatives. The increase in DCF for the quarter was driven by lower cash payments made pursuant to the partnership\u2019s long-term incentive plan and lower maintenance capital expenditures. After considering the distributions declared, Enable\u2019s distributable cash flow exceeded distributions declared by $142 million, fully funding our $38 million of expansion capital expenditures for the quarter and providing additional cash flow to reduce debt. I will now discuss our updated 2020 outlook on next slide. Before I get into the details, I want to recognize that we find ourselves in a very fluid environment. Accordingly, while we believe demand will return and prices will stabilize over time, we cannot know or predict when that may occur, nor can we predict the full extent or duration of any customer volume curtailments. The outlook shown on this slide reflects current market prices and our expectations for producer activity for the balance of the year, which have been informed by recent commercial dialogue with our key producers. And as Rod mentioned, we expect to see some curtailments in the Anadarko and Williston Basins as well as some new wells connected to our systems, primarily in the Ark-La-Tex Basin. In terms of production curtailments, the outlook assumes that we will see approximately 0.6 TBtu per day of natural gas production and 70,000 barrels per day of crude oil and condensate production curtailed in May. And while most producers are not giving indications on curtailments beyond May, our outlook assumes the curtailments extend through June and an approximate impact of $12 million for the month. At our current distribution rate, and considering the actions we announced in early April to increase retained cash flows, we expect that distributable cash flow will exceed distributions by approximately $325 million at the midpoint of the output. That will allow us to fully fund our anticipated expansion capital expenditures for the year while reducing total debt levels. As I close my remarks, I want to emphasize that even though we're facing near-term challenges, our assets have served customers for many decades through many different industry cycles. We are confident that the steps we are taking position Enable well for success both now and in the future. I will now turn the call back over to Rod.\nRod Sailor: Thanks, John. As we wrap up today's call, I want to emphasize a few key points. First and most importantly, we are committed to protecting the health and safety of employees, customers and communities. Second, Enable is built for the long term. And we continue to benefit from significant scale, diversified assets, integrated systems, unique market solutions, and a strong base of firm demand-driven transportation and storage contracts. Third, Enable remains strong, and the actions we announced in early April create significant financial flexibility and liquidity. Finally, Enable will take the necessary actions to position the Company for success in 2020 and beyond, including continuing to scale expenses and capital to the business environment. That concludes my remarks. And we will now open the call up for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Jeremy Tonet of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJames Kirby: Hey. Good morning, guys. This is James on for Jeremy. I appreciate you taking my questions. Just starting with the updated guidance, I appreciate the color in terms of the next few months how you're seeing production play out across your portfolio. Looking into the back half of the year and the second half, where are kind of the moving pieces in terms of your G&P segment or what can get you to maybe the high end versus low end of the guide?\nRod Sailor: Yes, James. It's Rod. I'll start the answer and John or Michael can weigh in to the extent they need to. I think, as we think about it, and we said this in our commentary around the slides, as we look at the back half of 2020, we continue to see a very constructive dry gas environment setting up. If you recall, we saw a lot of activity in the STACK area, which is a gassier play. As producers focused on crude, they moved down into the SCOOP. Our system can handle activity, be it in the SCOOP, be in the STACK, be it anywhere along the Anadarko basin. So, we do see some opportunities for producers to be a little more active on grilling in some of the gassier windows of the Anadarko if we continue to see a constructive gas environment. On the crude side, really, it's going to be highly dependent on demand and the impacts on demand that increased demand would have on price to see I think more a crude-directed drilling. That's where we've seen the biggest pullback from producers of late. Again, stronger gas prices. Again, we expect to continue to see producers continuing to follow their drilling plans in the Haynesville. So, I think that some of the positives that we would expect or could point to would be around a stronger gas price, what that would do for increased drilling in the gassier of your windows of the Anadarko and potentially others in the Ark-La-Tex Basin. And remember, one of the points we really tried to emphasize is, again, given the integrated nature of our system, the fact that many of our producers are gathering customers have transportation obligations on our system, we continue to work with them to find creative ways to get gas molecules to the absolute best market available. So, I think you need to see some of continued constructive gas environment, and we need to see pickup in crude demand.\nJames Kirby: Okay. Thanks.\nRod Sailor: Just before you leave, I\u2019ll check if John or Michael have anything to say.\nJohn Laws: No, Rod. I think, you said it well. I think just to think about it, maybe building on Rod's comments and really at the end of the day, we just think completions, right? We still have some work going on in the area and in the basins. We got rigs running. But, I think we've been a little conservative from a completion standpoint for the balance of the year. And so, if you see some of the conditions that Rod has described, we're all trying to work our way through this current environment and understand how the demand will rebound and what that will mean for prices. I think there's an opportunity to see the wells that are being drilled, so that rig activity is going on now being brought forward into completions.\nJames Kirby: And then, I just wanted to touch on the -- on the rating agencies and how conversations have been going with them. I assume they've viewed the reconnections as a positive. But, just if there's any rating sensitivities that they've put out for you? I think, S&P put you guys on negative watch. Just how conversations are evolving with them? And if there is any leverage target that you guys are trying to get by year end?\nJohn Laws: Yes. I think, good question. So, we've been in very regular dialogue with each of the three agencies, certainly leading up to the announcements that we had on the 1st of April and thereafter. I think the primary leverage target that the agencies have put out for us -- and it varies a little bit. But generally, that 4.5 times range is, to the extent we're exceeding that on a sustained basis, that begins to be a point where they'll take a harder look and look -- we are entering into this crisis as we closed out last year, with a with a pretty strong balance sheet and under 4 times, we've maintained that leverage level through the first quarter, roughly 3.85 or 3.86 from an overall leverage level. So, yes, we feel like we're relatively well-positioned. The measures that we've taken as well, on top of that just add to that strength as we continue to march through 2020.\nOperator: Next, we have Danilo Juvane of BMO Capital.\nDanilo Juvane: My first one is perhaps for Rod. In your prepared remarks, you talked about being prepared to push further actions to the extent the situations is there. Are there any specific levers that you're thinking about potentially pulling in terms of further actions, and what necessarily makes you pursue further actions up here?\nRod Sailor: I appreciate the question. I think, the point to that comment is, I think we took the right and appropriate actions in April to ensure, strengthen the balance sheet and to give us ultimate financial flexibility and liquidity. And all of those options are on the table going forward, depending on what we see or believe the future holds to us. And I wouldn't rate anything one above the other. But I just wanted to be sure that we made the point that we've got a lot of levers to pull, we pulled some of them, and we'll continue to look at pulling those or additional levers as we think the business climate warrants it.\nDanilo Juvane: That\u2019s helpful, Rod. Thank you. And now, looking at the O&M for the quarter, it was a little bit lighter than what we expected. You identified when you announced the dividend cut host of initiatives, cost savings measures and so forth. I think $35 million in O&M indentified for this year, $70 million for next year. Was any of that accelerated into the quarter? Just wanted some clarity on that.\nRod Sailor: I think a little of it was because we started taking some actions around -- again, some of the actions that we're taking in the first quarter will carry on over into next year. But, yes, but, I think we'll continue. And I think we've got all of the $35 million currently identified and we'll continue to address cost cutting as we go through the year. We'll execute on the $35 million. And it would not surprise me if we saw a little bit more. And again, some of those cost reductions are activity-based. And so again, depending on activity levels, we could see some of those go down. We could see some of them go up with some of the discussions we're having around some of the dryer gas areas.\nDanilo Juvane: Thanks for the color, Rod. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have Shneur Gershuni of UBS.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is Agasha [ph] calling in for Shneur. Could you please provide more color on Continental\u2019s curtailments in the Anadarko, which wells could be impacted, do they focus more on vintage wells? Any color would be helpful.\nRod Sailor: Yes. I don't think it would be appropriate for us to talk about individual customers and curtailments, especially given the Continental will be having I think their earnings call next week, and I'm sure they will be outlining what their plans are. We've tried to point out that the level of curtailments that we've had on our system, and clearly Continental is a large part of those curtailments. But, I don't want to get into any specifics around that. I don't think that would be appropriate for us.\nUnidentified Analyst: Then, what is management thinking about debt repurchases in the open market? Is it part of the strategy this year to reduce debt, and has Enable repurchased any debt so far?\nJohn Laws: We released our Q this morning. So, we don't have any debt repurchases disclosed in there. But look, I think what you should and investors should expect from Enable is that we're going to be front-footed on a number of different things and strategies in evaluating those opportunities and looking at how the debt may trade, could be an opportunity for us that we'll evaluate. But we don't have anything specific to comment on there.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Next we have Alexis Kania of Wolfe Research.\nAlexis Kania: Hey. Good morning. Two questions. I think, first is, you mentioned the EBITDA impact of the June assumption of curtailments, which I think was $12 million to $16 million. Is that a fair assumption to use, to the extent that we see extensions of those curtailments, so that\u2019s again, a good sensitivity that we could use on a monthly basis for the balance of the year? And the second question is just on Gulf Run. Is there kind of a date when you would need to kind of decide on kind of the ultimate sizing of that project during the FERC process? I'm sure there's probably some implications in ordering, kind of pipe diameter and alike. So, I'm kind of curious about kind of what the window was to look for additional supply or contracted volumes.\nRod Sailor: Yes. On the curtailment question, again, just to be clear, we did assume -- in our guidance, we assumed that there would be curtailments in May and June. Again, most of the producers we're talking to are taking it sort of on a monthly basis and have indicated May and very few have pointed to June, but we wanted to -- we felt that was the appropriate timeframe, just given the construct of the curve to take. And the $12 million number was the number that we referenced for June. You could expect that -- again, those wells are somewhat on decline, so that 12 number would slowly decrease over time, should curtailments last past June. We're in the filing process on Gulf Run. And so, yes, there is a date depending on how that process plays out that we will ultimately need to make some decisions around, probably first and foremost the ultimate size. So, we can start thinking about how we want to handle the pipe cost. Today, pipe cost has continued to come down since we announced that project, and that's been favorable to us. Clearly, there will likely be some escalations and other costs. So, right now, we haven't set a firm date that we need to say we're done. It's been an exercise with potential customers that we've had a lot of activity and then, it gets slowed to nothing. And now, we've seen another pickup of activity around potential interest in that project. So, look, our commercial team has done a phenomenal job around that project. They will continue to talk with potential subscribers and capacity right up until we feel that during the regulatory process we need to finalize scope and move forward with making some purchases around -- or making some expenditures related to that project. Probably not as crisp an answer as you'd like, but it is an ongoing situation and we still have some ability to move our time around and still make all of our regulatory and construction deadlines.\nOperator: Next we have Gabe Moreen of Mizuho.\nGabe Moreen: I appreciate that things are highly uncertain at the moment. But, can you maybe speak to sort of the base volume declines maybe you would expecting in your guidance sort of on a 4Q to 4Q basis or 1Q to 1Q basis in the Anadarko, just curious after curtailments are hopefully done with sooner rather than later where you see the base volumes kind of headed absent drilling?\nJohn Laws: Yes. Hey. Good morning, Gabe. It\u2019s John. Thank you for the question. And I do appreciate you're recognizing sort of the -- how fluid things are at the moment. I think, as I mentioned a little bit earlier at the outset is, we're not real aggressive on well connects in the Anadarko this year. And so, -- and we've also not put out specific volumetric guidance here. But, I think, it's probably fair to say I think if you were looking at sort of an overall decline over the year, probably in that 10ish percent range. It'd be a little bit stronger than that if you were looking at Q4-to-Q4. But I'm going to stop short of giving you a specific number just as the inactivity continues to evolve and we don't know exactly how things will matriculate through the balance of the year, and as we're looking here on a fluid basis.\nRod Sailor: Yes. And I might just add that, again, when crude price collapsed and producers started reacting, we've seen -- we're only in sort of the third week of this exercise around most producers shutting in production, and we've seen from our customers some changes in the wells that they planned to shut in. And so, it is a very dynamic environment around that that does make it a little -- I think John said it well. We've made our best assumptions on our outlook based on the activity that we think that we will -- that we have seen and we think that we will see. But again, I think it's -- producers are going to continue to think about where best to find value between ongoing production, their drilling activities and what they want to shut in. I mean, clearly, it's heavily weighted towards crude, but there's a lot of gas with some of those shut-ins. And again, depending on the price construct, you can see that that vary. I think, it'll vary in May and optimistic that we will start to see some of those wells coming on hopefully sooner rather than later.\nGabe Moreen: Thanks, John. Thanks, Rod. And I truly appreciate the uncertainty of the whole exercise. Just want to clarify, John, when you threw out the 10-percentish number, was that Anadarko-specific or sort of a cross-basin kind of stab at the number?\nJohn Laws: That was more of Anadarko. Yes. That's not necessarily in our expectations for some of the drier gas areas. And that gets into a little bit of the difficulty in giving you these numbers as well, because we continue to be encouraged by and see the activity of -- some of the rig activity converting into completions this year.\nGabe Moreen: Got it. And then, second question is, in the past you've been kind of creative I think in terms of coming up with some projects and solutions around basins where there's been excess processing capacity. You had mentioned earlier about cost saves on compressors. I'm just curious whether in your own network of plants in the Anadarko or even in conjunction with others, kind of solutions being bandied about, I think rationalizing some of that capacity. Just curious on your thoughts there.\nRod Sailor: Yes. Look, I think, first, thank you. I do think we've been able to provide some creative solutions to those things and I think we'll continue to look. And look, I think rationalizing processing capacity in and around our footprint has been an exercise that we've continued to champion, probably haven't had as much success with that, again, outside of Wildcat where we were in a growing environment, our Wildcat project. But, we've talked about it in a constricting environment also. And so, nothing to announce there. It is something that we continue to think about. We think about ways to use -- better use our assets. And frankly, in areas where we're seeing a lot more activity, we're trying to find creative ways to partner with our peers and competitors to utilize all the capacity that's out there.\nGabe Moreen: Got it. Thanks Rod.\nOperator: Well, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Sailor for any closing remarks. Sir?\nRod Sailor: Thank you very much. And in closing, I want to recognize all of our employees for their hard work, dedication and continued focus on safety during this challenging time. Look, I thank everyone on the call for your interest in Enable. And I hope you all remain safe and healthy. Please, have a great day.\nOperator: And we thank you, sir and also to the rest of the management team for your time also today. The conference has now concluded. Again, we thank you all for attending today's presentation. At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",

            "name": "John Laws",
            "content": "Thank you, Rod, and good morning, everyone. My remarks will cover our first quarter 2020 operational and financial results at a high level as well as an updated outlook for 2020. As always, you can find a more detailed and comprehensive overview of our financial and operational results in our first quarter earnings release and in our 10-Q, both of which were released earlier this morning. Turning to the operational performance overview slide. We saw a slight decrease in natural gas gathered volumes as a result of lower volumes in the Anadarko and Arkoma Basins offset by volume increases in the Ark-La-Tex Basin. We saw an increase in crude and condensate gathered volumes driven by volume growth in the Anadarko, net of lower gathered volumes in the Williston. Finally, the slight decrease in transported volumes was primarily related to lower gathered volumes. Turning to the financial results on the next slide. Our decline in net income was primarily driven by non-cash impairments that we recognized in our gathering and processing segment during the quarter, offset by revenue increases from FERC's approval of our MRT rate case settlements. The slight decrease in adjusted EBITDA was driven by lower gross margins after adjusting for non-cash items, including an adjustment related to the change in fair value of commodity derivatives. The increase in DCF for the quarter was driven by lower cash payments made pursuant to the partnership's long-term incentive plan and lower maintenance capital expenditures. After considering the distributions declared, Enable's distributable cash flow exceeded distributions declared by $142 million, fully funding our $38 million of expansion capital expenditures for the quarter and providing additional cash flow to reduce debt. I will now discuss our updated 2020 outlook on next slide. Before I get into the details, I want to recognize that we find ourselves in a very fluid environment. Accordingly, while we believe demand will return and prices will stabilize over time, we cannot know or predict when that may occur, nor can we predict the full extent or duration of any customer volume curtailments. The outlook shown on this slide reflects current market prices and our expectations for producer activity for the balance of the year, which have been informed by recent commercial dialogue with our key producers. And as Rod mentioned, we expect to see some curtailments in the Anadarko and Williston Basins as well as some new wells connected to our systems, primarily in the Ark-La-Tex Basin. In terms of production curtailments, the outlook assumes that we will see approximately 0.6 TBtu per day of natural gas production and 70,000 barrels per day of crude oil and condensate production curtailed in May. And while most producers are not giving indications on curtailments beyond May, our outlook assumes the curtailments extend through June and an approximate impact of $12 million for the month. At our current distribution rate, and considering the actions we announced in early April to increase retained cash flows, we expect that distributable cash flow will exceed distributions by approximately $325 million at the midpoint of the output. That will allow us to fully fund our anticipated expansion capital expenditures for the year while reducing total debt levels. As I close my remarks, I want to emphasize that even though we're facing near-term challenges, our assets have served customers for many decades through many different industry cycles. We are confident that the steps we are taking position Enable well for success both now and in the future. I will now turn the call back over to Rod. No, Rod. I think, you said it well. I think just to think about it, maybe building on Rod's comments and really at the end of the day, we just think completions, right? We still have some work going on in the area and in the basins. We got rigs running. But, I think we've been a little conservative from a completion standpoint for the balance of the year. And so, if you see some of the conditions that Rod has described, we're all trying to work our way through this current environment and understand how the demand will rebound and what that will mean for prices. I think there's an opportunity to see the wells that are being drilled, so that rig activity is going on now being brought forward into completions. Yes. I think, good question. So, we've been in very regular dialogue with each of the three agencies, certainly leading up to the announcements that we had on the 1st of April and thereafter. I think the primary leverage target that the agencies have put out for us -- and it varies a little bit. But generally, that 4.5 times range is, to the extent we're exceeding that on a sustained basis, that begins to be a point where they'll take a harder look and look -- we are entering into this crisis as we closed out last year, with a with a pretty strong balance sheet and under 4 times, we've maintained that leverage level through the first quarter, roughly 3.85 or 3.86 from an overall leverage level. So, yes, we feel like we're relatively well-positioned. The measures that we've taken as well, on top of that just add to that strength as we continue to march through 2020. We released our Q this morning. So, we don't have any debt repurchases disclosed in there. But look, I think what you should and investors should expect from Enable is that we're going to be front-footed on a number of different things and strategies in evaluating those opportunities and looking at how the debt may trade, could be an opportunity for us that we'll evaluate. But we don't have anything specific to comment on there. Yes. Hey. Good morning, Gabe. It's John. Thank you for the question. And I do appreciate you're recognizing sort of the -- how fluid things are at the moment. I think, as I mentioned a little bit earlier at the outset is, we're not real aggressive on well connects in the Anadarko this year. And so, -- and we've also not put out specific volumetric guidance here. But, I think, it's probably fair to say I think if you were looking at sort of an overall decline over the year, probably in that 10ish percent range. It'd be a little bit stronger than that if you were looking at Q4-to-Q4. But I'm going to stop short of giving you a specific number just as the inactivity continues to evolve and we don't know exactly how things will matriculate through the balance of the year, and as we're looking here on a fluid basis. That was more of Anadarko. Yes. That's not necessarily in our expectations for some of the drier gas areas. And that gets into a little bit of the difficulty in giving you these numbers as well, because we continue to be encouraged by and see the activity of -- some of the rig activity converting into completions this year."

            "name": "Rod Sailor",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. You can see on slide 4, the key topics we plan to cover this morning. As always, Enable is committed to protecting the health and safety of our employees, customers, and communities where we live and work while maintaining continuity and providing vital energy infrastructure services. Second, we plan to spend time today covering the current market environment and its impact on Enable, the significant demand reductions as a result of COVID-19, as well as the supply impacts from actions taken by Russia and Saudi Arabia have resulted in a significant drop in crude prices, which has impacted companies across the energy value chain. The U.S. rig count has dropped almost 50% since early March, and we are starting to see production curtailed in plays across the U.S. to include certain areas of our footprint. During times of market volatility, we believe Enable benefits from its strong balance sheet, significant scale in key operating basins, and our overall diversified asset portfolio of gathering and processing systems interconnected with natural gas, transportation and storage systems. Third, we have quickly responded to this new market environment by reducing our capital expenditures and operating costs. And we are committed to further action as needed to make sure Enable remains strong in 2020 and beyond. Fourth, despite the challenging business environment, we continue to execute on our strategic objectives and we have several key project and contracting updates to share today. Finally, while the market has changed quickly, we know it is important to provide an updated view for 2020. And John will share our updated outlook for the year, at the end of the call. The next slide highlights our response to COVID-19. As the coronavirus began to spread in the U.S., we quickly implemented our business continuity program, allowing us to continue operating our assets and executing on our business objectives. Following the local, state and federal guidelines, and recommendations from health organizations, most of our employees have been working remotely, and we have implemented social distancing practices for the field and other functions unable to work remotely. I am pleased to report that business operations are running smoothly and there have been no COVID-19-related impacts to systems operation or critical business functions, a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employees. To promote physical and mental wellbeing, we are offering multiple support resources to our employees and their families. And we recently committed to make donations to hunger relief organizations in communities across our footprint. Turning to the next slide. As the implications of economic downturn and dramatic commodity price declines became apparent, we quickly announced actions designed to position the company well for the challenges of 2020. These actions included a 50% reduction in our distribution, as well as significant costs and capital reductions, which in total should result in approximately $450 million of additional cash flow on an annualized basis, which can be deployed back into the business to fund capital expenditures and reduce debt. From a capital standpoint, we are limiting our capital expenditures to contracted long-term transportation and storage projects and contracted capital efficient gathering and processing projects. We're also looking for cost reduction opportunities across the business and have already identified significant savings, including idling of certain facilities, deferral of non-critical projects, lower materials and supplies costs as a result of reduced activity, and lower equipment rental costs as we turn back underutilized rental compressor units and replace rental units with unused equity units. Enable is now well-positioned to fully fund its business in 2020, while reducing total debt levels. And we are committed to taking further actions as needed should challenging market conditions persist. As we look at producer activity for the balance of the year, we expect most new well connects will be focused in the Haynesville shale on our Ark-La-Tex system with more limited activity in the Anadarko and Williston Basins. Given significant declines in the demand for crude and the associated reduction in crude prices, we anticipate some amount of near-term production curtailment in the Anadarko and Williston Basins, and we have updated our outlook to reflect curtailments through June. Turning to the next slide. Enable continues to benefit from a diversified asset portfolio. Our transportation and storage segment is anchored by firm contracts with high-quality customers, providing stability during volatile market environments. With a more constructive outlook for natural gas prices further out the curve, we are seeing increased producer interest in growing and completing wells in leaner gas plays, particularly in the Anadarko Basin. And as I just mentioned, we expect producers will continue to drill and complete wells in the Haynesville shale in the Ark-La-Tex Basin. Over the long term, Enable is well-positioned from both a producer operating cost and wellhead pricing perspective. Based on recent third-party research, our gathering footprint includes plays with very competitive operating cost profiles. We also offer unique market solutions to our producers, and many of our producers hold downstream capacity commitments that facilitate moving production to premium markets. The next slide highlights several key project and contract updates. First, we recently received FERC approval on MRT's rate case settlements. These settlements established rates for service on the MRT system that provide a return on MRT's historical investments, recovery of the pipeline's ongoing operating costs and rate certainty for customers. We recognized a onetime $17 million revenue benefit in 2020 related to 2019 billings, and we estimate a $7 million benefit on an ongoing basis. Our Gulf Run Pipeline project is proceeding on schedule. We recently filed certificate applications with the FERC on February 28th, and FERC will now conduct an environmental assessment of the project. The project scope filed in the application would provide approximately 1.7 Bcf per day of capacity, which could both accommodate Golden Pass's 1.1 Bcf per day commitment and allow for additional capacity subscriptions that may develop from ongoing discussions, at an estimated total cost for the filed scope of approximately $640 million. The project will be appropriately sized to meet contracted customer capacity commitments, and we estimate a capital cost of approximately $500 million to meet Golden Pass's current 1.1 Bcf per day commitment. Subject to FERC approval, we still anticipate placing the project into service in late 2022. Our MASS natural gas transportation project also remains on schedule for its anticipated second quarter 2021 startup. The project leverages Enable's existing infrastructure to provide access to emerging Gulf Coast markets and growing Southeast demand markets and is backed by a firm fee-based agreement. On the contracting front, EGT recently recontracted substantial capacity with its largest customer CenterPoint Energy Resources Corporation. The contracted term for the majority of the renewed capacity is nine years and the effective date of the new contracts will be April 1, 2021. We were also recently awarded a three-year renewal for approximately 150,000 dekatherms per day from a utility on the EOIT system. And we recently contracted 100,000 dekatherms per day of capacity for two years, starting in 2021 on EGT's Line CP. Finally, we continue to evaluate asset optimization opportunities, and we recently closed on the sale of EGT's undivided 1/12th interest in the Bistineau Storage Facility. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss first quarter results and our updated 2020 outlook. Thanks, John. As we wrap up today's call, I want to emphasize a few key points. First and most importantly, we are committed to protecting the health and safety of employees, customers and communities. Second, Enable is built for the long term. And we continue to benefit from significant scale, diversified assets, integrated systems, unique market solutions, and a strong base of firm demand-driven transportation and storage contracts. Third, Enable remains strong, and the actions we announced in early April create significant financial flexibility and liquidity. Finally, Enable will take the necessary actions to position the Company for success in 2020 and beyond, including continuing to scale expenses and capital to the business environment. That concludes my remarks. And we will now open the call up for your questions. Yes, James. It's Rod. I'll start the answer and John or Michael can weigh in to the extent they need to. I think, as we think about it, and we said this in our commentary around the slides, as we look at the back half of 2020, we continue to see a very constructive dry gas environment setting up. If you recall, we saw a lot of activity in the STACK area, which is a gassier play. As producers focused on crude, they moved down into the SCOOP. Our system can handle activity, be it in the SCOOP, be in the STACK, be it anywhere along the Anadarko basin. So, we do see some opportunities for producers to be a little more active on grilling in some of the gassier windows of the Anadarko if we continue to see a constructive gas environment. On the crude side, really, it's going to be highly dependent on demand and the impacts on demand that increased demand would have on price to see I think more a crude-directed drilling. That's where we've seen the biggest pullback from producers of late. Again, stronger gas prices. Again, we expect to continue to see producers continuing to follow their drilling plans in the Haynesville. So, I think that some of the positives that we would expect or could point to would be around a stronger gas price, what that would do for increased drilling in the gassier of your windows of the Anadarko and potentially others in the Ark-La-Tex Basin. And remember, one of the points we really tried to emphasize is, again, given the integrated nature of our system, the fact that many of our producers are gathering customers have transportation obligations on our system, we continue to work with them to find creative ways to get gas molecules to the absolute best market available. So, I think you need to see some of continued constructive gas environment, and we need to see pickup in crude demand. Just before you leave, I'll check if John or Michael have anything to say. I appreciate the question. I think, the point to that comment is, I think we took the right and appropriate actions in April to ensure, strengthen the balance sheet and to give us ultimate financial flexibility and liquidity. And all of those options are on the table going forward, depending on what we see or believe the future holds to us. And I wouldn't rate anything one above the other. But I just wanted to be sure that we made the point that we've got a lot of levers to pull, we pulled some of them, and we'll continue to look at pulling those or additional levers as we think the business climate warrants it. I think a little of it was because we started taking some actions around -- again, some of the actions that we're taking in the first quarter will carry on over into next year. But, yes, but, I think we'll continue. And I think we've got all of the $35 million currently identified and we'll continue to address cost cutting as we go through the year. We'll execute on the $35 million. And it would not surprise me if we saw a little bit more. And again, some of those cost reductions are activity-based. And so again, depending on activity levels, we could see some of those go down. We could see some of them go up with some of the discussions we're having around some of the dryer gas areas. Yes. I don't think it would be appropriate for us to talk about individual customers and curtailments, especially given the Continental will be having I think their earnings call next week, and I'm sure they will be outlining what their plans are. We've tried to point out that the level of curtailments that we've had on our system, and clearly Continental is a large part of those curtailments. But, I don't want to get into any specifics around that. I don't think that would be appropriate for us. Yes. On the curtailment question, again, just to be clear, we did assume -- in our guidance, we assumed that there would be curtailments in May and June. Again, most of the producers we're talking to are taking it sort of on a monthly basis and have indicated May and very few have pointed to June, but we wanted to -- we felt that was the appropriate timeframe, just given the construct of the curve to take. And the $12 million number was the number that we referenced for June. You could expect that -- again, those wells are somewhat on decline, so that 12 number would slowly decrease over time, should curtailments last past June. We're in the filing process on Gulf Run. And so, yes, there is a date depending on how that process plays out that we will ultimately need to make some decisions around, probably first and foremost the ultimate size. So, we can start thinking about how we want to handle the pipe cost. Today, pipe cost has continued to come down since we announced that project, and that's been favorable to us. Clearly, there will likely be some escalations and other costs. So, right now, we haven't set a firm date that we need to say we're done. It's been an exercise with potential customers that we've had a lot of activity and then, it gets slowed to nothing. And now, we've seen another pickup of activity around potential interest in that project. So, look, our commercial team has done a phenomenal job around that project. They will continue to talk with potential subscribers and capacity right up until we feel that during the regulatory process we need to finalize scope and move forward with making some purchases around -- or making some expenditures related to that project. Probably not as crisp an answer as you'd like, but it is an ongoing situation and we still have some ability to move our time around and still make all of our regulatory and construction deadlines. Yes. And I might just add that, again, when crude price collapsed and producers started reacting, we've seen -- we're only in sort of the third week of this exercise around most producers shutting in production, and we've seen from our customers some changes in the wells that they planned to shut in. And so, it is a very dynamic environment around that that does make it a little -- I think John said it well. We've made our best assumptions on our outlook based on the activity that we think that we will -- that we have seen and we think that we will see. But again, I think it's -- producers are going to continue to think about where best to find value between ongoing production, their drilling activities and what they want to shut in. I mean, clearly, it's heavily weighted towards crude, but there's a lot of gas with some of those shut-ins. And again, depending on the price construct, you can see that that vary. I think, it'll vary in May and optimistic that we will start to see some of those wells coming on hopefully sooner rather than later. Yes. Look, I think, first, thank you. I do think we've been able to provide some creative solutions to those things and I think we'll continue to look. And look, I think rationalizing processing capacity in and around our footprint has been an exercise that we've continued to champion, probably haven't had as much success with that, again, outside of Wildcat where we were in a growing environment, our Wildcat project. But, we've talked about it in a constricting environment also. And so, nothing to announce there. It is something that we continue to think about. We think about ways to use -- better use our assets. And frankly, in areas where we're seeing a lot more activity, we're trying to find creative ways to partner with our peers and competitors to utilize all the capacity that's out there. Thank you very much. And in closing, I want to recognize all of our employees for their hard work, dedication and continued focus on safety during this challenging time. Look, I thank everyone on the call for your interest in Enable. And I hope you all remain safe and healthy. Please, have a great day."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is also being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Tom Long, Co-Chief Executive Officer for Energy Transfer. Thank you. You may begin.\nTom Long: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call, and thank you for joining us today. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of our senior management team, who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based on our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which we expect to be filed this Friday, February 18. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'd like to start today by looking at some of our fourth quarter and full year 2021 highlights. For the full year 2021, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $13 billion, which was a significant increase over 2020 and in line with our expectations. DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, was $8.2 billion, which resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $6.4 billion. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of approximately $5 billion after distributions of $1.8 billion and growth capital of approximately $1.4 billion. On January 25, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.175 per common unit or $0.70 on an annualized basis, which represents a 15% increase over the previous quarter and represents the first step in our plan to return additional value to unitholders. Operationally, we moved record volumes through our NGL pipelines and NGL and refined products terminals for the full year 2021, primarily driven by growth in volumes through our Nederland terminal and on our Mariner East pipeline system. In addition, NGL fractionation volumes reached a new record during the fourth quarter, largely driven by growth in volumes leading our Mont Belvieu fractionators. At our Nederland terminal, we completed expansions in early 2021 that brought our company-wide total NGL export capacity to more than 1.1 million barrels per day which we believe is the largest in the world. On December 2, 2021, we completed our acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners, which provides increased scale in the Mid-Continent and Ark-La-Tex regions and improved connectivity for our natural gas, crude oil and NGL transportation customers. The combination of Energy Transfer's and Enable's complementary assets will allow us to continue to provide flexible, reliable and competitive services for our customers as we pursue additional commercial opportunities utilizing our improved connectivity and expanded footprint. We continue to expect the combined company to generate more than $100 million of annual run rate cost savings synergies, of which we expect to achieve $75 million in 2022. In addition, we are in the process of identifying and evaluating a number of commercial and operational synergies that are expected to enhance the operational capabilities of our systems by capitalizing on improved efficiencies and increasing utilization and profitability of our combined assets. Before moving to a growth project update, I want to briefly touch on the recent winter weather conditions seen across many of our assets. This out of winter weather was less severe and significantly less disruptive than winter storm Uri last year, and commodity prices remained much more stable throughout as a result. As we always do, we have procedures in place to provide layers of protection and risk mitigation, including engineering controls and winterization processes and preplanning and prepositioning of resources to assure, we are able to respond when needed. Our extensive experience with operating pipelines, processing plants and storage facilities combined with a significant amount of preparation allows us to operate reliably throughout extreme weather conditions, and this is due to the consistent and extraordinary efforts of our employees. I'll now walk you through recent developments on our growth projects. Starting with Mariner East Pipeline system. Construction of the final phase of the Mariner East pipeline is complete and commissioning is in progress which will bring our total NGL capacity on the Mariner East pipeline system to 350,000 to 375,000 barrels per day, including ethane. Energy Transfer's Mariner East pipeline system now includes multiple pipelines across the state of Pennsylvania, connecting the prolific Marcellus and Utica shales to markets throughout the state and the broader region, including Energy Transfer's Marcus Hook terminal on the East Coast. For full year 2021, NGL volumes through the Mariner East pipeline system and Marcus Hub terminal are up nearly 10% over 2020. With our expanded network, we will see volumes continue to grow. In our Pennsylvania Access project, which allows refined products to flow from the Midwest supply regions into Pennsylvania, New York and other markets in the Northeast started flowing refined products in January. At our expanded Nederland terminal, NGL volumes continued to increase during the fourth quarter, including export volumes under our Orbit ethane export joint venture, which have remained strong. For the full year 2021, we loaded nearly 26 million barrels of ethane out of the facility. For 2022, we expect to load a minimum of 40 million barrels of ethane and project this to increase to up to 60 million barrels for 2023. We also expect our LPG export volumes at Nederland to continue to grow in 2022. And in total, our percentage of worldwide NGL exports has doubled over the last 2 years, capturing nearly 20% of the world market, which was more than any other company or country exported during the fourth quarter of 2021. At Mont Belvieu, we recently brought online a 3 million-barrel high-rate storage well, which increases our total wells to 24 and our NGL storage capabilities at Mont Belvieu to 53 million barrels. Turning to our Cushing South pipeline. In early June, we commenced service on the 65,000 barrels per day crude oil pipeline, providing transportation service from our Cushing terminal to our Nederland terminal, which also provides access for Powder River and DJ Basin barrels to our Nederland terminal via an upstream connection with our White Cliffs pipeline. This pipe is already being fully utilized. And as we mentioned on our last call, we are moving forward with Phase 2, which will nearly double the pipeline's capacity to 120,000 barrels per day. Phase 2 is expected to be in service by the end of the first quarter of 2022 and is underpinned by third-party commitments. As a reminder, minimal capital spend was required for this phase. Next, construction on the Ted Collins link is progressing and is now expected to be completed late in the first quarter of 2022. The Ted Collins link will increase market connectivity for our Houston terminal. It will also give us the ability to fully load and export WTI barrels as well as low gravity Bakken barrels out of the Houston market, demonstrating Energy Transfer's unique capability to provide a neat Bakken barrel to markets along the Gulf Coast. Our Permian Bridge project, which connects our gathering and processing assets in the Delaware Basin with our G&P assets in the Midland Basin, was placed into service in October and continues to be significantly utilized. This project allows us to move approximately 115,000 Mcf per day of rich gas out of the Midland Basin and to utilize available processing capacity more efficiently, while also providing access to additional takeaway options. In addition, an expansion is underway, which will bring the top line's total capacity to over 200,000 Mcf per day in the first quarter of 2022. And due to significantly increased producer demand, we now plan to build a new 200 MMcf per day cryogenic processing plant in the Delaware Basin. The Gray Wolf plant is supported by new commitments and growth from existing customer contracts and is expected to be in service by the end of 2022. In addition, to provide incremental revenue to our Midstream segment, once in service, the volumes from the tailgate of the plant will utilize our gas and NGL pipelines for takeaway, providing 3 revenue streams. Now in order to address the growing need for additional natural gas takeaway from the Permian Basin, we are diligently evaluating a takeaway project that would utilize existing energy transfer assets along with new build pipeline providing producers with firm capacity to the premier markets of Katy, Carthage, Gilles and Henry Hubs. This pipeline project would include the construction of a new approximately 260-mile pipeline from the Midland Basin to our existing 36-inch pipeline Southwest of Fort Worth, parallelly existing right of way. From there, it would interconnect with our existing assets with available capacity for delivery through our vast pipeline network to markets at Carthage as well as the Katy, Beaumont and the Houston Ship Channel and other markets along the Gulf Coast, including deliveries to the Gilles and Henry Hub. We view this project as an ideal solution for natural gas growth out of the Permian Basin that we can complete much more quickly than our competitors' options at significantly less cost about following an existing right of way along the majority of the route. In addition, it is aligned with our strategy of identifying and repurposing underutilized assets in order to maximize the value of our uniquely positioned existing asset base. Customer discussions are underway as we pursue this project. Given the proposed route and our ability to utilize existing assets, we believe we could complete construction of project in 2 years or less once we have reached FID. Turning to the Gulf Run Pipeline, which will be a 42-inch interstate natural gas pipeline with 1.65 Bcf per day of capacity. Gulf Run is backed by a 20-year commitment from Golden Pass LNG and will provide natural gas transportation between the Haynesville Shale and the Gulf Coast, connecting some of the most prolific natural gas-producing regions in the U.S. with the LNG export market. Pipeline construction is underway and is expected to be completed by the end of 2022. Lastly, in July of 2021, we announced the signing of a memorandum understanding with Republic of Panama to study the feasibility of jointly developing a proposed Trans-Panama Gateway Pipeline. We anticipate working closely with Panama to successfully bring this project to fruition. Panama's geographic location and favorable investment climate make this an attractive project. We continue to believe this project will create the most liquid and attractive LPG supply hub in the world and are excited about the opportunity it presents. Now for an update on our alternative energy activities. In January of 2022, we announced that we expanded our Alternative Energy Group through the hiring of a Vice President of Alternative Energy. This role is responsible for developing Alternative Energy and carbon capture projects for Energy Transfer, along with various ESG initiatives, including the development of carbon capture offset programs that are accretive to our operations. In addition to the 2 solar projects we announced in 2021, we are also continuing to explore several opportunities for solar, wind and forestry carbon credit projects on our existing acreage in the Appalachian region. We remain in discussions with other large renewable energy developers. On the carbon capture front, we continue to pursue our carbon capture project at Marcus Hook that would involve capturing CO2 from the flue gas and delivering it to the customers for use in the food and beverage industries. This project looks financially attractive based upon preliminary cost estimates and design feasibility studies. We are also pursuing several carbon projects related to our assets, including projects involving the capture of CO2 from processing and treating plants for use in enhanced oil recovery for sequestration. We continue to believe that our franchise will allow us to participate in a variety of projects involving carbon capture or other innovative uses as we continue to reduce our carbon footprint. Lastly, we published our annual corporate responsibility report to our website in December. Now let's take a closer look at our fourth quarter results. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $2.8 billion compared to $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020. DCF attributable to the partners, as adjusted, was $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter compared to $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020. For the fourth quarter, we saw higher transportation volumes across all of our segments, including record volumes in the NGL and refined products segment as well as a $60 million adjusted EBITDA contribution from the acquisition of Enable for the month of December. On January 25, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.175 per common unit or $0.70 on an annualized basis. This distribution will be paid on February 18 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on February 8. This distribution represents a 15% increase over the previous quarter and represents the first step in our plan to return additional value to unitholders while maintaining our leverage ratio target of 4 to 4.5x debt to EBITDA. Future increases to the distribution level will be evaluated quarterly with the ultimate goal of returning distributions to the previous level of $0.305 per quarter or $1.22 on an annualized basis while balancing our leverage target, growth opportunities and unit buybacks. Turning to our results by segment and starting with NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was $739 million compared to $703 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to higher transportation and terminal services margins related to increased throughput at our Nederland terminal in the fourth quarter of 2021 as well as increased fractionation in refinery services margin. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines increased to a record 1.9 million barrels per day compared to 1.4 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to increased export volumes feeding into our Nederland terminal from the initiation of service on our propane and ethane export projects, higher volumes from the Permian and Eagle Ford regions as well as increased volumes on our Mariner East pipeline system. And our fractionators also reached another record for the quarter. With average fractionated volumes of 895,000 barrels per day compared to 825,000 barrels per day for the fourth quarter of 2020. For our crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $533 million compared to $517 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to higher crude oil transportation volumes out of the Permian Basin improved volumes through our Nederland terminal and improved performance on our Bakken and Bayou Bridge pipelines as a result of recovering volumes in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the addition of the Enable assets. For Midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $547 million compared to $390 million for the fourth quarter of 2020. This was primarily due to a $147 million increase related to favorable NGL and natural gas prices. In addition, our Midstream segment also benefited from growth in the Permian, South Texas and Northeast and the acquisition of the Enable assets in December 2021. Gathered gas volumes were 14.8 million MMBtus per day compared to 12.6 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year due to higher volumes in the Permian, South Texas and Northeast regions as well as addition of the Enable assets in December of 2021. Permian Basin volumes continue to be strong and Midland volumes remain at or near record highs. As a result, we are expanding our Permian Bridge project and constructing our new Grey Wolf processing plant in the Delaware Basin. In our Interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $397 million compared to $448 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. While volumes are beginning to improve, we did experience contract expirations at the end of 2020 on Tiger and FEP. And due to very mild temperatures throughout the Midwest, we experienced lower demand on our Panhandle and Trunkline systems during the fourth quarter. However, these decreases were partially offset by increases on Rover and Tiger due to more favorable market conditions and to significant volume growth out of the Haynesville. These results also include the Enable assets in December of 2021. We have seen steady growth recently in the Interstate segment with the fourth quarter up more than 10% over the third quarter of 2021 even without the impact of Enable. For our Intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $274 million compared to $233 million in the fourth quarter of last year. This was primarily due to increased firm transportation volumes from the Permian and South Texas, the recognition of certain revenues related to winter storm Uri and an increase in retained fuel revenues due to higher natural gas prices as well as the addition of the Enable assets in December of 2021. Now turning to our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance. With expectations for continued strong performance from our existing business as well as the addition of the Enable assets, we expect our full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be $11.8 billion to $12.2 billion. And moving to our 2022 growth capital expenditures. We expect growth capital expenditures, including expenditures related to the recently acquired Enable assets to be between $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion, balanced primarily across the midstream NGL and refined products in Interstate segments. This number includes approximately $200 million of 2021 planned capital that has been deferred into 2022 as well as growth capital related to the recently acquired Enable assets, in particular, Gulf Run pipeline. In addition, this includes newly approved projects in the Permian Basin that support growing natural gas production through new gathering and processing capacity, improved efficiencies and reduced emissions. These projects include construction of a new processing plant optimization of the Oasis pipeline and modernization and debottlenecking of the existing system. The majority of these new projects are expected to provide strong returns and be completed at a 6x multiple on average. Now looking briefly at our liquidity position. As of December 31, 2021, total available liquidity under our revolving credit facility was slightly over $2 billion, and our leverage ratio was 3.07% for the credit facility. During the fourth quarter, we utilized cash from operations to reduce our outstanding debt for approximately $400 million. And for full year 2021, we reduced our long-term debt by approximately $6.3 billion. We expect to generate a significant amount of cash flow in 2022, which will be strategically allocated in a manner that best positions us to continue to improve our leverage, invest in the growth of the partnership and return value to our unitholders. As we approach our leverage target range, we have taken our first steps toward returning additional capital to our equity holders through distribution growth, which we will continue to evaluate on a quarterly basis. In addition, we have increased our growth capital spend, as I mentioned earlier on the call, with this capital focused on strong returning projects that will be in service in less than 12 months. And we expect to continue to pay down debt throughout the year with excess cash flow from operations. During the fourth quarter, we continue to see volumes recover across many of our systems, including another record quarter for volumes in our NGL and refined products segment. Looking ahead, we are excited about the opportunities in front of us. We will continue to explore and implement commercial synergies around the recently acquired Enable assets. And we continue to see growth across our NGL business segment, driven by increasing demand, both domestically and internationally.  We have entered 2022 with a much stronger balance sheet than 2021, and we'll continue to place emphasis on financial flexibility and pay down debt in 2022 while continuing to position ourselves to return value to our unitholders. Given the volume growth expected out of the Permian Basin, we have some attractive new projects underway that will address new demand, enhance the efficiency and flexibility of our existing asset base and generate attractive returns above our target threshold. We also continue to make progress on the alternative energy front, which can further enhance and effectively grow our Energy franchise. Operator, please open the line up for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: Congrats on a good end of year and good quarter. Actually, I had 2. One is, in the potential development of a takeaway solution for natural gas coming out of the Permian, can you talk a little bit about just what the early feedback from shippers has been? Meaning, what's the level of interest in shippers to sign a 10 or 15-year contract? Or are they more willing to do and want to do shorter-term deals? That's the first question. And then the second question is, can you just talk a little bit about the Permian Express system and where you might have recontracts, contracts that roll off over the next couple of years?\nMackie McCrea: You bet, Michael. This is Mackie. We are so excited about this project. We haven't really spoken a lot about it. We have more capacity than anybody else now across the states. We've been accommodating volumes growth for the last year or 2. We've heard a lot of our competitors talk about a project, how needed it was, how close they were to getting a project online. And it really became important over the last number of weeks that we kick in, in a big way. And so to answer your question, the customers that we talk to are very excited. If you compare our project to anybody else, most of them have gone either from the Waha area down to [indiscernible] or now they're talking about going to Katy and the luxury of what our project will provide will be just kind of a smorgasbord of markets. And we've said in the statements by Tom earlier, but the bottom line is we will take Permian Basin molecules and deliver them to the best markets on the Gulf Coast to Katy, to ship channel, to some of the LNG markets, to Henry Hub to Gilles and the better markets in Louisiana. Some of these producers can stop or shippers can stop in Carthage. So we're extremely excited about this. We continue to do what we've been doing for a long time, and let's look at all of our assets and not only how we repurpose them possibly to make more revenue, but also how we use more efficiently and utilize them in a better way. And this project will allow that. It's probably a 200-mile less pipeline than our competitors. It will tie into 36- and 42-inch pipelines downstream, where we have a significant amount of capacity, they will need to -- say we're very excited in the customers we've spoken to are as well. In regards to Permian Express, spread, as everybody knows, have fallen off dramatically over the last couple of years. The -- as the industry does commonly, we go through the cycle of over building. And clearly, the crude side of our business is overbuilt. As we always say, though, we feel very fortunate that we have assets that reach out all the way to the wellhead and we don't stop it in Houston now or Nederland or Bayou Bridge or put barrels on the water and even deliver through our Mid-Valley system up in the Mid-Continent. So we can often more than any of our competitors, and our teams at the results have shown this quarter have done a fantastic job of keeping Permian Express full and growing them. Our volumes fall off to the pandemic. We grow significantly fourth quarter over fourth quarter that we just showed in our results. And so yes, contracts have rolled off over the last 2 or 3 years. We're not looking at locking in long-term contracts right now where the spreads are, but we'll see this production start to increase over the next 2 or 3 years, and we'll certainly capitalize on the spreads as they move out. But in the meantime, we're all for this string of services from the wellhead all the way to loading on ships or to refineries, and we're pretty excited about our true growth business through these assets.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.\nChase Mulvehill: Just a follow-up question here. If we think about the potential capacity of the pipelines coming out of the Permian or the natural gas coming out of the Permian, how much capacity do you think you'll be able to kind of pull out of there and get to the Gulf Coast as you look at these conversions for this Permian nat gas takeaway projects?\nMackie McCrea: The way we're going to look at that is, of course, listen to our customers and we'll design a system that can meet those demands. But what we anticipate is kind of a minimum of combined capacity that we have today on Oasis that's available today and in the future. And with this new pipeline project, we'll have a target between 1.5 and 2 Bcf of new takeaway capacity, a couple of years after we reach FID.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay. All right. That makes sense. And you said, once you reach FID, to take you kind of 2 years to put it in service, and it seems like it's early stages, maybe conversations with customers. So maybe we're a few months away from FID. And if we kind of look forward 2 months, where $90 crude is going to incentivize a lot more activity in the Permian. It's only going to pull this bottleneck forward, not push it to the right. So it's probably going to happen even faster than people think. And so we reach that point of constraint for natural gas takeaway capacity earlier in the Permian in 2023.  So maybe walk us through your Permian business and help us understand the puts and takes, where you can make more money and where it might hurt you if you hit some bottlenecks for nat gas takeaway in the permit?\nMackie McCrea: Okay. Yes. Look -- and we've spoken about a few of these projects. We are in the middle of the project right now where we're spending on a great deal of capital, and we're increasing the capacity on Oasis by between 40,000 and 45,000 a day. We're looking at another expansion where we can increase it by about another 20,000. So -- and we should kick that off pretty soon. Not a lot of capital, just adding compression, and we'll be able to move about 60,000 more a day. So to your question about it could move forward more quickly, we agree with that, we think if you look at some of the forward curves, you're out over $1, $1.20, I think, latter part of '22 and '23, and we're well positioned to capitalize on that. We have capacity on Oasis. We have more capacity coming available in the next couple of years on contracts that are rolling off at much lower rates than where we think the market will be. So we positioned ourselves very well. So we're kind of capitalizing in 3 different ways. One, on what we have today, wherever the spread is, we're, of course, benefiting from that. We're adding capacity where it makes sense, and I just alluded to on the 60,000 that would be adding here the next 6 or 7 months. And then once we hopefully get to FID here in the coming quarters, then we'll add additional takeaway. But there is going to be some tough time regardless of the decisions late for whoever it's going to build the next pipe, and we do believe there is going to be a blowout spreads, and we're sitting in a very good spot there because where our assets are in the available capacity we have to move Permian Basin volumes to the Gulf Coast.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: I just want to start off with the CapEx, if I could? I was just wondering if you could help us bridge, I guess, the $500 million to $700 million guide before to now? And any numbers you could put around how much was Enable versus new projects? Just trying to better understand the drivers there.\nTom Long: Okay. Yes. Jeremy, this is Tom. One, will I start first with the split of how the numbers are coming out between the various segments. And I appreciate the fact that Gulf Run is now included in this. But the largest piece of this is really earmarked toward the midstream. You heard us talk about like the new processing plant. So that's probably about 35%, 36% of the number. Then moving next, you're going to move into the interstate with the Gulf Run that I just mentioned, you're probably running about 20%, 23% or so on that piece of it. And then when you keep moving on down through the mix, the NGL and refined products are 20%, 21% with crude intrastate and other kind of bringing up the last of it. But that's the way you really kind of see it. Now kind of looking at this, remember that we did roll over a couple of hundred million from projects and in 2021. So we probably need to start with that. As far as the rest of the pieces of it, that's really how it's probably best to try to break that out. I don't really have a bridge necessarily between the $700 million to these numbers. But I would say the biggest chunk of that is coming in with the Gulf Run.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful there. And I just want to turn to Enable for a minute, if I could? Just wondering now that you have them in the fold for a little bit here, wondering how things are going versus expectations? And really, I just wanted to see, you talked about converting assets like for this potential new Permian gas pipe project, do you see, I guess, more potential conversions now that you have kind of a larger set of assets to work with here?\nTom Long: Yes, Jeremy, we do. We're very excited. As we've said before, we hadn't really dug into the commercial synergies. We knew they were there. We saw some kind of easy ones. But as we've dug in, we found more. There's a number of ways where we can run plants more efficiently. There's pipelines that we're looking at, we can convert them to a different product, particularly NGL in a couple of instances. And we're also looking at combining assets and pipeline assets to move volumes out of Haynesville and into some of the markets to get gas fill -- our assets to the Gulf Coast. So still a little bit early. We'll talk much about those, certainly by our next earnings call will be knee deep and announcements and taking advantage of some of those synergies, but we're very excited with kind of a very preliminary discussions and analysis that we've been going through, but we do have teams working on that daily.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: Just wanted to follow up on some of the Permian gas discussion. Just to confirm, the Oasis pipeline optimization project that you referenced, is that the 60,000 expansion that, Mackie, you were talking about? Or is that the limit as to what Oasis can be expanded?\nMackie McCrea: Mike, it's Mackie. Yes, gosh, limit. We've seen like we've gone through this exercise, I don't know, for years, and we keep adding capacity. And as we study more, we find ways to add more. So the more recent one was the one I mentioned, too, that we're already moving forward on the 40,000-plus -- 40,000, 45,000 Mcf day expansion of ad and compression, and then we're about to approve another smaller one, but a 20,000. So combined, that's about 60,000 or 65,000 of additional capacity that we'll have added by the end of the year, first part of 2023. So that's separate from this other project that we're talking about out of the Midland Basin, a much bigger project to move gas to existing assets that we own over closer to East Texas.\nMichael Blum: Okay. Great. And then on this new project, I think you mentioned you'd have to convert some existing pipelines. Would you -- what service would you be taking those out of? And the second part of that question is for the -- this new larger pipeline, what length of contract will you need to sort of get this thing to FID?\nMackie McCrea: I'll start with the end of that. Our goals on these types of projects are typically 10 years, so that's what we'll be negotiating a lot depends on the rates and what exactly the customer is looking for. So we'll be negotiable on that. But to clarify, no on this one, unlike all the others converting crude oil to gas or gas to NGLs or NGLs to diesel. This is just utilizing capacity that's underutilized today. So for example, we would be tying this project into a 36-inch pipe near Tolar, which is southwest of the Metroplex, DFW Metroplex, and that would tie into our massive intrastate 36, 42-inch pipeline systems that deliver enormous amounts of gas all over the Carthage and all the way down into the Gulf Coast, Katy and into the ship channel markets as well as the Beaumont markets. So we're not converting any capacity on this project. It's just fully utilized capacity. It's already built sitting there idle underutilized.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein.\nJean Ann Salisbury: The Haynesville is growing rapidly and several new projects have been proposed. Can you kind of comment on if you think Haynesville will run out of capacity kind of before Gulf Run comes on? And are you close to moving forward on the expansion project to Gulf Run?\nMackie McCrea: Yes. I'll step back a little bit. Yes, our team, [indiscernible] and her folks, have been working hard on finding a solution for the growth out of the Haynesville. So we've done that in a number of ways by bringing gas in from Tiger into Carthage and moving it to our HPL and ETC network down into the Gulf Coast. We've done some significant contracts there. We're negotiating some very significant ones that provide access and flexibility where some of these producers are looking to go east to Perryville and Tiger and also come back into Texas. At the same time, there's about 1.1 Bcf of Golf Runs already sold. So we've got about 500-plus, 550 that we're looking to sell. We're aggressively tying that into our conversations for those producers that would like to reach the markets at the end of Gulf Run. And in that now, as you can imagine, we're -- and the volume growth in the Haynesville is a tremendous volume growth. We'll need to increase Gulf Run, no doubt. And we'll be looking at doing that in the near future. In addition to that, as we move more gas Eastern on both our new CP line and on the Tiger line, we will be kind of upgrading our ability to move gas through trunk line down into the Henry Hub market into some of the LNG markets on the Gulf Coast. So Haynesville, huge growth for this country for natural gas growth and huge things that we can capitalize on with the assets we have, especially now that we own the Enable assets that run through that same area.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Great. That's super helpful. And then as a follow-up, you used to have significant exposure to the Waha differential, but then I think you firmed it all up. I'm not sure for how long. How much exposure would you have to the differential in '23 '24? And it looks like it might widen again. I know you kind of mentioned you could optimize Oasis, so perhaps that could be part of it. But on the underlying Oasis, just wanted to see if you still had open capacity?\nMackie McCrea: Yes. We have -- we did have a strategy a while back of, we were very fortunate to be able to benefit from the spreads when they blew out. But during that time, we knew they'd come back in. So we did go in and carve out some of that capacity as our shippers requested and put some of those contracts in place, long-term 5, 7, 10-year contracts. But we still have several hundred thousand in excess of several hundred thousand a day of capacity across the state. And over the next year or 2, we'll have more capacity becoming available, like probably at least double that amount. So 400,000 to 500,000 in the next year or 2 will have to benefit from these wider spreads and/or benefit from those shippers that are wanting to take capacity under a 10-year deal on a new project, they may start out on Oasis for part of that time in the early years and then move them over to the bigger projects. So it just gives us kind of a significant advantage over all the competition and be able to accommodate the needs over the next year or 2 and then gives us time to build a much bigger diameter pipeline to meet the needs that we all see coming by '24, '25.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Timm Schneider with Citi.\nTimm Schneider: And actually, let me follow up on the contracting question on the new -- on the potential new Gulf Coast gas pipeline. Any appetite here to maybe do this even if you don't get the 10-year commitments right off the bat because you are going to, assuming this is the most cost-efficient project out there, going to be making a lot of money potentially on spreads. How do you think about that?\nMackie McCrea: I'm sorry, I missed the first part of that question. Say that again. I'm sorry, Timm.\nTimm Schneider: Yes. So I was just asking what the appetite was for you guys to potentially go ahead with this project even if you don't have 10-year contracts from shippers given the fact that it's probably the most cost efficient and you'd be making a lot of money on spreads as is anyways?\nMackie McCrea: Yes. As we've said, one thing we are going to do even in light of how needed this is, we're going to be very prudent on our capital. And so we're going to make decisions that make sense both short term and long term. But we do believe because of the advantages that I've talked through and that you all are aware of that we have a significant advantage to kind of get this moving very quickly. And so we do believe that whether it's 7-year contracts at higher rates or 10-year terms at a little bit lower rates. We believe we're going to achieve those. We really, at this point, don't see any like major players stepping up 600,000 a day. We do think this can be made of a whole lot of different shippers and producers. But once again, I think as we get the word out and we have the number of customers, everybody is going to see a clear advantage that this project offers is significantly better than any of the competing pipeline projects that are out there.\nTimm Schneider: Got it. And then a follow-up on the CapEx side. And Tom, I think you kind of talked about this in prepared remarks. The increase in CapEx, that is primarily going to be very short -- not very short cycle, but shorter cycle CapEx, where a lot of that is actually going to show up in 2022 EBITDA. Is that the right way to think about that?\nTom Long: Yes, that is the way to think about it. That's the real beauty of a lot of this CapEx. It is very short nature. And I'm not saying it won't be until kind of later 2022. So 2023 is probably when you'll see the full impact. But you stated it properly when you said that these are shorter build type, good returning projects.\nTimm Schneider: All right. And then maybe the last one here. What are the book \u2013 I mean, the book ends 11.8 billion to $12.2 billion on the EBITDA. What are some of the moving pieces around that?\nA \u2013Mackie McCrea: Yes. I\u2019m not sure if I understand your question completely. If you\u2019re talking \u2013 I mean some of it, Timm, is commodity prices. Commodity prices stay higher, we\u2019ll be on the higher end or they go higher than there are today. If we see commodity prices drop off, that would tend to move a little bit off of the high end. So that\u2019s one of the drivers. And then spreads kind of watch and see what happens with spreads. And we think that as we\u2019ve seen in the gas, these were down the teams not that long ago, and now we\u2019re starting to see them spread out. And as I\u2019ve mentioned a little bit earlier, as you get deeper in this year, they\u2019re going to spread out significantly. So we\u2019ve made certain assumptions on those spreads. However, we\u2019ve been very conservative along those lines. So I guess I\u2019d summarize all that with commodity prices certainly will have an impact, but also we do believe that the drilling is returning in a big way. The rigs have even moved back into Oklahoma. We were talking a little bit earlier today that the rigs pre-pandemic in the first part of 2020 are now back to I think equal, maybe a little bit more rigs in Oklahoma, which everybody is aware they moved back in, in a big way. So there\u2019s assumptions that the industry is going to continue to grow as the pandemic leave the world as demand grows for all these products. And so we\u2019re very bullish on drilling to continue. And so that plays a role into our projections as well.\nA \u2013Tom Long: And the one thing that I would add is the commodity piece of this is, as far as the exposure, we\u2019re using about 7.5% to 10%, and we\u2019re using 0% to 2.5% on the spreads. So 90% fee-based. And when you add those others together, they add up to about 10%. So that\u2019s how you can calibrate that commodity and spread component.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse.\nSpiro Dounis: First one is just on the distribution. Curious how you guys are thinking about the time frame or maybe the pace on getting back to that prior distribution of $1.22 -- sorry, $1.22 a year? It sounds like leverage may be one of the governing factors there to some degree. And the other factor you mentioned, of course, is the pace of buyback. So just curious how you're weighing all that and just how to help us think about the pace of getting back to that prior level?\nTom Long: Yes. We really are focusing on the points that you just walked through there. So if you really look at this, returning to the -- at least the $1.22 that we talked -- that we had previously, back before we had reduced the distributions, that is moved up to a top priority, but we clearly have these great projects we're talking about, likewise, these capital projects, then you blend in the debt paydown likewise. Unit buybacks, I would probably put as behind those 3.\nSpiro Dounis: Got it. That's helpful. And then, Mackie, just putting all your comments together, just around the Haynesville, clearly, more gas coming there, this new natural gas pipeline out of the Permian. You're trying to move that gas. It sounds like as far east as you possibly can. All seems to be getting to a point where maybe Henry Hub very clearly can be well supplied for a long time. So I'm sort of curious what does that do for prospects on something like Lake Charles LNG? I saw that you guys had requested an extension there for construction recently. So I don't want to tie them together too much, but just curious where that sits commercially, got I think moving more gas towards Hub is a good thing long term?\nMackie McCrea: Yes. It's a great question because, for example, one of the larger shippers that possibly could take a fairly significant amount of gas compared to the others on this project wants to get to Henry Hub and would love to be a provider of gas to our LNG projects, our Lake Charles project. So that does kind of go hand-in-hand with some of the shippers and producers we're talking to. But around LNG, we've been through cycles of excitement and emotion over the last 4 or 5 years, whether we'll ever get there. And I'd tell you, it's really pick up steam. You read it anywhere. You see what's going on around the world and China from the top of their leader, their mandate is to go out and find gas. And we're seeing that with the Chinese customers as well as other customers. Around the world, there is a big push right now, that all of a sudden natural gas is green, and everybody's realized how important it is only for the next 5 years or the next 30 years. And so it's really picked up steam. We hope to be able to announce some agreements that we are close to getting signed over the next few years. They're certainly still ways from FID but we are really excited about where that project is going. And more importantly than not of where we may end up at the end of the day, what percentage we make under that. The biggest site we have what you just alluded to, and that's all the gas that we'll feed into the system into the Henry Hub area through our multitude of pipelines, through Golf Run, through Trunkline in both directions, bringing gas across CP, across Tiger, unlike all the other projects that are along the Gulf Coast, nobody can bring gas from Marcellus, Utica, through Panhandle, I mean, Rover Panhandle Trunkline directly into this project or now from Arkoma in Oklahoma Basin all the way down or even out from Permian. So it's turning to a really good project for the markets around the world, and then it has a by far the best supply portfolio and connectivity upstream. So we do believe that the Henry Hub area is going to become a much bigger trading hub than it already is and our LNG project would just magnify that significantly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley: First, just a simple one. How many units of the company repurchased in Q4, the company itself, if any?\nTom Long: I think it was about $4 million.\nKeith Stanley: $4 million. Okay. Great. Second one, Tom, you talked about debt reduction still being a priority for this year. Can you give a sense of, I guess, how you're looking at maturities and using free cash flow? Obviously, I mean you did over $6 billion of debt repayment last year. So as you see maturities this year, are you looking to use free cash flow to repay them generally? Or are you open to refinancing some of the debt as it matures.\nTom Long: Let's turn off with, we're clearly going to keep working towards the $4 million to $4.5 million. So as these maturities come up throughout the year, I would say that we will be paying down some of those maturities with free cash flow, but we will probably refi some of those maturities as they come up throughout the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.\nColton Bean: Mackie, you mentioned seeing more drilling activity in Oklahoma. Now that you have the Enable operations in-house, can you just update us on your Mid-Con NGL strategy? And what sort of time line we should be thinking about to fully integrate those volumes into the ET value chain?\nMackie McCrea: You bet. And as I mentioned, we have the teams little bit working on this daily to try to figure out a way to best utilize all of our pipelines, our processing plants. For example, there are some plants in the Panhandle that may make sense to initially or for a short period of time to shut those down and more [Technical Difficulty].\nOperator: Please stand by. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nMackie McCrea: Can you all hear me?\nOperator: Yes, sir. Go ahead.\nMackie McCrea: Okay. So did you hear any of my answer? If not, I'll just start over -- we're not sure what happened. It just disconnected. But anyway, I'll do a shorter version. We do have teams working on this around the clock. We've already identified some opportunities to better utilize more efficiently some of our plants and some of our pipelines. Looking longer term, we are looking at converting a pipeline to potentially crude service. And then, of course, a lot of our folks is going to be utilizing existing pipelines and/or repurposing in other manners to get NGL barrels down into our Texas NGL franchise ultimately for deliveries to Mont Belvieu and of course, on the Gulf Coast into the export market. So we've got kind of a short-term vision of immediate things that we'll do to benefit the assets up in Oklahoma and then a longer-term vision of bringing us many of the NGL barrels into our system.\nColton Bean: Great. And Mackie, maybe just to clarify that last point on bringing Oklahoma barrels down. Is that thought process over the next couple of years? Or is that more of a back half of the decade when those barrels might be available to you?\nMackie McCrea: Without disclosing a whole lot, I guess, from a competitive standpoint, in the next 3 years or so, we do expect the demand to grow in our ability from a contractual standpoint to start moving more barrels from the tailgate of both plants and other plants in Oklahoma, even third-party plants into our NGL franchise for deliveries down to the Gulf Coast.\nColton Bean: Perfect. And then maybe, Tom, switching back to the capital priorities. You mentioned buybacks sliding a bit lower in the stack versus some of the alternatives -- can you remind us how you all evaluate the return potential on buybacks versus new growth projects?\nTom Long: Yes. It's based upon what you what you look at from a DCF per unit standpoint, is how we really look at that, probably not as much from a distribution yield. And as we look at where the unit price is and where that breakeven is versus the other opportunities for some of the capital projects we've talked about today. But we do look at it from a DCF per unit standpoint. A DCF yield, let's call it that.\nOperator: And that concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. All parties may now disconnect. Have a good day. Thank you.",

            "name": "Tom Long",
            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call, and thank you for joining us today. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of our senior management team, who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based on our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which we expect to be filed this Friday, February 18. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'd like to start today by looking at some of our fourth quarter and full year 2021 highlights. For the full year 2021, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $13 billion, which was a significant increase over 2020 and in line with our expectations. DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, was $8.2 billion, which resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $6.4 billion. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of approximately $5 billion after distributions of $1.8 billion and growth capital of approximately $1.4 billion. On January 25, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.175 per common unit or $0.70 on an annualized basis, which represents a 15% increase over the previous quarter and represents the first step in our plan to return additional value to unitholders. Operationally, we moved record volumes through our NGL pipelines and NGL and refined products terminals for the full year 2021, primarily driven by growth in volumes through our Nederland terminal and on our Mariner East pipeline system. In addition, NGL fractionation volumes reached a new record during the fourth quarter, largely driven by growth in volumes leading our Mont Belvieu fractionators. At our Nederland terminal, we completed expansions in early 2021 that brought our company-wide total NGL export capacity to more than 1.1 million barrels per day which we believe is the largest in the world. On December 2, 2021, we completed our acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners, which provides increased scale in the Mid-Continent and Ark-La-Tex regions and improved connectivity for our natural gas, crude oil and NGL transportation customers. The combination of Energy Transfer's and Enable's complementary assets will allow us to continue to provide flexible, reliable and competitive services for our customers as we pursue additional commercial opportunities utilizing our improved connectivity and expanded footprint. We continue to expect the combined company to generate more than $100 million of annual run rate cost savings synergies, of which we expect to achieve $75 million in 2022. In addition, we are in the process of identifying and evaluating a number of commercial and operational synergies that are expected to enhance the operational capabilities of our systems by capitalizing on improved efficiencies and increasing utilization and profitability of our combined assets. Before moving to a growth project update, I want to briefly touch on the recent winter weather conditions seen across many of our assets. This out of winter weather was less severe and significantly less disruptive than winter storm Uri last year, and commodity prices remained much more stable throughout as a result. As we always do, we have procedures in place to provide layers of protection and risk mitigation, including engineering controls and winterization processes and preplanning and prepositioning of resources to assure, we are able to respond when needed. Our extensive experience with operating pipelines, processing plants and storage facilities combined with a significant amount of preparation allows us to operate reliably throughout extreme weather conditions, and this is due to the consistent and extraordinary efforts of our employees. I'll now walk you through recent developments on our growth projects. Starting with Mariner East Pipeline system. Construction of the final phase of the Mariner East pipeline is complete and commissioning is in progress which will bring our total NGL capacity on the Mariner East pipeline system to 350,000 to 375,000 barrels per day, including ethane. Energy Transfer's Mariner East pipeline system now includes multiple pipelines across the state of Pennsylvania, connecting the prolific Marcellus and Utica shales to markets throughout the state and the broader region, including Energy Transfer's Marcus Hook terminal on the East Coast. For full year 2021, NGL volumes through the Mariner East pipeline system and Marcus Hub terminal are up nearly 10% over 2020. With our expanded network, we will see volumes continue to grow. In our Pennsylvania Access project, which allows refined products to flow from the Midwest supply regions into Pennsylvania, New York and other markets in the Northeast started flowing refined products in January. At our expanded Nederland terminal, NGL volumes continued to increase during the fourth quarter, including export volumes under our Orbit ethane export joint venture, which have remained strong. For the full year 2021, we loaded nearly 26 million barrels of ethane out of the facility. For 2022, we expect to load a minimum of 40 million barrels of ethane and project this to increase to up to 60 million barrels for 2023. We also expect our LPG export volumes at Nederland to continue to grow in 2022. And in total, our percentage of worldwide NGL exports has doubled over the last 2 years, capturing nearly 20% of the world market, which was more than any other company or country exported during the fourth quarter of 2021. At Mont Belvieu, we recently brought online a 3 million-barrel high-rate storage well, which increases our total wells to 24 and our NGL storage capabilities at Mont Belvieu to 53 million barrels. Turning to our Cushing South pipeline. In early June, we commenced service on the 65,000 barrels per day crude oil pipeline, providing transportation service from our Cushing terminal to our Nederland terminal, which also provides access for Powder River and DJ Basin barrels to our Nederland terminal via an upstream connection with our White Cliffs pipeline. This pipe is already being fully utilized. And as we mentioned on our last call, we are moving forward with Phase 2, which will nearly double the pipeline's capacity to 120,000 barrels per day. Phase 2 is expected to be in service by the end of the first quarter of 2022 and is underpinned by third-party commitments. As a reminder, minimal capital spend was required for this phase. Next, construction on the Ted Collins link is progressing and is now expected to be completed late in the first quarter of 2022. The Ted Collins link will increase market connectivity for our Houston terminal. It will also give us the ability to fully load and export WTI barrels as well as low gravity Bakken barrels out of the Houston market, demonstrating Energy Transfer's unique capability to provide a neat Bakken barrel to markets along the Gulf Coast. Our Permian Bridge project, which connects our gathering and processing assets in the Delaware Basin with our G&P assets in the Midland Basin, was placed into service in October and continues to be significantly utilized. This project allows us to move approximately 115,000 Mcf per day of rich gas out of the Midland Basin and to utilize available processing capacity more efficiently, while also providing access to additional takeaway options. In addition, an expansion is underway, which will bring the top line's total capacity to over 200,000 Mcf per day in the first quarter of 2022. And due to significantly increased producer demand, we now plan to build a new 200 MMcf per day cryogenic processing plant in the Delaware Basin. The Gray Wolf plant is supported by new commitments and growth from existing customer contracts and is expected to be in service by the end of 2022. In addition, to provide incremental revenue to our Midstream segment, once in service, the volumes from the tailgate of the plant will utilize our gas and NGL pipelines for takeaway, providing 3 revenue streams. Now in order to address the growing need for additional natural gas takeaway from the Permian Basin, we are diligently evaluating a takeaway project that would utilize existing energy transfer assets along with new build pipeline providing producers with firm capacity to the premier markets of Katy, Carthage, Gilles and Henry Hubs. This pipeline project would include the construction of a new approximately 260-mile pipeline from the Midland Basin to our existing 36-inch pipeline Southwest of Fort Worth, parallelly existing right of way. From there, it would interconnect with our existing assets with available capacity for delivery through our vast pipeline network to markets at Carthage as well as the Katy, Beaumont and the Houston Ship Channel and other markets along the Gulf Coast, including deliveries to the Gilles and Henry Hub. We view this project as an ideal solution for natural gas growth out of the Permian Basin that we can complete much more quickly than our competitors' options at significantly less cost about following an existing right of way along the majority of the route. In addition, it is aligned with our strategy of identifying and repurposing underutilized assets in order to maximize the value of our uniquely positioned existing asset base. Customer discussions are underway as we pursue this project. Given the proposed route and our ability to utilize existing assets, we believe we could complete construction of project in 2 years or less once we have reached FID. Turning to the Gulf Run Pipeline, which will be a 42-inch interstate natural gas pipeline with 1.65 Bcf per day of capacity. Gulf Run is backed by a 20-year commitment from Golden Pass LNG and will provide natural gas transportation between the Haynesville Shale and the Gulf Coast, connecting some of the most prolific natural gas-producing regions in the U.S. with the LNG export market. Pipeline construction is underway and is expected to be completed by the end of 2022. Lastly, in July of 2021, we announced the signing of a memorandum understanding with Republic of Panama to study the feasibility of jointly developing a proposed Trans-Panama Gateway Pipeline. We anticipate working closely with Panama to successfully bring this project to fruition. Panama's geographic location and favorable investment climate make this an attractive project. We continue to believe this project will create the most liquid and attractive LPG supply hub in the world and are excited about the opportunity it presents. Now for an update on our alternative energy activities. In January of 2022, we announced that we expanded our Alternative Energy Group through the hiring of a Vice President of Alternative Energy. This role is responsible for developing Alternative Energy and carbon capture projects for Energy Transfer, along with various ESG initiatives, including the development of carbon capture offset programs that are accretive to our operations. In addition to the 2 solar projects we announced in 2021, we are also continuing to explore several opportunities for solar, wind and forestry carbon credit projects on our existing acreage in the Appalachian region. We remain in discussions with other large renewable energy developers. On the carbon capture front, we continue to pursue our carbon capture project at Marcus Hook that would involve capturing CO2 from the flue gas and delivering it to the customers for use in the food and beverage industries. This project looks financially attractive based upon preliminary cost estimates and design feasibility studies. We are also pursuing several carbon projects related to our assets, including projects involving the capture of CO2 from processing and treating plants for use in enhanced oil recovery for sequestration. We continue to believe that our franchise will allow us to participate in a variety of projects involving carbon capture or other innovative uses as we continue to reduce our carbon footprint. Lastly, we published our annual corporate responsibility report to our website in December. Now let's take a closer look at our fourth quarter results. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $2.8 billion compared to $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020. DCF attributable to the partners, as adjusted, was $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter compared to $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020. For the fourth quarter, we saw higher transportation volumes across all of our segments, including record volumes in the NGL and refined products segment as well as a $60 million adjusted EBITDA contribution from the acquisition of Enable for the month of December. On January 25, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.175 per common unit or $0.70 on an annualized basis. This distribution will be paid on February 18 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on February 8. This distribution represents a 15% increase over the previous quarter and represents the first step in our plan to return additional value to unitholders while maintaining our leverage ratio target of 4 to 4.5x debt to EBITDA. Future increases to the distribution level will be evaluated quarterly with the ultimate goal of returning distributions to the previous level of $0.305 per quarter or $1.22 on an annualized basis while balancing our leverage target, growth opportunities and unit buybacks. Turning to our results by segment and starting with NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was $739 million compared to $703 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to higher transportation and terminal services margins related to increased throughput at our Nederland terminal in the fourth quarter of 2021 as well as increased fractionation in refinery services margin. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines increased to a record 1.9 million barrels per day compared to 1.4 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to increased export volumes feeding into our Nederland terminal from the initiation of service on our propane and ethane export projects, higher volumes from the Permian and Eagle Ford regions as well as increased volumes on our Mariner East pipeline system. And our fractionators also reached another record for the quarter. With average fractionated volumes of 895,000 barrels per day compared to 825,000 barrels per day for the fourth quarter of 2020. For our crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $533 million compared to $517 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to higher crude oil transportation volumes out of the Permian Basin improved volumes through our Nederland terminal and improved performance on our Bakken and Bayou Bridge pipelines as a result of recovering volumes in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the addition of the Enable assets. For Midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $547 million compared to $390 million for the fourth quarter of 2020. This was primarily due to a $147 million increase related to favorable NGL and natural gas prices. In addition, our Midstream segment also benefited from growth in the Permian, South Texas and Northeast and the acquisition of the Enable assets in December 2021. Gathered gas volumes were 14.8 million MMBtus per day compared to 12.6 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year due to higher volumes in the Permian, South Texas and Northeast regions as well as addition of the Enable assets in December of 2021. Permian Basin volumes continue to be strong and Midland volumes remain at or near record highs. As a result, we are expanding our Permian Bridge project and constructing our new Grey Wolf processing plant in the Delaware Basin. In our Interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $397 million compared to $448 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. While volumes are beginning to improve, we did experience contract expirations at the end of 2020 on Tiger and FEP. And due to very mild temperatures throughout the Midwest, we experienced lower demand on our Panhandle and Trunkline systems during the fourth quarter. However, these decreases were partially offset by increases on Rover and Tiger due to more favorable market conditions and to significant volume growth out of the Haynesville. These results also include the Enable assets in December of 2021. We have seen steady growth recently in the Interstate segment with the fourth quarter up more than 10% over the third quarter of 2021 even without the impact of Enable. For our Intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $274 million compared to $233 million in the fourth quarter of last year. This was primarily due to increased firm transportation volumes from the Permian and South Texas, the recognition of certain revenues related to winter storm Uri and an increase in retained fuel revenues due to higher natural gas prices as well as the addition of the Enable assets in December of 2021. Now turning to our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance. With expectations for continued strong performance from our existing business as well as the addition of the Enable assets, we expect our full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be $11.8 billion to $12.2 billion. And moving to our 2022 growth capital expenditures. We expect growth capital expenditures, including expenditures related to the recently acquired Enable assets to be between $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion, balanced primarily across the midstream NGL and refined products in Interstate segments. This number includes approximately $200 million of 2021 planned capital that has been deferred into 2022 as well as growth capital related to the recently acquired Enable assets, in particular, Gulf Run pipeline. In addition, this includes newly approved projects in the Permian Basin that support growing natural gas production through new gathering and processing capacity, improved efficiencies and reduced emissions. These projects include construction of a new processing plant optimization of the Oasis pipeline and modernization and debottlenecking of the existing system. The majority of these new projects are expected to provide strong returns and be completed at a 6x multiple on average. Now looking briefly at our liquidity position. As of December 31, 2021, total available liquidity under our revolving credit facility was slightly over $2 billion, and our leverage ratio was 3.07% for the credit facility. During the fourth quarter, we utilized cash from operations to reduce our outstanding debt for approximately $400 million. And for full year 2021, we reduced our long-term debt by approximately $6.3 billion. We expect to generate a significant amount of cash flow in 2022, which will be strategically allocated in a manner that best positions us to continue to improve our leverage, invest in the growth of the partnership and return value to our unitholders. As we approach our leverage target range, we have taken our first steps toward returning additional capital to our equity holders through distribution growth, which we will continue to evaluate on a quarterly basis. In addition, we have increased our growth capital spend, as I mentioned earlier on the call, with this capital focused on strong returning projects that will be in service in less than 12 months. And we expect to continue to pay down debt throughout the year with excess cash flow from operations. During the fourth quarter, we continue to see volumes recover across many of our systems, including another record quarter for volumes in our NGL and refined products segment. Looking ahead, we are excited about the opportunities in front of us. We will continue to explore and implement commercial synergies around the recently acquired Enable assets. And we continue to see growth across our NGL business segment, driven by increasing demand, both domestically and internationally.  We have entered 2022 with a much stronger balance sheet than 2021, and we'll continue to place emphasis on financial flexibility and pay down debt in 2022 while continuing to position ourselves to return value to our unitholders. Given the volume growth expected out of the Permian Basin, we have some attractive new projects underway that will address new demand, enhance the efficiency and flexibility of our existing asset base and generate attractive returns above our target threshold. We also continue to make progress on the alternative energy front, which can further enhance and effectively grow our Energy franchise. Operator, please open the line up for our first question. Okay. Yes. Jeremy, this is Tom. One, will I start first with the split of how the numbers are coming out between the various segments. And I appreciate the fact that Gulf Run is now included in this. But the largest piece of this is really earmarked toward the midstream. You heard us talk about like the new processing plant. So that's probably about 35%, 36% of the number. Then moving next, you're going to move into the interstate with the Gulf Run that I just mentioned, you're probably running about 20%, 23% or so on that piece of it. And then when you keep moving on down through the mix, the NGL and refined products are 20%, 21% with crude intrastate and other kind of bringing up the last of it. But that's the way you really kind of see it. Now kind of looking at this, remember that we did roll over a couple of hundred million from projects and in 2021. So we probably need to start with that. As far as the rest of the pieces of it, that's really how it's probably best to try to break that out. I don't really have a bridge necessarily between the $700 million to these numbers. But I would say the biggest chunk of that is coming in with the Gulf Run. Yes, Jeremy, we do. We're very excited. As we've said before, we hadn't really dug into the commercial synergies. We knew they were there. We saw some kind of easy ones. But as we've dug in, we found more. There's a number of ways where we can run plants more efficiently. There's pipelines that we're looking at, we can convert them to a different product, particularly NGL in a couple of instances. And we're also looking at combining assets and pipeline assets to move volumes out of Haynesville and into some of the markets to get gas fill -- our assets to the Gulf Coast. So still a little bit early. We'll talk much about those, certainly by our next earnings call will be knee deep and announcements and taking advantage of some of those synergies, but we're very excited with kind of a very preliminary discussions and analysis that we've been going through, but we do have teams working on that daily. Yes, that is the way to think about it. That's the real beauty of a lot of this CapEx. It is very short nature. And I'm not saying it won't be until kind of later 2022. So 2023 is probably when you'll see the full impact. But you stated it properly when you said that these are shorter build type, good returning projects. Yes. We really are focusing on the points that you just walked through there. So if you really look at this, returning to the -- at least the $1.22 that we talked -- that we had previously, back before we had reduced the distributions, that is moved up to a top priority, but we clearly have these great projects we're talking about, likewise, these capital projects, then you blend in the debt paydown likewise. Unit buybacks, I would probably put as behind those 3. I think it was about $4 million. Let's turn off with, we're clearly going to keep working towards the $4 million to $4.5 million. So as these maturities come up throughout the year, I would say that we will be paying down some of those maturities with free cash flow, but we will probably refi some of those maturities as they come up throughout the year. Yes. It's based upon what you what you look at from a DCF per unit standpoint, is how we really look at that, probably not as much from a distribution yield. And as we look at where the unit price is and where that breakeven is versus the other opportunities for some of the capital projects we've talked about today. But we do look at it from a DCF per unit standpoint. A DCF yield, let's call it that."

            "name": "Mackie McCrea",
            "content": "You bet, Michael. This is Mackie. We are so excited about this project. We haven't really spoken a lot about it. We have more capacity than anybody else now across the states. We've been accommodating volumes growth for the last year or 2. We've heard a lot of our competitors talk about a project, how needed it was, how close they were to getting a project online. And it really became important over the last number of weeks that we kick in, in a big way. And so to answer your question, the customers that we talk to are very excited. If you compare our project to anybody else, most of them have gone either from the Waha area down to [indiscernible] or now they're talking about going to Katy and the luxury of what our project will provide will be just kind of a smorgasbord of markets. And we've said in the statements by Tom earlier, but the bottom line is we will take Permian Basin molecules and deliver them to the best markets on the Gulf Coast to Katy, to ship channel, to some of the LNG markets, to Henry Hub to Gilles and the better markets in Louisiana. Some of these producers can stop or shippers can stop in Carthage. So we're extremely excited about this. We continue to do what we've been doing for a long time, and let's look at all of our assets and not only how we repurpose them possibly to make more revenue, but also how we use more efficiently and utilize them in a better way. And this project will allow that. It's probably a 200-mile less pipeline than our competitors. It will tie into 36- and 42-inch pipelines downstream, where we have a significant amount of capacity, they will need to -- say we're very excited in the customers we've spoken to are as well. In regards to Permian Express, spread, as everybody knows, have fallen off dramatically over the last couple of years. The -- as the industry does commonly, we go through the cycle of over building. And clearly, the crude side of our business is overbuilt. As we always say, though, we feel very fortunate that we have assets that reach out all the way to the wellhead and we don't stop it in Houston now or Nederland or Bayou Bridge or put barrels on the water and even deliver through our Mid-Valley system up in the Mid-Continent. So we can often more than any of our competitors, and our teams at the results have shown this quarter have done a fantastic job of keeping Permian Express full and growing them. Our volumes fall off to the pandemic. We grow significantly fourth quarter over fourth quarter that we just showed in our results. And so yes, contracts have rolled off over the last 2 or 3 years. We're not looking at locking in long-term contracts right now where the spreads are, but we'll see this production start to increase over the next 2 or 3 years, and we'll certainly capitalize on the spreads as they move out. But in the meantime, we're all for this string of services from the wellhead all the way to loading on ships or to refineries, and we're pretty excited about our true growth business through these assets. The way we're going to look at that is, of course, listen to our customers and we'll design a system that can meet those demands. But what we anticipate is kind of a minimum of combined capacity that we have today on Oasis that's available today and in the future. And with this new pipeline project, we'll have a target between 1.5 and 2 Bcf of new takeaway capacity, a couple of years after we reach FID. Okay. Yes. Look -- and we've spoken about a few of these projects. We are in the middle of the project right now where we're spending on a great deal of capital, and we're increasing the capacity on Oasis by between 40,000 and 45,000 a day. We're looking at another expansion where we can increase it by about another 20,000. So -- and we should kick that off pretty soon. Not a lot of capital, just adding compression, and we'll be able to move about 60,000 more a day. So to your question about it could move forward more quickly, we agree with that, we think if you look at some of the forward curves, you're out over $1, $1.20, I think, latter part of '22 and '23, and we're well positioned to capitalize on that. We have capacity on Oasis. We have more capacity coming available in the next couple of years on contracts that are rolling off at much lower rates than where we think the market will be. So we positioned ourselves very well. So we're kind of capitalizing in 3 different ways. One, on what we have today, wherever the spread is, we're, of course, benefiting from that. We're adding capacity where it makes sense, and I just alluded to on the 60,000 that would be adding here the next 6 or 7 months. And then once we hopefully get to FID here in the coming quarters, then we'll add additional takeaway. But there is going to be some tough time regardless of the decisions late for whoever it's going to build the next pipe, and we do believe there is going to be a blowout spreads, and we're sitting in a very good spot there because where our assets are in the available capacity we have to move Permian Basin volumes to the Gulf Coast. Mike, it's Mackie. Yes, gosh, limit. We've seen like we've gone through this exercise, I don't know, for years, and we keep adding capacity. And as we study more, we find ways to add more. So the more recent one was the one I mentioned, too, that we're already moving forward on the 40,000-plus -- 40,000, 45,000 Mcf day expansion of ad and compression, and then we're about to approve another smaller one, but a 20,000. So combined, that's about 60,000 or 65,000 of additional capacity that we'll have added by the end of the year, first part of 2023. So that's separate from this other project that we're talking about out of the Midland Basin, a much bigger project to move gas to existing assets that we own over closer to East Texas. I'll start with the end of that. Our goals on these types of projects are typically 10 years, so that's what we'll be negotiating a lot depends on the rates and what exactly the customer is looking for. So we'll be negotiable on that. But to clarify, no on this one, unlike all the others converting crude oil to gas or gas to NGLs or NGLs to diesel. This is just utilizing capacity that's underutilized today. So for example, we would be tying this project into a 36-inch pipe near Tolar, which is southwest of the Metroplex, DFW Metroplex, and that would tie into our massive intrastate 36, 42-inch pipeline systems that deliver enormous amounts of gas all over the Carthage and all the way down into the Gulf Coast, Katy and into the ship channel markets as well as the Beaumont markets. So we're not converting any capacity on this project. It's just fully utilized capacity. It's already built sitting there idle underutilized. Yes. I'll step back a little bit. Yes, our team, [indiscernible] and her folks, have been working hard on finding a solution for the growth out of the Haynesville. So we've done that in a number of ways by bringing gas in from Tiger into Carthage and moving it to our HPL and ETC network down into the Gulf Coast. We've done some significant contracts there. We're negotiating some very significant ones that provide access and flexibility where some of these producers are looking to go east to Perryville and Tiger and also come back into Texas. At the same time, there's about 1.1 Bcf of Golf Runs already sold. So we've got about 500-plus, 550 that we're looking to sell. We're aggressively tying that into our conversations for those producers that would like to reach the markets at the end of Gulf Run. And in that now, as you can imagine, we're -- and the volume growth in the Haynesville is a tremendous volume growth. We'll need to increase Gulf Run, no doubt. And we'll be looking at doing that in the near future. In addition to that, as we move more gas Eastern on both our new CP line and on the Tiger line, we will be kind of upgrading our ability to move gas through trunk line down into the Henry Hub market into some of the LNG markets on the Gulf Coast. So Haynesville, huge growth for this country for natural gas growth and huge things that we can capitalize on with the assets we have, especially now that we own the Enable assets that run through that same area. Yes. We have -- we did have a strategy a while back of, we were very fortunate to be able to benefit from the spreads when they blew out. But during that time, we knew they'd come back in. So we did go in and carve out some of that capacity as our shippers requested and put some of those contracts in place, long-term 5, 7, 10-year contracts. But we still have several hundred thousand in excess of several hundred thousand a day of capacity across the state. And over the next year or 2, we'll have more capacity becoming available, like probably at least double that amount. So 400,000 to 500,000 in the next year or 2 will have to benefit from these wider spreads and/or benefit from those shippers that are wanting to take capacity under a 10-year deal on a new project, they may start out on Oasis for part of that time in the early years and then move them over to the bigger projects. So it just gives us kind of a significant advantage over all the competition and be able to accommodate the needs over the next year or 2 and then gives us time to build a much bigger diameter pipeline to meet the needs that we all see coming by '24, '25. I'm sorry, I missed the first part of that question. Say that again. I'm sorry, Timm. Yes. As we've said, one thing we are going to do even in light of how needed this is, we're going to be very prudent on our capital. And so we're going to make decisions that make sense both short term and long term. But we do believe because of the advantages that I've talked through and that you all are aware of that we have a significant advantage to kind of get this moving very quickly. And so we do believe that whether it's 7-year contracts at higher rates or 10-year terms at a little bit lower rates. We believe we're going to achieve those. We really, at this point, don't see any like major players stepping up 600,000 a day. We do think this can be made of a whole lot of different shippers and producers. But once again, I think as we get the word out and we have the number of customers, everybody is going to see a clear advantage that this project offers is significantly better than any of the competing pipeline projects that are out there. Yes. It's a great question because, for example, one of the larger shippers that possibly could take a fairly significant amount of gas compared to the others on this project wants to get to Henry Hub and would love to be a provider of gas to our LNG projects, our Lake Charles project. So that does kind of go hand-in-hand with some of the shippers and producers we're talking to. But around LNG, we've been through cycles of excitement and emotion over the last 4 or 5 years, whether we'll ever get there. And I'd tell you, it's really pick up steam. You read it anywhere. You see what's going on around the world and China from the top of their leader, their mandate is to go out and find gas. And we're seeing that with the Chinese customers as well as other customers. Around the world, there is a big push right now, that all of a sudden natural gas is green, and everybody's realized how important it is only for the next 5 years or the next 30 years. And so it's really picked up steam. We hope to be able to announce some agreements that we are close to getting signed over the next few years. They're certainly still ways from FID but we are really excited about where that project is going. And more importantly than not of where we may end up at the end of the day, what percentage we make under that. The biggest site we have what you just alluded to, and that's all the gas that we'll feed into the system into the Henry Hub area through our multitude of pipelines, through Golf Run, through Trunkline in both directions, bringing gas across CP, across Tiger, unlike all the other projects that are along the Gulf Coast, nobody can bring gas from Marcellus, Utica, through Panhandle, I mean, Rover Panhandle Trunkline directly into this project or now from Arkoma in Oklahoma Basin all the way down or even out from Permian. So it's turning to a really good project for the markets around the world, and then it has a by far the best supply portfolio and connectivity upstream. So we do believe that the Henry Hub area is going to become a much bigger trading hub than it already is and our LNG project would just magnify that significantly. You bet. And as I mentioned, we have the teams little bit working on this daily to try to figure out a way to best utilize all of our pipelines, our processing plants. For example, there are some plants in the Panhandle that may make sense to initially or for a short period of time to shut those down and more [Technical Difficulty]. Can you all hear me? Okay. So did you hear any of my answer? If not, I'll just start over -- we're not sure what happened. It just disconnected. But anyway, I'll do a shorter version. We do have teams working on this around the clock. We've already identified some opportunities to better utilize more efficiently some of our plants and some of our pipelines. Looking longer term, we are looking at converting a pipeline to potentially crude service. And then, of course, a lot of our folks is going to be utilizing existing pipelines and/or repurposing in other manners to get NGL barrels down into our Texas NGL franchise ultimately for deliveries to Mont Belvieu and of course, on the Gulf Coast into the export market. So we've got kind of a short-term vision of immediate things that we'll do to benefit the assets up in Oklahoma and then a longer-term vision of bringing us many of the NGL barrels into our system. Without disclosing a whole lot, I guess, from a competitive standpoint, in the next 3 years or so, we do expect the demand to grow in our ability from a contractual standpoint to start moving more barrels from the tailgate of both plants and other plants in Oklahoma, even third-party plants into our NGL franchise for deliveries down to the Gulf Coast."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.  I will now turn the conference over to your host, Tom Long, Co-Chief Executive Officer for Energy Transfer. Thank you. You may begin.\nTom Long: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call, and thank you for joining us today. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based on our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, which we expect to be filed tomorrow, November 4. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, or DCF, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'd like to start today by looking at some of our third quarter highlights. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 billion and DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, of $1.3 billion. Our excess cash flow after distributions was approximately $900 million. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of approximately $540 million after distributions of $414 million and growth capital of approximately $360 million.  Operationally, our NGL transportation and fractionation and NGL refined products terminals volumes reached new records during the quarter, largely driven by growth in volumes, beating our Mont Belvieu fractionators and Nederland Terminal. As the market continues to recover, we are well positioned to benefit from increasing demand and higher margins. Switching gears to an update on the acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners, which will provide increased scale in the Mid-Continent and Ark-La-Tex regions and improved connectivity for our natural gas and NGL transportation customers.  We expect the combination of Energy Transfer\u2019s and Enable\u2019s complementary assets to allow us to provide flexible and competitive service to our customers as we pursue additional commercial opportunities utilizing our improved connectivity and increased footprint.  As a reminder, we expect the combined company to generate more than $100 million of annual run rate cost synergies, and this is before potential commercial synergies. We continue to believe that the transaction will close before the end of the year. I'll now walk you through recent developments on our growth projects, starting with our Cushing South pipeline. In early June, we commenced service to provide transportation for approximately 65,000 barrels per day of crude oil from our Cushing terminal to our Nederland terminal, providing access for Powder River and DJ Basin barrels to our Nederland terminal being an upstream connection with our White Cliffs pipeline.  This pipe is already being fully utilized. And as we mentioned on our last call, we are moving forward with Phase 2, which will increase the capacity to 120,000 barrels per day. Phase 2 is expected to be in service early in the second quarter of 2022 and is underpinned by third-party commitments. As a reminder, minimal capital spend is required for this phase. Next, construction on the Ted Collins link is progressing and is now expected to be in service late in the first quarter of 2022. The Ted Collins link will give us the ability to fully load and export unblended low-gravity Bakken and WTI barrels out of the Houston market, showcasing Energy Transfer's unique ability to provide a net Bakken barrel to markets along the Gulf Coast. Now turning to our Mariner East system. We have commissioned the next significant phase of the Mariner East project, which brings our current capacity on the Mariner East pipeline system to approximately 260,000 barrels per day.  Year-to-date, NGL volumes through the Mariner East pipeline system and Marcus Hook Terminal are up 12% over the same period in 2020. We are awaiting the issuance of a permit modification for the conversion of the final directional drill to an open cut, which will allow us to place the final segment of Mariner East into service in the first quarter of 2022. Our Pennsylvania Access project, which will allow refined products to flow from the Midwest supply regions into Pennsylvania, New York and other markets in the Northeast, will begin moving refined products this winter. Now for a brief update on our Nederland terminal. As a reminder, with the completion of the remaining expansions of our LPG facilities at Nederland, earlier this year, we are now capable of exporting more than 700,000 barrels per day of NGLs from our Nederland terminal.  And when combined with our export capabilities from our Marcus Hook Terminal as well as our Mariner West pipeline, which exports ethane to Canada, our total NGL export capacity is over 1.1 million barrels per day, which is among the largest in the world. At our expanded Nederland terminal, NGL volumes continued to increase during the third quarter, including export volumes under our Orbit ethane export joint venture, which has remained strong. Year-to-date through September, we have loaded more than 16 million barrels of ethane out of this facility. And in total, our percentage of worldwide NGL exports has doubled over the last 18 months to nearly 20%, which was more than any other company or country for the third quarter of 2021.  Looking ahead, we expect our total NGL export volumes from Nederland to continue to increase throughout next year. In addition, demand for supply to refineries remain strong, and our crude oil storage at Nederland is fully contracted. At Mont Belvieu, we recently brought on a 3 million-barrel high-rate storage well, which takes our NGL storage capabilities at Mont Belvieu to 53 million barrels. And our Permian Bridge project, which connects our gathering and processing assets in the Delaware Basin with our G&P assets in the Midland Basin was placed into service in October and is already being significantly utilized.  This project allows us to move approximately 115,000 Mcf per day of rich gas out of the Midland Basin and to operate existing capacity more efficiently while also providing access to additional takeaway options. In addition, it can easily be expanded to 200,000 Mcf per day when needed. Lastly, in July, we announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the Republic of Panama to study the feasibility of jointly developing a proposed Trans-Panama Gateway Pipeline. We believe this project would create the most liquid and attractive LPG supply hub in the world and are excited about the opportunity it presents. Now for an update on our alternative energy activities, where we have continued to make progress on a number of fronts. In September, we entered into a 15-year power purchase agreement with SB Energy for 120 megawatts of solar power from its Eiffel solar project in Northeast Texas. This is the second solar project we are participating in and these agreements provide a good fixed price per megawatt hour on a generated basis. So we only pay for power actually generated and delivered to us. We're also continuing to explore several opportunities for solar, wind and forestry carbon credit projects on our existing acreage in the Appalachian region. In particular, we're continuing to jointly pursue solar and wind development on the Energy Transfer track in Kentucky with a large utility company, and we are in discussions with other large renewable energy developers. On the carbon capture front, our Marcus Hook project looks financially attractive based upon preliminary cost estimates and design feasibility studies. This project would involve capturing CO2 from the flue gas and delivering it to customers for industrial applications and is used in food and beverage industries.  We're also pursuing several carbon projects related to our assets, including projects involving the capture of CO2 from processing plants for use in enhanced oil recovery or sequestration. We continue to believe that our franchise will allow us to participate in a variety of projects involving carbon capture or other innovative uses as we continue to reduce our carbon footprint. Lastly, we expect to publish our annual corporate responsibility report for our website shortly. Now let's take a closer look at our third quarter results. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $2.6 billion compared to $2.9 billion for the third quarter of 2020. DCF attributable to the partners as adjusted was $1.31 billion for the third quarter compared to $1.69 billion for the third quarter of 2020. While we saw higher volumes across the majority of our segments, including record volumes in the NGL and refined products segment, these benefits do not offset the significant optimization gains in the third quarter of 2020 related to our various optimization groups as well as the onetime $103 million gain in our Midstream segment. In addition, the third quarter of 2021 included higher utilities and other Winter Storm Uri related expenses. On October 26, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.1525 per common unit or $0.61 on an annualized basis. This distribution will be paid on November 19 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on November 5. Turning to our results by segment, and we'll start with the NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was $706 million compared to $762 million for the same period last year. Higher terminal services and transportation margins related to the increased throughput on our Nederland and Mariner East pipelines in the third quarter of 2021 were offset by a $55 million decrease in our optimization businesses at Mont Belvieu and in the Northeast as well as increased OpEx and G&A. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines increased to a record 1.8 million barrels per day compared to 1.5 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to increased export volumes feeding into our Nederland terminal from the initiation of service on our propane and ethane export projects, higher volumes from the Eagle Ford region as well as increased volumes on our Mariner East and Mariner West pipeline systems.  And our fractionators also reached a new record for the quarter with an average fractionated volumes of 884,000 barrels per day compared to 877,000 barrels per day for the third quarter of 2020. Throughout 2021, we have continued to add volumes to our system and are well positioned to capture additional volumes and capitalize on new opportunities as demand improves. For our crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $496 million compared to $631 million for the same period last year. The improved performance on our Bakken and Bayou Bridge pipelines as a result of recovering volumes in the third quarter of 2021 did not offset approximately $100 million of onetime items in the third quarter of 2020. In addition, we had approximately $20 million in other optimization reductions as well as increased OpEx and G&A expense year-over-year. For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $556 million compared to $530 million for the third quarter of 2020. This was largely the result of a $156 million increase related to favorable NGL and natural gas prices as well as volume growth in the Permian and the ramp-up of recently completed assets in the Northeast, which were partially offset by a decrease of $103 million due to the restructuring and assignment of certain contracts in the Ark-La-Tex region in the third quarter of 2020.  Gathered gas volumes were 13 million MMBtus per day compared to 12.9 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year due to higher volumes in the Permian, Ark-La-Tex and South Texas regions. Permian Basin volumes continue to be strong and Midland Inlet volumes remained at or near record highs. As a result, we are already utilizing our Permian Bridge project to enhance the efficiency of our processing in the area by moving some volumes over to our Delaware Basin processing plants. In our Interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $334 million compared to $425 million for the third quarter of 2020 primarily due to contract expirations at the end of 2020 on Tiger and FEP as well as a shipper bankruptcy on Tiger and lower demand on Panhandle and Trunkline partially offset by an increase in transported volumes on Rover due to more favorable market conditions. And for our intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $172 million compared to $203 million in the third quarter of last year. This was primarily due to lower optimization volumes as a result of third-party customers shifting to long-term contracts from the Permian to the Gulf Coast and lower spreads as well as an increase in operating expenses, which were largely offset by increased transportation volumes out of the Permian and an increase in retained fuel revenues and storage margin. While it impacted us over the comparison period, the additional long-term contracting of third-party customers from the Permian to the Gulf Coast is expected to benefit us going forward as the Waha to Katy basis differential has tightened significantly.  To reduce volatility within our earnings and protect us from falling basis differentials like we saw from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, we have strategically taken steps to lock in additional volumes under fee-based long-term contracts, which are exceeding current differentials. Now turning to our 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance. Our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA remains $12.9 billion to $13.3 billion. As a reminder, this range excludes any contributions from the announced Enable acquisition. And moving to a growth capital update, for the 9 months ended September 30, 2021, Energy Transfer spent $1.08 billion on organic growth projects, primarily in the NGL refined products segment, excluding SUN and USA compression CapEx.  For full year 2021, we continue to expect growth capital expenditures to be approximately $1.6 billion, primarily in the NGL refined product, midstream and crude oil segment. After 2022 and 2023, we continue to expect to spend approximately $500 million to $700 million per year. Now looking briefly at our liquidity position. As of September 30, 2021, total available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities was approximately $5.4 billion, and our leverage ratio was 3.15x for the credit facility.  During the third quarter, we utilized cash from operations to reduce our outstanding debt by approximately $800 million. And year-to-date, we have reduced our long-term debt by approximately $6 billion. We have done a lot of heavy lifting over the last few years as we work to accelerate our debt reduction, improve our leverage and best position ourselves to return value to our unitholders. We expect to generate a significant amount of cash flow in 2022, and paying down debt continues to be our top priority.  Additionally, our strong performance in 2021 opens the door for the potential to begin returning value to our unitholders in the form of distribution increases and/or buybacks beginning next year. During the third quarter, we continue to see volumes recover across several of our systems as well as improve fundamentals. In addition, our Nederland and Mariner East expansion projects drove record volumes in our NGL and refined products segment, and we expect total NGL exports to grow throughout 2022.  Overall, our assets continued to generate strong cash flow, which allowed us to internally fund our growth projects and further reduce debt in the third quarter. We remain committed to maintaining and improving our investment grade rating and continue to place a significant amount of emphasis on capital discipline, deleveraging and maintaining financial flexibility. We continue to be excited about the acquisition of Enable, and we believe we will be able to use our enhanced footprint to improve efficiencies and pursue new commercial opportunities.  How we participate in the evolving energy world is a key focus, and we continue to make progress on a number of our alternative energy projects, which we can enhance and effectively grow our energy franchise with preliminary cost estimates looking favorable.  Operator, please open the line up for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.\nShneur Gershuni : Tom, maybe we can start off with the quarterly results and how we should think about them with respect to the unchanged guidance. We saw some higher volumes but we also saw some lower margins. For example, in the NGL transportation segment, costs are up, but you had sort of intimated that costs were going to be up earlier this year. Just wondering if this quarter's results was kind of how you thought it was going to play out as guidance was originally constructed and whether we should be thinking that towards the midpoint or towards the lower end. Is there some seasonality that we should be thinking about with all the contract restructuring that's occurring? I'm just wondering if you can sort of give us some color about the shape and how we should be thinking about this specific quarter, just given some of the margin compression that we've seen.\nMackie McCrea: Yes. Good afternoon, Shneur. As we obviously started the year, we had the initial guidance we gave and then we had, obviously, a very, very strong first quarter. So as we look out over the year, I think it\u2019s the first part of your question there about what we were expecting, this is pretty much in line. I will say that it was probably a little bit higher optimization activities that we were anticipating in some of the segments, NGL and refined products. Crude oil would probably be another one.  So this is really playing out maybe a little bit softer than what we were anticipating, but we still feel good about the guidance that we provided. And I think the last part of your question as to where we would anticipate coming in. I think in fairness, it\u2019d probably be coming in at the lower end of that range. Is probably where we see it right now. But once again, we have a lot of good positive volumes moving through, and with the continued optimization opportunities, we do feel very, very good about the year.\nShneur Gershuni : Great. And maybe as a follow-up question, on Slide 6, you maintained the $500 million to $700 million a year in growth capital for both 2022 and 2023, and that seems to be unchanged. You\u2019ve made progress paying down debt during the quarter and so forth. You talked about return of capital along the lines of distribution increases, buybacks and so forth. Is there a new leverage target that we need to be thinking about? Is it still to get below 4.5 before we can some sort of a pivot? Just kind of wondering what your latest thoughts are on that side.\nMackie McCrea: We would -- our target is still that 4 to 4.5 range. But Shneur, like I stated in the past, we do always look out at the forecast. So when we make these decisions, we're not just looking at any one specific point in time. We're looking at our projections and where we see the leverage going. So it's something that's more of an outlook. So there's not a bright line, if you will. So that's the reason we felt comfortable saying that we look at returning some to our -- returning capital to our unitholders even in the form of distributions or unit CapEx. Yes, I said beginning next year. I want to be sure I add that into the answer.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.\nChase Mulvehill : I guess first question around kind of the ethane markets. And specifically, we've got -- for ethane demand, we've got about 280,000 barrels a day of cracker capacity that's set to come online over the next 1.5 years or so. So that's going to be a sizable pull on ethane volumes here in the U.S. So I guess maybe if you could kind of talk to how you think -- or kind of where those volumes, those ethane volumes come from, do you think it's kind of more underlying NGL growth? Or do you think it's more so less ethane rejection? Or do you think there's any risk that you actually export less ethane volumes as these crackers come online?\nMackie McCrea: Chase, this is Mackie. Yes, I\u2019ll tell you what a great question. We love these types of questions because Energy Transfer has positioned itself to really be the leader in not only ethane but all NGLs. As you know, we were the first export of ethane into Canada, and then we\u2019ve grown our export business ethane in Marcus Hook and out of Nederland.  We also are unique in that we control the vast majority of the ethane that we receive at the tailgate of our frac. So unlike some of our peers, we actually control an enormous amount of ethane that, indeed, the world is searching for. And we have -- with RB and his team, we have continuous conversations with companies all over the world. South America, Asia, Europe, China. We expect that business to grow. As you know, we brought on a satellite this year, and they\u2019ll be bringing their second frac on next year. So we\u2019ll be ramping those volumes up. We already have approval for a 70,000 and 140,000 barrel a day expansion at Marcus Hook, and we\u2019re just looking and negotiating with customers to get to FID on those projects. So ethane and propane have such bright futures, and we are very pleased to be situated where we are to participate in those markets.\nChase Mulvehill : Okay. Perfect. Unrelated follow-up, but I kind of have to ask on Biden\u2019s kind of build back better plan. How do you think this is going to influence ET\u2019s strategy over the medium to longer term?\nMackie McCrea: Gosh, this is Mackie. I\u2019ll start. I want to follow up. I had to answer that. We don\u2019t really -- whatever comes out of those plans and out of all that legislation, we\u2019ll deal with that when that comes out and once it gets budgeted on. But we\u2019re keeping our heads down. We\u2019re in the fossil fuel business. We play an integral part in producing, transporting, fracking and exporting and also selling to the domestic markets the enormous amounts of energy that make the living standards as we have them here and around the world. And we are excited about our industry. We see a long future in this industry. We see a significantly growing demand for natural gas and especially for propane and ethane, for ethylene and propylene and other very critical products that are -- play such a big role in everyday life. So we don\u2019t really -- we try -- of course, we pay attention to politics. Of course, we pay attention to any tax impacts it may have on our partnership but we don\u2019t really get all worried and caught up in that. We\u2019ll deal with it when it comes out. But in the meantime, we\u2019re just trying to generate revenues for our unitholders.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jean Salisbury with Bernstein.\nJean Salisbury : Could you kind of talk about why mainly optimization has lagged your estimates? And is there like a minimum that optimization could be? And are we near that here?\nMackie McCrea: This is Mackie again. Yes, as Tom was referring to, optimization opportunities, especially material ones like we saw in 2020, you can't predict those. You can't predict a pandemic. You can't predict oil going to a negative zero and you can't predict it bouncing back up in a relatively small period of time to the mid-40s or $50 a barrel.  So the fortunate thing about our assets, both our crude assets, our NGL assets and our natural gas assets is we have a tremendous amount of storage. So it does give us the ability to put products into storage and hedge them out, say, for example, this winter. And then if we have any type of winter events or any type of pricing volatility events, we are able to really benefit from pulling our products out at much higher margins than we expected. So it's hard to predict. We certainly position ourselves to take advantage of any of that volatility in the market. like we saw this past February, but we certainly don't project that into our budget or into our outlook in the coming years.\nJean Salisbury : Okay. I mean, is it fair to say, I guess, that since there has been kind of less volatility in the market than you had kind of projected at the beginning of the year?\nMackie McCrea: Yes. Yes, we don\u2019t -- I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t totally follow the question, but we were well situated to benefit not only our revenues but also the customers and the people of Texas and Uri. But -- as I mentioned, we\u2019re also set up this year. If there\u2019s any types of cold falls or any type of significant volatility in pricing. We\u2019re well positioned to be able to provide what will be necessary for customers in this state and throughout the country.\nJean Salisbury: Okay. That makes sense. And then -- and you mentioned that the next satellite cracker comes on next -- sometime next year. Do you have a sense of when in the year that will start? And do you get -- do you start getting paid basically when those shipments start?\nMackie McCrea: Yes, the second question, I believe the latest we heard was the third quarter of next year. I can\u2019t say that with absolute certainty. That\u2019s the last thing we heard. I meant to check on that before this call, and I have not heard an update. So I believe that\u2019s it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley : One small one, just a follow-up on the quarter. So you\u2019ve talked to, I guess, the optimization headwinds. There\u2019s also a driver side of unfavorable crude inventory valuation adjustments. Was that a big driver for the crude segment? And I guess also was the Bakken pipeline expansion fully in the crude segment results for Q3?\nMackie McCrea: Let's start with the inventory gains. This quarter, you saw about $33 million. And some of that is because of the absolute lower inventory balance that we're keeping also versus $67 million in the quarter, the quarter last year, both those being gains, but you can see that's where the -- that's really kind of where the spread is there. I think as far as the second part of it, yes. The Bakken pipeline was in there.\nKeith Stanley : Okay.\nMackie McCrea: And I might add in there still ramping up. Is that -- was that your question, Keith, just to make sure on that, were you talking about the expansion?\nKeith Stanley : Yes. That\u2019s right. Okay. So that\u2019s still ramping into Q4, I guess.\nMackie McCrea: Yes. I'll give a little clarity. This is Mackie. We brought that on in August. And when we brought that project on the optimization to increase the capacity, the demand charges kicked in on that. So the volumes will be what the volumes will be, and the drilling needs to pick up in the Bakken to really see those volumes grow. But the bottom line is we are receiving demand charges for the incremental capacity we've created for a significant portion of it.\nKeith Stanley : Got it. Separate question just on capital allocation. So Tom, you said debt repayment is still a priority for the company. I guess you have about $1 billion plus of maturities coming up in the first quarter. Should we assume that's kind of consistent with what you've been doing in 2021 that you would repay that with your free cash flow as well? And then on the distribution, I'm just curious when you talk about looking at distribution increases next year, is it -- do you view it -- I mean you cut the distribution last year to basically put cash to the balance sheet not because you couldn't pay it. So how would you look at it when you get into next year? Is the goal to kind of get back to where you were? Do you factor in where the yield is? Just trying to get a sense of how you would look at the distribution once you're comfortable with where the balance sheet is.\nTom Long: All right. Keith, let's start off with the first part of your question on the debt. You probably saw we had $1.9 billion already. And on November 1, we have $1 billion of that. And on December 1, we'll pay off the other $900 million. So we're going to continue as these maturities -- as these maturities come forward, we will continue to pay them down. If some opportunity comes along that maybe you want to term some out, I'm not going to take that completely off the table. But right now, we are continuing to pay down these maturities and even call some early as they come up. I think the second part of your question, that's -- those are discussions that we continue to have with the Board. I wouldn't say that there's any more definitive I can tell you at this time other than both the buybacks and the distributions are very much front and center as we look at them. But I want to make sure the first part of your statement that maintaining financial flexibility is definitely a top priority.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet : Just wanted to start off, I guess, at a higher level, if you could provide any color as far as what you're seeing on producer activity. Especially as you're heading into '22 year ahead, we've seen kind of bifurcation with the private getting after and the public being more disciplined. Do you expect those trends to continue? Or do you see anything changing there? And how much does this value across base?\nMackie McCrea: Jeremy, this is Mackie. You said it well, and that\u2019s kind of what we saw this year. It\u2019s what we are seeing going in next year. The majors are just much more cautious. They\u2019re watching capital much more closer than a lot of the independents. So at least around a lot of our assets, we are seeing more activity and more production coming on with the smaller companies, the smaller independents. However, some of these majors, especially out in the Permian Basin in the Northern Louisiana area and even in the Marcellus Utica, we are seeing rigs come back in, as everybody knows. I think rigs in North Louisiana are up about 45% from where they were a year ago -- a little over a year ago, and we\u2019re seeing a similar type growth out in the Permian. There\u2019s still a lot of DUCs out in the Permian that have not been completed. A number of them have been but we are seeing a lot of those now being completed as we go into 2022.  So I think we would describe it, at least around our system, is just consistent growth not just a hard ramp in the first or second quarter but just consistent growth throughout the year, both in rigs and in volume growth out in the Permian. We do expect faster growth on the more leaner gas in Northern Louisiana. And we see kind of similar gradual growth in the Eagle Ford down South Texas on our assets down there.\nJeremy Tonet : And just want to pick up on some of your comments before. And certainly, hydrocarbons are important to improving the standard of global living here. But looking at Slide 7, you talk about the alternative energy group here. And I just want to see which specific opportunities are you guys kind of focused on right now? Do you see opportunities in black carbon or using right of ways for electric transmission? And I know everything coming out of D.C. is clear as mud. But if we get things like higher 45 Qs or renewables, including qualified income, what could this mean for you guys?\nMackie McCrea: Yes. Tom Mason in his group, of course, are today following that and we're looking for what comes out of Congress with the 45Q and other tax benefits around renewables. As we've said before, our focus is really on the missions to our assets, in other words around our processing plants, our treating facilities. We're looking to capture carbon, whether we do it, partner up with somebody or allow somebody else to capture that.  We are also looking at some -- catching some carbon off some of our facilities up in the Northeast. We have our Marcus Hook facility. We're looking to capture some gas. We've done some preliminary studies. They actually look very promising at some rates of return that makes sense, and so we will continue to pursue those. And we're also looking at some carbon capture down in South Texas that will either be sequestered or part of an ERR project. So we are proceeding. We're doing that on a daily basis. Tom and his team are looking at deals all across the board, whether it's black carbon or whether it's taking natural gas and converting it to a gasoline or whether it's renewable diesel and transporting that through our diesel pipeline system, we're looking at all of that, and we'll continue to participate in that as we have around the solar business, where we are not invested in that from a capital perspective but we're certainly investing in our commitment to purchase what we see as very inexpensive power. So we are supporting renewables in that way or that manner. But we'll continue to pursue those that make sense, and we do expect to consummate some of those in the distant future not necessarily a tremendous amount of capital, but we do see several projects that may involve up to $20 million or $30 million of capital around CO2 sequestration. So that is going to remain a focus of ours as we go into '22 and beyond.\nOperator: Our next question is from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.\nColton Bean : So maybe just circling back to the comments on the interstate segment. It looks like the transportation margin on a per unit basis fell quite a bit relative to the first half of the year. So I just wanted to clarify, it sounded like that was primarily attributable to shorter term. I\u2019m sorry.\nMackie McCrea: Intrastate?\nColton Bean : Intra, the Texas, Texas pipes. Yes. It looks like the transportation margin on a per unit basis fell a decent bit relative to what we saw in first half. And I think, Tom, you might have spoken to this, but just wanted to clarify. It sounded like that was primarily attributable to higher rate short-term contracts that maybe Whistler changed the dynamic there. Just wanted to understand what was kind of going on between first half of the year and Q3?\nMackie McCrea: You bet. This is Mackie again. So prior to the last 3, 42 inches that have come on in the last couple of years, -- we -- that was kind of our bread and butter. It\u2019s moving gas across the state. We saw spreads of $1.50, $2. And those, of course, started to come in. So we started a strategy about a couple of years ago to look to secure longer-term commitment at not $1, $1.50 spreads but a good healthy spread, and that\u2019s what we began doing.  So when you look at the third quarter, the spreads were up as much as $0.75 or $0.80 on average for that quarter. We did secure during prior -- I mean, I\u2019m sorry, last year that impacted third quarter of this year at lower than that $0.75 or $0.80 but much higher than where the spreads are today. It\u2019s a strategy that made sense to us to. Where we could see the spreads coming in at least in the short term, we think this will be short-lived. In 2 to 3 years, we believe the basis will blow back out. There will be more need. Look at the growth in the Permian Basin and natural gas is just incredible. But in the meantime, we did want to secure some of our capacity at healthy margins for longer-term contracts.\nColton Bean : Got it. And with this kind of even the last of the greenfields to your point, is this a safe run rate look at ahead of just kind of looking at where the basis goes from here?\nMackie McCrea: Yes. I'll answer it like this, that we've seen spreads fall to $0.25 -- $0.20, $0.25, $0.30 here as of recent. We do believe, and I believe the industry believes that over the next 1.5 years to 2 years that, that will start moving back out. We may see $0.75 or $1. We have some of our competitors out there talking about building in maybe another 42-inch. What we're trying to tell the marketplace and the producers and shippers before they commit another project, we'll have capacity. We have capacity coming available in 2 or 3 years from now. And we'd love to lock it in for prices similar to what they would pay on new build on greenfield projects.  So we are very well positioned to kind of weather the storm here as all the -- these 42 inches have been completed as the gas begins to grow and fill them up. And once they all become full, we're very well positioned to capture bigger spreads on capacity we'll have on our gas system.\nColton Bean : Got it. And maybe just a little bit more of a niche topic here. The legacy PBR assets, do you all still have any exposure there in terms of what we\u2019re seeing on price hikes in the coal market right now? Or alternatively, is this a more attractive seller\u2019s market where you might look to divest some of those legacy assets?\nTom Long: No, I wouldn\u2019t say that there would be any opportunity for spike there. As you know, that\u2019s a very small -- very, very small piece that sits up there. It\u2019s a royalty business. So I wouldn\u2019t guide you toward anything there. As far as divestiture, there\u2019s no plans, no dialogue going on, on that front.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum : I wanted to ask about Rover. You highlighted a $13 million increase in revenue. Just wanted to hear what the dynamics are on Rover right now. How much of that is contracted? And I guess given that the basin is pretty tight on takeaway, is there an ability to sign up more producers at higher rates?\nMackie McCrea: Yes. Michael, this is Mackie. What a great project. That\u2019s really turned out well for us. We saw -- for example, we saw a hiccup on Petco\u2019s pipeline here a couple of months ago, and we saw the value of that pipeline increase even more so with the difficulty that we see in the -- at least the near term, over the next 2, 3, 4, 5 years, how difficult it will be to get another interstate pipeline approved out of that area. So we\u2019re so well positioned.  We do have probably approximately over 90% of it under long-term contracts on a month-to-month basis. Many times, we\u2019re selling capacity at tariff rates depending on the month, depending on whether they\u2019re going to down or going south to Zone 1a. So it\u2019s such an excellently strategically located asset. As we see volumes grow at the Marcellus Utica, it\u2019s kind of unique in the sense that it can move barrels up to the north into Canada. And as you know, it can move barrels all the way down to Gulf Coast to provide supplies for LNG facilities as well other markets on the Gulf Coast. So we\u2019re -- we consistently move about 3.2 to 3.4. We can move as much as 3.55, I believe it is. And so we\u2019ll continue to see that kind of grow both in filling up to the max and also at max tariff rates as the future -- as we go into the future.\nMichael Blum : Got it. And then just a quick follow-up for me. So your CapEx for \u201822 and \u201823 of that $500 million to $700 million per year range, I\u2019m assuming that does not include any potential spending on these initiatives you have going on in Panama. So I guess the question is if this MOU becomes an FID project in Panama, how does that change those numbers?\nMackie McCrea: It would certainly add to those numbers, but getting that project to FID, it's down the road. We're probably talking at least 12 months of getting that to FID. So we wouldn't see any material spending until probably '23.\nOperator: Our next question is from Pearce Hammond with Piper Sandler.\nPearce Hammond : I just had one question today. Mackie, as you look out over the next few years at NGL supply demand, when do you see a need for more fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu?\nMackie McCrea: Well, what a great question, and we are positioned to capitalize on that when we find the answer to that question. We\u2019re being very capital disciplined, so we have not completed our 8 frac, but we\u2019re certainly watching it very closely, both for volumes that are committed to our plants and also volumes committed to third-party plants.  So just from -- looking from our eyes intra transfer eyes, we don\u2019t see the need for one for at least the next 6 to 9 months, but we evaluate on a quarterly basis. And we do expect that at some point in 2022, we\u2019ll have to take a serious look at completing that 8 frac. We do expect the volumes to begin growing as long as commodity prices continue to stay where they are now. It sure looks like they will.\nOperator: Our next question is from Christine Cho with Barclays.\nChristine Cho : I just wanted to -- how should we think about costs going up in \u201822 on the O&M and G&A side? And then do your inflation trackers have any caps to them? And to the extent that it tracks something like a CPI or PPI, should we think that -- should we assume the entire increase will be reflected in rates next year? Or would competitive pressures limit some of that -- the increase that you would actually put through?\nMackie McCrea: I can start on the second half of that, which maybe most of it. Yes, in most of our contracts, certainly, in all of our liquid contracts around our transportation and fractionation and around our crude contracts, we have an index. It's typically a FERC index. But to give you an example, I believe the FERC index this year, I believe that started in July and it goes July to the next July, was negative. So we actually didn't have any kind of uptick in that from -- while we see this inflation.  However, what that sets up for is next July we expect that to move up significantly. We've heard as much as 5% or 6%, and we do have those increases in the vast majority of our rig contracts as well as in many, if not most, of our gas contracts. So we do have, whether it's the CPI index in our gas contract or the FERC index and our liquid contracts, we do have that in the majority of those, and we'll benefit from -- or at least not be harmed by the inflationary growth in costs.\nChristine Cho : And we should expect that you would put the entire increase through? Like the competitive pressures wouldn't preclude you from just doing a part of it?\nMackie McCrea: It may on future contracts. But when I\u2019m referring to all the existing contracts we have today to move products to our systems already have that language in it.\nChristine Cho : And then on the NGL segment, just curious, one of your peers had talked about doing incentive rates in the Permian. Curious if you guys did the same thing or if the segment was really just all optimization headwinds.\nMackie McCrea: Yes. I'm not sure what an incentive rate is, what -- the rate we will do is the highest rate we can possibly get from our shippers from what the market will allow.\nChristine Cho : Well, I guess, would you say they trended lower quarter-over-quarter?\nMackie McCrea: I\u2019m sorry. So if you\u2019re saying -- where the marketplace is, yes. The -- just like crude, just like natural gas for lease for a short period of time, NGL cross all has been overbuilt. Fortunately, much of the barrels that are -- that come to our system and that will come to our system in the future are already dedicated. But those barrels that are out there to tailgate of third-party facilities that we go out and try to get on a monthly basis, it\u2019s gotten very competitive. The T&F prices are significantly lower than where they were years ago.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides : Look, we're 8 or 9 months removed from Winter Storm Uri. Can you give a little insight on what you're seeing in the contracting market for gas storage, especially in Texas, whether you're already entering significant new contracts and kind of taking a little bit of the -- maybe the margin upside but also the margin downside of spreads move around but getting more of a fixed fee payment and just kind of how the market for gas storage overall is moving after that event?\nMackie McCrea: You bet, this is Mackie again. Yes, it' kind of a variety. We effected a lot more demand or a lot more desperate, I'd say, demand to come secure storage. We certainly have sold more storage than we did last year at much more favorable rates and also some swing rights to that. We are still in negotiations with a number of parties and power plants for swing service and storage service for this winter. But some of the companies had panicked or haven't -- don't seem as worried about it as we thought they would after what happened at Uri. But once again, we're well positioned whether or not we've already done as we have some new deals or we're positioned to be able to provide that service as they need it this winter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Now I would like to turn the call back to Tom Long for closing remarks.\nTom Long: Thank you all once again for joining us today and for your support, and we look forward to talking to you in the near future.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. Energy Transfer, thanks you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Long",
            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call, and thank you for joining us today. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based on our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, which we expect to be filed tomorrow, November 4. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, or DCF, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'd like to start today by looking at some of our third quarter highlights. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 billion and DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, of $1.3 billion. Our excess cash flow after distributions was approximately $900 million. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of approximately $540 million after distributions of $414 million and growth capital of approximately $360 million.  Operationally, our NGL transportation and fractionation and NGL refined products terminals volumes reached new records during the quarter, largely driven by growth in volumes, beating our Mont Belvieu fractionators and Nederland Terminal. As the market continues to recover, we are well positioned to benefit from increasing demand and higher margins. Switching gears to an update on the acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners, which will provide increased scale in the Mid-Continent and Ark-La-Tex regions and improved connectivity for our natural gas and NGL transportation customers.  We expect the combination of Energy Transfer's and Enable's complementary assets to allow us to provide flexible and competitive service to our customers as we pursue additional commercial opportunities utilizing our improved connectivity and increased footprint.  As a reminder, we expect the combined company to generate more than $100 million of annual run rate cost synergies, and this is before potential commercial synergies. We continue to believe that the transaction will close before the end of the year. I'll now walk you through recent developments on our growth projects, starting with our Cushing South pipeline. In early June, we commenced service to provide transportation for approximately 65,000 barrels per day of crude oil from our Cushing terminal to our Nederland terminal, providing access for Powder River and DJ Basin barrels to our Nederland terminal being an upstream connection with our White Cliffs pipeline.  This pipe is already being fully utilized. And as we mentioned on our last call, we are moving forward with Phase 2, which will increase the capacity to 120,000 barrels per day. Phase 2 is expected to be in service early in the second quarter of 2022 and is underpinned by third-party commitments. As a reminder, minimal capital spend is required for this phase. Next, construction on the Ted Collins link is progressing and is now expected to be in service late in the first quarter of 2022. The Ted Collins link will give us the ability to fully load and export unblended low-gravity Bakken and WTI barrels out of the Houston market, showcasing Energy Transfer's unique ability to provide a net Bakken barrel to markets along the Gulf Coast. Now turning to our Mariner East system. We have commissioned the next significant phase of the Mariner East project, which brings our current capacity on the Mariner East pipeline system to approximately 260,000 barrels per day.  Year-to-date, NGL volumes through the Mariner East pipeline system and Marcus Hook Terminal are up 12% over the same period in 2020. We are awaiting the issuance of a permit modification for the conversion of the final directional drill to an open cut, which will allow us to place the final segment of Mariner East into service in the first quarter of 2022. Our Pennsylvania Access project, which will allow refined products to flow from the Midwest supply regions into Pennsylvania, New York and other markets in the Northeast, will begin moving refined products this winter. Now for a brief update on our Nederland terminal. As a reminder, with the completion of the remaining expansions of our LPG facilities at Nederland, earlier this year, we are now capable of exporting more than 700,000 barrels per day of NGLs from our Nederland terminal.  And when combined with our export capabilities from our Marcus Hook Terminal as well as our Mariner West pipeline, which exports ethane to Canada, our total NGL export capacity is over 1.1 million barrels per day, which is among the largest in the world. At our expanded Nederland terminal, NGL volumes continued to increase during the third quarter, including export volumes under our Orbit ethane export joint venture, which has remained strong. Year-to-date through September, we have loaded more than 16 million barrels of ethane out of this facility. And in total, our percentage of worldwide NGL exports has doubled over the last 18 months to nearly 20%, which was more than any other company or country for the third quarter of 2021.  Looking ahead, we expect our total NGL export volumes from Nederland to continue to increase throughout next year. In addition, demand for supply to refineries remain strong, and our crude oil storage at Nederland is fully contracted. At Mont Belvieu, we recently brought on a 3 million-barrel high-rate storage well, which takes our NGL storage capabilities at Mont Belvieu to 53 million barrels. And our Permian Bridge project, which connects our gathering and processing assets in the Delaware Basin with our G&P assets in the Midland Basin was placed into service in October and is already being significantly utilized.  This project allows us to move approximately 115,000 Mcf per day of rich gas out of the Midland Basin and to operate existing capacity more efficiently while also providing access to additional takeaway options. In addition, it can easily be expanded to 200,000 Mcf per day when needed. Lastly, in July, we announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the Republic of Panama to study the feasibility of jointly developing a proposed Trans-Panama Gateway Pipeline. We believe this project would create the most liquid and attractive LPG supply hub in the world and are excited about the opportunity it presents. Now for an update on our alternative energy activities, where we have continued to make progress on a number of fronts. In September, we entered into a 15-year power purchase agreement with SB Energy for 120 megawatts of solar power from its Eiffel solar project in Northeast Texas. This is the second solar project we are participating in and these agreements provide a good fixed price per megawatt hour on a generated basis. So we only pay for power actually generated and delivered to us. We're also continuing to explore several opportunities for solar, wind and forestry carbon credit projects on our existing acreage in the Appalachian region. In particular, we're continuing to jointly pursue solar and wind development on the Energy Transfer track in Kentucky with a large utility company, and we are in discussions with other large renewable energy developers. On the carbon capture front, our Marcus Hook project looks financially attractive based upon preliminary cost estimates and design feasibility studies. This project would involve capturing CO2 from the flue gas and delivering it to customers for industrial applications and is used in food and beverage industries.  We're also pursuing several carbon projects related to our assets, including projects involving the capture of CO2 from processing plants for use in enhanced oil recovery or sequestration. We continue to believe that our franchise will allow us to participate in a variety of projects involving carbon capture or other innovative uses as we continue to reduce our carbon footprint. Lastly, we expect to publish our annual corporate responsibility report for our website shortly. Now let's take a closer look at our third quarter results. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $2.6 billion compared to $2.9 billion for the third quarter of 2020. DCF attributable to the partners as adjusted was $1.31 billion for the third quarter compared to $1.69 billion for the third quarter of 2020. While we saw higher volumes across the majority of our segments, including record volumes in the NGL and refined products segment, these benefits do not offset the significant optimization gains in the third quarter of 2020 related to our various optimization groups as well as the onetime $103 million gain in our Midstream segment. In addition, the third quarter of 2021 included higher utilities and other Winter Storm Uri related expenses. On October 26, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.1525 per common unit or $0.61 on an annualized basis. This distribution will be paid on November 19 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on November 5. Turning to our results by segment, and we'll start with the NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was $706 million compared to $762 million for the same period last year. Higher terminal services and transportation margins related to the increased throughput on our Nederland and Mariner East pipelines in the third quarter of 2021 were offset by a $55 million decrease in our optimization businesses at Mont Belvieu and in the Northeast as well as increased OpEx and G&A. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines increased to a record 1.8 million barrels per day compared to 1.5 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to increased export volumes feeding into our Nederland terminal from the initiation of service on our propane and ethane export projects, higher volumes from the Eagle Ford region as well as increased volumes on our Mariner East and Mariner West pipeline systems.  And our fractionators also reached a new record for the quarter with an average fractionated volumes of 884,000 barrels per day compared to 877,000 barrels per day for the third quarter of 2020. Throughout 2021, we have continued to add volumes to our system and are well positioned to capture additional volumes and capitalize on new opportunities as demand improves. For our crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $496 million compared to $631 million for the same period last year. The improved performance on our Bakken and Bayou Bridge pipelines as a result of recovering volumes in the third quarter of 2021 did not offset approximately $100 million of onetime items in the third quarter of 2020. In addition, we had approximately $20 million in other optimization reductions as well as increased OpEx and G&A expense year-over-year. For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $556 million compared to $530 million for the third quarter of 2020. This was largely the result of a $156 million increase related to favorable NGL and natural gas prices as well as volume growth in the Permian and the ramp-up of recently completed assets in the Northeast, which were partially offset by a decrease of $103 million due to the restructuring and assignment of certain contracts in the Ark-La-Tex region in the third quarter of 2020.  Gathered gas volumes were 13 million MMBtus per day compared to 12.9 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year due to higher volumes in the Permian, Ark-La-Tex and South Texas regions. Permian Basin volumes continue to be strong and Midland Inlet volumes remained at or near record highs. As a result, we are already utilizing our Permian Bridge project to enhance the efficiency of our processing in the area by moving some volumes over to our Delaware Basin processing plants. In our Interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $334 million compared to $425 million for the third quarter of 2020 primarily due to contract expirations at the end of 2020 on Tiger and FEP as well as a shipper bankruptcy on Tiger and lower demand on Panhandle and Trunkline partially offset by an increase in transported volumes on Rover due to more favorable market conditions. And for our intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $172 million compared to $203 million in the third quarter of last year. This was primarily due to lower optimization volumes as a result of third-party customers shifting to long-term contracts from the Permian to the Gulf Coast and lower spreads as well as an increase in operating expenses, which were largely offset by increased transportation volumes out of the Permian and an increase in retained fuel revenues and storage margin. While it impacted us over the comparison period, the additional long-term contracting of third-party customers from the Permian to the Gulf Coast is expected to benefit us going forward as the Waha to Katy basis differential has tightened significantly.  To reduce volatility within our earnings and protect us from falling basis differentials like we saw from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, we have strategically taken steps to lock in additional volumes under fee-based long-term contracts, which are exceeding current differentials. Now turning to our 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance. Our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA remains $12.9 billion to $13.3 billion. As a reminder, this range excludes any contributions from the announced Enable acquisition. And moving to a growth capital update, for the 9 months ended September 30, 2021, Energy Transfer spent $1.08 billion on organic growth projects, primarily in the NGL refined products segment, excluding SUN and USA compression CapEx.  For full year 2021, we continue to expect growth capital expenditures to be approximately $1.6 billion, primarily in the NGL refined product, midstream and crude oil segment. After 2022 and 2023, we continue to expect to spend approximately $500 million to $700 million per year. Now looking briefly at our liquidity position. As of September 30, 2021, total available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities was approximately $5.4 billion, and our leverage ratio was 3.15x for the credit facility.  During the third quarter, we utilized cash from operations to reduce our outstanding debt by approximately $800 million. And year-to-date, we have reduced our long-term debt by approximately $6 billion. We have done a lot of heavy lifting over the last few years as we work to accelerate our debt reduction, improve our leverage and best position ourselves to return value to our unitholders. We expect to generate a significant amount of cash flow in 2022, and paying down debt continues to be our top priority.  Additionally, our strong performance in 2021 opens the door for the potential to begin returning value to our unitholders in the form of distribution increases and/or buybacks beginning next year. During the third quarter, we continue to see volumes recover across several of our systems as well as improve fundamentals. In addition, our Nederland and Mariner East expansion projects drove record volumes in our NGL and refined products segment, and we expect total NGL exports to grow throughout 2022.  Overall, our assets continued to generate strong cash flow, which allowed us to internally fund our growth projects and further reduce debt in the third quarter. We remain committed to maintaining and improving our investment grade rating and continue to place a significant amount of emphasis on capital discipline, deleveraging and maintaining financial flexibility. We continue to be excited about the acquisition of Enable, and we believe we will be able to use our enhanced footprint to improve efficiencies and pursue new commercial opportunities.  How we participate in the evolving energy world is a key focus, and we continue to make progress on a number of our alternative energy projects, which we can enhance and effectively grow our energy franchise with preliminary cost estimates looking favorable.  Operator, please open the line up for our first question. All right. Keith, let's start off with the first part of your question on the debt. You probably saw we had $1.9 billion already. And on November 1, we have $1 billion of that. And on December 1, we'll pay off the other $900 million. So we're going to continue as these maturities -- as these maturities come forward, we will continue to pay them down. If some opportunity comes along that maybe you want to term some out, I'm not going to take that completely off the table. But right now, we are continuing to pay down these maturities and even call some early as they come up. I think the second part of your question, that's -- those are discussions that we continue to have with the Board. I wouldn't say that there's any more definitive I can tell you at this time other than both the buybacks and the distributions are very much front and center as we look at them. But I want to make sure the first part of your statement that maintaining financial flexibility is definitely a top priority. No, I wouldn't say that there would be any opportunity for spike there. As you know, that's a very small -- very, very small piece that sits up there. It's a royalty business. So I wouldn't guide you toward anything there. As far as divestiture, there's no plans, no dialogue going on, on that front. Thank you all once again for joining us today and for your support, and we look forward to talking to you in the near future."

            "name": "Mackie McCrea",
            "content": "Yes. Good afternoon, Shneur. As we obviously started the year, we had the initial guidance we gave and then we had, obviously, a very, very strong first quarter. So as we look out over the year, I think it's the first part of your question there about what we were expecting, this is pretty much in line. I will say that it was probably a little bit higher optimization activities that we were anticipating in some of the segments, NGL and refined products. Crude oil would probably be another one.  So this is really playing out maybe a little bit softer than what we were anticipating, but we still feel good about the guidance that we provided. And I think the last part of your question as to where we would anticipate coming in. I think in fairness, it'd probably be coming in at the lower end of that range. Is probably where we see it right now. But once again, we have a lot of good positive volumes moving through, and with the continued optimization opportunities, we do feel very, very good about the year. We would -- our target is still that 4 to 4.5 range. But Shneur, like I stated in the past, we do always look out at the forecast. So when we make these decisions, we're not just looking at any one specific point in time. We're looking at our projections and where we see the leverage going. So it's something that's more of an outlook. So there's not a bright line, if you will. So that's the reason we felt comfortable saying that we look at returning some to our -- returning capital to our unitholders even in the form of distributions or unit CapEx. Yes, I said beginning next year. I want to be sure I add that into the answer. Chase, this is Mackie. Yes, I'll tell you what a great question. We love these types of questions because Energy Transfer has positioned itself to really be the leader in not only ethane but all NGLs. As you know, we were the first export of ethane into Canada, and then we've grown our export business ethane in Marcus Hook and out of Nederland.  We also are unique in that we control the vast majority of the ethane that we receive at the tailgate of our frac. So unlike some of our peers, we actually control an enormous amount of ethane that, indeed, the world is searching for. And we have -- with RB and his team, we have continuous conversations with companies all over the world. South America, Asia, Europe, China. We expect that business to grow. As you know, we brought on a satellite this year, and they'll be bringing their second frac on next year. So we'll be ramping those volumes up. We already have approval for a 70,000 and 140,000 barrel a day expansion at Marcus Hook, and we're just looking and negotiating with customers to get to FID on those projects. So ethane and propane have such bright futures, and we are very pleased to be situated where we are to participate in those markets. Gosh, this is Mackie. I'll start. I want to follow up. I had to answer that. We don't really -- whatever comes out of those plans and out of all that legislation, we'll deal with that when that comes out and once it gets budgeted on. But we're keeping our heads down. We're in the fossil fuel business. We play an integral part in producing, transporting, fracking and exporting and also selling to the domestic markets the enormous amounts of energy that make the living standards as we have them here and around the world. And we are excited about our industry. We see a long future in this industry. We see a significantly growing demand for natural gas and especially for propane and ethane, for ethylene and propylene and other very critical products that are -- play such a big role in everyday life. So we don't really -- we try -- of course, we pay attention to politics. Of course, we pay attention to any tax impacts it may have on our partnership but we don't really get all worried and caught up in that. We'll deal with it when it comes out. But in the meantime, we're just trying to generate revenues for our unitholders. This is Mackie again. Yes, as Tom was referring to, optimization opportunities, especially material ones like we saw in 2020, you can't predict those. You can't predict a pandemic. You can't predict oil going to a negative zero and you can't predict it bouncing back up in a relatively small period of time to the mid-40s or $50 a barrel.  So the fortunate thing about our assets, both our crude assets, our NGL assets and our natural gas assets is we have a tremendous amount of storage. So it does give us the ability to put products into storage and hedge them out, say, for example, this winter. And then if we have any type of winter events or any type of pricing volatility events, we are able to really benefit from pulling our products out at much higher margins than we expected. So it's hard to predict. We certainly position ourselves to take advantage of any of that volatility in the market. like we saw this past February, but we certainly don't project that into our budget or into our outlook in the coming years. Yes. Yes, we don't -- I'm sorry, I didn't totally follow the question, but we were well situated to benefit not only our revenues but also the customers and the people of Texas and Uri. But -- as I mentioned, we're also set up this year. If there's any types of cold falls or any type of significant volatility in pricing. We're well positioned to be able to provide what will be necessary for customers in this state and throughout the country. Yes, the second question, I believe the latest we heard was the third quarter of next year. I can't say that with absolute certainty. That's the last thing we heard. I meant to check on that before this call, and I have not heard an update. So I believe that's it. Let's start with the inventory gains. This quarter, you saw about $33 million. And some of that is because of the absolute lower inventory balance that we're keeping also versus $67 million in the quarter, the quarter last year, both those being gains, but you can see that's where the -- that's really kind of where the spread is there. I think as far as the second part of it, yes. The Bakken pipeline was in there. And I might add in there still ramping up. Is that -- was that your question, Keith, just to make sure on that, were you talking about the expansion? Yes. I'll give a little clarity. This is Mackie. We brought that on in August. And when we brought that project on the optimization to increase the capacity, the demand charges kicked in on that. So the volumes will be what the volumes will be, and the drilling needs to pick up in the Bakken to really see those volumes grow. But the bottom line is we are receiving demand charges for the incremental capacity we've created for a significant portion of it. Jeremy, this is Mackie. You said it well, and that's kind of what we saw this year. It's what we are seeing going in next year. The majors are just much more cautious. They're watching capital much more closer than a lot of the independents. So at least around a lot of our assets, we are seeing more activity and more production coming on with the smaller companies, the smaller independents. However, some of these majors, especially out in the Permian Basin in the Northern Louisiana area and even in the Marcellus Utica, we are seeing rigs come back in, as everybody knows. I think rigs in North Louisiana are up about 45% from where they were a year ago -- a little over a year ago, and we're seeing a similar type growth out in the Permian. There's still a lot of DUCs out in the Permian that have not been completed. A number of them have been but we are seeing a lot of those now being completed as we go into 2022.  So I think we would describe it, at least around our system, is just consistent growth not just a hard ramp in the first or second quarter but just consistent growth throughout the year, both in rigs and in volume growth out in the Permian. We do expect faster growth on the more leaner gas in Northern Louisiana. And we see kind of similar gradual growth in the Eagle Ford down South Texas on our assets down there. Yes. Tom Mason in his group, of course, are today following that and we're looking for what comes out of Congress with the 45Q and other tax benefits around renewables. As we've said before, our focus is really on the missions to our assets, in other words around our processing plants, our treating facilities. We're looking to capture carbon, whether we do it, partner up with somebody or allow somebody else to capture that.  We are also looking at some -- catching some carbon off some of our facilities up in the Northeast. We have our Marcus Hook facility. We're looking to capture some gas. We've done some preliminary studies. They actually look very promising at some rates of return that makes sense, and so we will continue to pursue those. And we're also looking at some carbon capture down in South Texas that will either be sequestered or part of an ERR project. So we are proceeding. We're doing that on a daily basis. Tom and his team are looking at deals all across the board, whether it's black carbon or whether it's taking natural gas and converting it to a gasoline or whether it's renewable diesel and transporting that through our diesel pipeline system, we're looking at all of that, and we'll continue to participate in that as we have around the solar business, where we are not invested in that from a capital perspective but we're certainly investing in our commitment to purchase what we see as very inexpensive power. So we are supporting renewables in that way or that manner. But we'll continue to pursue those that make sense, and we do expect to consummate some of those in the distant future not necessarily a tremendous amount of capital, but we do see several projects that may involve up to $20 million or $30 million of capital around CO2 sequestration. So that is going to remain a focus of ours as we go into '22 and beyond. Intrastate? You bet. This is Mackie again. So prior to the last 3, 42 inches that have come on in the last couple of years, -- we -- that was kind of our bread and butter. It's moving gas across the state. We saw spreads of $1.50, $2. And those, of course, started to come in. So we started a strategy about a couple of years ago to look to secure longer-term commitment at not $1, $1.50 spreads but a good healthy spread, and that's what we began doing.  So when you look at the third quarter, the spreads were up as much as $0.75 or $0.80 on average for that quarter. We did secure during prior -- I mean, I'm sorry, last year that impacted third quarter of this year at lower than that $0.75 or $0.80 but much higher than where the spreads are today. It's a strategy that made sense to us to. Where we could see the spreads coming in at least in the short term, we think this will be short-lived. In 2 to 3 years, we believe the basis will blow back out. There will be more need. Look at the growth in the Permian Basin and natural gas is just incredible. But in the meantime, we did want to secure some of our capacity at healthy margins for longer-term contracts. Yes. I'll answer it like this, that we've seen spreads fall to $0.25 -- $0.20, $0.25, $0.30 here as of recent. We do believe, and I believe the industry believes that over the next 1.5 years to 2 years that, that will start moving back out. We may see $0.75 or $1. We have some of our competitors out there talking about building in maybe another 42-inch. What we're trying to tell the marketplace and the producers and shippers before they commit another project, we'll have capacity. We have capacity coming available in 2 or 3 years from now. And we'd love to lock it in for prices similar to what they would pay on new build on greenfield projects.  So we are very well positioned to kind of weather the storm here as all the -- these 42 inches have been completed as the gas begins to grow and fill them up. And once they all become full, we're very well positioned to capture bigger spreads on capacity we'll have on our gas system. Yes. Michael, this is Mackie. What a great project. That's really turned out well for us. We saw -- for example, we saw a hiccup on Petco's pipeline here a couple of months ago, and we saw the value of that pipeline increase even more so with the difficulty that we see in the -- at least the near term, over the next 2, 3, 4, 5 years, how difficult it will be to get another interstate pipeline approved out of that area. So we're so well positioned.  We do have probably approximately over 90% of it under long-term contracts on a month-to-month basis. Many times, we're selling capacity at tariff rates depending on the month, depending on whether they're going to down or going south to Zone 1a. So it's such an excellently strategically located asset. As we see volumes grow at the Marcellus Utica, it's kind of unique in the sense that it can move barrels up to the north into Canada. And as you know, it can move barrels all the way down to Gulf Coast to provide supplies for LNG facilities as well other markets on the Gulf Coast. So we're -- we consistently move about 3.2 to 3.4. We can move as much as 3.55, I believe it is. And so we'll continue to see that kind of grow both in filling up to the max and also at max tariff rates as the future -- as we go into the future. It would certainly add to those numbers, but getting that project to FID, it's down the road. We're probably talking at least 12 months of getting that to FID. So we wouldn't see any material spending until probably '23. Well, what a great question, and we are positioned to capitalize on that when we find the answer to that question. We're being very capital disciplined, so we have not completed our 8 frac, but we're certainly watching it very closely, both for volumes that are committed to our plants and also volumes committed to third-party plants.  So just from -- looking from our eyes intra transfer eyes, we don't see the need for one for at least the next 6 to 9 months, but we evaluate on a quarterly basis. And we do expect that at some point in 2022, we'll have to take a serious look at completing that 8 frac. We do expect the volumes to begin growing as long as commodity prices continue to stay where they are now. It sure looks like they will. I can start on the second half of that, which maybe most of it. Yes, in most of our contracts, certainly, in all of our liquid contracts around our transportation and fractionation and around our crude contracts, we have an index. It's typically a FERC index. But to give you an example, I believe the FERC index this year, I believe that started in July and it goes July to the next July, was negative. So we actually didn't have any kind of uptick in that from -- while we see this inflation.  However, what that sets up for is next July we expect that to move up significantly. We've heard as much as 5% or 6%, and we do have those increases in the vast majority of our rig contracts as well as in many, if not most, of our gas contracts. So we do have, whether it's the CPI index in our gas contract or the FERC index and our liquid contracts, we do have that in the majority of those, and we'll benefit from -- or at least not be harmed by the inflationary growth in costs. It may on future contracts. But when I'm referring to all the existing contracts we have today to move products to our systems already have that language in it. Yes. I'm not sure what an incentive rate is, what -- the rate we will do is the highest rate we can possibly get from our shippers from what the market will allow. I'm sorry. So if you're saying -- where the marketplace is, yes. The -- just like crude, just like natural gas for lease for a short period of time, NGL cross all has been overbuilt. Fortunately, much of the barrels that are -- that come to our system and that will come to our system in the future are already dedicated. But those barrels that are out there to tailgate of third-party facilities that we go out and try to get on a monthly basis, it's gotten very competitive. The T&F prices are significantly lower than where they were years ago. You bet, this is Mackie again. Yes, it' kind of a variety. We effected a lot more demand or a lot more desperate, I'd say, demand to come secure storage. We certainly have sold more storage than we did last year at much more favorable rates and also some swing rights to that. We are still in negotiations with a number of parties and power plants for swing service and storage service for this winter. But some of the companies had panicked or haven't -- don't seem as worried about it as we thought they would after what happened at Uri. But once again, we're well positioned whether or not we've already done as we have some new deals or we're positioned to be able to provide that service as they need it this winter."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Tom Long, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you. You may begin.\nTom Long: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to the Energy Transfer's second quarter 2021 earnings call and thank you for joining us today. I'm also joined today by; Mackie McCrea and other members of our senior management team, who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully you saw our press release we issued earlier this afternoon, as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Security Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based on our current beliefs, as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us, and are discussed in more detail on our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30th, 2021, which we expect to be filed this Thursday, August the 5th. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow or DCF, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'd like to start today by looking at some of our second quarter highlights. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 billion and DCF attributable to the partners of ET as adjusted of $1.4 billion. Our excess cash flow after distributions was approximately $980 million. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of approximately $625 million after distributions of $414 million and growth capital of approximately $355 million. The increased results over the second quarter of 2020 were primarily due to higher earnings in the midstream, intrastate and NGL and refined product segments. Switching gears to an update on the acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners, which will provide increased scale in the Midcontinent and Ark-La-Tex regions and improved connectivity for our natural gas and NGL transportation customers. In May, the acquisition was approved by Enable unitholders, and the only remaining condition to closing is obtaining HSR clearance. The FTC has issued requests for additional information and documentary material, commonly known as Second Request, which extended the HSR waiting period. Energy Transfer and Enable are working diligently to provide the relevant information to the FTC, and have engaged in constructive dialogue with them throughout this process. We continue to believe that the FTC will grant unconditional clearance of the transaction and that we will close the transaction in the second half of 2021. I'll now walk you through recent developments on our major growth projects, and we'll start with our Cushing to Nederland pipeline. In early June, we commenced joint tariff service to provide crude oil transportation from our Cushing Terminal to our Nederland Terminal. This project also provides the capability to deliver Powder River and DJ Basin barrels to our Nederland Terminal, being an upstream connection with our White Cliffs pipeline. We are now capable of transporting approximately 65,000 barrels per day of oil from the DJ Basin and Cushing area to Nederland. And we're seeing a steady growth in volumes. The first phase of this project is fully contracted with a large majority of those contracts coming from third-party shippers. In addition to customer demand, we are moving forward with Phase II of this project, which will increase the capacity to 120,000 barrels per day. Phase II is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2022 and is underpinned by third-party commitments. Minimal capital spend is required for this project. Next, construction of the Ted Collins Link is progressing and we continue to expect it to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2021. Upon initial completion, this project will provide crude oil transportation up to 150,000 barrels per day from West Texas and Nederland to our Houston Terminal, which can be expanded to 300,000 barrels per day. Now, looking to Dakota Access in May, the DC District Court denied the plaintiff's motion for an injunction to shut down Dakota Access, and thereafter dismissed the plaintiffs' lawsuit against the Army Corps. We continue to cooperate with the Army Corps in their preparation of the Environmental Impact Statement. We recently placed the next phase of incremental capacity for the Bakken Pipeline Optimization project into service, which is supported by minimum volume commitment from long-term customers. With completion of this phase of the optimization, Dakota Access now has the ability to flow approximately 750,000 barrels per day. Let's take a look at our Mariner East System. Second quarter 2021, NGL volumes through the Mariner East Pipeline system increased approximately 15% over the second quarter of 2020. Our Pennsylvania Access Project, which will allow refined products to flow from the Midwest supply regions into Pennsylvania, New York and other markets in the northeast is ready for service when markets dictate. We now expect the next significant phase of the Mariner East project to be in service in the third quarter of 2021 and the final phase of the Mariner East Pipeline is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Today, we are seeing demand exceed our current throughput capacity, which will allow us to begin utilizing additional capacity as our next phase of Mariner East is brought online later this year. Now, a brief update on our Nederland Terminal. During the second quarter, we completed the remaining expansions of our LPG facilities at Nederland. With the addition of our LPG and ethane expansions completed in late 2020 and early 2021, we are now capable of exporting approximately 700,000 barrels per day of NGLs from our Nederland Terminal. And when combined with our export capabilities for our Marcus Hook Terminal as well as our Mariner West Pipeline which exports more than 55,000 barrels per day of ethane to Canada, our total NGL export capacity is now over 1.1 million barrels per day, which is among the largest in the world. In fact, in May and June, we exported more NGLs than any other company or country in the world, with our daily throughput averaging over 850,000 barrels per day in June. We see an increasing need for products in markets beyond North America and we are striving to meet this need with our growing export business. At our expanded Nederland Terminal, volumes have continued to increase throughout the first half of this year, and we expect them to continue to increase throughout the remainder of 2021. And export volumes under our Orbit Ethane Export joint venture have seen strong growth. Through June, we loaded more than 9 million barrels of ethane out of this facility since placing it into service. Our Permian Bridge project, which will connect our gathering and processing assets in the Delaware Basin with our G&P assets in the Midland Basin is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. This project will allow us to move approximately 115,000 MCF per day of rich gas out of the Midland Basin and operate existing capacity more efficiently, while also providing access to additional takeaway options. This project is a good example of how we can preserve capital spend as we strategically look for ways to optimize, repurpose and expand our assets to provide us with competitive advantages. Lastly, in July, we announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with Republic of Panama to study the feasibility of jointly developing a proposed Trans-Panama Gateway Pipeline. The project would include terminals from the Pacific and Atlantic side of Panama to be connected by a pipeline for the receipt, transportation and export of LPGs to international markets. This project would provide relief for the increasing traffic of VLGCs through the Panama Canal and provide high volume Pacific loading optionality for customers in Asia. Now, for an update on our alternative energy activities, since we announced the creation of an Alternative Energy Group in February, we have continued to focus on renewable energy projects. In this regard, we have finalized a second long-term power purchase agreement for 120 megawatts of solar power that we expect to sign after receipt of regulatory approval. We're also continuing to explore several opportunities for solar and wind projects on our existing acreage in the northeast, and recently signed an agreement with a large utility company to jointly pursue solar and wind development on an Energy Transfer Tract in Kentucky. On the Carbon Capture front, our Marcus Hook project continues to look promising based on preliminary cost estimates, and design feasibility studies. This project would involve capturing CO2 from the flue gas and delivering it to customers that would produce food grade CO2. We're also pursuing two carbon projects near our systems, one involving the capture of CO2 from processing plants for use in an enhanced oil recovery, and the second for a carbon utilization project. We're also reviewing potential equity investments in a variety of projects including biogas and biodiesel projects that would qualify for low-carbon fuel standard credits, as long as they satisfy our economic return criteria. Our engineering and operations teams are constantly working to explore ways to reduce emissions across our facilities. And as we've discussed previously, our Dual Drive Compressors continue to win environmental awards for reducing CO2 emissions by utilizing their ability to run off electric power as well as natural gas. An important distinction for our Dual Drive Compressors versus all electric compressors is that, Dual Drive helps grid reliability as the electric demand can be volatile, especially in some remote areas of operations. In addition, we have significantly ramped up our exports of butane, propane and ethane for power generation. There in many cases displaces diesel, wood and animal waste, naphtha and other fuels which provide for a significant reduction of CO2 emissions. Finally, we expect to publish ESG data on the Energy Infrastructure Council and GPA Midstream ESG template in the near future and we're also continuing to address various inaccuracies in third-party ESG reports, due to a lack of effort by certain third-parties to discover and report accurate information. Now, let's take a closer look at our second quarter results. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $2.6 billion, compared to $2.4 billion for the second quarter of 2020. DCF attributable to the Partners as adjusted was $1.4 billion for the second quarter, compared to $1.3 billion for the second quarter of 2020. The increased results were primarily driven by improved earnings in the midstream, intrastate and NGL and refined product segments. On July 22nd, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.1525 per common unit or $0.61 on an annualized basis. This distribution will be paid on August 19th to unitholders of record as of the close of business on August the 6th. Turning to our results by segment, we'll start with the NGL refined products segment. Our adjusted EBITDA was $736 million, compared to $674 million the same period last year. This was primarily due to higher export volumes feeding our Nederland Terminal, increased throughput on our Mariner East Pipeline, and at our Marcus Hook Terminal as well as increased storage and fractionation and refinery services margin. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly-owned and joint venture pipelines increased to 1.7 million barrels per day, compared to 1.4 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to increase export volumes, feeding into our Nederland Terminal from the initiation of service on our propane and ethane export projects, as well as increased volumes on our Mariner East Pipeline system. On our fractionators, average fractionated volumes was 833,000 barrels per day, compared to 836,000 barrels per day for the second quarter of 2020. Since the end of the second quarter, transportation and fractionation volumes have continued to increase. For our Crude Oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $484 million, compared to $519 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to lower average tariff rates on our Texas Crude Oil Pipeline system, as well as decrease in our crude oil acquisition and marketing business. We did see higher volumes on our Bakken and Bayou Bridge pipelines, which have improved from the lows of last year. We have now seen the majority of the major contract roll offs on our Permian Express system and will look to capture better margins going forward as the market improves. For Midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $477 million, compared to $367 million for the second quarter of 2020. This was largely the result of favorable NGL and natural gas prices, as well as volume growth across most of our regions and the ramp up of recently completed assets in the northeast. Gathered gas volumes were 13.1 million MMBTUs per day, compared to 13 million MMBTUs per day for the same period last year, due to higher volumes in the Permian, Ark-La-Tex, South and North Texas regions as they continue to improve from lows same last year. Permian Basin volumes have remained strong and Midland inlet volumes continue to be at or near record highs. In our Intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $331 million, compared to $403 million for the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to contract expirations on Tiger and FEP, as well as a shipper bankruptcy on Tiger, partially offset by an increase in transported volumes on Rover. And for our Intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $224 million, compared to $187 million in the second quarter of last year. This was primarily due to demand volume ramp ups in the Permian, and an increase in retained fuel revenues, as well as a $39 million increase from revenues related to Winter Storm Uri. There is no doubt that Uri created much more demand for our pipeline and storage network, and we are seeing this reflected in incoming calls and discussions with existing and new customers who are looking to lock in firm transport and/or storage agreements. Now turning to our 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance. We continue to expect a full year adjusted EBITDA to be between $12.9 billion to $13.3 billion, excluding any contribution from the announced Enable acquisition. And moving to a growth capital update for the six months ended June 30th, 2021, Energy Transfer spent $715 million on organic growth projects, primarily in the NGL and refined products segment, excluding Sun and USA Compression CapEx. For full year 2021, we continue to expect growth capital expenditures to be approximately $1.6 billion primarily in the NGL and refined products, midstream and crude oil segments. We continue to focus on aligning capital outlay with customer needs and remain disciplined in regard to all spending. Any new projects are primarily expected to be focused on improving optionality around our existing assets. And for 2022 and 2023, we continue to expect spend of approximately $500 million to $700 million per year. Now looking briefly at our liquidity position. As of June 30th, 2021, total available liquidity under our revolving credit facility was approximately $5 billion and our leverage ratio was 3.14 for our credit facility. During the second quarter, we utilized cash from operations and proceeds from a $900 million Series H preferred unit offering to reduce our outstanding debt by approximately $1.5 billion. And year-to-date, we have reduced our long-term debt by $5.2 billion. And in May of this year, S&P and Moody's affirmed our credit ratings of BBB minus and Baa3, respectively, and both revise our outlook to stable from negative. In addition, in April, we removed a layer of organizational complexity with the roll up of Energy Transfer Operating Company into Energy Transfer. During the second quarter, we continue to see improved fundamentals and the completion of our NGL expansions at Nederland has positioned us as one of the leading exporters of NGLs in the world. We expect our LPG and ethane export projects at our Nederland Terminal to further ramp up throughout the rest of this year. Capital discipline and deleveraging continue to be among our top priorities, and we continue to pay down debt in the second quarter. We've remained committed to maintaining and improving our investment grade rating. And we will look to return additional capital for unitholders in the form of unit buybacks and/or distribution increases with the mix dependent upon our analysis of market conditions at the time. We also continue to explore development of alternative energy projects and opportunities to reduce our environmental footprint, some of which are looking very promising, and we hope to be announcing additional projects shortly. Operator, please open the lineup for our first question?\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nShneur Gershuni: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. You know, maybe to start off, just given all the comments that you made about capital allocation and so forth. When I sort of think about your guidance for this year, all the debt that you paid off during the most recent quarter, there were some preferred offering as well too. It sort of suggests that you'd be below your $4.5 billion for leverage in the third or fourth quarter of this year. What are your priorities in terms of returning capital to unitholders? You know, just sort of looking at your current trading levels, does buybacks become the priority? Or is there some other things that you're considering?\nTom Long: Good afternoon, Shneur and definitely appreciate the question here. As you know, we got the four different options that we look at. We're very excited that we've been able to pay off as much as we have this year with the $5.2 billion. We're still not providing guidance as to exactly timing from that standpoint, but I will say that the debt has clearly been our focus at this point, but I will say the distribution and/or unit buybacks as well as the CapEx, we're going to continue to look at it from an economic standpoint as to what makes sense. But it's great to be in this position and have this question right now. So, keep in mind that, not putting that in any one order, but we clearly had the debt as the top. And we've made great progress on that. So you can appreciate the distribution and unit buyback as we've worked diligently to stay very disciplined on the CapEx front.\nShneur Gershuni: You know, that makes sense. And maybe that's a good transition to my follow-up question. You've sort of maintained the growth capital outlook for both '22 and '23 in fact 700 million per year. And I recognize that a lot of that is kind of in the FID bucket already. Kind of interested in the sort of the discussion you had in your prepared remarks, you talked about a bunch of different Carbon Capture projects that you were looking at some with sequestration, some within the oil recovery and so forth. Are those projects also included in kind of that outlook that you have for the next two years in CapEx? If not, do you have a sense around the price tag on that, and so - and how we could think it could potentially move as you move to FID on those types of projects?\nMackie McCrea: Yeah, Shneur, this is Mackie. As we have expressed as Tom Mason and his team are leading, we're looking at a lot of stuff around ESG and as we have said anything that makes sense, economic sense on rates of return, we're going to pursue it. Right now, there's really nothing on the horizon that has any kind of significant material, capital costs to it that we're looking at any serious way. For example, we made the announcements on the silver front, we're really - we're not investing anything, we're just a buyer of inexpensive electricity. Some of these other Carbon Capture projects that we're looking at going to require a lot of capital, and/or the Partner that we're teaming up with will provide more of the capital. So right now, we don't have really anything in there materially. And we even have a little bit of a cushion to help grow our Midstream business, as these rigs begin and then have started moving in and as far to gather opportunities and things like that. So no, we don't have much in there at all from a cost standpoint for ESG project.\nShneur Gershuni: Okay, really appreciated it. I'll respect the two questions that I have a ton more. So I'll jump back in the queue. Thank you and have a great afternoon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Hi. With the double expansion being up, are you seeing or expecting more flows? Or since there's excess pipeline out of the Bakken. Should we think of it more like new MBCs will start so you'll get paid? But we may not see the flows right away?\nMackie McCrea: This is Mackie, again. Yes, we have seen for August, this significant increase in nominations and we're seeing the flows begin. And also, yes, to your question around MBC, the MBC on the optimization commitment did kick in on August 1st.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Perfect, thanks. And then as you noted, the Intrastate segment was down sequentially, data contract expirations on Tiger and Fayetteville pretty materially. Is that kind of the end of the original contracts? I think maybe there's a little - there's one more in Fayetteville Express next year, but for this year, is there any more expiration coming in the back half? Or is this kind of the new base?\nMackie McCrea: We're seeing the bottoms. As you mentioned, there's one small one of the PP over next year or the end of this year, but now we're kind of, you know, 10 years passed by pretty quickly. And we are, but we're seeing so much growth around some of these pipelines in North Louisiana and excited about being able to move a lot of that gas out really both ways, but also adding back in the Texas into our Intrastate system. So we believe we've seen the bottom of the barrel there, and we'll see more growth. A quick example around Intrastates we recently have sold out the vast majority of our capacity from West Texas to California through our DW system for the next two years at Max tariff rate, not sure why we had a company come in that believes the value for gas in California must be on the way up. So we're seeing some positives. And we've said that a while around TransWestern well, where when contracts roll off, we actually add new contracts at higher fee. So, there are some pluses also the Intrastate's more seasonal. This is not a - the second quarter's not a high throughput necessarily for our Intrastate system. But we do pretty much the upside for here.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Great, thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Stanley: Hi. Good afternoon. Maybe I could follow-up on Enable some. Just on feedback and questions you've gotten from the FTC. Has anything been surprising to-date or has the process been as expected and just want to confirm next steps in the process? It sounds like you still have to respond to their second request? Is that right?\nMackie McCrea: Yeah, this is Mackie again. That's correct. We are responding to their second request, we're a little surprised. We thought that, that after extending it 30 more days from initial 30 days that we would resolve all their questions and issues. But we remain confident that we will be closing in the not too distant future. And we've been and we'll continue to be very cooperative with FTC. And feel real good about getting the finish line sooner than later.\nKeith Stanley: Great. A separate question just on the Crude segment. So Crude EBITDA was down year-over-year and that's from the second quarter of '20. You mentioned that you're hoping things are kind of close? Or I guess, should we think of this as close to a bottom for that segment? I think there was a reference to the majority of the contracts now rolling off. So, should we think of EBITDA on crude is bottoming? And is there anything that can kind of turn that segment around?\nMackie McCrea: Yeah, this is Mackie, again. Well actually the segment has been turned around. We give you an example. On majority of our pipelines, we were at about 2.5 million barrels a day, pre-pandemic, and we're back up to about 50,000 barrels less than that. So our volumes have recovered almost 95% to 90% from where they were, these are the volumes across Texas and at the Bakken. So a lot of really good things happen to crude as far as volumes, we can really control the spreads, the spreads per part of the quarter widened out a little bit, they've narrowed, they kind of go back and forth, it's clearly a fact there's too much crude capacity across Texas. So we continue to look at repurposing things and also providing more value than just point A to point B through our systems. But our Crude team has done a fantastic job. Just started in January till now we've added about 500,000 to 600,000 barrels a day of crude cross all - we didn't have at the beginning of this year, albeit at much tighter spreads and margins than what we saw a year, a year and a half ago. But we can only control what we can gather and transport for customers. And the spread will be where they'll be. So and I guess final out are to complete the question. Yeah, we feel like we're kind of at the bottom, we think that we're going to continue to keep our volumes where they are or grow, we of course are, have kicked in the NBCs for optimization project. That's new revenues that are coming in. So, similar to Intrastate, which you know the two at most struggling segments, we all hit on. All the other, please ask about. We're pretty excited about those now and the future. But anyway, we similar to Intrastate, we feel like we've been at the bottom and everything's kind of up from here.\nKeith Stanley: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons Energy. Please proceed with your question.\nPearce Hammond: Yeah. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. My first is, two years ago, you announced the office in Beijing and not just to build business in China, but also throughout Asia. And you highlighted earlier the success you're having with the Orbit JV. So I'm just curious, you know, what's your line of sight to other opportunities in Asia for Energy Transfer? And, you know, how do you see that market evolving over the next few years?\nMackie McCrea: It's Mackie again. We are extremely excited. The pandemic really put a kind of a pause on not only LPG and ethane, but also crude, it kind of slowed everything down and everything is or by now the economy around the world, especially in the US, but China's coming back. We have pages of companies that we're talking to different sizes from both ethane and LPG expansion projects. We are - we very much expect over the next year, if not sooner, within six months to get to FID on another expansion, whether it's at Marcus Hook or at The Nederland that we've always kind of been proud of the fact that we're the only company in the country that can export both from the Gulf Coast and from Nederland infrastructure - I mean, Gulf Coast and from Marcus Hook. And we're able to structure and negotiate these deals with a lot of these Chinese companies and give them that option, but also give us an option, which makes our assets more reliable and gives both of those terminals significant benefits. So that's a longwinded answer too. Yes, it's picked up in a big way. We're in conversations with numerous companies in China as well as many others around the world. And we couldn't be more excited about what we've done from an export build out capacity for ethane and LPG and crude oil. For that matter and where the future is going to be to around the world, we're exceptionally well situated to meet the market demands in future.\nPearce Hammond: Well thank you, Mackie for that. And then my follow-up pertains to the Panama announcement. I know it's super early. But just curious from a high level, what do you see Energy Transfer bring into Panama? What would be the advantages to Energy Transfer? Just for a high level thoughts on what could be in the country?\nMackie McCrea: Yeah, we're really excited about that. What a great group of people, everybody we've met with there, and the government has been just a pleasure to work with. And we're really excited about where all that's gone. What do we bring to the table, if you look back over just the last, not that many years, we've gone from kind of nothing to now as you heard on Tom's remarks, the export NGLs in the world? So that kind of says something, just made a statement about the two terminals that we have. And what this terminal provide is the Country of Panama to benefit from moving barrels that are much in need throughout the world, to the Pacific side of their country and become a major hub for the Asian markets as well as for the South American market. So we bring the expertise, we bring - we will be able to bring the barrels, we're going to be able to operate at really in effect four terminals, a hub on the Atlantic side, Pacific side and the two that we have today. So we're very excited. As you mentioned in the very early part of this, we look forward to where this is going. And hopefully getting the FID in a not too distant future.\nPearce Hammond: Thank you, Mackie.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to start off with the EBITDA guidance, if I could here, because it seems like you've already completed a good portion of it over half year-to-date. And so just wondering if there's something that you're expecting to show up in the back half of the year, that would be a headwind relative to the beginning of the year or anything else to think of here is it really just kind of conservatism with not raising the guide at this point, just trying to understand drivers within the range a bit better?\nTom Long: Listen, I'll start off with it. Good afternoon, Jeremy. We think our guidance is really down the middle of the fairway, you know, the $12.9 billion to $13.3 billion. And you know, you're right, we've had a great start to the year with the first six months. But when you really look at it, and you kind of look at the forward curves that we've used for the pricing, which have stayed right in line with that for all the various commodities. And you've heard Mackie talk a lot about the volumes, et cetera. That's the reason why we've kept the range in a little bit wider. But once again, we feel very good about this. We don't really feel like there's any headwinds on this. We're very excited about the next - the last half of the year, next two quarters. And I don't know I'm looking to Mackie to see if he'd like to add anything more to the answer here. But we do feel very good. We do not see headwinds.\nMackie McCrea: Yeah, I guess what I'll add is, I kind of joked a minute ago about on the top, no questions yet around the Midstream or Intrastate or NGLs. But we're so excited about what we're seeing, we've said that last time, the rigs are moving in, they're moving in in a big way. We've seen our volumes in our Midstream just in the first quarter of this year to the second quarter of this year go up by 8%. And if you look at just the Permian alone, it's up 15%. So we're extremely well situated to where these rigs are, as everybody knows, you bring the gas to the plant and connect to these plants are residue an Intrastate systems and our NGL systems. So if you look at what kind of feeding into our NGL system, both our Lone Star Pipelines and our Mont Belvieu fracks. We're now fracking about 900 - a little over 900,000 barrels a day. If you look back a year ago, we first brought on frack seven, I think we did about what 920,000 or 930,000 barrels was our high. But that's a little misleading, because when we brought on fracks, we weighed a bunch NGLs and laggards and storage. So we're kind of feeding from the field, from the plant plus, out of storage. It's different today. We're filling of our fracks today from the field, from the tailgate of all the plants. In fact, we're actually injecting some raw grade into storage. So we, the NGL segment is just unbelievably exciting. We can't say enough about our team and all the effort we put together at the end of 2020, beginning of '21 around getting the Orbit project completed online and finalizing all this LPG growth and buoy, are we incredibly well situated benefit from that all the way from the wellhead through the fracks and then on to the export market. So pretty excited about that. And that'll kind of help feed into our EBITDA the last half of the year.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it, that's really helpful there. And then pivoting over here, it seems like a number of studies out there have talked about given the density of CO2 emissions off the Gulf Coast, there's really a good opportunity for kind of CO2 hub concepts on the Texas Gulf Coast, particularly as it relates to Houston there between PetChem and heavy industry emissions. And just wondering over time, especially if these DC initiatives pass that would support CCUS economics, what role do you see for EP here over time. And do you believe that CO2 storage sequestration is more of an offshore or onshore solution over time just given you know, the pros and cons of each side here?\nMackie McCrea: This is Mackie, again. Well, first thing I'll say is that, if you look kind of along the Gulf Coast, there's nobody that has more pipelines of all different sorts than us. So, as we look to repurpose pipelines, if there's opportunities to repurpose into lube, CO2 or flue gas from some of these, but industry is along the coast, there's nobody probably better situated than us. But we're not really out chasing, say, a CO2 sequestration project down in the Gulf or out in Timbuktu, what we're doing is looking at projects that are related to our assets, and doing what we can to work with third-parties to figure out a way to either capture that or to process it or wherever the case may be. So, as I mentioned earlier, Tom Mason put a great team together, we're evaluating numerous opportunities and we'll certainly move forward on those that make good economic sense.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good afternoon. Wanted to ask on Mariner East 2X. Now that you're, you know, just about less than two quarters away from finally getting this project fully done. I wondered if you can give us some clarity in terms of you know how much the project ultimately cost? What the economics could look like? And would you expect to sign additional shippers up once the pipeline is fully up and running.\nTom Long: Michael, I'll start and Tom if to add anything. It cost a lot, I'll start with that, around the volumes, we - today, we can move out 220,000, 225,000 the next phase which will be completed, we feel really good about sometime in September will put us north of 260,000 and by the end of the year we'll be north of 280,000, possibly approaching 300,000 barrels a day. So really excited about getting that whole franchise through the end, Tom. There are you know, you got to kind of have the outlet and then the volumes come, but volumes are there. There's enormous reserves of NGLs, in the Marcellus and Utica there's nobody positioned to be able to get that out besides us every other [technical difficulty] kind of pull. And so we do have the opportunity to expand, we'll be able to move as we said about 280,000 to 300,000. But we can expand at 450,000 by pumps. We also have enormous capability to increase our chilling and storage on the acreage we own there at Marcus Hook and also have enormous capabilities expanding our dock capacity. So we're extremely well situated to handle and to be the pipeline and across that you know provider of choice for all the barrels out of that basin and we're pretty excited that we're almost there.\nMichael Blum: Got it, thank you. My other question was just on the Permian. Clearly there's a lot of excess crude pipeline out of the Permian right now. And it seems like there will be need for a natural gas, another natural gas pipeline or expansion at some point in the next couple of years. Just wondering if that's something a potential conversion of a crude line to natural gas is something that you would all look at or do you feel like your crude line there are basically falling, they're not - it's not the best to use? Thanks.\nMackie McCrea: Mark, I think the best way we'll answer that is, there's nothing off the table. So we will continue to look at all of our pipeline assets to see if some other product would be more profitable and more efficient for our partnership. So, you know right now our team has done, as I mentioned earlier, a fabulous job of kind of recovering our volumes in short period of time this year. We have a group - a kind of a new group that's working diligently to continue the momentum. So we'll see how things go. No doubt, the crude pipeline industry is so good at this, it overbuilding and the crude, us and all of a sudden have overbuilt, but we feel pretty good where we're at, we wish spreads were a little bit lighter, but we will continue to analyze and look at every opportunity. As far as gas, you know, we've got the ability to move quite a bit of gas from West Texas, we have some of these contracts falling off in four or five years now, you know, some fairly significant volumes. So we welcome everybody to just look into expand - or look into secure a space in '24 or '25 I want a new pipeline, we certainly can accommodate a new pipeline, but also can accommodate with capacity that we'll have available as well today. So anyway, we'll continue to look at everything and whatever makes the most sense will convert it or keep it in that service.\nMichael Blum: Thanks, Mackie.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gabe Marine with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nGabe Moreen: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Someone beat me to the Panama question, so I want to ask that and I want to get out. But maybe I can ask about the Enable FTC saga here. And I think you're surprised they're getting so many requests. Just thinking from a bigger picture if you think the FTC may be raising the bar here a little bit on consolidation? I don't know whether it's an energy here just in general. Do you think that changes your approach at all to future M&A or consolidation within the sector, which I think as you mentioned in previous questions, too much capacity out there which I think we'd all agree is needed?\nMackie McCrea: Yeah, I can start and one of - then Tom can follow-up, I guess. But I don't know how to characterize it. I guess it could say, you know, we did a lot of looking at this as we were announcing it, and we just don't see any issues. There's so much competition out there. Everywhere we'll enable as pipelines, we really don't see any issues. So we were a little frustrated and disappointed with the second request. However, we do feel like we're working very well with the FTC. We're doing what they've asked or working with us around the timing. And so right now, I'd say we're pretty confident, as we said earlier, that we're going to provide them with everything that they've asked for. And that will - we'll be able to close in a not too distant future.\nTom Long: Hey, Gabe I'll chime in here, and this is Tom. We still feel very strong that consolidation is the right path to go in, in the Midstream space. And therefore we won't let our foot off the gas pedal here. We think there's a lot of good drivers to bringing, you know, bringing assets together a lot of optimization that can be done. So yeah, no plans to really led off on our efforts toward consolidation.\nGabe Moreen: Got it. Thanks, Mackie. Thanks, Tom. And maybe kind of a follow-up to that. You know, you didn't mention M&A related to that as sort of a capital allocation option. Although I assume it's still would be an option. I think there were some media reports about potentially being interested in going downstream and looking at petrochemicals. So I was wondering if you can maybe comment on those - on that. And then maybe also related to another deal where the FTC is interfered, there's some Intrastate gas pipelines out there. I was wondering if you know, those types of assets might be of interest, even if they don't appear to offer any synergies to existing asset base?\nTom Long: All right, well why don't I start off with the first part of your question and then [technical difficulty] to Mackie for the second part. We are very much interested in moving downstream. We think that's a natural fit. For all the things that we've talked about today, all the things that you've seen that we've been doing, we think it's the perfect situation to our natural situation, if you will, a natural path for us to go down to look downstream. So yes, we are continuing to have dialogue and it is something that we remain very interested in.\nGabe Moreen: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to hand it back to Tom Long for closing remarks.\nTom Long: As always, we appreciate all of you joining us today. Thank you for your support, and we look forward to talking to you in the near future.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Tom Long",
            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to the Energy Transfer's second quarter 2021 earnings call and thank you for joining us today. I'm also joined today by; Mackie McCrea and other members of our senior management team, who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully you saw our press release we issued earlier this afternoon, as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Security Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based on our current beliefs, as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us, and are discussed in more detail on our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30th, 2021, which we expect to be filed this Thursday, August the 5th. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow or DCF, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'd like to start today by looking at some of our second quarter highlights. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 billion and DCF attributable to the partners of ET as adjusted of $1.4 billion. Our excess cash flow after distributions was approximately $980 million. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of approximately $625 million after distributions of $414 million and growth capital of approximately $355 million. The increased results over the second quarter of 2020 were primarily due to higher earnings in the midstream, intrastate and NGL and refined product segments. Switching gears to an update on the acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners, which will provide increased scale in the Midcontinent and Ark-La-Tex regions and improved connectivity for our natural gas and NGL transportation customers. In May, the acquisition was approved by Enable unitholders, and the only remaining condition to closing is obtaining HSR clearance. The FTC has issued requests for additional information and documentary material, commonly known as Second Request, which extended the HSR waiting period. Energy Transfer and Enable are working diligently to provide the relevant information to the FTC, and have engaged in constructive dialogue with them throughout this process. We continue to believe that the FTC will grant unconditional clearance of the transaction and that we will close the transaction in the second half of 2021. I'll now walk you through recent developments on our major growth projects, and we'll start with our Cushing to Nederland pipeline. In early June, we commenced joint tariff service to provide crude oil transportation from our Cushing Terminal to our Nederland Terminal. This project also provides the capability to deliver Powder River and DJ Basin barrels to our Nederland Terminal, being an upstream connection with our White Cliffs pipeline. We are now capable of transporting approximately 65,000 barrels per day of oil from the DJ Basin and Cushing area to Nederland. And we're seeing a steady growth in volumes. The first phase of this project is fully contracted with a large majority of those contracts coming from third-party shippers. In addition to customer demand, we are moving forward with Phase II of this project, which will increase the capacity to 120,000 barrels per day. Phase II is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2022 and is underpinned by third-party commitments. Minimal capital spend is required for this project. Next, construction of the Ted Collins Link is progressing and we continue to expect it to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2021. Upon initial completion, this project will provide crude oil transportation up to 150,000 barrels per day from West Texas and Nederland to our Houston Terminal, which can be expanded to 300,000 barrels per day. Now, looking to Dakota Access in May, the DC District Court denied the plaintiff's motion for an injunction to shut down Dakota Access, and thereafter dismissed the plaintiffs' lawsuit against the Army Corps. We continue to cooperate with the Army Corps in their preparation of the Environmental Impact Statement. We recently placed the next phase of incremental capacity for the Bakken Pipeline Optimization project into service, which is supported by minimum volume commitment from long-term customers. With completion of this phase of the optimization, Dakota Access now has the ability to flow approximately 750,000 barrels per day. Let's take a look at our Mariner East System. Second quarter 2021, NGL volumes through the Mariner East Pipeline system increased approximately 15% over the second quarter of 2020. Our Pennsylvania Access Project, which will allow refined products to flow from the Midwest supply regions into Pennsylvania, New York and other markets in the northeast is ready for service when markets dictate. We now expect the next significant phase of the Mariner East project to be in service in the third quarter of 2021 and the final phase of the Mariner East Pipeline is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Today, we are seeing demand exceed our current throughput capacity, which will allow us to begin utilizing additional capacity as our next phase of Mariner East is brought online later this year. Now, a brief update on our Nederland Terminal. During the second quarter, we completed the remaining expansions of our LPG facilities at Nederland. With the addition of our LPG and ethane expansions completed in late 2020 and early 2021, we are now capable of exporting approximately 700,000 barrels per day of NGLs from our Nederland Terminal. And when combined with our export capabilities for our Marcus Hook Terminal as well as our Mariner West Pipeline which exports more than 55,000 barrels per day of ethane to Canada, our total NGL export capacity is now over 1.1 million barrels per day, which is among the largest in the world. In fact, in May and June, we exported more NGLs than any other company or country in the world, with our daily throughput averaging over 850,000 barrels per day in June. We see an increasing need for products in markets beyond North America and we are striving to meet this need with our growing export business. At our expanded Nederland Terminal, volumes have continued to increase throughout the first half of this year, and we expect them to continue to increase throughout the remainder of 2021. And export volumes under our Orbit Ethane Export joint venture have seen strong growth. Through June, we loaded more than 9 million barrels of ethane out of this facility since placing it into service. Our Permian Bridge project, which will connect our gathering and processing assets in the Delaware Basin with our G&P assets in the Midland Basin is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. This project will allow us to move approximately 115,000 MCF per day of rich gas out of the Midland Basin and operate existing capacity more efficiently, while also providing access to additional takeaway options. This project is a good example of how we can preserve capital spend as we strategically look for ways to optimize, repurpose and expand our assets to provide us with competitive advantages. Lastly, in July, we announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with Republic of Panama to study the feasibility of jointly developing a proposed Trans-Panama Gateway Pipeline. The project would include terminals from the Pacific and Atlantic side of Panama to be connected by a pipeline for the receipt, transportation and export of LPGs to international markets. This project would provide relief for the increasing traffic of VLGCs through the Panama Canal and provide high volume Pacific loading optionality for customers in Asia. Now, for an update on our alternative energy activities, since we announced the creation of an Alternative Energy Group in February, we have continued to focus on renewable energy projects. In this regard, we have finalized a second long-term power purchase agreement for 120 megawatts of solar power that we expect to sign after receipt of regulatory approval. We're also continuing to explore several opportunities for solar and wind projects on our existing acreage in the northeast, and recently signed an agreement with a large utility company to jointly pursue solar and wind development on an Energy Transfer Tract in Kentucky. On the Carbon Capture front, our Marcus Hook project continues to look promising based on preliminary cost estimates, and design feasibility studies. This project would involve capturing CO2 from the flue gas and delivering it to customers that would produce food grade CO2. We're also pursuing two carbon projects near our systems, one involving the capture of CO2 from processing plants for use in an enhanced oil recovery, and the second for a carbon utilization project. We're also reviewing potential equity investments in a variety of projects including biogas and biodiesel projects that would qualify for low-carbon fuel standard credits, as long as they satisfy our economic return criteria. Our engineering and operations teams are constantly working to explore ways to reduce emissions across our facilities. And as we've discussed previously, our Dual Drive Compressors continue to win environmental awards for reducing CO2 emissions by utilizing their ability to run off electric power as well as natural gas. An important distinction for our Dual Drive Compressors versus all electric compressors is that, Dual Drive helps grid reliability as the electric demand can be volatile, especially in some remote areas of operations. In addition, we have significantly ramped up our exports of butane, propane and ethane for power generation. There in many cases displaces diesel, wood and animal waste, naphtha and other fuels which provide for a significant reduction of CO2 emissions. Finally, we expect to publish ESG data on the Energy Infrastructure Council and GPA Midstream ESG template in the near future and we're also continuing to address various inaccuracies in third-party ESG reports, due to a lack of effort by certain third-parties to discover and report accurate information. Now, let's take a closer look at our second quarter results. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $2.6 billion, compared to $2.4 billion for the second quarter of 2020. DCF attributable to the Partners as adjusted was $1.4 billion for the second quarter, compared to $1.3 billion for the second quarter of 2020. The increased results were primarily driven by improved earnings in the midstream, intrastate and NGL and refined product segments. On July 22nd, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.1525 per common unit or $0.61 on an annualized basis. This distribution will be paid on August 19th to unitholders of record as of the close of business on August the 6th. Turning to our results by segment, we'll start with the NGL refined products segment. Our adjusted EBITDA was $736 million, compared to $674 million the same period last year. This was primarily due to higher export volumes feeding our Nederland Terminal, increased throughput on our Mariner East Pipeline, and at our Marcus Hook Terminal as well as increased storage and fractionation and refinery services margin. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly-owned and joint venture pipelines increased to 1.7 million barrels per day, compared to 1.4 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to increase export volumes, feeding into our Nederland Terminal from the initiation of service on our propane and ethane export projects, as well as increased volumes on our Mariner East Pipeline system. On our fractionators, average fractionated volumes was 833,000 barrels per day, compared to 836,000 barrels per day for the second quarter of 2020. Since the end of the second quarter, transportation and fractionation volumes have continued to increase. For our Crude Oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $484 million, compared to $519 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to lower average tariff rates on our Texas Crude Oil Pipeline system, as well as decrease in our crude oil acquisition and marketing business. We did see higher volumes on our Bakken and Bayou Bridge pipelines, which have improved from the lows of last year. We have now seen the majority of the major contract roll offs on our Permian Express system and will look to capture better margins going forward as the market improves. For Midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $477 million, compared to $367 million for the second quarter of 2020. This was largely the result of favorable NGL and natural gas prices, as well as volume growth across most of our regions and the ramp up of recently completed assets in the northeast. Gathered gas volumes were 13.1 million MMBTUs per day, compared to 13 million MMBTUs per day for the same period last year, due to higher volumes in the Permian, Ark-La-Tex, South and North Texas regions as they continue to improve from lows same last year. Permian Basin volumes have remained strong and Midland inlet volumes continue to be at or near record highs. In our Intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $331 million, compared to $403 million for the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to contract expirations on Tiger and FEP, as well as a shipper bankruptcy on Tiger, partially offset by an increase in transported volumes on Rover. And for our Intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $224 million, compared to $187 million in the second quarter of last year. This was primarily due to demand volume ramp ups in the Permian, and an increase in retained fuel revenues, as well as a $39 million increase from revenues related to Winter Storm Uri. There is no doubt that Uri created much more demand for our pipeline and storage network, and we are seeing this reflected in incoming calls and discussions with existing and new customers who are looking to lock in firm transport and/or storage agreements. Now turning to our 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance. We continue to expect a full year adjusted EBITDA to be between $12.9 billion to $13.3 billion, excluding any contribution from the announced Enable acquisition. And moving to a growth capital update for the six months ended June 30th, 2021, Energy Transfer spent $715 million on organic growth projects, primarily in the NGL and refined products segment, excluding Sun and USA Compression CapEx. For full year 2021, we continue to expect growth capital expenditures to be approximately $1.6 billion primarily in the NGL and refined products, midstream and crude oil segments. We continue to focus on aligning capital outlay with customer needs and remain disciplined in regard to all spending. Any new projects are primarily expected to be focused on improving optionality around our existing assets. And for 2022 and 2023, we continue to expect spend of approximately $500 million to $700 million per year. Now looking briefly at our liquidity position. As of June 30th, 2021, total available liquidity under our revolving credit facility was approximately $5 billion and our leverage ratio was 3.14 for our credit facility. During the second quarter, we utilized cash from operations and proceeds from a $900 million Series H preferred unit offering to reduce our outstanding debt by approximately $1.5 billion. And year-to-date, we have reduced our long-term debt by $5.2 billion. And in May of this year, S&P and Moody's affirmed our credit ratings of BBB minus and Baa3, respectively, and both revise our outlook to stable from negative. In addition, in April, we removed a layer of organizational complexity with the roll up of Energy Transfer Operating Company into Energy Transfer. During the second quarter, we continue to see improved fundamentals and the completion of our NGL expansions at Nederland has positioned us as one of the leading exporters of NGLs in the world. We expect our LPG and ethane export projects at our Nederland Terminal to further ramp up throughout the rest of this year. Capital discipline and deleveraging continue to be among our top priorities, and we continue to pay down debt in the second quarter. We've remained committed to maintaining and improving our investment grade rating. And we will look to return additional capital for unitholders in the form of unit buybacks and/or distribution increases with the mix dependent upon our analysis of market conditions at the time. We also continue to explore development of alternative energy projects and opportunities to reduce our environmental footprint, some of which are looking very promising, and we hope to be announcing additional projects shortly. Operator, please open the lineup for our first question? Good afternoon, Shneur and definitely appreciate the question here. As you know, we got the four different options that we look at. We're very excited that we've been able to pay off as much as we have this year with the $5.2 billion. We're still not providing guidance as to exactly timing from that standpoint, but I will say that the debt has clearly been our focus at this point, but I will say the distribution and/or unit buybacks as well as the CapEx, we're going to continue to look at it from an economic standpoint as to what makes sense. But it's great to be in this position and have this question right now. So, keep in mind that, not putting that in any one order, but we clearly had the debt as the top. And we've made great progress on that. So you can appreciate the distribution and unit buyback as we've worked diligently to stay very disciplined on the CapEx front. Listen, I'll start off with it. Good afternoon, Jeremy. We think our guidance is really down the middle of the fairway, you know, the $12.9 billion to $13.3 billion. And you know, you're right, we've had a great start to the year with the first six months. But when you really look at it, and you kind of look at the forward curves that we've used for the pricing, which have stayed right in line with that for all the various commodities. And you've heard Mackie talk a lot about the volumes, et cetera. That's the reason why we've kept the range in a little bit wider. But once again, we feel very good about this. We don't really feel like there's any headwinds on this. We're very excited about the next - the last half of the year, next two quarters. And I don't know I'm looking to Mackie to see if he'd like to add anything more to the answer here. But we do feel very good. We do not see headwinds. Michael, I'll start and Tom if to add anything. It cost a lot, I'll start with that, around the volumes, we - today, we can move out 220,000, 225,000 the next phase which will be completed, we feel really good about sometime in September will put us north of 260,000 and by the end of the year we'll be north of 280,000, possibly approaching 300,000 barrels a day. So really excited about getting that whole franchise through the end, Tom. There are you know, you got to kind of have the outlet and then the volumes come, but volumes are there. There's enormous reserves of NGLs, in the Marcellus and Utica there's nobody positioned to be able to get that out besides us every other [technical difficulty] kind of pull. And so we do have the opportunity to expand, we'll be able to move as we said about 280,000 to 300,000. But we can expand at 450,000 by pumps. We also have enormous capability to increase our chilling and storage on the acreage we own there at Marcus Hook and also have enormous capabilities expanding our dock capacity. So we're extremely well situated to handle and to be the pipeline and across that you know provider of choice for all the barrels out of that basin and we're pretty excited that we're almost there. Hey, Gabe I'll chime in here, and this is Tom. We still feel very strong that consolidation is the right path to go in, in the Midstream space. And therefore we won't let our foot off the gas pedal here. We think there's a lot of good drivers to bringing, you know, bringing assets together a lot of optimization that can be done. So yeah, no plans to really led off on our efforts toward consolidation. All right, well why don't I start off with the first part of your question and then [technical difficulty] to Mackie for the second part. We are very much interested in moving downstream. We think that's a natural fit. For all the things that we've talked about today, all the things that you've seen that we've been doing, we think it's the perfect situation to our natural situation, if you will, a natural path for us to go down to look downstream. So yes, we are continuing to have dialogue and it is something that we remain very interested in. As always, we appreciate all of you joining us today. Thank you for your support, and we look forward to talking to you in the near future."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Mackie McCrea",
            "content": "Yeah, Shneur, this is Mackie. As we have expressed as Tom Mason and his team are leading, we're looking at a lot of stuff around ESG and as we have said anything that makes sense, economic sense on rates of return, we're going to pursue it. Right now, there's really nothing on the horizon that has any kind of significant material, capital costs to it that we're looking at any serious way. For example, we made the announcements on the silver front, we're really - we're not investing anything, we're just a buyer of inexpensive electricity. Some of these other Carbon Capture projects that we're looking at going to require a lot of capital, and/or the Partner that we're teaming up with will provide more of the capital. So right now, we don't have really anything in there materially. And we even have a little bit of a cushion to help grow our Midstream business, as these rigs begin and then have started moving in and as far to gather opportunities and things like that. So no, we don't have much in there at all from a cost standpoint for ESG project. This is Mackie, again. Yes, we have seen for August, this significant increase in nominations and we're seeing the flows begin. And also, yes, to your question around MBC, the MBC on the optimization commitment did kick in on August 1st. We're seeing the bottoms. As you mentioned, there's one small one of the PP over next year or the end of this year, but now we're kind of, you know, 10 years passed by pretty quickly. And we are, but we're seeing so much growth around some of these pipelines in North Louisiana and excited about being able to move a lot of that gas out really both ways, but also adding back in the Texas into our Intrastate system. So we believe we've seen the bottom of the barrel there, and we'll see more growth. A quick example around Intrastates we recently have sold out the vast majority of our capacity from West Texas to California through our DW system for the next two years at Max tariff rate, not sure why we had a company come in that believes the value for gas in California must be on the way up. So we're seeing some positives. And we've said that a while around TransWestern well, where when contracts roll off, we actually add new contracts at higher fee. So, there are some pluses also the Intrastate's more seasonal. This is not a - the second quarter's not a high throughput necessarily for our Intrastate system. But we do pretty much the upside for here. Yeah, this is Mackie again. That's correct. We are responding to their second request, we're a little surprised. We thought that, that after extending it 30 more days from initial 30 days that we would resolve all their questions and issues. But we remain confident that we will be closing in the not too distant future. And we've been and we'll continue to be very cooperative with FTC. And feel real good about getting the finish line sooner than later. Yeah, this is Mackie, again. Well actually the segment has been turned around. We give you an example. On majority of our pipelines, we were at about 2.5 million barrels a day, pre-pandemic, and we're back up to about 50,000 barrels less than that. So our volumes have recovered almost 95% to 90% from where they were, these are the volumes across Texas and at the Bakken. So a lot of really good things happen to crude as far as volumes, we can really control the spreads, the spreads per part of the quarter widened out a little bit, they've narrowed, they kind of go back and forth, it's clearly a fact there's too much crude capacity across Texas. So we continue to look at repurposing things and also providing more value than just point A to point B through our systems. But our Crude team has done a fantastic job. Just started in January till now we've added about 500,000 to 600,000 barrels a day of crude cross all - we didn't have at the beginning of this year, albeit at much tighter spreads and margins than what we saw a year, a year and a half ago. But we can only control what we can gather and transport for customers. And the spread will be where they'll be. So and I guess final out are to complete the question. Yeah, we feel like we're kind of at the bottom, we think that we're going to continue to keep our volumes where they are or grow, we of course are, have kicked in the NBCs for optimization project. That's new revenues that are coming in. So, similar to Intrastate, which you know the two at most struggling segments, we all hit on. All the other, please ask about. We're pretty excited about those now and the future. But anyway, we similar to Intrastate, we feel like we've been at the bottom and everything's kind of up from here. It's Mackie again. We are extremely excited. The pandemic really put a kind of a pause on not only LPG and ethane, but also crude, it kind of slowed everything down and everything is or by now the economy around the world, especially in the US, but China's coming back. We have pages of companies that we're talking to different sizes from both ethane and LPG expansion projects. We are - we very much expect over the next year, if not sooner, within six months to get to FID on another expansion, whether it's at Marcus Hook or at The Nederland that we've always kind of been proud of the fact that we're the only company in the country that can export both from the Gulf Coast and from Nederland infrastructure - I mean, Gulf Coast and from Marcus Hook. And we're able to structure and negotiate these deals with a lot of these Chinese companies and give them that option, but also give us an option, which makes our assets more reliable and gives both of those terminals significant benefits. So that's a longwinded answer too. Yes, it's picked up in a big way. We're in conversations with numerous companies in China as well as many others around the world. And we couldn't be more excited about what we've done from an export build out capacity for ethane and LPG and crude oil. For that matter and where the future is going to be to around the world, we're exceptionally well situated to meet the market demands in future. Yeah, we're really excited about that. What a great group of people, everybody we've met with there, and the government has been just a pleasure to work with. And we're really excited about where all that's gone. What do we bring to the table, if you look back over just the last, not that many years, we've gone from kind of nothing to now as you heard on Tom's remarks, the export NGLs in the world? So that kind of says something, just made a statement about the two terminals that we have. And what this terminal provide is the Country of Panama to benefit from moving barrels that are much in need throughout the world, to the Pacific side of their country and become a major hub for the Asian markets as well as for the South American market. So we bring the expertise, we bring - we will be able to bring the barrels, we're going to be able to operate at really in effect four terminals, a hub on the Atlantic side, Pacific side and the two that we have today. So we're very excited. As you mentioned in the very early part of this, we look forward to where this is going. And hopefully getting the FID in a not too distant future. Yeah, I guess what I'll add is, I kind of joked a minute ago about on the top, no questions yet around the Midstream or Intrastate or NGLs. But we're so excited about what we're seeing, we've said that last time, the rigs are moving in, they're moving in in a big way. We've seen our volumes in our Midstream just in the first quarter of this year to the second quarter of this year go up by 8%. And if you look at just the Permian alone, it's up 15%. So we're extremely well situated to where these rigs are, as everybody knows, you bring the gas to the plant and connect to these plants are residue an Intrastate systems and our NGL systems. So if you look at what kind of feeding into our NGL system, both our Lone Star Pipelines and our Mont Belvieu fracks. We're now fracking about 900 - a little over 900,000 barrels a day. If you look back a year ago, we first brought on frack seven, I think we did about what 920,000 or 930,000 barrels was our high. But that's a little misleading, because when we brought on fracks, we weighed a bunch NGLs and laggards and storage. So we're kind of feeding from the field, from the plant plus, out of storage. It's different today. We're filling of our fracks today from the field, from the tailgate of all the plants. In fact, we're actually injecting some raw grade into storage. So we, the NGL segment is just unbelievably exciting. We can't say enough about our team and all the effort we put together at the end of 2020, beginning of '21 around getting the Orbit project completed online and finalizing all this LPG growth and buoy, are we incredibly well situated benefit from that all the way from the wellhead through the fracks and then on to the export market. So pretty excited about that. And that'll kind of help feed into our EBITDA the last half of the year. This is Mackie, again. Well, first thing I'll say is that, if you look kind of along the Gulf Coast, there's nobody that has more pipelines of all different sorts than us. So, as we look to repurpose pipelines, if there's opportunities to repurpose into lube, CO2 or flue gas from some of these, but industry is along the coast, there's nobody probably better situated than us. But we're not really out chasing, say, a CO2 sequestration project down in the Gulf or out in Timbuktu, what we're doing is looking at projects that are related to our assets, and doing what we can to work with third-parties to figure out a way to either capture that or to process it or wherever the case may be. So, as I mentioned earlier, Tom Mason put a great team together, we're evaluating numerous opportunities and we'll certainly move forward on those that make good economic sense. Mark, I think the best way we'll answer that is, there's nothing off the table. So we will continue to look at all of our pipeline assets to see if some other product would be more profitable and more efficient for our partnership. So, you know right now our team has done, as I mentioned earlier, a fabulous job of kind of recovering our volumes in short period of time this year. We have a group - a kind of a new group that's working diligently to continue the momentum. So we'll see how things go. No doubt, the crude pipeline industry is so good at this, it overbuilding and the crude, us and all of a sudden have overbuilt, but we feel pretty good where we're at, we wish spreads were a little bit lighter, but we will continue to analyze and look at every opportunity. As far as gas, you know, we've got the ability to move quite a bit of gas from West Texas, we have some of these contracts falling off in four or five years now, you know, some fairly significant volumes. So we welcome everybody to just look into expand - or look into secure a space in '24 or '25 I want a new pipeline, we certainly can accommodate a new pipeline, but also can accommodate with capacity that we'll have available as well today. So anyway, we'll continue to look at everything and whatever makes the most sense will convert it or keep it in that service. Yeah, I can start and one of - then Tom can follow-up, I guess. But I don't know how to characterize it. I guess it could say, you know, we did a lot of looking at this as we were announcing it, and we just don't see any issues. There's so much competition out there. Everywhere we'll enable as pipelines, we really don't see any issues. So we were a little frustrated and disappointed with the second request. However, we do feel like we're working very well with the FTC. We're doing what they've asked or working with us around the timing. And so right now, I'd say we're pretty confident, as we said earlier, that we're going to provide them with everything that they've asked for. And that will - we'll be able to close in a not too distant future."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Rebecca and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Enable Midstream First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Thank you. Mr. Matt Beasley, you may begin your conference.\nMatt Beasley: Thank you and good morning everyone. Presenting on this morning's call are Rod Sailor, our President and CEO; and John Laws, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we issued our earnings press release and filed our Form 10-Q with the SEC. Our earnings press release, Form 10-Q filing, and the presentation that accompanies this call are all available in the Investor Relations section of our website. We will also be posting a replay of today's call to the site. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws. Actual results could differ materially from our projections and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ from projections can be found in our SEC filings. We will also be referencing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, which we have reconciled to the nearest GAAP measures in the appendix of today's presentation. We invite you to review the disclaimers in this presentation for both forward-looking statements including statements about our pending merger with Energy Transfer and non-GAAP financial measures. In light of the pending proposed merger with Energy Transfer, we do not plan to take questions at the end of today's call. The Form S-4 for this transaction has been filed which includes the detailed overview of the transaction and a question-and-answer section. Now, we'll get started and I will turn the call over to Rod Sailor.\nRod Sailor: Thanks Matt. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I will begin my remarks on slide 4 with an update on our pending merger with Energy Transfer. In early April, the SEC declared effective the Form S-4 registration statement filed in connection with the merger and our two sponsors, CenterPoint and OG&E have delivered written consents to approve the merger. While these consents are sufficient to approve the transaction, all unit holders as of the record date have the opportunity to make their voices heard by returning their written consents before the consent deadline. Teams from both companies have been hard at work planning for a seamless integration and we expect the transaction to close mid-year this year subject to certain conditions, including Hart Scott Rodino Act clearance. We believe the proposed merger with Energy Transfer will provide significant benefits for our unitholders. The combination of complementary assets provide scope and scale with basin, commodity and customer diversity which have been key elements of Enable\u2019s long-term strategic goals. This all equity transaction provides tax efficiency for unitholders and allows our unitholders to participate in the upside potential as the integration opportunities are realized. Turning to the next slide, I would like to cover a few recent highlights. Enable reported strong first quarter 2021 results due to higher commodity prices, asset optimization and increased billings related to winter storm Uri. DCF exceeded declared distributions to comment unitholders by $189 million for the first quarter of 2021 fully funding expansion capital expenditures for the quarter. The quarter\u2019s strong results improved our key debt-to-EBITDA leverage metric and lowered our total debt levels. I am also pleased to report that substantially all production impacted by winter storm Uri is now back online. And as a result, our natural gas gathered volumes in March were higher than the average volumes for the quarter. We have made significant progress on our Gulf run pipeline project, including recently locking in all of the pipe pricing at favorable levels through our strategic sourcing efforts. Our plan is to build a 42-inch diameter pipeline with a capacity of approximately 1.7 Bcf per day, and it provides significant upside potential from capacity sales to other shippers. Finally, employees have returned to our office locations on a reduced capacity basis. And we continue to take steps to ensure the safety of all of our employees, customers and communities. Moving to the next slide, I will now cover accomplishments in our Transportation and Storage segment. During the first quarter, we contracted or extended over 250,000 dekatherms per day of firm fee-based transportation capacity at a volume weighted contract life of over four years. We recently completed a successful open season for storage capacity on our Enable Oklahoma Intrastate Transmission system achieving higher rates than we anticipated. Finally, I am pleased to announce the EGT's mass project went into service April 1, as planned. This project is designed to deliver gas from Oklahoma to delivery points with access to emerging Gulf Coast markets and growing demand markets in the southeast and is underpinned by a firm five year commitment for 100,000, dekatherms per day. Turning to our Gulf Run project, on the next slide as I mentioned in my opening remarks, our sourcing efforts have allowed us to achieve pipe pricing for the 42 inch project scope at a favorable level relative to the market. The construction contractor bidding process is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2021 and we anticipate placing the project into service in late 2022 subject to FERC approval. Turning to the Gathering and Processing highlights on the next slide. As I previously mentioned, substantially all production impacted by winter storm Uri is now back online and as a result, we saw volumes in March that were higher than the quarter average. Strong rig activity and well results drove total Haynesville natural gas volumes to a record high in April. According to S&P Global Platts Analytics, and Enable\u2019s assets are well positioned to benefit from the growing sources of demand in the region, and from Southeast and Gulf Coast markets. Producer activity continues around our footprint with 10 rigs currently drilling wells expected to be connected to our gathering systems. And there are currently 181 duct wells behind our systems, which provide an inventory of wells producers can complete without investing additional drilling capital. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss our first quarter results.\nJohn Laws: Thank you, Rod and good morning everyone. I will now cover a few of our key operational and financial metrics for the quarter. As always, you can find a more detailed and comprehensive overview of our financial and operational results in our first quarter earnings release and in our 10-Q, both of which were released earlier this morning. Turning to our operational performance overview slide. Our natural gas gathered, processed, transported and crude oil and condensate gathered volumes saw decreases compared to the first quarter of 2020, primarily as a result of lower producer activity and the weather related volume curtailments and production freeze offs from winter storm Uri. Looking at our financial results on the next slide, Uri certainly brought with it some operational challenges, but as Rod indicated earlier, our integrated platform of gathering and processing and transportation and storage assets performed very well together and drove higher revenues, gross margin, net income, adjusted EBITDA and DCF for the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. And of course I'd be remiss if I did not mention that none of these results would have been achieved if it were not for the tireless dedication of our employees in the field and in the office, who worked long hours through inclement weather to maintain our operations. The increases in our revenues and gross margin were primarily a result of higher commodity prices, asset optimization, and increased billings related to winter storm, Uri, offset by the lower gathering and processing volumes I mentioned earlier, and some unfavorable impacts associated with the changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives. Net income benefited from lower O&M expenses, which was driven by our continued focus on cost discipline, including the benefit of actions taken in prior periods and lower interest expense, as well as the absence of non-cash impairments in the first quarter of 2021 when compared to $28 million of impairments for the first quarter of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF were up 15% and 22%, respectively, and provided strong cash flow to fully cover our distributions and expansion capital program and improve our leverage profile. One item of note is that during the quarter, the calculation for the rate of distribution on Enable\u2019s series A preferred units converted from a fixed annual rate of 10% to an annualized floating rate based on the sum of a three month LIBOR rate, plus 8.5%. After considering the distributions declared, which reflected a blended fixed and floating rate of distribution on the Series A preferred units and a distribution on common units consistent with the prior calendar quarter, Enable\u2019s first quarter distributable cash flow exceeded common unit distributions declared by $189 million, generating a distribution coverage ratio of 3.63 times for the quarter. At the same time, our total debt to our trailing 12-months adjusted EBITDA improved from 4.27 at the end of 2020 to 4.06, as of the end of the first quarter of 2021. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Rod for his closing remarks.\nRod Sailor: Thanks, John. And thanks to everyone for participating in our call today. Let me also thank all of our employees for the tremendous efforts and accomplishments during the storm and the job they continue to do day in and day out to provide safe and reliable services to our customers and communities. Please stay safe and have a good day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Energy Transfer Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Long, Co-CEO. Please go ahead.\nTom Long: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon everyone and welcome to the Energy Transfer fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team, who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs, as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us, and are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-K for the full year ended December 31, 2022, which we expect to file this Friday, February 17. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'd like to start today by going over our financial results. For full year 2022, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $13.1 billion, which reflects continued growth over 2021 and is a partnership record. DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, was $7.4 billion, which resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $4.4 billion. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of approximately $2.4 billion, after distributions of $3.1 billion and growth capital of approximately $1.9 billion. Operationally, we moved record volumes across all of our segments for the year ended 2022, which included record volumes on our legacy midstream, intrastate and NGL transport systems as well as through our fractionators at Mont Belvieu. In addition, we exported a record amount of NGLs out of our Nederland Terminal in 2022, and we expect our exports to continue to grow into 2023. Looking at our fourth quarter 2022 results, we were pleased to report another strong quarter during which we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $3.4 billion, which was up more than 20% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. DCF attributable to the partners, as adjusted, was $1.9 billion compared to $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $965 million. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of approximately $360 million after distributions of $945 million and growth capital of approximately $605 million. On January 25, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.305 per common unit or $1.22 on an annualized basis. This distribution represents a 75% increase over the fourth quarter of 2021 and is a 15% increase over the third quarter of 2022. With this recent increase, we have now restored our distribution level to where it was in the first half of 2020. We greatly appreciate our equity investors, who have supported us over the last two plus years as we have diligently worked to lower our leverage and improve the financial stability of the partnership. This will allow us to better capitalize on opportunities that will lead to the future success for the partnership and all of our stakeholders. Future distribution increases will be evaluated on an annual basis while balancing energy transfers, leverage targets, growth opportunities and potential unit buybacks. As of December 31, 2022, the total available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities was approximately $4.2 billion. And while we are not speaking directly for the rating agencies, based on our internal calculations, we are now within the 4 to 4.5 target leverage ratio range based on our calculations of the rating agencies leverage ratios. Now turning to our results by segment for the fourth quarter, I'll start with NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was $928 million compared to $739 million for the same period last year. This change was primarily due to higher transportation, fractionation and terminal services margins and the recognition of gains on hedged NGL inventory. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines increased to a record 2 million barrels per day compared to 1.9 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes from the Permian and Eagle Ford regions as well as on our NGL pipelines that deliver into our Nederland Terminal. And our average fractionated volumes set a new partnership record, averaging 962,000 barrels per day compared to 895,000 barrels per day for the fourth quarter of 2021. In fact, during the fourth quarter of 2022, single day fractionation throughput at Mont Belvieu reached more than 1 million barrels for the first time in our partnership's history. NGL export volumes significantly exceeded fourth quarter and full year 2021 exports, driven by record ethane and LPG exports out of our Nederland Terminal. This was primarily driven by the second tranche of satellites contract going into effect on July 1, which doubled the volume commitments from the initial term. In 2022, we loaded nearly 43 million barrels of ethane out of Nederland. And for full year 2023, we expect to load more than 60 million barrels. In total, we continue to export more NGLs than any other company or country with our percentage of worldwide NGL exports remaining at approximately 20% of the world market. For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $632 million compared to $547 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to increased throughput and all of our operating regions as well as the acquisition of the Enable assets in December of 2021 and the Woodford Express assets in September of 2022. Gathered gas volumes were at a record 19.4 million MMBtus per day compared to 14.8 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year. Excluding Enable and Woodford Express, gathered gas volumes on our legacy assets were up 8% over the same period last year. For our crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $571 million compared to $533 million for the same period last year. These results were driven by improved performance on our Texas crude pipeline system, increased throughput at our Gulf Coast terminals, stronger refinery utilization and higher export demand as well as the addition of the Enable assets in December of 2021. Crude oil transportation volumes increased to 4.3 million barrels per day compared to 3.8 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This was driven by higher volumes on our Texas pipeline systems and on the Bayou Bridge pipeline, the addition of the Enable assets as well as placing the Ted Collins Link and Cushing South pipelines into service. In our interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $494 million compared to $397 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to increased transportation revenue related to higher contracted volumes and rates on several of our pipelines as well as the addition of the Enable interstate assets. Volumes increased 33% over the same period last year and utilization on many of our interstate pipelines, including Trunkline, Tiger, FGT, Southeast Supply Header and Rover remains high. And for our intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $433 million compared to $274 million in the fourth quarter of last year. This was primarily due to higher pipeline and storage optimization opportunities, higher fees on assets in the Haynesville as well as the addition of the Enable assets. Utilization of our HPL System remains strong due to the increased demand for our gas takeaway and our Rigs pipeline system continues to flow at or near capacity due to increased activity in the Haynesville. Now looking at recent developments on our ongoing growth projects. I'll start with an update on our Lake Charles LNG project. Global demand for LNG remained strong as energy security has emerged as a key theme for LNG. In addition, U.S. natural gas producers have shown increased interest in committing a portion of their production to long-term sales arrangements at European and Asian natural gas or LNG index prices. We view these two factors as key drivers towards securing additional long-term LNG offtake agreements. The LNG market along the Gulf Coast is currently extremely competitive. Given this level of competition, it is taking us longer to reach FID than originally expected, but we are optimistic that we will bring this project to FID. We continue making progress on all aspects of the project and are working hard to sign up more customers, and we'll share additional information as it becomes available. Turning to our Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals, in November 2022 we completed dredging at Marcus Hook to increase the depth at one of our docks to 42 feet, which will allow us to fully load VLECs at this dock going forward. In addition, we recently completed a FEED study on a potential expansion project at our Nederland Terminal, which would provide us with additional NGL export capacity. We are currently evaluating next steps and hope to provide more details on this opportunity in the near future. We also expect to approve an optimization project at Marcus Hook that would add incremental ethane refrigeration and storage capacity. NGL demand, both in the U.S. as well as from overseas customers continues to increase. We are firm believers that there will be significant growth in international demand for many years to come. Next, construction of our Frac VIII continues as scheduled, and we expect it to be in service in the third quarter of 2023. This addition will bring our total Mont Belvieu fractionation capacity to approximately 1.15 million barrels per day. Also during the fourth quarter, we brought a new storage cavern online at Mont Belvieu with a capacity of approximately 3 million barrels, which supports our ongoing purity growth at the fracs as well as growth at our docks in Nederland. This brings our total underground NGL storage capacity at Mont Belvieu to approximately 60 million barrels. Out in the Permian, in December, we placed our 200 million cubic foot per day Grey Wolf processing plant into service, and it is already ramping up more quickly than anticipated. As a reminder, this plant, which is located in the Delaware Basin, is supported by new commitments and growth from existing customer contracts. Construction continues on the Bear plant, our eighth 200 million cubic foot per day processing plant in the Delaware Basin. This plant remains on schedule to be in service in the second quarter of 2023. In addition, we continue to evaluate the necessity and potential timing of adding another processing plant in the region. Regarding Permian takeaway, we also recently completed modernization and debottlenecking work on our Oasis pipeline, which added at least an incremental 60,000 Mcf per day of takeaway capacity out of the Permian Basin. We also placed the Gulf Run pipeline into service in December. Gulf Run, which is a 42-inch interstate natural gas pipeline with 1.65 Bcf per day of capacity, provides natural gas transportation between our upstream pipeline network and from the Haynesville Shale for delivery to the Gulf Coast connecting some of the most prolific natural gas producing regions in the U.S. with the LNG export market as well as many markets along the Gulf Coast. It is backed by a 20-year commitment for 1.1 Bcf per day from Golden Pass LNG, and we recently concluded a non-binding open season on Gulf Run due to growing producer demand. We were pleased with the results of the open season and customer discussions are ongoing, which will likely necessitate additional facilities beyond the initial design of 1.65 Bcf per day. We are already utilizing a significant portion of Zone 1 capacity on Gulf Run, and we have added additional customer commitments through Zone 2, which is being delivered into our Trunkline pipeline. In addition to these ongoing projects, we continue to evaluate and have customer discussions regarding a number of other projects that are over the long-term could provide strong returns and significant upside to our business. We remain optimistic that we can bring these projects to FID and look forward to sharing any significant updates on these potential projects at the appropriate timing. On the alternative energy front, we continue to make progress on our carbon capture and storage project with CapturePoint. That is related to our North Louisiana processing plants. The Class VI permit for the sequestration side was filed by CapturePoint with the EPA in June of 2022. We also recently executed a letter of intent with Oxy related to Oxy's Magnolia hub in Allen Parish, Louisiana, north of the Lake Charles Industrial Complex. Pursuant to the letter of intent, Energy Transfer and Oxy are working together to obtain long-term commitments of CO2 from the industrial customers in the Lake Charles, Louisiana area. If this project reaches FID, Energy Transfer would construct a CO2 pipeline to connect the customers to Oxy's sequestration site in Allen Parish, Louisiana. Oxy filed applications with the EPA for 2 Class 6 injection wells in 2021. Oxy is a leader in the CCS sector, and we're pleased to be working with them to make this project successful. In addition, we're evaluating numerous opportunities to capture and either utilize or store the CO2 across our systems. Now looking at our growth capital spend for the full year of December 31, 2022. Energy Transfer spent approximately $1.9 billion on organic growth projects, primarily in the midstream, interstate and NGL and refined products segments, excluding SUN and USA Compression CapEx. For full year 2023, we expect growth capital expenditures to be between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, which will be spent primarily in the midstream NGL and refined products and interstate segments. This capital includes projects that will address growing demand like Frac VIII at Mont Belvieu, the Bear processing plant in the Permian Basin, compression and optimization projects on existing pipelines, new treating capacity in the Haynesville, additional gathering and compression build-out in the Permian, improved efficiencies and emission reduction work, as well as preliminary spend related to carbon capture projects. In addition, this number does include a small amount of capital that was pushed from 2022 into 2023 due to project in-service timing needs. A significant amount of our 2023 capital spend is comprised of projects that are expected to be online and contributing cash flow before the end of 2023 at very attractive returns. Now for our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance, given the continued domestic and international demand for our products and services, the ability of our base business to operate through various market cycles as well as our market outlook for the year, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between $12.9 billion and $13.3 billion. Our business continues to provide stable cash flows and opportunities for optimization and expansion. And in 2023, we expect utilization in all of our core segments to increase. With the current forward curve for commodity prices and spreads, our guidance does not assume the same upside benefits from pricing and spreads that we experienced in 2022. As a result of our commitment to strengthening our balance sheet throughout 2022, we entered 2023 in a much stronger financial position, and we expect to maintain our leverage target range of 4 to 4.5 times. We will continue to place emphasis on strategically allocated cash flow in a manner that best positions us to further improve our financial flexibility and leverage, invest in high-returning growth projects and return value to unitholders. We remain bullish about the future of our industry and the growing worldwide demand for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and refined products. As we look for additional ways to address existing and new demand for our products, we will continue to pursue strategic growth projects that enhance our existing asset base and generate attractive returns as part of our capital allocation strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line, up for our first question.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTom Long: Jeremy you are being muted.\nJeremy Tonet: Pardon me.\nOperator: Jeremy your line is now live.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. \nTom Long: Hi, good afternoon.\nJeremy Tonet: That's helpful to be unmuted. Thank you. Maybe just kind of start off here, I want to go to the Permian and kind of get high-level thoughts as you see it with regards to basin logistic needs and Permian gas takeaway has been in focus. And we've seen volatility in Waha prices. I'm just wondering what that means for ET this year, what's kind of embedded to the guidance. But more so, I guess, longer term, how you see basin egress evolving and future opportunities for ET along these lines, particularly as it relates to possible timing for Warrior development?\nMackie McCrea: Jeremy, this is Mackie. Yes, when we think about the Permian Basin, probably one of the most prolific basins in the world. We love looking at the maps because, as you know, we have inter and intra state pipelines come in every direction and out of that area including three NGL pipelines and then, of course, some significant pipeline capacity across the state. As you know, everybody knows on this call, there has been a significant growth in natural gas volumes out of the Permian. There has been expansions. There continue to be compression expansions on the 42-inch getting built. And then about this time last year, we kicked off Warrior and started getting some momentum and we continue to have momentum. So we don't know when the next project will be announced coming out of the Permian Basin, we do believe it will be ours when it happens. Just a quick update on those volumes. We have contracted about 25% to 30% of what we need to get to FID on Warrior. We're talking to another at least 50% to 60% of what would be needed. It is a slow process based on what you just said, when you've got negative spreads where Waha has been higher than Katie and or you've got a few cents spread. It's hard to get deals done. But certainly, over the next three to four years on top of what's already been expanded and built, there will need to be another line and if there is one, we do believe it will be ours.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's really helpful. And then kind of looking at the other side gas Downstream, significant LNG development coming in the Gulf Coast, particularly in Louisiana over the balance of the decade here and it seems like you guys have quite the pipeline positioning in Louisiana there to support that. But just wondering, it seems like these exporters are looking for diversity of supply beyond the Haynesville and also maybe kind of more connectivity into Texas and into the Permian. Just wondering how you see that unfolding over time and what opportunities that could present to ET?\nMackie McCrea: Yes, just a common theme I'd say throughout this on every question. I think just asked, golly look at a pipeline map and look at what energy transport can do on moving volumes to Gulf Coast, especially to Louisiana, after buying [indiscernible] we now have three \u2013 I'm sorry, four 42-inch pipes in North Louisiana. We have connections from Carthage to Perryville and out to Gulf Run we connect almost to the Gulf Coast and other pipelines. So we're so well positioned both to feed our own LNG project, should we get that to FID, but regardless even our results, we're seeing volumes find their way from North Marcellus to [indiscernible] and Trunkline and through all of our pipeline system to the Gulf Coast already to see the growing demand for LNG. So we're so well positioned and pretty excited about the full utilization and even expansions of our systems across the South.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's really helpful. I\u2019ll leave it there, thanks.\nMackie McCrea: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Reynolds with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrian Reynolds: Hi, good afternoon everyone. Maybe to start off on just the guidance, it implies kind of limited growth year-over-year based off of the presentation, where you put out some puts and takes with commodity declines offset by volume growth. So I was just curious if you could perhaps just unpack the base assumptions maybe around the commodity deck and then as well, just a high-level view on Permian and Haynesville growth to help us square the guidance. Thanks.\nTom Long: Hi, you bet, Brian. This is Tom Long. Really, when you look at 2022, obviously, it was a great year for us again with the results that were given to you right now. But when you really look at the volumes, if you remember, we started off the year with our guidance of about $11.8 billion to $12.2 billion, when you looked at it. And then we saw the prices start spiking up through the year with the conflict that occurred over in Ukraine. But likewise, when we got to the first quarter and our first quarter call, we talked about the optimization opportunities that our com ops group were able to achieve. And we said that was probably to $225 million to $250 million. So it gave us a real shot in the arm as well as in the prices. And as we continue through the year, if you were comparing 2022 results, with what we've got in the guidance for 2023, you're going to have about probably $400 million to $600 million that was coming just from the, what we call the price and the spreads that we saw. So the assumptions \u2013 the last part of your question, I think, as far as the assumptions go, we're pretty much using the forward curve. We're staying kind of down the middle of the fairway. And that's kind of the walk forward from 2022 to 2023. But you can see, once again, between the numbers that I gave you there for the first quarter and then the pricing for the full year, hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a bridge of where we are. So we're very excited with what we've been able to achieve with the various projects or various assets that are coming online that we continue to see, as well as the volumes. So we're obviously very excited to be able to put numbers of the $12.9 billion to $13.3 billion to you.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Appreciate the feedback. Maybe as my follow-up, I appreciate some of the color on the prepared remarks around Lake Charles LNG just maybe taking a little bit longer than expected. Curious if you could just talk a little bit more about, one, just the equity interest in the projects; two, to spa contracting. It seems like, broadly speaking, it's very hard to term out LNG in any environment. And then lastly, just any update on the EPC provider. I guess in the greater context, is there just a focus on returns for this project versus, I guess, just pursuing this project just to ultimately bring value to the downstream system? Thanks.\nMackie McCrea: You bet, Brian. This is Mackie again. And you hit the nail on the head, it has taken us longer than we had anticipated. It is extremely competitive out there. The need for natural gas for many years to come is out there. There's international customers throughout that are looking for supplies, especially reliable, cheaper gas supplies in the U.S., but it's extremely competitive. And we are disappointed we're not further along in signing up customers. But even as we speak, we have Tom Mason and his team are actually over there for on a two-week trip meeting with customers, some of which were down the road quite a ways on consummating new deals, which will certainly make public. So we're working hard on that front. We've got our work cut out for us. We still believe we have the best project for a number of reasons, especially with the ability to feed it from so many different basins. So we're still very excited about it. On the EPC front, we have received some of our costs in over the next 60 to 90 days, we're going to fine-tune those. We're going to put kind of \u2013 to get a better understanding about any risk and mitigation of those risks. But really, our focus right now is on getting the customers. And we've got a great effort on that, and we still remain optimistic that we will get it to FID.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Appreciate the color. I\u2019ll leave it there. Enjoy your evening.\nMackie McCrea: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So maybe just want to talk about \u2013 start with capital allocation for 2023. Tom, in your prepared remarks, you seem to indicate that deleveraging, is it continues to be a priority? So I'm wondering if you're thinking that you want to push towards the lower end of that 4 to 4.5 leverage target? And then how should we think about dividend growth rate in 2023? And then anything on buybacks? Thanks.\nTom Long: Yes, good afternoon Michael. I'll start with this. When you really look at it, we have been just absolutely just more than pleased, if you will, that we've been able to get the distributions back up to about 2022. Really, when you look at a lot of the distribution cuts that were made back that year, we're very proud with what we've been able to achieve. I think we're probably one of the few that we're able to get it back up to the precut levels. So when you really look at the allocation, we're going to \u2013 you worded it well. We're going to continue to probably keep a lot of financial flexibility and some dry powder, which means we'll keep it at the lower end of that 4 to 4.5, so we'll continue to focus on bringing that down as far as the leverage ratio. When you really look at the capital projects that we've talked about here, I know we start off with this CapEx number of where we are, we're going to continue to look at acquisitions. And so when you focus on that and you see where we kind of \u2013 what we did in 2022 with some of the smaller type acquisitions, the $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion does not include anything that might come along only on the consolidation front. So we're going to allocate dollars to the continued growth of the company. And then third, we're going to look at returning capital to the unitholders, and that will be evaluating the distribution levels. Like I mentioned in the kind of the prepared remarks that we're going to be looking at that distribution more on an annual type basis. There's not a whole lot of other guidance at this point that we're going to provide at this time. But we're going to continue to look at possible unit buybacks. So we put both of those in that same returning capital to the unitholders. But that's the way, I think, in summary, answering your question.\nMichael Blum: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then also I just wanted to ask you about your gas storage business. I wonder if you can just talk generally about the trends you're seeing in storage rates and then just remind us kind of what's your average length of your storage contracts and how much merchant capacity you have? Thanks.\nMackie McCrea: Hi Mike, this is Mackie. Yes, we've got a total of about 150 Bcf throughout the country of storage. So average kind of storage facility is a little bit different. We have been able to consummate over the past five or six months, some storage-related deals with transportation to some power plants in Texas as well as in Oklahoma. What happened with Yuri kind of woke some folks up, and that's what we were kind of advertising for a while. If you don't lock in demand charge or reserve space from storage and for pipeline capacity, you could be in trouble when times are tight. So we have been successful. Some of those deals are three to five years. A lot of our storage contracts may be as low as a year or two. I won't get into a lot of specifics for competitive reasons, but we've got a wide variety of customers and a wide drive needs. And then, of course, whatever the merchant capacity is available we've got an optimization team that capitalizes on that value when those opportunities arise.\nMichael Blum: All right, thanks very much.\nMackie McCrea: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Marc Solecitto with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMarc Solecitto: Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe just to start, wondering if you could share your latest thoughts on a potential C-Corp currency? And if that something that could be on the table here in 2023.\nTom Long: Yes, Mark, this is Tom Long. We do have a team that's working on that. I guess the way I would tell you is that we are spending quite a bit of time on evaluating that. And we feel pretty good about probably 2023. We're going to be a little bit careful about putting in guidance out there right now. But it's something that we still think makes a lot of sense and are spending a lot of time. But can't really guide you any closer than that.\nMarc Solecitto: No, I appreciate that. And then going back to when you announced the Enable transaction, I believe at the time you referenced the opportunity to integrate slightly some of those G&P assets with your Gulf Coast frac assets over time. So just wondering if you could give us an update on that. Are we starting to see that here in 2023? Is that still a little bit longer dated?\nMackie McCrea: Hey Mark, this is Mackie. Let me kind of break it down a little bit. With the Enable assets, some of the things we have been able to do, for example, out in the Panhandle in Western Oklahoma, we've been able to actually shut down a couple of smaller plants and move those at much higher margins, saving a lot of operating costs with better returns. So there has been some synergies there. There's also been synergies on connecting some of the enabled pipelines, for example, North Louisiana to our Carthage facilities, some of their interstate pipelines. And then as far as connecting the dots between Oklahoma and the Gulf Coast, yes, we will be having the vast majority of the liquids that are the tailgate of Enable\u2019s cryo will be delivered to our fractionators when those contracts run out in a couple of years.\nMarc Solecitto: Got it. I appreciate the time.\nMackie McCrea: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJohn Mackay: Hey thanks Tom, I appreciate it. Maybe I just wanted to talk about the Haynesville a little bit. I know you've touched on it in a couple of other questions so far. But be curious to hear your view on just what the basin looks like given where gas prices have gone, kind of what you're thinking for Basin growth overall and what that can mean for maybe your gathering footprint specifically, and maybe for the opportunity to get more contracts at Gulf Run?\nMackie McCrea: Hey, John, this is Mackie again. Yes, I did mention a minute ago. We have three intrastate 42-inch pipes. One 42-inch intrastate multiple other pipes, we connect Carthage to Perryville. We now are connected from the Haynesville down to our trunk plant system in Golden Pass. So we're so well positioned. The reserves are there. Do we have a strong opinion of where the gas price will go below $2 where they'll keep drilling? We don't know, but we do know that these wells come on at $50,000 or $60,000 a day. You don't need a real high gas price to justify drilling those. We haven't had any huge indications of slowdown. In fact, we're adding significant treating capacity in North Louisiana. So we believe that the reserves for there are going to grow and much of that volume is going to hit our system.\nJohn Mackay: All right. That's helpful. Maybe just a follow-up on the CapEx guide. Talked a little bit about potential NGL export debottlenecking projects. Just it wasn't clear. Is that in the current growth guide? Or is that something we'd see more in 2024, and then more broadly I'm not trying to pin you down on the 2024 number. But is the 2023 CapEx level kind of a reasonable run rate to think about now that a lot of the bigger projects have rolled off?\nMackie McCrea: I'll start this and then maybe Tom can follow-up. But yes, our Flex port expansion and our potential expansion up at Marcus Hook, those are not in our guidance numbers. However, as we alluded to on the last call and have been for a while, we will expand, it's going to happen. You wouldn't be surprised if we announce something by the next call. we have the volumes to justify it. We're just trying to make the most prudent decision on do we expand Nederland first, do we expand Marcus Hook first or with some of the successes and the negotiations going on? Do we expand both. So that is a very positive side of our business. We've been growing over the last five or six years enormously. We with the world has an insatiable desire for NGLs. We think that's going to grow for many, many years to come and we believe we'll play a bigger role than anybody else in the industry on meeting that demand. So we do anticipate making some announcements in the fairly near future on expanding our export capacity.\nTom Long: And John, I'm going to go ahead and jump in here, too. This is Tom Long. As far as the second part of your question there. As you can see, we gave the guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion for a company our size, you can probably also appreciate that we've got a lot of opportunities. So that's really the number that we're starting the year here based upon projects we've identified, but we've talked about these other projects, and you stated that correctly that that's \u2013 the other projects that have not got to FID, we're not including in this. So as those come along through the year, we will talk more about those, which could impact that number. But I think the other thing to make sure you stay focused on from a CapEx standpoint is that it doesn't include some of the small M&A type opportunities. So a lot of this growth capital are projects right now that are pretty short bills. We get good returns, very good returns on them, and at the same time we get good capital returns on them in a shorter period of time, let's say, less than 12 months. So we're going to continue to focus on doing the things that need to strengthen the company and continue to grow it. And so you'll expect much more to come with the CapEx that we're looking at, so.\nMackie McCrea: Hey, John, this is Mackie. Add one more thing, too. Keep in mind, we have built a franchise up there. We're the only company that can transport growth of LPG. We're the only company that can transport through pipelines growth and ethane we have the ability to increase our ethane capacity by 3 times of what we're moving today. We can more than double our LPG capacity. So when we're talking about expansion at Marcus Hook, we're going to have a decent good rate of return on those \u2013 that expansion capital and then very little capital for same pump stations to utilize existing capacity that's already in the ground.\nJohn Mackay: That great. Really clear. Appreciate all the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Hi. How much do you anticipate that both run can physically flow until Golden Pass comes online? And are you getting paid for all contracts today even before that?\nMackie McCrea: Jen, this is Mackie again. That contract has a foundation customer Golden Pass. Yes, they began being demand charges first part of this year would actually ramp up a little later in the year. And we will be fully utilizing that pipeline as much as we possible can. I believe we flows almost up to 0.5 Bcf a day, actually physical volumes in addition to the demand charges that we're getting from Golden Pass. And it's our expectations that that team will continue to fill that pipe up and every bit of the capacity is available until it's begins being utilized by Golden Pass. As you know, probably that's 1.65 Bcf of capacity that we can easily expand.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Yes. That makes sense. And then do you think of Lake Charles and the petchem project being somewhat dependent on each other in terms of the share that you're willing to take? Just hypothetically, if one of them was to definitively kind of not reach up ID, would that increase your appetite to take a greater share of the other where you think of the as completely independent?\nTom Long: Yes. This is Tom Long. I'll chime in here first. We look at them as independent. They're not in the same dialogue we look at. In other words, our desire is to continue to look at market for all the product that we handle. And so when you start looking at petchem, you start looking at LNG, you start to have to start looking at the upstream benefits that we see. And we think they both on a stand-alone basis would make sense or we won't take them to FID, but they are independent.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Great. That's all for me. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nChase Mulvehill: Hey. Good afternoon everybody. So I guess, a quick question on the midstream segment. Obviously, took a big step down in the fourth quarter, probably more so related to POPs. But could you talk about how much in the fourth quarter that really reflected kind of spot commodity pricing versus what further downside you might have as you kind of roll in lower commodity prices. And I realize that you're using the strip for your guidance, but just trying to understand and level set things gelato the fourth quarter.\nTom Long: Yes. This is Tom Long. It is those POP contracts. Jas, used to you nailed that as far as the way you described it. But the midstream area is the area that we did. When you look at 2022, we did enjoy a lot of the higher commodity prices as we as we went through the year and saw that. And that's the \u2013 that's probably one of the segments that we continue to look at when we give the guidance for 2023 that it is a lot about the pricing. Now remember, we are still using that forward curve for 2023, and that's what we've got baked into it. But we still remain very bullish on the volumes and what we're seeing, and we're going to obviously capture all the value we can to continue to grow that segment.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay. Makes sense. And you probably have a decent look into kind of petchem demand. And if we're starting to see kind of early signs of, I guess a bottoming of petchem demand potentially a pickup in the back half or you maybe think that's more 2024. So would be curious on your thoughts on petchem demand and if you see that kind of bottom in the near term and maybe moving up as we get a [indiscernible]\nMackie McCrea: Chase, we started losing you. Yes, I think I can answer if I don't ask it again. But as [indiscernible], we do have a team they're working diligently on a very unique \u2013 probably one of the most flexible projects that's ever been built in the world, and we are in a difficult time. We're in a very down cycle. There's really no spread similar to what's happening on a warrior, where there's just no spread, and it's hard to get a company's commit. However, we are in dialogue with several equity partners, both of which will take a significant part of the yield out. And we do think it's project at some point, we'll get to FID. It's tough timing right now based on kind of where the crack spreads are. But to your point, it is a cycle and maybe buy everybody is going to start seeing maybe by the latter part of 2024, we start seeing the upside of that cycle. And so as we kind of get deeper into 2023 different this year, we are optimistic that we'll get more momentum and hopefully get that to FID.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay. Perfect. I'll turn it over.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.\nColton Bean: Good afternoon. Shifting back to Gulf Run, you mentioned the deliverability through Zone 2 and the trunk line. I think the team's previously looked at extending the terminus beyond starts to add downstream connectivity. Can you just update us on where you stand on that project and what you need to see to move forward?\nMackie McCrea: You bet. This is Mackie again. We had an open season a while back, not that far back, but last year, and it was extremely successful in regards to the demand. So we're looking at a bunch of things. It doesn't take a lot of pipe to get down to connect our affiliated company at FTT, which would help some of those customers. We also, of course, are looking at potentially extending it down to Lake Charles. We can add compression only and at a Bcf or it may mean that loop in that pipeline and building an entire new 42-inch, not only down to trunkline but also we're down to Florida and other of the interstate pipeline. So as the volumes grow out of the Haynesville, as customers are looking for more gas, not only along the Louisa the Gulf Coast, but all the way to Florida, we do expect some significant expansions of the Gulf Run system.\nColton Bean: Great. And then Mackie, back on the NGL export expansion, can you just frame for us the scope that you're looking at Nederland and Marcus Hook? I mean is that incremental refrigeration, mostly birth that you're looking at? Just trying to get a sense of the total capital that might be required?\nMackie McCrea: Both, there's kind of different tracks this may take. But generally, both expansions right now would be 70,000 barrels a day. That would include both refrigeration and tanks both at Nederland and at Marcus Hook.\nColton Bean: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cusimano with Pickering Energy. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cusimano: Hey. Good afternoon everyone. I just had a couple of clarification questions, if I could. First, on the \u2013 the comment that you made, Tom, on the distribution increases. And I know you said that you all are going to look to increase them annually. Is it fair to assume that we're at a stable level here until January of like 2024?\nTom Long: We're going to always evaluate these as each quarter when the distribution is approved by the Board. But wanted to make sure we communicated to the Street that our goal was to get back to $1.22 [ph]. We're obviously very, very pleased to see it at a 2 times coverage ratio when you look at the fourth quarter is what I'm referring to. But it's something that we're going to probably get back into the kind of the normal evaluations on an annual type basis. Clearly, when you look at \u2013 once again, I kind of look at the capital allocation of the debt, continue to bring the debt down, but also, these projects we're talking about. I know I've said already earlier on this call, but we're going to continue to look at these good projects to continue to strengthen the company. But it's really more on an annual basis that we'll be looking at some type of some type of an evaluation as to where we are, so.\nMichael Cusimano: Okay. Yes. No, that's very clear. And then also to clarify on the midstream commentary from earlier. Was there any like offset benefits in other segments from the lower \u2013 maybe like pop realizations in midstream? I guess like did the intrastate segment benefit from lower Waha, et cetera, that there was kind of some puts and takes there across the franchise?\nMackie McCrea: This is Mackie. A little bit hard to answer that question. But if you just reflect and look at our results, as we said, in every segment, we hit records. So yes, as midstream might have got a little bit tighter and POP maybe not as strong or maybe heading this year. That's kind of the advantage of Energy Transfer, we're so diversified in all the different aspects, crude, NGL, to midstream, to our intra- and interstate pipelines. So for example, we hit record volumes in some of our pipelines in the intrastate as well as other of our pipeline systems. So sure, there's offsets when some of our segments may struggle like midstream. Certainly, that's offset many times about maybe our crude business or our NGL business.\nMichael Cusimano: Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful.\nMackie McCrea: Okay, I\u2019m sorry. You have another question? Yes.\nMichael Cusimano: That\u2019s helpful, that\u2019s all from me.\nMackie McCrea: Okay.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Long for any closing remarks.\nTom Long: You bet. Once again, thank all of you for joining us today. Another great year we've delivered and we would be remiss if we didn't thank all of the team members of Energy Transfer for delivering another great year and to getting our balance sheet back to where it needs to be, our financial flexibility it didn't just happen by coincidence or accidents. So a huge complement to the entire Energy Transfer team, and we can\u2019t thank all of you enough for your continued support, and we look forward to talking to all of you in the near future.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Long",
            "content": "Thank you, operator, and good afternoon everyone and welcome to the Energy Transfer fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team, who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs, as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us, and are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-K for the full year ended December 31, 2022, which we expect to file this Friday, February 17. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'd like to start today by going over our financial results. For full year 2022, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $13.1 billion, which reflects continued growth over 2021 and is a partnership record. DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, was $7.4 billion, which resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $4.4 billion. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of approximately $2.4 billion, after distributions of $3.1 billion and growth capital of approximately $1.9 billion. Operationally, we moved record volumes across all of our segments for the year ended 2022, which included record volumes on our legacy midstream, intrastate and NGL transport systems as well as through our fractionators at Mont Belvieu. In addition, we exported a record amount of NGLs out of our Nederland Terminal in 2022, and we expect our exports to continue to grow into 2023. Looking at our fourth quarter 2022 results, we were pleased to report another strong quarter during which we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $3.4 billion, which was up more than 20% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. DCF attributable to the partners, as adjusted, was $1.9 billion compared to $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $965 million. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of approximately $360 million after distributions of $945 million and growth capital of approximately $605 million. On January 25, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.305 per common unit or $1.22 on an annualized basis. This distribution represents a 75% increase over the fourth quarter of 2021 and is a 15% increase over the third quarter of 2022. With this recent increase, we have now restored our distribution level to where it was in the first half of 2020. We greatly appreciate our equity investors, who have supported us over the last two plus years as we have diligently worked to lower our leverage and improve the financial stability of the partnership. This will allow us to better capitalize on opportunities that will lead to the future success for the partnership and all of our stakeholders. Future distribution increases will be evaluated on an annual basis while balancing energy transfers, leverage targets, growth opportunities and potential unit buybacks. As of December 31, 2022, the total available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities was approximately $4.2 billion. And while we are not speaking directly for the rating agencies, based on our internal calculations, we are now within the 4 to 4.5 target leverage ratio range based on our calculations of the rating agencies leverage ratios. Now turning to our results by segment for the fourth quarter, I'll start with NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was $928 million compared to $739 million for the same period last year. This change was primarily due to higher transportation, fractionation and terminal services margins and the recognition of gains on hedged NGL inventory. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines increased to a record 2 million barrels per day compared to 1.9 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes from the Permian and Eagle Ford regions as well as on our NGL pipelines that deliver into our Nederland Terminal. And our average fractionated volumes set a new partnership record, averaging 962,000 barrels per day compared to 895,000 barrels per day for the fourth quarter of 2021. In fact, during the fourth quarter of 2022, single day fractionation throughput at Mont Belvieu reached more than 1 million barrels for the first time in our partnership's history. NGL export volumes significantly exceeded fourth quarter and full year 2021 exports, driven by record ethane and LPG exports out of our Nederland Terminal. This was primarily driven by the second tranche of satellites contract going into effect on July 1, which doubled the volume commitments from the initial term. In 2022, we loaded nearly 43 million barrels of ethane out of Nederland. And for full year 2023, we expect to load more than 60 million barrels. In total, we continue to export more NGLs than any other company or country with our percentage of worldwide NGL exports remaining at approximately 20% of the world market. For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $632 million compared to $547 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to increased throughput and all of our operating regions as well as the acquisition of the Enable assets in December of 2021 and the Woodford Express assets in September of 2022. Gathered gas volumes were at a record 19.4 million MMBtus per day compared to 14.8 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year. Excluding Enable and Woodford Express, gathered gas volumes on our legacy assets were up 8% over the same period last year. For our crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $571 million compared to $533 million for the same period last year. These results were driven by improved performance on our Texas crude pipeline system, increased throughput at our Gulf Coast terminals, stronger refinery utilization and higher export demand as well as the addition of the Enable assets in December of 2021. Crude oil transportation volumes increased to 4.3 million barrels per day compared to 3.8 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This was driven by higher volumes on our Texas pipeline systems and on the Bayou Bridge pipeline, the addition of the Enable assets as well as placing the Ted Collins Link and Cushing South pipelines into service. In our interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $494 million compared to $397 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to increased transportation revenue related to higher contracted volumes and rates on several of our pipelines as well as the addition of the Enable interstate assets. Volumes increased 33% over the same period last year and utilization on many of our interstate pipelines, including Trunkline, Tiger, FGT, Southeast Supply Header and Rover remains high. And for our intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $433 million compared to $274 million in the fourth quarter of last year. This was primarily due to higher pipeline and storage optimization opportunities, higher fees on assets in the Haynesville as well as the addition of the Enable assets. Utilization of our HPL System remains strong due to the increased demand for our gas takeaway and our Rigs pipeline system continues to flow at or near capacity due to increased activity in the Haynesville. Now looking at recent developments on our ongoing growth projects. I'll start with an update on our Lake Charles LNG project. Global demand for LNG remained strong as energy security has emerged as a key theme for LNG. In addition, U.S. natural gas producers have shown increased interest in committing a portion of their production to long-term sales arrangements at European and Asian natural gas or LNG index prices. We view these two factors as key drivers towards securing additional long-term LNG offtake agreements. The LNG market along the Gulf Coast is currently extremely competitive. Given this level of competition, it is taking us longer to reach FID than originally expected, but we are optimistic that we will bring this project to FID. We continue making progress on all aspects of the project and are working hard to sign up more customers, and we'll share additional information as it becomes available. Turning to our Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals, in November 2022 we completed dredging at Marcus Hook to increase the depth at one of our docks to 42 feet, which will allow us to fully load VLECs at this dock going forward. In addition, we recently completed a FEED study on a potential expansion project at our Nederland Terminal, which would provide us with additional NGL export capacity. We are currently evaluating next steps and hope to provide more details on this opportunity in the near future. We also expect to approve an optimization project at Marcus Hook that would add incremental ethane refrigeration and storage capacity. NGL demand, both in the U.S. as well as from overseas customers continues to increase. We are firm believers that there will be significant growth in international demand for many years to come. Next, construction of our Frac VIII continues as scheduled, and we expect it to be in service in the third quarter of 2023. This addition will bring our total Mont Belvieu fractionation capacity to approximately 1.15 million barrels per day. Also during the fourth quarter, we brought a new storage cavern online at Mont Belvieu with a capacity of approximately 3 million barrels, which supports our ongoing purity growth at the fracs as well as growth at our docks in Nederland. This brings our total underground NGL storage capacity at Mont Belvieu to approximately 60 million barrels. Out in the Permian, in December, we placed our 200 million cubic foot per day Grey Wolf processing plant into service, and it is already ramping up more quickly than anticipated. As a reminder, this plant, which is located in the Delaware Basin, is supported by new commitments and growth from existing customer contracts. Construction continues on the Bear plant, our eighth 200 million cubic foot per day processing plant in the Delaware Basin. This plant remains on schedule to be in service in the second quarter of 2023. In addition, we continue to evaluate the necessity and potential timing of adding another processing plant in the region. Regarding Permian takeaway, we also recently completed modernization and debottlenecking work on our Oasis pipeline, which added at least an incremental 60,000 Mcf per day of takeaway capacity out of the Permian Basin. We also placed the Gulf Run pipeline into service in December. Gulf Run, which is a 42-inch interstate natural gas pipeline with 1.65 Bcf per day of capacity, provides natural gas transportation between our upstream pipeline network and from the Haynesville Shale for delivery to the Gulf Coast connecting some of the most prolific natural gas producing regions in the U.S. with the LNG export market as well as many markets along the Gulf Coast. It is backed by a 20-year commitment for 1.1 Bcf per day from Golden Pass LNG, and we recently concluded a non-binding open season on Gulf Run due to growing producer demand. We were pleased with the results of the open season and customer discussions are ongoing, which will likely necessitate additional facilities beyond the initial design of 1.65 Bcf per day. We are already utilizing a significant portion of Zone 1 capacity on Gulf Run, and we have added additional customer commitments through Zone 2, which is being delivered into our Trunkline pipeline. In addition to these ongoing projects, we continue to evaluate and have customer discussions regarding a number of other projects that are over the long-term could provide strong returns and significant upside to our business. We remain optimistic that we can bring these projects to FID and look forward to sharing any significant updates on these potential projects at the appropriate timing. On the alternative energy front, we continue to make progress on our carbon capture and storage project with CapturePoint. That is related to our North Louisiana processing plants. The Class VI permit for the sequestration side was filed by CapturePoint with the EPA in June of 2022. We also recently executed a letter of intent with Oxy related to Oxy's Magnolia hub in Allen Parish, Louisiana, north of the Lake Charles Industrial Complex. Pursuant to the letter of intent, Energy Transfer and Oxy are working together to obtain long-term commitments of CO2 from the industrial customers in the Lake Charles, Louisiana area. If this project reaches FID, Energy Transfer would construct a CO2 pipeline to connect the customers to Oxy's sequestration site in Allen Parish, Louisiana. Oxy filed applications with the EPA for 2 Class 6 injection wells in 2021. Oxy is a leader in the CCS sector, and we're pleased to be working with them to make this project successful. In addition, we're evaluating numerous opportunities to capture and either utilize or store the CO2 across our systems. Now looking at our growth capital spend for the full year of December 31, 2022. Energy Transfer spent approximately $1.9 billion on organic growth projects, primarily in the midstream, interstate and NGL and refined products segments, excluding SUN and USA Compression CapEx. For full year 2023, we expect growth capital expenditures to be between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, which will be spent primarily in the midstream NGL and refined products and interstate segments. This capital includes projects that will address growing demand like Frac VIII at Mont Belvieu, the Bear processing plant in the Permian Basin, compression and optimization projects on existing pipelines, new treating capacity in the Haynesville, additional gathering and compression build-out in the Permian, improved efficiencies and emission reduction work, as well as preliminary spend related to carbon capture projects. In addition, this number does include a small amount of capital that was pushed from 2022 into 2023 due to project in-service timing needs. A significant amount of our 2023 capital spend is comprised of projects that are expected to be online and contributing cash flow before the end of 2023 at very attractive returns. Now for our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance, given the continued domestic and international demand for our products and services, the ability of our base business to operate through various market cycles as well as our market outlook for the year, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between $12.9 billion and $13.3 billion. Our business continues to provide stable cash flows and opportunities for optimization and expansion. And in 2023, we expect utilization in all of our core segments to increase. With the current forward curve for commodity prices and spreads, our guidance does not assume the same upside benefits from pricing and spreads that we experienced in 2022. As a result of our commitment to strengthening our balance sheet throughout 2022, we entered 2023 in a much stronger financial position, and we expect to maintain our leverage target range of 4 to 4.5 times. We will continue to place emphasis on strategically allocated cash flow in a manner that best positions us to further improve our financial flexibility and leverage, invest in high-returning growth projects and return value to unitholders. We remain bullish about the future of our industry and the growing worldwide demand for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and refined products. As we look for additional ways to address existing and new demand for our products, we will continue to pursue strategic growth projects that enhance our existing asset base and generate attractive returns as part of our capital allocation strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line, up for our first question. Jeremy you are being muted. Hi, good afternoon. Hi, you bet, Brian. This is Tom Long. Really, when you look at 2022, obviously, it was a great year for us again with the results that were given to you right now. But when you really look at the volumes, if you remember, we started off the year with our guidance of about $11.8 billion to $12.2 billion, when you looked at it. And then we saw the prices start spiking up through the year with the conflict that occurred over in Ukraine. But likewise, when we got to the first quarter and our first quarter call, we talked about the optimization opportunities that our com ops group were able to achieve. And we said that was probably to $225 million to $250 million. So it gave us a real shot in the arm as well as in the prices. And as we continue through the year, if you were comparing 2022 results, with what we've got in the guidance for 2023, you're going to have about probably $400 million to $600 million that was coming just from the, what we call the price and the spreads that we saw. So the assumptions \u2013 the last part of your question, I think, as far as the assumptions go, we're pretty much using the forward curve. We're staying kind of down the middle of the fairway. And that's kind of the walk forward from 2022 to 2023. But you can see, once again, between the numbers that I gave you there for the first quarter and then the pricing for the full year, hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a bridge of where we are. So we're very excited with what we've been able to achieve with the various projects or various assets that are coming online that we continue to see, as well as the volumes. So we're obviously very excited to be able to put numbers of the $12.9 billion to $13.3 billion to you. Yes, good afternoon Michael. I'll start with this. When you really look at it, we have been just absolutely just more than pleased, if you will, that we've been able to get the distributions back up to about 2022. Really, when you look at a lot of the distribution cuts that were made back that year, we're very proud with what we've been able to achieve. I think we're probably one of the few that we're able to get it back up to the precut levels. So when you really look at the allocation, we're going to \u2013 you worded it well. We're going to continue to probably keep a lot of financial flexibility and some dry powder, which means we'll keep it at the lower end of that 4 to 4.5, so we'll continue to focus on bringing that down as far as the leverage ratio. When you really look at the capital projects that we've talked about here, I know we start off with this CapEx number of where we are, we're going to continue to look at acquisitions. And so when you focus on that and you see where we kind of \u2013 what we did in 2022 with some of the smaller type acquisitions, the $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion does not include anything that might come along only on the consolidation front. So we're going to allocate dollars to the continued growth of the company. And then third, we're going to look at returning capital to the unitholders, and that will be evaluating the distribution levels. Like I mentioned in the kind of the prepared remarks that we're going to be looking at that distribution more on an annual type basis. There's not a whole lot of other guidance at this point that we're going to provide at this time. But we're going to continue to look at possible unit buybacks. So we put both of those in that same returning capital to the unitholders. But that's the way, I think, in summary, answering your question. Yes, Mark, this is Tom Long. We do have a team that's working on that. I guess the way I would tell you is that we are spending quite a bit of time on evaluating that. And we feel pretty good about probably 2023. We're going to be a little bit careful about putting in guidance out there right now. But it's something that we still think makes a lot of sense and are spending a lot of time. But can't really guide you any closer than that. And John, I'm going to go ahead and jump in here, too. This is Tom Long. As far as the second part of your question there. As you can see, we gave the guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion for a company our size, you can probably also appreciate that we've got a lot of opportunities. So that's really the number that we're starting the year here based upon projects we've identified, but we've talked about these other projects, and you stated that correctly that that's \u2013 the other projects that have not got to FID, we're not including in this. So as those come along through the year, we will talk more about those, which could impact that number. But I think the other thing to make sure you stay focused on from a CapEx standpoint is that it doesn't include some of the small M&A type opportunities. So a lot of this growth capital are projects right now that are pretty short bills. We get good returns, very good returns on them, and at the same time we get good capital returns on them in a shorter period of time, let's say, less than 12 months. So we're going to continue to focus on doing the things that need to strengthen the company and continue to grow it. And so you'll expect much more to come with the CapEx that we're looking at, so. Yes. This is Tom Long. I'll chime in here first. We look at them as independent. They're not in the same dialogue we look at. In other words, our desire is to continue to look at market for all the product that we handle. And so when you start looking at petchem, you start looking at LNG, you start to have to start looking at the upstream benefits that we see. And we think they both on a stand-alone basis would make sense or we won't take them to FID, but they are independent. Yes. This is Tom Long. It is those POP contracts. Jas, used to you nailed that as far as the way you described it. But the midstream area is the area that we did. When you look at 2022, we did enjoy a lot of the higher commodity prices as we as we went through the year and saw that. And that's the \u2013 that's probably one of the segments that we continue to look at when we give the guidance for 2023 that it is a lot about the pricing. Now remember, we are still using that forward curve for 2023, and that's what we've got baked into it. But we still remain very bullish on the volumes and what we're seeing, and we're going to obviously capture all the value we can to continue to grow that segment. We're going to always evaluate these as each quarter when the distribution is approved by the Board. But wanted to make sure we communicated to the Street that our goal was to get back to $1.22 [ph]. We're obviously very, very pleased to see it at a 2 times coverage ratio when you look at the fourth quarter is what I'm referring to. But it's something that we're going to probably get back into the kind of the normal evaluations on an annual type basis. Clearly, when you look at \u2013 once again, I kind of look at the capital allocation of the debt, continue to bring the debt down, but also, these projects we're talking about. I know I've said already earlier on this call, but we're going to continue to look at these good projects to continue to strengthen the company. But it's really more on an annual basis that we'll be looking at some type of some type of an evaluation as to where we are, so. You bet. Once again, thank all of you for joining us today. Another great year we've delivered and we would be remiss if we didn't thank all of the team members of Energy Transfer for delivering another great year and to getting our balance sheet back to where it needs to be, our financial flexibility it didn't just happen by coincidence or accidents. So a huge complement to the entire Energy Transfer team, and we can't thank all of you enough for your continued support, and we look forward to talking to all of you in the near future."

            "name": "Mackie McCrea",
            "content": "Jeremy, this is Mackie. Yes, when we think about the Permian Basin, probably one of the most prolific basins in the world. We love looking at the maps because, as you know, we have inter and intra state pipelines come in every direction and out of that area including three NGL pipelines and then, of course, some significant pipeline capacity across the state. As you know, everybody knows on this call, there has been a significant growth in natural gas volumes out of the Permian. There has been expansions. There continue to be compression expansions on the 42-inch getting built. And then about this time last year, we kicked off Warrior and started getting some momentum and we continue to have momentum. So we don't know when the next project will be announced coming out of the Permian Basin, we do believe it will be ours when it happens. Just a quick update on those volumes. We have contracted about 25% to 30% of what we need to get to FID on Warrior. We're talking to another at least 50% to 60% of what would be needed. It is a slow process based on what you just said, when you've got negative spreads where Waha has been higher than Katie and or you've got a few cents spread. It's hard to get deals done. But certainly, over the next three to four years on top of what's already been expanded and built, there will need to be another line and if there is one, we do believe it will be ours. Yes, just a common theme I'd say throughout this on every question. I think just asked, golly look at a pipeline map and look at what energy transport can do on moving volumes to Gulf Coast, especially to Louisiana, after buying [indiscernible] we now have three \u2013 I'm sorry, four 42-inch pipes in North Louisiana. We have connections from Carthage to Perryville and out to Gulf Run we connect almost to the Gulf Coast and other pipelines. So we're so well positioned both to feed our own LNG project, should we get that to FID, but regardless even our results, we're seeing volumes find their way from North Marcellus to [indiscernible] and Trunkline and through all of our pipeline system to the Gulf Coast already to see the growing demand for LNG. So we're so well positioned and pretty excited about the full utilization and even expansions of our systems across the South. Thank you. You bet, Brian. This is Mackie again. And you hit the nail on the head, it has taken us longer than we had anticipated. It is extremely competitive out there. The need for natural gas for many years to come is out there. There's international customers throughout that are looking for supplies, especially reliable, cheaper gas supplies in the U.S., but it's extremely competitive. And we are disappointed we're not further along in signing up customers. But even as we speak, we have Tom Mason and his team are actually over there for on a two-week trip meeting with customers, some of which were down the road quite a ways on consummating new deals, which will certainly make public. So we're working hard on that front. We've got our work cut out for us. We still believe we have the best project for a number of reasons, especially with the ability to feed it from so many different basins. So we're still very excited about it. On the EPC front, we have received some of our costs in over the next 60 to 90 days, we're going to fine-tune those. We're going to put kind of \u2013 to get a better understanding about any risk and mitigation of those risks. But really, our focus right now is on getting the customers. And we've got a great effort on that, and we still remain optimistic that we will get it to FID. Sure. Hi Mike, this is Mackie. Yes, we've got a total of about 150 Bcf throughout the country of storage. So average kind of storage facility is a little bit different. We have been able to consummate over the past five or six months, some storage-related deals with transportation to some power plants in Texas as well as in Oklahoma. What happened with Yuri kind of woke some folks up, and that's what we were kind of advertising for a while. If you don't lock in demand charge or reserve space from storage and for pipeline capacity, you could be in trouble when times are tight. So we have been successful. Some of those deals are three to five years. A lot of our storage contracts may be as low as a year or two. I won't get into a lot of specifics for competitive reasons, but we've got a wide variety of customers and a wide drive needs. And then, of course, whatever the merchant capacity is available we've got an optimization team that capitalizes on that value when those opportunities arise. Thank you. Hey Mark, this is Mackie. Let me kind of break it down a little bit. With the Enable assets, some of the things we have been able to do, for example, out in the Panhandle in Western Oklahoma, we've been able to actually shut down a couple of smaller plants and move those at much higher margins, saving a lot of operating costs with better returns. So there has been some synergies there. There's also been synergies on connecting some of the enabled pipelines, for example, North Louisiana to our Carthage facilities, some of their interstate pipelines. And then as far as connecting the dots between Oklahoma and the Gulf Coast, yes, we will be having the vast majority of the liquids that are the tailgate of Enable's cryo will be delivered to our fractionators when those contracts run out in a couple of years. Thank you. Hey, John, this is Mackie again. Yes, I did mention a minute ago. We have three intrastate 42-inch pipes. One 42-inch intrastate multiple other pipes, we connect Carthage to Perryville. We now are connected from the Haynesville down to our trunk plant system in Golden Pass. So we're so well positioned. The reserves are there. Do we have a strong opinion of where the gas price will go below $2 where they'll keep drilling? We don't know, but we do know that these wells come on at $50,000 or $60,000 a day. You don't need a real high gas price to justify drilling those. We haven't had any huge indications of slowdown. In fact, we're adding significant treating capacity in North Louisiana. So we believe that the reserves for there are going to grow and much of that volume is going to hit our system. I'll start this and then maybe Tom can follow-up. But yes, our Flex port expansion and our potential expansion up at Marcus Hook, those are not in our guidance numbers. However, as we alluded to on the last call and have been for a while, we will expand, it's going to happen. You wouldn't be surprised if we announce something by the next call. we have the volumes to justify it. We're just trying to make the most prudent decision on do we expand Nederland first, do we expand Marcus Hook first or with some of the successes and the negotiations going on? Do we expand both. So that is a very positive side of our business. We've been growing over the last five or six years enormously. We with the world has an insatiable desire for NGLs. We think that's going to grow for many, many years to come and we believe we'll play a bigger role than anybody else in the industry on meeting that demand. So we do anticipate making some announcements in the fairly near future on expanding our export capacity. Hey, John, this is Mackie. Add one more thing, too. Keep in mind, we have built a franchise up there. We're the only company that can transport growth of LPG. We're the only company that can transport through pipelines growth and ethane we have the ability to increase our ethane capacity by 3 times of what we're moving today. We can more than double our LPG capacity. So when we're talking about expansion at Marcus Hook, we're going to have a decent good rate of return on those \u2013 that expansion capital and then very little capital for same pump stations to utilize existing capacity that's already in the ground. Jen, this is Mackie again. That contract has a foundation customer Golden Pass. Yes, they began being demand charges first part of this year would actually ramp up a little later in the year. And we will be fully utilizing that pipeline as much as we possible can. I believe we flows almost up to 0.5 Bcf a day, actually physical volumes in addition to the demand charges that we're getting from Golden Pass. And it's our expectations that that team will continue to fill that pipe up and every bit of the capacity is available until it's begins being utilized by Golden Pass. As you know, probably that's 1.65 Bcf of capacity that we can easily expand. Chase, we started losing you. Yes, I think I can answer if I don't ask it again. But as [indiscernible], we do have a team they're working diligently on a very unique \u2013 probably one of the most flexible projects that's ever been built in the world, and we are in a difficult time. We're in a very down cycle. There's really no spread similar to what's happening on a warrior, where there's just no spread, and it's hard to get a company's commit. However, we are in dialogue with several equity partners, both of which will take a significant part of the yield out. And we do think it's project at some point, we'll get to FID. It's tough timing right now based on kind of where the crack spreads are. But to your point, it is a cycle and maybe buy everybody is going to start seeing maybe by the latter part of 2024, we start seeing the upside of that cycle. And so as we kind of get deeper into 2023 different this year, we are optimistic that we'll get more momentum and hopefully get that to FID. You bet. This is Mackie again. We had an open season a while back, not that far back, but last year, and it was extremely successful in regards to the demand. So we're looking at a bunch of things. It doesn't take a lot of pipe to get down to connect our affiliated company at FTT, which would help some of those customers. We also, of course, are looking at potentially extending it down to Lake Charles. We can add compression only and at a Bcf or it may mean that loop in that pipeline and building an entire new 42-inch, not only down to trunkline but also we're down to Florida and other of the interstate pipeline. So as the volumes grow out of the Haynesville, as customers are looking for more gas, not only along the Louisa the Gulf Coast, but all the way to Florida, we do expect some significant expansions of the Gulf Run system. Both, there's kind of different tracks this may take. But generally, both expansions right now would be 70,000 barrels a day. That would include both refrigeration and tanks both at Nederland and at Marcus Hook. This is Mackie. A little bit hard to answer that question. But if you just reflect and look at our results, as we said, in every segment, we hit records. So yes, as midstream might have got a little bit tighter and POP maybe not as strong or maybe heading this year. That's kind of the advantage of Energy Transfer, we're so diversified in all the different aspects, crude, NGL, to midstream, to our intra- and interstate pipelines. So for example, we hit record volumes in some of our pipelines in the intrastate as well as other of our pipeline systems. So sure, there's offsets when some of our segments may struggle like midstream. Certainly, that's offset many times about maybe our crude business or our NGL business. Okay, I'm sorry. You have another question? Yes. Okay."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded today. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Long, Co-CEO. Please go ahead, sir.\nTom Long: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer third quarter 2022 earnings call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team, who are here to help answer your questions after the prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, which we expect to be filed this Thursday, November 3. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'll start today by going over our third quarter financial results. We were pleased to report another strong quarter during which we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $3.1 billion, which was up approximately 20% compared to $2.6 billion for the third quarter of 2021. In the third quarter, we experienced a nonrecurring $126 million charge in the crude oil segment related to the resolution of a prior year legal metal. In addition, we had an approximately $130 million negative impact due to the timing of the recognition of gains on hedged inventory in the NGL and refined products segment. Absent these 2 items, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter would have been $3.34 billion. Results for the third quarter benefited from higher volumes across all of our segments, including record volumes in the Midstream, intrastate, crude oil and through our fractionators. In addition, the acquisition of the Enable assets in December of 2021 contributed to our growth over the prior period. DCF attributable to the partners, as adjusted, was $1.6 billion for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $1.3 billion for the third quarter of 2021. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $760 million. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of approximately $265 million after distributions of $819 million and growth capital of approximately $500 million. On October 25, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.265 per common unit or $1.06 on an annualized basis. This distribution will be paid on November 21 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on November 4. This distribution represents a more than 70% increase over the third quarter of 2021. As a reminder, future increases to the distribution level will be evaluated quarterly with the ultimate goal of returning distributions to the previous level of $0.305 per quarter or $1.22 on an annualized basis while balancing our leverage target, growth opportunities and unit buybacks. As of September 30, 2022, the total available liquidity under our revolving credit facility was approximately $2.32 billion. Now turning to our results by segment. I'll start with the NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was $634 million compared to $706 million for the same period last year. This change was primarily due to the previously mentioned $130 million negative impact due to the timing of the recognition of gains on hedged NGL inventory during the current period. We expect to fully realize the offsetting gains on our financial derivatives and physical forward sales as the majority settle in the fourth quarter with a small amount settling in the first quarter of 2023. Adjusting for the noncash timing matter around hedging, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter would have been $764 million. Results in this segment were otherwise driven by higher fractionation, transportation, terminal services and storage margins related to increased volumes and higher rates. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines increased to 1.9 million barrels per day compared to 1.8 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes on our NGL pipelines that deliver into our Nederland Terminal as well as a record volumes on the combined Mariner East pipelines. And our average fractionated volumes set a new partnership record, averaging 940,000 barrels per day compared to 884,000 barrels per day for the third quarter of 2021. NGL export volumes significantly exceeded the third quarter of last year, driven by record ethane exports out of both Nederland and Marcus Hook. At Nederland, this was driven by the second tranche of satellites contract going into effect on July 1, which doubled the volume commitments from the initial term. Year-to-date, we have loaded approximately 29 million barrels of ethane out of Nederland. And for full year 2022, we expect to load more than 40 million barrels of ethane out of Nederland, with that increasing to approximately 60 million barrels for 2023. In total, we continue to export more NGLs than any other company or country with our percentage of worldwide NGL exports remaining at approximately 20% of the world market. For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $868 million compared to $556 million for the third quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to the increased throughput and in all of our operating regions, favorable natural gas and NGL prices and the acquisition of the Enable assets in December of 2021. Gathered gas volumes were a record 19.1 million MMBtu\u2019s per day compared to 13 million MMBtu\u2019s per day for the same period last year. Excluding Enable, Gathered gas volumes on our legacy assets were also a partnership record for the third quarter. Permian Basin and inlet volumes remain at or near record highs. We continue to utilize the Permian bridge daily to optimize our available processing capacity as we await the completion of 2 new plants that are currently under construction. For the crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $461 million compared to $496 million for the same period last year. Earnings were offset by a $126 million charge related to the resolution of our prior year legal matter. Absent this charge, adjusted EBITDA would have been $587 million for the third quarter of 2022. These results were otherwise driven by improved performance on our Bakken pipeline, increased throughput at our Gulf Coast terminals, stronger refinery utilization and higher export demand as well as the addition of the Enable assets in December of 2021. Crude oil transportation volumes increased to a record 4.6 million barrels per day compared to 4.2 million barrels per day for the same period last year, driven by higher crude oil prices and strong refinery demand as well as the addition of the Ted Collins Link and Cushing South pipelines and increased throughput through our Houston terminal. Excluding Enable, crude oil transportation volumes were also a record for the third quarter. In our intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $409 million compared to $334 million for the third quarter of 2021. During the quarter, we benefited from increased rates, higher production in the Haynesville Shale that drove greater utilization on Tiger improved demand on trunk line and line CP as well as the addition of the other interstate enabled assets. We continue to see heavy utilization on many of our interstate pipelines, including Tiger, FTT, Stash and Rover. And for our intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $301 million compared to $172 million for the third quarter of last year. This was primarily due to higher optimization opportunities, increased retained fuel revenues related to higher natural gas prices as well as the addition of the Enable assets. Utilization of our HPL system remains strong due to the increased demand for gas takeaway and our rig pipeline system continues to flow at or near capacity due to increased activity in the Haynesville. Turning to a brief update on our M&A activity. In August of this year, we completed the sale of our 51% interest in Energy Transfer Canada for cash proceeds of approximately $300 million. The sale reduced our consolidated debt by approximately $850 million. It also allowed us to divest of these noncore assets at an attractive valuation and utilize the cash proceeds to further deleverage our balance sheet and redeploy capital within our U.S. footprint. And in September of this year, we completed our acquisition of the Woodford Express LLC, which owns a Mid-Continent gas gathering and processing system for approximately $485 million. This bolt-on opportunity provided roughly 400 million cubic foot per day of cryogenic gas processing and treating capacity in Grady County, Oklahoma as well as more than 200 miles of low and mid pressure gathering lines in the heart of the SCOOP play. The assets are already connected to our inter and intrastate systems as well as our gas gathering system. The system is supported by dedicated acreage with long-term, predominantly fixed fee contracts. Now looking at recent developments at our ongoing growth projects. Year-to-date, Lake Charles LNG has executed 6 LNG offtake agreements for an aggregate of nearly 8 million tons per annum, including a 20-year LNG agreement with Shell LNG LLC that was executed in August. As we have previously stated, we expect to finance a significant portion of the capital cost of this project by means of the sale of equity in the project to infrastructure funds and possibly to one and more industry participants in conjunction with LNG offtake agreements. We have recently signed nonbinding letter agreements with two Japanese customers for LNG offtake and we are in active negotiations with several customers for long-term offtake contracts for significant volumes of LNG. We are making progress on all aspects of the project and we're now targeting FID by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Upon completion of the LNG project, we expect to realize significant incremental cash flows from transportation of natural gas on our Trunkline pipeline system and other energy transfer pipelines upstream from Lake Charles. We believe that our Lake Charles LNG project will provide an important contribution towards solving the growing global energy demand. As a reminder, our Mariner East pipeline system is fully commissioned and capable to transform more than 365,000 barrels per day, including ethane. As we have previously mentioned, we completed work at our Marcus Hook terminal to allow us to increase ethane exports out of Marcus Hook. As a result, we reached a new record for ethane exports out of our Marcus Hook terminal in the third quarter. NGL demand both in the U.S. as well as from overseas customers continues to increase, and we have sufficient commitments to move forward with an ethane export expansion. Even though we expect to expand our ethane export capabilities at both our Marcus Hook and Nederland Terminals, these commitments provide us with the optionality to initially expand at either terminal. Construction of Frac VIII continues to schedule, and we expect it to be in service in the third quarter of 2023, which will bring our total Mont Belvieu fractionation capacity to over 1.1 million barrels per day. Construction of our new 200 million cubic foot per day Grey Wolf processing plant in the Delaware Basin is underway. This plan is supported by new commitments and growth from existing customer contracts and remains on schedule to be in service by the end of 2022. Construction is underway on the Bear plant, our second 200 million cubic foot per day processing plant also located in the Delaware Basin, which was accelerated to meet growing demand. We expect this plant to be in service in the second quarter of 2023. In addition, given the significant amount of demand we're seeing, we are evaluating the necessity and potential timing of adding another processing plant in the region. Mainline construction of the Gulf Run pipeline was only finished, and we expect to complete the modification of compression by the end of this year. Gulf Run, which is a 42-inch interstate natural gas pipeline with 1.65 Bcf per day of capacity will provide natural gas transportation between our upstream pipeline network and from the Haynesville Shale for delivery to the Gulf Coast, connecting some of the most prolific natural gas-producing regions in the U.S. with the LNG export market. It is backed by a 20-year commitment for 1.1 Bcf per day for Golden Pass LNG, and we recently concluded a nonbinding open season on Gulf Run due to the growing product demand. We're pleased with the results of the open season and customer discussions are ongoing, which will likely necessitate additional facilities beyond the initial design of the 1.65 Bcf per day. Modernization and debottlenecking work on Oasis pipeline continues, which will add an incremental 60,000 Mcf per day of much needed capacity out of the Permian Basin. We expect it to be partially in service by the end of this year with full service by the end of January of 2023. In addition to these ongoing projects, we continue to evaluate and have customer discussions regarding a number of other projects that, over the long term, could provide significant upside to our business. These include the Warrior Pipeline project, which is the most optimal solution for customers to transport gas out of the Permian as well as opportunities to develop a petchem project on the Gulf Coast or acquired petchem facilities. We remain optimistic that we can bring these projects to FID and look forward to sharing any significant updates on these projects at the appropriate time. On the alternative energy front, our focus remains on reducing emissions across our pipelines, including pursuing a number of projects related to carbon capture and sequestration, enhanced oil recovery for use in the food and beverage industries as well as sequestering CO2 from our proposed Lake Charles LNG liquefaction facility. We'll be excited to update you once we have a project and specific agreement in place. Looking at our growth capital spend for the 9 months ended September 30, 2022, Energy Transfer spent approximately $1.3 billion on organic growth projects, primarily in the midstream, intrastate and NGL refined products segment, excluding SUN and USA Compression CapEx. For full year 2022, we expect growth capital expenditures to be near the high end of our range of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. Over 90% of our 2022 growth capital spend is comprised of projects that are already online or are expected to be online and contributing cash flow before the end of 2023, at very attractive returns. We will provide our 2023 growth capital outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call. For 2022, adjusted EBITDA guidance given our strong performance for the first 9 months of the year as well as continued demand for our products and services, we now expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between $12.8 billion and $13 million. This is up compared to our previous guidance of $12.6 billion to $12.8 billion. Overall, our outlook is strong as we have a stable business that has demonstrated its ability to manage through various market cycles. And we expect future growth to be supported by production, improvements, improved market conditions, increased utilization of our existing assets as well as strong domestic and international demand for our products. We remain bullish about the future of our industry and the growing worldwide demand for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. We expect to reach our leverage target range of 4 times to 4.5 times by the end of 2022 to continue to strategically allocate our cash flow in a manner that best positions us to further improve our financial flexibility and leverage, invest in high-returning growth projects and return value to our unitholders. As we look for additional ways to address existing and new demand for our products, we will continue to pursue strategic growth projects that enhance our existing asset base and generate attractive returns as part of our capital allocation strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line up for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] At this, we will take our first question, which will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Just want to kind of start off with the LNG project with Lake Charles, if I could. Just walking through a number of kind of different details that have emerged over the past quarter or so. You've had smaller competitors kind of fall by the wayside, if you will. Yet, it's still kind of an inflationary environment where it's hard to kind of lock in contractors, I think. Just wondering how you see these different influences coming together and how that impacts, I guess, your outlook for Lake Charles at this point?\nTom Mason: Jeremy, great question. A lot of moving parts to your question, but as is in the LNG world right now. Obviously, as you've touched on, the EPC costs have escalated since our first bid we got 2 years ago, and that had an impact on pricing of liquefaction. We have made good progress in increasing our liquefaction charge as we progress with new contracts. And we're excited about where we are in terms of being a bigger company with a strong balance sheet and a great natural gas pipeline network. We are one of the strongest with a brownfield facility with storage tanks and docs, we're really good position to get to the goal line.\nJeremy Tonet: And then maybe just kind of pivoting to the Permian a bit. If you could update us, I guess, as far as how you see the takeaway outlook evolving here at latest thoughts on Warrior. I imagine negative Waha prices do not hurt your business, but just wondering if you could provide more details on that, and I guess open capacity you have in maybe how that could increase over the first half of the year?\nMarshall McCrea: Yes, Jeremy. This is Mackie. We continue to be very excited about that project as we've experienced the last 2 or 3 weeks when there's any kind of a blip on any pipeline that's moving gas out of the Permian Basin. We see these wide spreads. We do like most industry believe that as we get deeper in this year and throughout most of the next 2 years, it's going to get back. The base is going to blow out. We do sit in a very fortunate situation that we do have capacity available today, that actually gets a little bit more over the next few years across the state. So we will be able to benefit from those wider spreads. But at the same time, we offer the team diligently working towards getting to the finish line on Warrior after the announcement of this other 42-inch line, it's going to move a couple of Bcf across. It's kind of slowed things down. But we will be the next pipeline that's announced out of there. We are not for the best option for anybody coming out of the Permian Basin, whether it's Delaware or Midland by Katy ship channel as well as other really good markets off of our interstate systems. So we're keeping our head down, but we're going to be very prudent when we make that decision, and we hope to that in the next couple of quarters.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nChase Mulvehill: I guess a question on ethane. Obviously, ethane prices have softened a little bit here. I'd be kind of curious on your thoughts about ethane rejection and kind of how that plays out over the coming quarters. And kind of rolling into that about your thoughts on ethane exports and if you see that as kind of a near-term release valve? Or do you actually think that we're running kind of up against full capacity there?\nMarshall McCrea: Chase, this is Mackie. Yes, we're just so pleased with what we've done as far as building out Marcus Hook and building out Nederland around ethane as we've said, we now have sufficient contracts to expand. However, that will take 3 or 4 years to expand once we get to -- once we make the decision, whether it's in the North or along the Gulf Coast. But the way we look at rejection or recovery is just depends on the region. So from an energy transfer standpoint, we may be projecting ethane in some areas and recovering in others. But right now, we're ethylene prices are and where gas prices are, we are recovering ethane in most of the regions. As you know, a tremendous amount of ethane is rejected daily up in the Northeast. There's a lot of ethane up there for our projects. And then as we head toward a decision to expanding at either Marcus Hook or at Nederland, we'll look at maximizing what we have today. As we've said in our opening remarks, satellite kicked into their second tranche. So we've got that. We also have additional capacity that we will be fully utilizing on a month-to-month basis as the market dictates.\nChase Mulvehill: So another follow-up is just really on Lone Star. If I'm right, I think you've got some latent capacity there. But kind of what I'd like to ask is if there's opportunities for you to kind of work with some of your peers to maybe offload some of their long-haul Permian NGL volumes. I mean, the reason that I asked when your competitors actually laid one of their expansion projects on NGL [Chinook] and maybe somebody else announces something here later this week. But just kind of curious because you do have some latent capacity and just kind of if there's an opportunity for you to work with some of your peers and outflows some of those volumes and help the industry kind of be a little bit more capital efficient.\nMarshall McCrea: Yes, this is Mackie again. Yes, I'd love to know who you're talking about, that's interesting, but please give my telephone number. We certainly would offer transportation to anybody pipe through our -- I mean, natural gas liquids there pipelines. And we feel real good about where we're at we. Over the last several weeks, we've set records out of the Permian. I think we exceeded 860,000 barrels a day. And actually, around our NGL business, we almost hit 1 million barrels here this past week of fractionation at Mont Belvieu with these colder temperatures. So we have the ability to move more volume, significantly more volume out of the Permian as our 2 new cryogenic plants come on by the second quarter of next year. So we certainly have built it to accommodate our own barrels. But you've had the bids out there and they're trying to get their barrels from off below, we would love to hear from.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Marc Solecitto with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMarc Solecitto: So maybe following up on one of the earlier questions around a basis exposure. I think a few quarters ago, you referenced a couple of hundred Mcf that was open with a couple of hundred becoming available over the next couple of years. So just wondering if you are sharing an update if you could provide that?\nMarshall McCrea: Sure. I'll quantify it a little bit with no matter what I say, we are in negotiations on Warrior and that very easily could impact what capacity is available over the next year or 2 because that kind of comes into those negotiations. But notwithstanding that, we've got about -- we've had about 250,000 a day available. As we said in our opening remarks, we've got about another 60,000 coming available the latter part of this year and the first part of next year. So that puts us right around 300,000 a day that we'll have available as we sit here today.\nMarc Solecitto: And then just with respect to the updated guidance. First, I just wanted to clarify whether the previous guidance range included the legal settlement in crude segment. And then as we think about the upward revision, was that mostly a function of just upside to your conservative commodity price assumptions or other operational drivers? And then any variables between the lower and upper end of the revised range. Curious if you have any color there.\nTom Long: Yes, Mark, this is Tom Long. Short answer is that the legal settlement was not included in the previous guidance. So this guidance you see right that we came up with does include the $126 million. But I will tell you it also includes the $130 million for the timing around the mark-to-market on some of the NGLs. So the guidance we're giving you right now of $12.8 billion, $13 billion does now include both of those. But as we highlighted in the prepared remarks, we are expecting the one or most of the 130 to come back to us in the fourth quarter. So keep that in mind that, that guidance does include what occurred in the third quarter, but the reversal of most of it in the fourth quarter. Mark, as far as I think the rest of your question that you were going through, we've always stayed fairly conservative on the commodity prices, and we continue to do that. I think you see with where some of the prices, at least on the natural gas side of it, are going to right now. It was prudent for us to do that. But at the same time, we don't have many months left in the year for much of an impact. You had quite a few other parts of that question, you may need to repeat what part of it I'm not answered here.\nMarc Solecitto: Just as far as within the revised range, the upper and lower end, what are some of the drivers between the upper and lower parts of the range?\nTom Long: It continues to be a pricing that was running a little higher than what we had anticipated. Once again, a little bit of that got shaved off with what you're seeing occur right now in the fourth quarter. The other piece of that is we just continue to have a great commercial team and the optimization efforts that are occurring across our system are really huge compliments to the team and what they're able to do. And so that's probably the primary 2 drivers.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Gabe Moreen with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nGabe Moreen: It may still be a little bit early days, but can you talk about the CapEx outlook for next year? Whether you think you're going higher or lower? I realize there's still a lot of things on the drawing board. But just as you sit here today, kind of directionally where you things may be headed for CapEx next year?\nTom Long: Yes. It's always a good question, okay? We worked hard in trying to hold off until that fourth quarter. And in fairness, a lot of that is because we do have so many great projects, Mackie was going over several of them. So you've got everything from the Lake Charles LNG to the Warrior to several other items, petchem, et cetera. So it's really difficult probably to give you that right now. That's the reason we wait till the end of the fourth quarter to be able to provide that. But we've talked about pretty much everything that's out there that we're seeing. So if you really kind of go back to what guidance we give this year, the $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion, there's not a lot of additional guidance we can give you for next year until we have a little more visibility into those. But as you can see, it's not going to be a really large number.\nGabe Moreen: And then maybe if I can follow up sort of on a 2-part Haynesville pipeline question. I'm just wondering where you guys think you are in terms of, I guess, utilization out of all the multiple straws you have in and out of the Haynesville also, I guess, repricing contracts to market now that, that capacity is really in demand. And the second part would just be kind of an update on Gulf front and the possibility of expanding that with or without Lake Charles?\nMarshall McCrea: Okay. Gabe, this is Mackie again. Yes. What an exciting area, my goodness, who could ever seen this. Maybe [Indiscernible] saw years ago, but when you see these wells coming on to 50,000, 60,000, 70,000 days and holding out for a while, but a great place to own 3, 42-inch pipe and a whole lot of other systems. So we're very excited about that. You touched on some things like we said earlier in our remarks, the rigs is pretty full. So we're looking at backhaul, the some of our Enable assets to get down the cartage and also get to our Gulf Run and Tiger pipelines. So we're doing everything we can to utilize capacity in both directions on all of our pipelines in North Louisiana. Jump in the Gulf Run, very excited to be bringing that on by the end of the year. We've got the 1.65. We have 1.1 Bcf that's sold to Golden Pass for a long-term contract. We also have secured another 350 of that. We've got a couple of hundred left that we are trying to extract as much value as we can as we finalize that. And we're continuing to evaluate what is the next step? Is it adding compression and adding a Bcf? Or is it looping the entire 42-inch? As we get closer and arrive at FID, we hope in the first quarter of next year on the Lake Charles, that will be very much the emphasis behind us probably looping that line, that 42-inch. So that is probably will end up once we get to FID there. But we also may do that anyway. In addition to that, as you said, we're really excited about values on Tiger and on CP, which will be Gulf Run. They narrow down to $0.04, $0.05, $0.06, $0.07, almost given the past way, and we are seeing that move out. And we're excited to see that. We're seeing wider margins. We're seeing a much higher value for gas east of Louisiana as you go further and a real need as you get closer to Florida. So we're very pleased to where we sit, and we will fully utilize those to the maximum at we can for our revenues and our unitholders.\nGabe Moreen: And I have both to locate the ethane export expansion based on who wins the World Series, but I don't want to sure if that's how. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nAnn Salisbury: Your NGL segment was boosted, I think, a bit in the quarter by the Medford frac being down. I think that there's some new third-party frac starting by the end of the year and then early next year. So do you kind of view this as a like a one quarter boost? Or do you -- in your view, is can you kind of maintain that incremental earnings over multiple quarters?\nMarshall McCrea: Ann, this is Mackie again. Yes, I'll kind of step back. We've really seen a tightening of T&F for really that last 18 months or so and over the last 5 or 6 months, early summer, mid-summer, it really got tightened. And now similar to some of the spreads on some of other assets, we're seeing it move out. So if you just look at the frac spreads, we are very optimistic that whatever frac capacity we have available before our eighth frac comes on that will have significant revenues from that capacity. We see a very tightening of it. Yes, there's a frac coming on. One of that's coming on isn't that accessible to Mont Belvieu, the fracs that are more accepted to Mont Belvieu, like ours and a few others really aren't until the third and fourth quarter and into '24 of next year. So there's going to be a tightening of capacity there already is at Mont Belvieu, and we hope to benefit from that as the value of fracking -- fractioning their widens.\nAnn Salisbury: And then can you remind us currently on your Permian crude pipeline, just roughly how much is still take-or-pay? And if there's any recontracting interest yet on the part that's not take pay or if you see that happening in the next couple of years when other pipelines start to roll off?\nMarshall McCrea: Yes. I don't have the exact numbers top off my head of how much take-or-pay, but it's a little bit of a loaded question a sense of what exactly that means. But we feel that pipe up as much as we can on that basis. There is some portion of it is locked in at wider spreads than where we see today. But similar to what we just talked about, we believe, even with the overbuild of of crude oil pipelines, we believe we'll see widening. And the reason we do with some of our customers is what we say on every earnings call and at other times is that we're not just offering Midland to Nederland or Midland to Houston service we're offering blending, we're offering storage. We're offering access into Bayou Bridge or into the header at or author to feed into the refineries as well as at the header systems and other pipeline systems in Houston. So we did see that start to move out here several months ago, and we do expect that to move out more. But we don't have all that old contract that really lit margins. Most of that's kind of way. And we are filling that in daily, monthly and also doing term deals at what we see as slowly widening spreads.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMichael Blum: Just had a couple of questions. One, can you talk about once you get to that $1.22 distribution, I guess, looking into next year, how are you thinking about buybacks distribution growth and I guess, especially in light of rising interest rates?\nTom Long: And we're so thankful to be talking about it from that standpoint versus the other alternatives. So we -- I will tell you, at this point, we are planning this quarter by quarter as far as the distribution side of it and looking at it. There's not been dialogue on anything around the distribution growth. We'll after the bucket 2022 in meeting our targets. So we're going to continue to look at that. When it comes to unit buybacks, I don't want to say that we're going to continue to look at paying down that debt. We really want to get that leverage target in that 4 to 4.5 range. And we'd be quite happy to get it to the -- closer to the 4 range. And we're going to have some opportunities next year with all the free cash flow that we're seeing and some of the debt maturities, we're going to continue to look at that. So we would put that up there higher than unit buyback to get to the lower leverage, but also the great capital projects that we're talking about. Those likewise set up a little bit higher than the unit buyback. So let us get to that point. It is a good healthy discussion we have quarter-by-quarter with our Board of Directors as we look at the distribution and how we're going to do that. But right now, our target is to get to the $1.22. And my gosh, we've made great progress on that. It's great to be here at this level, 70% higher than where we were. So we've executed on it, and it's really looking like we've got ourselves to a great place from that standpoint.\nMichael Blum: And then just wanted to ask on the potential cracker. So obviously, there's some weakness in petchem fundamentals right now, spreads, et cetera. Does that give you pause in terms of making that investment? Does that give you -- make you more likely to want to make that investment? And does it change the calculus between buying versus building?\nMarshall McCrea: Mike, this is Mackie. It certainly gives pause to people that we're trying to take capacity with right now. That's for sure. But the way we're looking at that project is we're not spending a material amount of dollars at this point coincidentally as of today, we have filed a second permit. So in the last couple of days, we filed our TCQ permit, and we filed our core Wetlands permit. So that kind of gets us going. That's -- those are 18- to 24-month processes depending on whether it goes to full on EIS and all that. So we've kind of started that and done all that work. Our team is working diligently with a number of players throughout the country and really the world. And there's a great deal of interest. We do believe we'll get there. But to answer your question, we're not going to get there unless we have sufficient commitments to get us a rate of return that meets our threshold. So if the hesitancy to sign up right now because the crack spreads are so narrow compared to what we need to build it. And we won't get anything signed. But we know the industry, as you and quite a many out there know is very cyclical. And you can generate a lot of income in a short period of time in the good times and then there's tough times. So we're approaching this project like we do everything. We're not going this to speculate to kind in a home run or not from time to time, we're going to line this up with both our partners potentially. As we've said, we anticipate we'll own about 25% at the end of the day, and we expect to bring in partners that will also be part of the yield take. But as we go around all these customers, we continue to hear and believe that this will be the most unique and the most flexible cracker in the world. If you look at the upstream pipeline as we talked about before, our pipeline network to all the refineries to bring butane products and gasoline by products as well as we've got four pipelines that are feeding and we can see enormous amounts of ethylene, propane, butane in natural gasoline to Nederland. And then you look at the takeaway, we'll have the ability to tie the storage for our customers and/or to deliver into ethylene and propylene pipelines and into the export market. So once again, way early but that's going to be one of those projects that if we get to FID, we'll have sufficient commitments, some great customers to have a great project and a rate of return, and we'll have some good partners.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Stanley: Two clarifications. First, Tom, it seems like you were alluding to probably paying down some debt again next year to try to get to the low end of the leverage target. I know the company has a decent amount of maturities for next year. Can you just talk to how you're planning on addressing that? Is it pay some down cash? And then would you look to issue new debt here? Or would you look to leverage your short-term borrowing facilities more?\nTom Long: Yes, Keith, we're clearly looking at paying down as much as we can. They're still a little bit to go as far as getting what our free cash flow is going to be. But in fairness, we do have a very good capacity left on our revolver from our credit facility. So we've got options as to how to navigate that, and we're going to be careful. I don't really want to get out in front of it and try to preannounce. But you nailed it when you said looking at trying to pay down as much as we can of it if not moving some of it to the revolver only because when you look out over the remainder of the year and you see what the free cash flow continues throughout the year, we have a lot of financial flexibility right now is the way I'd like to leave that, and we're going to play the best options we can of reaching all the targets that we want we're going after.\nKeith Stanley: And on Lake Charles, so it sounds like the base case is still for up to a 75% sell-down. But when you talked about 2023 CapEx that's Lake Charles was one of the areas of uncertainty when you look to next year. Are there scenarios where you could possibly need to fund a meaningful amount of Lake Charles next year as part of your capital budget? Or is that pretty unlikely?\nTom Long: That's -- I think funding a meaningful about next year will probably be more of what I would call unlikely probably very unlikely that we would have to do that for next year. But we'll see where it all goes. But at this point, based upon the way we would move through it -- through 2023, we'll leave it in the unlikely category.\nOperator: And our last question today will come from Brian Reynolds with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrian Reynolds: Maybe as one quick follow-up on the capital allocation. I was curious if you could just opine on how the desire for credit rating upgrade influences the timing and financial flexibility for buyback or an additional distribution base? And then maybe perhaps on just the growth CapEx. Having a little bit of priority was just curious as it relates to '23 CapEx specifically, if there's just limited upside to that number at this point given that Lake Charles seems to be pushed out a quarter or two at this point?\nTom Long: Yes. I think best way to start with that one is the target, the 4 to 4.5. Pretty much all 3 agencies put out there that you get to that closer towards maybe the lower end of that range. You're now looking at upgrades. And that is important to us. We really do want to continue to get into that 4, 4.5 and get into that next higher notch on the rating agencies. All the dialogue we had with them has been very constructive, by the way. We think that they hear us. We think we've got a lot of credibility with them. And we're going to continue to have this dialogue with them. And so it remains a priority, I would say, to continue to pay down the debt to get within those targets. Leverage targets that we've got laid out there. The capital portion of your question, we really do -- when you really look at our entire infrastructure, you look at the critical mass we have, et cetera, when we look at these capital projects, they're looking at a much broader benefit that comes to our comes to Energy Transfer. And when the question was asked earlier about what are the drivers on the guidance, continuing to get moved up. And a lot of that is around the optimization. When you really look at all the various access we have to some of the very best pricing points and the flexibility we have around that. A lot of these capital projects are very, very important, and we continue to work on the demand side. We've talked about the Lake Charles LNG. You've heard us talk today a lot about the petchem. We're not trying to own a large percentage of a lot of these a lot of these assets. What we're trying to continue to do is look at the demand side as much as we look at the supply side. So these capital projects are important. We do give them a high priority, and we'll continue to be very disciplined in how we spend every dollar.\nBrian Reynolds: And I guess, just as a quick follow-up, it just seems like there's limited upside to '23 CapEx given those comments at this point.\nTom Long: Yes, I'm sorry, I'm not -- do you mind, Brian one more time?\nBrian Reynolds: New projects coming into the backlog, it seems pretty set from the slide deck that you guys provided that it doesn't seem like any new large projects have come into '23 CapEx and it's really more a '24 and '25 event if those projects come to fruition.\nTom Long: Yes. That's a fair assumption. I'll just leave it as a fairly immaterial amount as far as 2023.\nBrian Reynolds: And then just quickly on the last question. I know we talked a lot about Permian and Haynesville spreads. Curious, is Golden Pass had open capacity all year during 2023? Gulf Run have open capacity, given Golden Pass in come online for another year or so and can effectively benefit from the spreads all year? And then second, is there an open capacity number for the Permian that you guys have provided for '23? That's it for me.\nMarshall McCrea: I might have on the second half of that, I ask again. I didn't understand this is Mackie again. On Gulf Run, yes, we sold 1.1 Bcf a day to Golden Pass and they're paying demand charge. So they are getting geared up where they actually go to use some of that. But -- the way we look at that pipeline is like we look at all of our assets, we will do everything we can to fully utilize in the capacity that's not being utilized regardless of whether it's demand charge being paid for or not. And I'm sorry, your second question, second half?\nBrian Reynolds: Just how much open capacity does Energy Transfer have on the nat gas takeaway side for '23?\nTom Long: Dave talked about earlier. So Yes. As I mentioned earlier, we've got about 250 now. And by the sometime in the end of January, we should have close to, say, approximately $300,000 a day across the state.\nOperator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Long for any closing remarks.\nMarshall McCrea: Yes. And this Mackie, I don't know why I'm compelled to do this, but I'm making a statement real quick. And the reason I we've got an election coming up here in about a week. And also what's driving it is this attack, relentless attack on fossil fuels. And I have teenage boys that are asking the fossil fuels going tomorrow. So I'm going to make a quick statement that will end kind of ironically, and that fossil fuels changed humanity. If you look at over the last 20 years, of these aspirational policies in trillions of dollars with subsidies and with tax expenses and credits, it's barely put a dent and or hasn't been at all the growth in fossil fuels. In fact, I think 3% of electricity demand in the world -- I mean, not demand of electricity production in the world comes from renewables. And as everybody knows on this call, there's thousands of products that we use every day. In fossil fuels has increased our life spans. It's increased our health has increased our standard of living tremendously. It's made us more mobile. Planes, trains and automobiles. It's just been -- it's so impactful to our lives. And I think it's fair to say that modern life with a reasonable standard of living and affordable energy is simply not possible without fossil fuels. And the logical and rational politically we\u2019ve led to renewables will have devastating impacts from the cost, reliability and security of energy around the world, as we're seeing in Europe and other places. And we find it interesting is that the cofounder of a large environmental access organization has come out fairly recently and said that he's now left. And one of the reasons was is that their METRO became within the organization that doesn't matter what the truth is. It matters what the public believes the truth is. So that particular environmental movement has turned to a political movement that is really being perpetuated by the media and by the administration. So statements that have been made recently some kind of play region here is the Energy Transition is not feasible in any meaningful time frame. It is a dangerous dilution to base policies and idea that such a transition is even possible. And so what we believe the transfer is to reduce submissions around this world is build more natural gas-fired generation to replace coal fire generation, send more natural gas liquids around the world, especially to undeveloped world our countries who are burning wood and biomass and animal waste and everything else. That's the solution to all of this. And so I'll end on this irony is that we have an administration right now that came into this and has put in very hostile administrators at FERC and EPA and SEC to attack our industry, and that's gone on for a while within this administration, where they're not allowing new leases, not allowing drilling permits, not allowing or slowing down proof of pipelines. And even going after pigments that have been in service for years and trying to take them out of service in the low hold here, we've got an election coming up and we start gaining the strategic petroleum reserve. And we come out with approaching countries like Venezuela, and countries like Iran, who just promote terrorism or hate the U.S. to try to get into produce more oil. And then what do we do the last few days, we come out and attack our oil and gas producers and say they're going to be penalized for not producing more. I mean, my goodness, if this doesn't seem like a sitcom or Saturday Night Live skit, it'd be funny if it wasn't so tragically sad. And sorry to get it from this podium, but I guess we're turning tired of being attacked in the fossil fuel business. I'm tired to my voice here tonight. So anyway, Tom, do you want to close?\nTom Long: Listen, we -- as always, we thank all of you for joining us today, and we really do appreciate your support. Look forward to talking to you in the near future.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Tom Long",
            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer third quarter 2022 earnings call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team, who are here to help answer your questions after the prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, which we expect to be filed this Thursday, November 3. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'll start today by going over our third quarter financial results. We were pleased to report another strong quarter during which we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $3.1 billion, which was up approximately 20% compared to $2.6 billion for the third quarter of 2021. In the third quarter, we experienced a nonrecurring $126 million charge in the crude oil segment related to the resolution of a prior year legal metal. In addition, we had an approximately $130 million negative impact due to the timing of the recognition of gains on hedged inventory in the NGL and refined products segment. Absent these 2 items, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter would have been $3.34 billion. Results for the third quarter benefited from higher volumes across all of our segments, including record volumes in the Midstream, intrastate, crude oil and through our fractionators. In addition, the acquisition of the Enable assets in December of 2021 contributed to our growth over the prior period. DCF attributable to the partners, as adjusted, was $1.6 billion for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $1.3 billion for the third quarter of 2021. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $760 million. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of approximately $265 million after distributions of $819 million and growth capital of approximately $500 million. On October 25, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.265 per common unit or $1.06 on an annualized basis. This distribution will be paid on November 21 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on November 4. This distribution represents a more than 70% increase over the third quarter of 2021. As a reminder, future increases to the distribution level will be evaluated quarterly with the ultimate goal of returning distributions to the previous level of $0.305 per quarter or $1.22 on an annualized basis while balancing our leverage target, growth opportunities and unit buybacks. As of September 30, 2022, the total available liquidity under our revolving credit facility was approximately $2.32 billion. Now turning to our results by segment. I'll start with the NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was $634 million compared to $706 million for the same period last year. This change was primarily due to the previously mentioned $130 million negative impact due to the timing of the recognition of gains on hedged NGL inventory during the current period. We expect to fully realize the offsetting gains on our financial derivatives and physical forward sales as the majority settle in the fourth quarter with a small amount settling in the first quarter of 2023. Adjusting for the noncash timing matter around hedging, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter would have been $764 million. Results in this segment were otherwise driven by higher fractionation, transportation, terminal services and storage margins related to increased volumes and higher rates. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines increased to 1.9 million barrels per day compared to 1.8 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes on our NGL pipelines that deliver into our Nederland Terminal as well as a record volumes on the combined Mariner East pipelines. And our average fractionated volumes set a new partnership record, averaging 940,000 barrels per day compared to 884,000 barrels per day for the third quarter of 2021. NGL export volumes significantly exceeded the third quarter of last year, driven by record ethane exports out of both Nederland and Marcus Hook. At Nederland, this was driven by the second tranche of satellites contract going into effect on July 1, which doubled the volume commitments from the initial term. Year-to-date, we have loaded approximately 29 million barrels of ethane out of Nederland. And for full year 2022, we expect to load more than 40 million barrels of ethane out of Nederland, with that increasing to approximately 60 million barrels for 2023. In total, we continue to export more NGLs than any other company or country with our percentage of worldwide NGL exports remaining at approximately 20% of the world market. For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $868 million compared to $556 million for the third quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to the increased throughput and in all of our operating regions, favorable natural gas and NGL prices and the acquisition of the Enable assets in December of 2021. Gathered gas volumes were a record 19.1 million MMBtu's per day compared to 13 million MMBtu's per day for the same period last year. Excluding Enable, Gathered gas volumes on our legacy assets were also a partnership record for the third quarter. Permian Basin and inlet volumes remain at or near record highs. We continue to utilize the Permian bridge daily to optimize our available processing capacity as we await the completion of 2 new plants that are currently under construction. For the crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $461 million compared to $496 million for the same period last year. Earnings were offset by a $126 million charge related to the resolution of our prior year legal matter. Absent this charge, adjusted EBITDA would have been $587 million for the third quarter of 2022. These results were otherwise driven by improved performance on our Bakken pipeline, increased throughput at our Gulf Coast terminals, stronger refinery utilization and higher export demand as well as the addition of the Enable assets in December of 2021. Crude oil transportation volumes increased to a record 4.6 million barrels per day compared to 4.2 million barrels per day for the same period last year, driven by higher crude oil prices and strong refinery demand as well as the addition of the Ted Collins Link and Cushing South pipelines and increased throughput through our Houston terminal. Excluding Enable, crude oil transportation volumes were also a record for the third quarter. In our intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $409 million compared to $334 million for the third quarter of 2021. During the quarter, we benefited from increased rates, higher production in the Haynesville Shale that drove greater utilization on Tiger improved demand on trunk line and line CP as well as the addition of the other interstate enabled assets. We continue to see heavy utilization on many of our interstate pipelines, including Tiger, FTT, Stash and Rover. And for our intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $301 million compared to $172 million for the third quarter of last year. This was primarily due to higher optimization opportunities, increased retained fuel revenues related to higher natural gas prices as well as the addition of the Enable assets. Utilization of our HPL system remains strong due to the increased demand for gas takeaway and our rig pipeline system continues to flow at or near capacity due to increased activity in the Haynesville. Turning to a brief update on our M&A activity. In August of this year, we completed the sale of our 51% interest in Energy Transfer Canada for cash proceeds of approximately $300 million. The sale reduced our consolidated debt by approximately $850 million. It also allowed us to divest of these noncore assets at an attractive valuation and utilize the cash proceeds to further deleverage our balance sheet and redeploy capital within our U.S. footprint. And in September of this year, we completed our acquisition of the Woodford Express LLC, which owns a Mid-Continent gas gathering and processing system for approximately $485 million. This bolt-on opportunity provided roughly 400 million cubic foot per day of cryogenic gas processing and treating capacity in Grady County, Oklahoma as well as more than 200 miles of low and mid pressure gathering lines in the heart of the SCOOP play. The assets are already connected to our inter and intrastate systems as well as our gas gathering system. The system is supported by dedicated acreage with long-term, predominantly fixed fee contracts. Now looking at recent developments at our ongoing growth projects. Year-to-date, Lake Charles LNG has executed 6 LNG offtake agreements for an aggregate of nearly 8 million tons per annum, including a 20-year LNG agreement with Shell LNG LLC that was executed in August. As we have previously stated, we expect to finance a significant portion of the capital cost of this project by means of the sale of equity in the project to infrastructure funds and possibly to one and more industry participants in conjunction with LNG offtake agreements. We have recently signed nonbinding letter agreements with two Japanese customers for LNG offtake and we are in active negotiations with several customers for long-term offtake contracts for significant volumes of LNG. We are making progress on all aspects of the project and we're now targeting FID by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Upon completion of the LNG project, we expect to realize significant incremental cash flows from transportation of natural gas on our Trunkline pipeline system and other energy transfer pipelines upstream from Lake Charles. We believe that our Lake Charles LNG project will provide an important contribution towards solving the growing global energy demand. As a reminder, our Mariner East pipeline system is fully commissioned and capable to transform more than 365,000 barrels per day, including ethane. As we have previously mentioned, we completed work at our Marcus Hook terminal to allow us to increase ethane exports out of Marcus Hook. As a result, we reached a new record for ethane exports out of our Marcus Hook terminal in the third quarter. NGL demand both in the U.S. as well as from overseas customers continues to increase, and we have sufficient commitments to move forward with an ethane export expansion. Even though we expect to expand our ethane export capabilities at both our Marcus Hook and Nederland Terminals, these commitments provide us with the optionality to initially expand at either terminal. Construction of Frac VIII continues to schedule, and we expect it to be in service in the third quarter of 2023, which will bring our total Mont Belvieu fractionation capacity to over 1.1 million barrels per day. Construction of our new 200 million cubic foot per day Grey Wolf processing plant in the Delaware Basin is underway. This plan is supported by new commitments and growth from existing customer contracts and remains on schedule to be in service by the end of 2022. Construction is underway on the Bear plant, our second 200 million cubic foot per day processing plant also located in the Delaware Basin, which was accelerated to meet growing demand. We expect this plant to be in service in the second quarter of 2023. In addition, given the significant amount of demand we're seeing, we are evaluating the necessity and potential timing of adding another processing plant in the region. Mainline construction of the Gulf Run pipeline was only finished, and we expect to complete the modification of compression by the end of this year. Gulf Run, which is a 42-inch interstate natural gas pipeline with 1.65 Bcf per day of capacity will provide natural gas transportation between our upstream pipeline network and from the Haynesville Shale for delivery to the Gulf Coast, connecting some of the most prolific natural gas-producing regions in the U.S. with the LNG export market. It is backed by a 20-year commitment for 1.1 Bcf per day for Golden Pass LNG, and we recently concluded a nonbinding open season on Gulf Run due to the growing product demand. We're pleased with the results of the open season and customer discussions are ongoing, which will likely necessitate additional facilities beyond the initial design of the 1.65 Bcf per day. Modernization and debottlenecking work on Oasis pipeline continues, which will add an incremental 60,000 Mcf per day of much needed capacity out of the Permian Basin. We expect it to be partially in service by the end of this year with full service by the end of January of 2023. In addition to these ongoing projects, we continue to evaluate and have customer discussions regarding a number of other projects that, over the long term, could provide significant upside to our business. These include the Warrior Pipeline project, which is the most optimal solution for customers to transport gas out of the Permian as well as opportunities to develop a petchem project on the Gulf Coast or acquired petchem facilities. We remain optimistic that we can bring these projects to FID and look forward to sharing any significant updates on these projects at the appropriate time. On the alternative energy front, our focus remains on reducing emissions across our pipelines, including pursuing a number of projects related to carbon capture and sequestration, enhanced oil recovery for use in the food and beverage industries as well as sequestering CO2 from our proposed Lake Charles LNG liquefaction facility. We'll be excited to update you once we have a project and specific agreement in place. Looking at our growth capital spend for the 9 months ended September 30, 2022, Energy Transfer spent approximately $1.3 billion on organic growth projects, primarily in the midstream, intrastate and NGL refined products segment, excluding SUN and USA Compression CapEx. For full year 2022, we expect growth capital expenditures to be near the high end of our range of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. Over 90% of our 2022 growth capital spend is comprised of projects that are already online or are expected to be online and contributing cash flow before the end of 2023, at very attractive returns. We will provide our 2023 growth capital outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call. For 2022, adjusted EBITDA guidance given our strong performance for the first 9 months of the year as well as continued demand for our products and services, we now expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between $12.8 billion and $13 million. This is up compared to our previous guidance of $12.6 billion to $12.8 billion. Overall, our outlook is strong as we have a stable business that has demonstrated its ability to manage through various market cycles. And we expect future growth to be supported by production, improvements, improved market conditions, increased utilization of our existing assets as well as strong domestic and international demand for our products. We remain bullish about the future of our industry and the growing worldwide demand for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. We expect to reach our leverage target range of 4 times to 4.5 times by the end of 2022 to continue to strategically allocate our cash flow in a manner that best positions us to further improve our financial flexibility and leverage, invest in high-returning growth projects and return value to our unitholders. As we look for additional ways to address existing and new demand for our products, we will continue to pursue strategic growth projects that enhance our existing asset base and generate attractive returns as part of our capital allocation strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line up for our first question. Yes, Mark, this is Tom Long. Short answer is that the legal settlement was not included in the previous guidance. So this guidance you see right that we came up with does include the $126 million. But I will tell you it also includes the $130 million for the timing around the mark-to-market on some of the NGLs. So the guidance we're giving you right now of $12.8 billion, $13 billion does now include both of those. But as we highlighted in the prepared remarks, we are expecting the one or most of the 130 to come back to us in the fourth quarter. So keep that in mind that, that guidance does include what occurred in the third quarter, but the reversal of most of it in the fourth quarter. Mark, as far as I think the rest of your question that you were going through, we've always stayed fairly conservative on the commodity prices, and we continue to do that. I think you see with where some of the prices, at least on the natural gas side of it, are going to right now. It was prudent for us to do that. But at the same time, we don't have many months left in the year for much of an impact. You had quite a few other parts of that question, you may need to repeat what part of it I'm not answered here. It continues to be a pricing that was running a little higher than what we had anticipated. Once again, a little bit of that got shaved off with what you're seeing occur right now in the fourth quarter. The other piece of that is we just continue to have a great commercial team and the optimization efforts that are occurring across our system are really huge compliments to the team and what they're able to do. And so that's probably the primary 2 drivers. Yes. It's always a good question, okay? We worked hard in trying to hold off until that fourth quarter. And in fairness, a lot of that is because we do have so many great projects, Mackie was going over several of them. So you've got everything from the Lake Charles LNG to the Warrior to several other items, petchem, et cetera. So it's really difficult probably to give you that right now. That's the reason we wait till the end of the fourth quarter to be able to provide that. But we've talked about pretty much everything that's out there that we're seeing. So if you really kind of go back to what guidance we give this year, the $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion, there's not a lot of additional guidance we can give you for next year until we have a little more visibility into those. But as you can see, it's not going to be a really large number. And we're so thankful to be talking about it from that standpoint versus the other alternatives. So we -- I will tell you, at this point, we are planning this quarter by quarter as far as the distribution side of it and looking at it. There's not been dialogue on anything around the distribution growth. We'll after the bucket 2022 in meeting our targets. So we're going to continue to look at that. When it comes to unit buybacks, I don't want to say that we're going to continue to look at paying down that debt. We really want to get that leverage target in that 4 to 4.5 range. And we'd be quite happy to get it to the -- closer to the 4 range. And we're going to have some opportunities next year with all the free cash flow that we're seeing and some of the debt maturities, we're going to continue to look at that. So we would put that up there higher than unit buyback to get to the lower leverage, but also the great capital projects that we're talking about. Those likewise set up a little bit higher than the unit buyback. So let us get to that point. It is a good healthy discussion we have quarter-by-quarter with our Board of Directors as we look at the distribution and how we're going to do that. But right now, our target is to get to the $1.22. And my gosh, we've made great progress on that. It's great to be here at this level, 70% higher than where we were. So we've executed on it, and it's really looking like we've got ourselves to a great place from that standpoint. Yes, Keith, we're clearly looking at paying down as much as we can. They're still a little bit to go as far as getting what our free cash flow is going to be. But in fairness, we do have a very good capacity left on our revolver from our credit facility. So we've got options as to how to navigate that, and we're going to be careful. I don't really want to get out in front of it and try to preannounce. But you nailed it when you said looking at trying to pay down as much as we can of it if not moving some of it to the revolver only because when you look out over the remainder of the year and you see what the free cash flow continues throughout the year, we have a lot of financial flexibility right now is the way I'd like to leave that, and we're going to play the best options we can of reaching all the targets that we want we're going after. That's -- I think funding a meaningful about next year will probably be more of what I would call unlikely probably very unlikely that we would have to do that for next year. But we'll see where it all goes. But at this point, based upon the way we would move through it -- through 2023, we'll leave it in the unlikely category. Yes. I think best way to start with that one is the target, the 4 to 4.5. Pretty much all 3 agencies put out there that you get to that closer towards maybe the lower end of that range. You're now looking at upgrades. And that is important to us. We really do want to continue to get into that 4, 4.5 and get into that next higher notch on the rating agencies. All the dialogue we had with them has been very constructive, by the way. We think that they hear us. We think we've got a lot of credibility with them. And we're going to continue to have this dialogue with them. And so it remains a priority, I would say, to continue to pay down the debt to get within those targets. Leverage targets that we've got laid out there. The capital portion of your question, we really do -- when you really look at our entire infrastructure, you look at the critical mass we have, et cetera, when we look at these capital projects, they're looking at a much broader benefit that comes to our comes to Energy Transfer. And when the question was asked earlier about what are the drivers on the guidance, continuing to get moved up. And a lot of that is around the optimization. When you really look at all the various access we have to some of the very best pricing points and the flexibility we have around that. A lot of these capital projects are very, very important, and we continue to work on the demand side. We've talked about the Lake Charles LNG. You've heard us talk today a lot about the petchem. We're not trying to own a large percentage of a lot of these a lot of these assets. What we're trying to continue to do is look at the demand side as much as we look at the supply side. So these capital projects are important. We do give them a high priority, and we'll continue to be very disciplined in how we spend every dollar. Yes, I'm sorry, I'm not -- do you mind, Brian one more time? Yes. That's a fair assumption. I'll just leave it as a fairly immaterial amount as far as 2023. Dave talked about earlier. So Yes. As I mentioned earlier, we've got about 250 now. And by the sometime in the end of January, we should have close to, say, approximately $300,000 a day across the state. Listen, we -- as always, we thank all of you for joining us today, and we really do appreciate your support. Look forward to talking to you in the near future."

            "content": "Jeremy, great question. A lot of moving parts to your question, but as is in the LNG world right now. Obviously, as you've touched on, the EPC costs have escalated since our first bid we got 2 years ago, and that had an impact on pricing of liquefaction. We have made good progress in increasing our liquefaction charge as we progress with new contracts. And we're excited about where we are in terms of being a bigger company with a strong balance sheet and a great natural gas pipeline network. We are one of the strongest with a brownfield facility with storage tanks and docs, we're really good position to get to the goal line."

            "name": "Marshall McCrea",
            "content": "Yes, Jeremy. This is Mackie. We continue to be very excited about that project as we've experienced the last 2 or 3 weeks when there's any kind of a blip on any pipeline that's moving gas out of the Permian Basin. We see these wide spreads. We do like most industry believe that as we get deeper in this year and throughout most of the next 2 years, it's going to get back. The base is going to blow out. We do sit in a very fortunate situation that we do have capacity available today, that actually gets a little bit more over the next few years across the state. So we will be able to benefit from those wider spreads. But at the same time, we offer the team diligently working towards getting to the finish line on Warrior after the announcement of this other 42-inch line, it's going to move a couple of Bcf across. It's kind of slowed things down. But we will be the next pipeline that's announced out of there. We are not for the best option for anybody coming out of the Permian Basin, whether it's Delaware or Midland by Katy ship channel as well as other really good markets off of our interstate systems. So we're keeping our head down, but we're going to be very prudent when we make that decision, and we hope to that in the next couple of quarters. Chase, this is Mackie. Yes, we're just so pleased with what we've done as far as building out Marcus Hook and building out Nederland around ethane as we've said, we now have sufficient contracts to expand. However, that will take 3 or 4 years to expand once we get to -- once we make the decision, whether it's in the North or along the Gulf Coast. But the way we look at rejection or recovery is just depends on the region. So from an energy transfer standpoint, we may be projecting ethane in some areas and recovering in others. But right now, we're ethylene prices are and where gas prices are, we are recovering ethane in most of the regions. As you know, a tremendous amount of ethane is rejected daily up in the Northeast. There's a lot of ethane up there for our projects. And then as we head toward a decision to expanding at either Marcus Hook or at Nederland, we'll look at maximizing what we have today. As we've said in our opening remarks, satellite kicked into their second tranche. So we've got that. We also have additional capacity that we will be fully utilizing on a month-to-month basis as the market dictates. Yes, this is Mackie again. Yes, I'd love to know who you're talking about, that's interesting, but please give my telephone number. We certainly would offer transportation to anybody pipe through our -- I mean, natural gas liquids there pipelines. And we feel real good about where we're at we. Over the last several weeks, we've set records out of the Permian. I think we exceeded 860,000 barrels a day. And actually, around our NGL business, we almost hit 1 million barrels here this past week of fractionation at Mont Belvieu with these colder temperatures. So we have the ability to move more volume, significantly more volume out of the Permian as our 2 new cryogenic plants come on by the second quarter of next year. So we certainly have built it to accommodate our own barrels. But you've had the bids out there and they're trying to get their barrels from off below, we would love to hear from. Sure. I'll quantify it a little bit with no matter what I say, we are in negotiations on Warrior and that very easily could impact what capacity is available over the next year or 2 because that kind of comes into those negotiations. But notwithstanding that, we've got about -- we've had about 250,000 a day available. As we said in our opening remarks, we've got about another 60,000 coming available the latter part of this year and the first part of next year. So that puts us right around 300,000 a day that we'll have available as we sit here today. Okay. Gabe, this is Mackie again. Yes. What an exciting area, my goodness, who could ever seen this. Maybe [Indiscernible] saw years ago, but when you see these wells coming on to 50,000, 60,000, 70,000 days and holding out for a while, but a great place to own 3, 42-inch pipe and a whole lot of other systems. So we're very excited about that. You touched on some things like we said earlier in our remarks, the rigs is pretty full. So we're looking at backhaul, the some of our Enable assets to get down the cartage and also get to our Gulf Run and Tiger pipelines. So we're doing everything we can to utilize capacity in both directions on all of our pipelines in North Louisiana. Jump in the Gulf Run, very excited to be bringing that on by the end of the year. We've got the 1.65. We have 1.1 Bcf that's sold to Golden Pass for a long-term contract. We also have secured another 350 of that. We've got a couple of hundred left that we are trying to extract as much value as we can as we finalize that. And we're continuing to evaluate what is the next step? Is it adding compression and adding a Bcf? Or is it looping the entire 42-inch? As we get closer and arrive at FID, we hope in the first quarter of next year on the Lake Charles, that will be very much the emphasis behind us probably looping that line, that 42-inch. So that is probably will end up once we get to FID there. But we also may do that anyway. In addition to that, as you said, we're really excited about values on Tiger and on CP, which will be Gulf Run. They narrow down to $0.04, $0.05, $0.06, $0.07, almost given the past way, and we are seeing that move out. And we're excited to see that. We're seeing wider margins. We're seeing a much higher value for gas east of Louisiana as you go further and a real need as you get closer to Florida. So we're very pleased to where we sit, and we will fully utilize those to the maximum at we can for our revenues and our unitholders. Ann, this is Mackie again. Yes, I'll kind of step back. We've really seen a tightening of T&F for really that last 18 months or so and over the last 5 or 6 months, early summer, mid-summer, it really got tightened. And now similar to some of the spreads on some of other assets, we're seeing it move out. So if you just look at the frac spreads, we are very optimistic that whatever frac capacity we have available before our eighth frac comes on that will have significant revenues from that capacity. We see a very tightening of it. Yes, there's a frac coming on. One of that's coming on isn't that accessible to Mont Belvieu, the fracs that are more accepted to Mont Belvieu, like ours and a few others really aren't until the third and fourth quarter and into '24 of next year. So there's going to be a tightening of capacity there already is at Mont Belvieu, and we hope to benefit from that as the value of fracking -- fractioning their widens. Yes. I don't have the exact numbers top off my head of how much take-or-pay, but it's a little bit of a loaded question a sense of what exactly that means. But we feel that pipe up as much as we can on that basis. There is some portion of it is locked in at wider spreads than where we see today. But similar to what we just talked about, we believe, even with the overbuild of of crude oil pipelines, we believe we'll see widening. And the reason we do with some of our customers is what we say on every earnings call and at other times is that we're not just offering Midland to Nederland or Midland to Houston service we're offering blending, we're offering storage. We're offering access into Bayou Bridge or into the header at or author to feed into the refineries as well as at the header systems and other pipeline systems in Houston. So we did see that start to move out here several months ago, and we do expect that to move out more. But we don't have all that old contract that really lit margins. Most of that's kind of way. And we are filling that in daily, monthly and also doing term deals at what we see as slowly widening spreads. Mike, this is Mackie. It certainly gives pause to people that we're trying to take capacity with right now. That's for sure. But the way we're looking at that project is we're not spending a material amount of dollars at this point coincidentally as of today, we have filed a second permit. So in the last couple of days, we filed our TCQ permit, and we filed our core Wetlands permit. So that kind of gets us going. That's -- those are 18- to 24-month processes depending on whether it goes to full on EIS and all that. So we've kind of started that and done all that work. Our team is working diligently with a number of players throughout the country and really the world. And there's a great deal of interest. We do believe we'll get there. But to answer your question, we're not going to get there unless we have sufficient commitments to get us a rate of return that meets our threshold. So if the hesitancy to sign up right now because the crack spreads are so narrow compared to what we need to build it. And we won't get anything signed. But we know the industry, as you and quite a many out there know is very cyclical. And you can generate a lot of income in a short period of time in the good times and then there's tough times. So we're approaching this project like we do everything. We're not going this to speculate to kind in a home run or not from time to time, we're going to line this up with both our partners potentially. As we've said, we anticipate we'll own about 25% at the end of the day, and we expect to bring in partners that will also be part of the yield take. But as we go around all these customers, we continue to hear and believe that this will be the most unique and the most flexible cracker in the world. If you look at the upstream pipeline as we talked about before, our pipeline network to all the refineries to bring butane products and gasoline by products as well as we've got four pipelines that are feeding and we can see enormous amounts of ethylene, propane, butane in natural gasoline to Nederland. And then you look at the takeaway, we'll have the ability to tie the storage for our customers and/or to deliver into ethylene and propylene pipelines and into the export market. So once again, way early but that's going to be one of those projects that if we get to FID, we'll have sufficient commitments, some great customers to have a great project and a rate of return, and we'll have some good partners. I might have on the second half of that, I ask again. I didn't understand this is Mackie again. On Gulf Run, yes, we sold 1.1 Bcf a day to Golden Pass and they're paying demand charge. So they are getting geared up where they actually go to use some of that. But -- the way we look at that pipeline is like we look at all of our assets, we will do everything we can to fully utilize in the capacity that's not being utilized regardless of whether it's demand charge being paid for or not. And I'm sorry, your second question, second half? Yes. And this Mackie, I don't know why I'm compelled to do this, but I'm making a statement real quick. And the reason I we've got an election coming up here in about a week. And also what's driving it is this attack, relentless attack on fossil fuels. And I have teenage boys that are asking the fossil fuels going tomorrow. So I'm going to make a quick statement that will end kind of ironically, and that fossil fuels changed humanity. If you look at over the last 20 years, of these aspirational policies in trillions of dollars with subsidies and with tax expenses and credits, it's barely put a dent and or hasn't been at all the growth in fossil fuels. In fact, I think 3% of electricity demand in the world -- I mean, not demand of electricity production in the world comes from renewables. And as everybody knows on this call, there's thousands of products that we use every day. In fossil fuels has increased our life spans. It's increased our health has increased our standard of living tremendously. It's made us more mobile. Planes, trains and automobiles. It's just been -- it's so impactful to our lives. And I think it's fair to say that modern life with a reasonable standard of living and affordable energy is simply not possible without fossil fuels. And the logical and rational politically we've led to renewables will have devastating impacts from the cost, reliability and security of energy around the world, as we're seeing in Europe and other places. And we find it interesting is that the cofounder of a large environmental access organization has come out fairly recently and said that he's now left. And one of the reasons was is that their METRO became within the organization that doesn't matter what the truth is. It matters what the public believes the truth is. So that particular environmental movement has turned to a political movement that is really being perpetuated by the media and by the administration. So statements that have been made recently some kind of play region here is the Energy Transition is not feasible in any meaningful time frame. It is a dangerous dilution to base policies and idea that such a transition is even possible. And so what we believe the transfer is to reduce submissions around this world is build more natural gas-fired generation to replace coal fire generation, send more natural gas liquids around the world, especially to undeveloped world our countries who are burning wood and biomass and animal waste and everything else. That's the solution to all of this. And so I'll end on this irony is that we have an administration right now that came into this and has put in very hostile administrators at FERC and EPA and SEC to attack our industry, and that's gone on for a while within this administration, where they're not allowing new leases, not allowing drilling permits, not allowing or slowing down proof of pipelines. And even going after pigments that have been in service for years and trying to take them out of service in the low hold here, we've got an election coming up and we start gaining the strategic petroleum reserve. And we come out with approaching countries like Venezuela, and countries like Iran, who just promote terrorism or hate the U.S. to try to get into produce more oil. And then what do we do the last few days, we come out and attack our oil and gas producers and say they're going to be penalized for not producing more. I mean, my goodness, if this doesn't seem like a sitcom or Saturday Night Live skit, it'd be funny if it wasn't so tragically sad. And sorry to get it from this podium, but I guess we're turning tired of being attacked in the fossil fuel business. I'm tired to my voice here tonight. So anyway, Tom, do you want to close?"

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Tom Long, Energy Transfer's Co-CEO. Mr. Long, you may begin.\nTom Long: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer second quarter 2022 earnings call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team, who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, as well the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, which we expect to be filed tomorrow, August 4. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You will find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'd like to start today by looking at some of our second quarter highlights. We were pleased to report another strong quarter, during which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.23 billion and DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, was $1.88 billion. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $1.17 billion. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of approximately $730 million after distributions of $710 million and growth capital of approximately $440 million. On July 26, we announced a quarterly distribution of $0.23 per common unit or $0.92 on an annualized basis, which represents a more than 50% increase over the second quarter of 2021. As a reminder, future increases to distribution level will be evaluated quarterly with the ultimate goal of returning distributions to the previous level of $0.305 per quarter or $1.22 on an annualized basis while balancing our leverage target, growth opportunities and unit buybacks. Operationally, our diverse asset base saw throughput increases across all of our segments as rig counts continue to improve across the U.S., and we saw record midstream volumes as well record throughput on our NGL transportation pipelines, Mont Belvieu fractionators and terminals. In addition, construction continues to progress on several of our growth projects, which I will provide more details on shortly. I'll start with a brief update on the sale of Energy Transfer Canada. In March of this year, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our 51% interest in Energy Transfer Canada for cash proceeds of approximately $270 million. In addition, the sale is expected to reduce our consolidated debt by approximately $550 million. This sale allows us to divest of these noncore assets at an attractive valuation and utilize the cash proceeds to further deleverage our balance sheet and redeploy capital within our U.S. footprint. The transaction remains on track, and we continue to expect it to close this month. This week, Energy Transfer signed an agreement to acquire Woodford Express, LLC, a Mid-Continent gas gathering and processing system for approximately $485 million. This bolt-on opportunity will provide a roughly 450 million cubic foot per day of cryogenic gas processing and treating capacity in Grady County, Oklahoma as well more than 200 miles of low and mid-pressure gathering lines in the heart of the SCOOP play. The assets are already connected to our inter and intrastate systems as well our gas gathering system. The system is supported by dedicated acreage with long-term predominantly fixed fee contracts with active proven producers. We're excited to have these strong assets, quality customer contracts and established operations to our footprint in the Mid-Continent, all at an attractive valuation that will be immediately accretive to Energy Transfer unitholders. This transaction is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of this year, subject to regulatory review and other customary closing conditions. Now I'll walk you through recent developments and other growth projects. Year-to-date, Lake Charles LNG has executed five LNG offtake agreements for an aggregate of 5.8 million tons per annum. The purchase price in all these agreements is indexed to the Henry Hub benchmark plus a fixed liquefaction charge and the LNG will be delivered on to customer vessels on an FOB basis. The agreements will become fully effective upon the satisfaction of the conditions precedent by Energy Transfer LNG, including reaching FID. We're also in active negotiations with a number of other high-quality customers as we expect to make announcements of additional offtake agreements in the weeks ahead. As we previously stated, we expect to finance a significant portion of the of the capital cost of this project by means sale of equity in the project to infrastructure funds and possibly to one or more industry participants in conjunction with LNG offtake agreements. We continue to work toward achieving FID for this project by the end of this year, and we expect that our anticipated announcements of additional long-term LNG offtake agreements over the next several weeks will keep us on track for meeting this objective. Upon completion of the LNG project, we expect to realize significant incremental cash flows from transportation of natural gas on our trunk line pipeline system and other energy transfer pipelines upstream from Lake Charles. Recent events in Europe highlight the importance of LNG from the United States, a country with abundant natural gas supply and government support for LNG exports. These events have caused companies around the world to place increased importance on long-term security of natural gas supply. We believe that our Lake Charles LNG project will be a significant factor in the long-term solutions for global energy needs. Looking at the Mariner East pipeline system, which is fully commissioned and capable of transporting more than 365,000 barrels per day, including ethylene. For the second quarter of 2022, NGL volumes through both the Mariner East pipeline system and Marcus Hook terminal reached new records. And in July, we set a monthly throughput record for the combined Mariner East pipes, and we continue to see strong utilization of these pipes. In addition, we recently completed work at the terminal to allow us to increase the ethane exports out of Marcus Hook, and we continue evaluate all options to achieve incremental ethane and LPG exports out of Marcus Hook until we complete an expansion of the terminal. At our expanded Nederland Terminal, NGL export volumes were very strong during the second quarter, including export volumes under our ethane export joint venture. We had a record in the second quarter for ethane exports and year-to-date, we have loaded nearly 18 million barrels of ethane out the facility. The second tranche of satellites contract went into effect on July 1, which doubles the volume commitments from the initial term and we loaded the first vessel under this demand base agreement in July. For full year 2022, we continue to expect to load more than 40 million barrels of ethane with that increasing to as high 60 million barrels for 2023.  In total, we continue to export more NGLs than any other company or country, and our percentage of worldwide NGL exports remain at approximately 20% of the world market. We continue to see increase in NGL demand, both in the U.S. as well as from overseas customers seeking additional supply from the U.S., and we have sufficient commitments to move forward on an ethane export expansion. Even though we expect to expand our ethane export capabilities at both our Marcus Hook and Nederland terminals, these commitments provide us with the optionality of initially expanding at either terminal. In addition, due to the significant tightening and fractionation capacity, we recently resumed construction on Frac VIII, which was more than half funded when construction was paused in 2020. Frac VIII is expected to be in service in the third quarter of 2023 and will bring our total Mont Belvieu fractionation capacity to over 1.1 million barrels per day. In the second quarter, our Permian Basin plant inlet processing volumes were approximately 2.2 Bcf per day, which is a new record and due to significant producer demand and continued growth around the Permian Basin gathering and processing assets, we are adding additional capacity to meet increasing production from the basin. Construction of our new 200 million cubic foot per day GrayWolf processing plant in the Delaware Basin is underway. This plan is supported by new commitments and growth from existing customer contracts and remains on schedule to be in service by the end of this year. We are also moving forward with a second 200 million cubic foot per day processing plant in the Permian Basin. A portion of the growth capital associated with the Bear plant was included in our previous forecast, but we have accelerated some spend into 2022 to expedite the completion of this plant in order to meet growing demand. This plan is expected to be serviced in the second quarter of 2023. In addition, given the significant amount of demand we're seeing we are evaluating the necessity and potential timing of adding another processing plant in the region. Once in service, the volumes from tailgate of these plants will utilize our gas and NGL pipelines for takeaway, providing revenue streams for our intrastate and NGL segments on top of the incremental revenue for our midstream segment. In the meantime, we continue to heavily utilize the Permian be project to provide operational flexibility between our processing facilities in the Delaware and the Midland Basin. Crude terminal throughput increased nearly 20% over the second quarter of last year, driven by increased upstream pipeline throughput, a strategic petroleum reserve drawdown and additional market connectivity via the Ted Collins Link. At our Nederland Terminal, we have recently seen record crude volumes destined for the refinery and export markets. Overall, we expect to see exports continue to stay strong, largely due to the Ted Collins Link, which provides our systems with more market connectivity and access to deeper water as well as a quality management program, which ensures a higher-quality Midland WTI barrel as desired by our customers. We continue to make progress on the construction of the Gulf Run Pipeline, which is a 42-inch interstate natural gas pipeline with 1.65 Bcf per day of capacity. Gulf Run is backed by a 20-year commitment for 1.1 Bcf per day from Golden Pass LNG and will provide natural gas transportation between the Haynesville Shale and the Gulf Coast, connecting some of the most perfect natural gas producing regions in the U.S. with the LNG export market. Gulf Run remains on schedule to be complete by the end of this year. We recently completed a nonbinding open season Gulf Run due to growing producer demand. We were pleased with the results of the open season and customer discussions are ongoing, which will likely necessitate additional facilities beyond the initial design of 1.65 Bcf per day. Turning to the Warrior Pipeline Project, which is the most optimal solution for customers to transport gas out of the Permian in regard to timing, cost, flexibility and access premium markets. We are still evaluating the construction of this new intrastate pipeline from the Midland Basin to our extensive pipeline network south of the DFW area and remain optimistic that we can bring this project to FID. In the meantime, modernization and debottlenecking work on our Oasis pipeline continues, which will add an incremental 60 million cubic foot per day of much needed capacity out of the Permian Basin. This capacity is expected to be available by the end of this year. We also continue to evaluate opportunities in the petrochemical space, which would include developing a project along the Gulf Coast as well as potential M&A opportunities. We are in discussions with a number of high-quality customers as we work to secure long-term tolling type commitments prior to reaching FID. We also intend to have a significant partnership with one or more industry participants. If we are able to reach FID on this project, the ethylene and propylene production units would be synchronized into a world-class facility, providing unique feedstock and product flexibility. This would allow our customers to capitalize on access to the lowest cost feedstock through our comprehensive pipeline system as well as unparalleled access to downstream domestic and international markets through our pipelines, our underground storage facilities and our export terminals. Now for an update on our alternative energy activities. We are continuing to focus on efforts on reducing emissions across our pipeline we have established an internal task force to coordinate these efforts in conjunction with third-party consultants. We recently entered into a letter of intent with Capture Point Solutions to pursue the joint development of a carbon capture and sequestration hub in Louisiana. This project would involve the installation of carbon capture equipment and several natural gas treating plants in the Haynesville area and the transport by pipeline of CO2 to a sequestration site that Capture Point is developing. Preliminary cost estimates as well as projections of cash flow and tax credits indicate that this project will generate an attractive financial return. We continue to pursue a number of projects related to carbon capture, including sequestration, enhanced oil recovery and utilization projects. We are in active discussions with several developers of CO2 sequestration sites in close proximity to our existing facilities in other regions as well our proposed Lake Charles LNG liquefaction facility. That would be good candidates for carbon capture and sequestration. Now I'll take a closer look at our second quarter results. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $3.23 billion compared to $2.62 billion for the second quarter 2021. DCF tripled to the partners, as adjusted, was $1.88 billion for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $1.39 billion for the second quarter of 2021. Results for the second quarter included higher transportation volumes across all of our segments as well as a full quarter contribution from the Enable assets that were acquired in December of 2021. On July 26, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.23 per common unit or $0.92 on an annualized basis. This distribution will be paid on August 19 to unitholders of record as of the close business on August 8. This distribution represents a more than 50% increase over the second quarter of 2021. Turning to our results by segment, and starting with NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was $763 million compared to $736 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to higher fractionation margin higher transportation margin as well higher terminal service margin related to increased throughput at our Nederland and Marcus Hook terminals in the second quarter of 2022. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines increased to a record 1.9 million barrels per day compared to 1.7 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to a ramp-up in volumes through our propane and ethane export pipelines into our Nederland Terminal and higher volumes from the Permian and Eagle Ford regions as well as record volumes on our Mariner East pipeline. And our average fractionated volumes were also a record at 938,000 barrels per day compared to 833,000 barrels per day the second quarter of 2021. For our crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $562 million compared to $484 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to improved performance Bakken pipeline despite significant weather impacts during the quarter, increased throughput at our Gulf Coast terminals as well as the addition of the Enable assets in December of 2021. Crude oil transportation volumes increased to 4.3 million barrels per day compared to 4 million barrels per day for the same period last year, driven by higher crude oil prices and strong refinery demand. For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $903 million compared to $477 million for the second quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to the acquisition of Enable assets in December and an increase related to favorable NGL and natural gas prices as well as significant increases throughout the majority of our operating regions. Gathered gas volumes were 18.3 million MMBtus per day compared to 13.1 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year due to the addition of the Enable assets, increased production in South Texas in the Northeast as well as additional gathering capacity from the Permian Bridge pipeline in West Texas. Permian Basin volumes continue to be strong, and Permian Basin inlet volumes remained at or near record highs. We are utilizing the Permian Bridge daily to optimize our available processing capacity as well as increasing our processing capacity in the area to accommodate incremental demand we are seeing. In our Interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $397 million compared to $331 million for the second quarter of 2021. During the quarter, we benefited from the addition of the Enable assets as well as increased rates and higher utilization on the Transwestern Tiger, Rover and Frontline systems due to more favorable market conditions volume growth. We continue to see heavy utilization on many of our interstate pipelines, including Tiger, FGT, Stash and Rover. And for the end of the second quarter, basis spreads on our interstate pipelines began to widen creating stronger demand for capacity across our interstate network, and we expect that to continue throughout the rest of this year. And for our Interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $218 million compared to $224 million in the second quarter of last year. Absent benefits from Winter Storm Uri in both quarters, this segment would have been up approximately $30 million due to an increase in retained fuels related to higher natural gas prices. This was partially offset by lower storage optimization opportunities. Utilization of our HPL system remained strong due to increased demand from gas takeaway and our rig pipeline system continues to flow at or near capacity due to increased activity in the Haynesville. Now turning to our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance. Given our strong performance in the second quarter as well as continued demand for our products, as we move through the rest of the year, we now expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $12.6 billion to $12.8 billion. This is up compared to our previous guidance of $12.2 billion to $12.6 billion. And moving to a growth capital update. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, Energy Transfer spent approximately $825 million on organic growth projects, primarily in the midstream, Interstate and NGL and Refined Products segment, excluding Sun and USA Compression CapEx.  For full year 2022, we continue to expect growth capital expenditures to be between $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion, and we will likely be near the high end of that range as we have added new projects related to incremental demand that we are now seeing. These projects include the addition of capital related to frac A accelerated spend on new processing facilities in the Permian and a new connection for Gulf Run, which are all offset by deferral of some spend to 2023 based upon project timing. Now looking briefly at our liquidity position. As of June 30, 2022, total available liquidity under our revolving credit facility was approximately $2.44 billion. We continue to expect to generate a significant amount of cash flow this year, which will be strategically allocated in a manner that best positions us to continue to improve our leverage, invest in high-returning growth projects, return value to our unitholders. And we expect to continue to pay down debt throughout this year and beyond with excess cash flow from operations. We also expect to reach our leverage target range by the end of this year and going forward, expect our strong coverage and balance sheet strength to allow us to further prioritize growth within our capital allocation strategy. Our strong second quarter and performance was driven by significant volume growth across all of our segments as a result of improved production and increased demand, which we expect to continue throughout 2022. In addition, the Enable assets acquired at the end of 2021 continued to outperform our internal budget during the second quarter. We expect production improvements, market conditions and strong domestic and international demand for our products to positively impact all of our segments for the remainder of this year. We are pleased with the progress we have made toward reaching our leverage target range we remain focused on improving our financial flexibility and paying down debt in order to further strengthen our balance sheet. In addition, we will continue to evaluate returning additional capital to our equity unitholders through distribution growth on a quarterly basis. We remain bullish about the future of our industry and the growing worldwide demand for natural gas and natural gas liquids. As we look for additional ways to address the existing and new demand for our products, we will continue to evaluate and pursue strategic growth projects that enhance our existing asset base and generate attractive returns as part of the capital allocation strategy. Operator, please open the line up for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Go ahead, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to start off touching base on the guidance real quick here. And doing a quick peruse of the first half of the year by annualize that goes over the high end of the guide range. If I take the second quarter annualized, that goes over the high end of the guidance range. Are there any headwinds that you're expecting in the back half of the year that would indicate that EBITDA run rate would decline from here? Or just trying to figure out gives and takes.\nTom Long: No headwinds, Jeremy. Let me start off with that. This is Tom Long. We remain conservative on the price deck, and that is the primary driver. In other words, when you look at the first half of the year and the prices that we were able to realize in the first two quarters, we continue to look at the second half of the year, and we remain conservative on the price deck. I wouldn't give you any other headwinds that we see.\nJeremy Tonet: And then the Woodford Express, just wondering if you could talk a bit about the background there, what drove you to this acquisition? And what type of multiple you paid or all the thoughts on the economics there?\nMackie McCrea: Yes. This is Mackie, Jeremy. Really, that's a value-driven acquisition. It's situated in a great area in Oklahoma. As we mentioned, it has connectivity already with our gathering assets and also with the residue takeaway pipelines, and it just was one heck of a buy. If you look at the acreage and the producers that are committed under long-term contracts and the fees that are associated with that, we're very pleased with the price that we could pay for those assets.\nJeremy Tonet: A real quick last one, if I could. With regards to Ira and a potential 45Q increase there, just wondering how this might impact your thoughts on pursuing carbon capture initiatives? Do you need that to go after these projects? Or are these economics even without that?\nMackie McCrea: Yes. This is Mackie. And Tom, who leads our ESG team, can elaborate. But as we mentioned, we're chasing a project right now in North Louisiana that we're extremely excited about. It's one of those projects we may or may not exercise in. We certainly will allow our CO2 be captured. But what the new credits in this new bill would provide for a significantly higher rates of return with that tax credit going from up to the $85. So depending on how that plays out in this bill, that certainly will be a very positive for that type of project on creating very significant returns.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill from Bank of America. Go ahead, Chase.\nChase Mulvehill: Good afternoon. I guess maybe I'll start with Lake Charles. It looks like there wasn't really anything new on the offtake front, but it sounds like you're still pretty positive and optimistic about signing more SPAs for the rest of the year. So could you maybe just kind of talk a little bit further about the opportunities that you see signing more offtake for the rest of the year? And then also about selling down some interest, just kind of the conversations that you're having there and the potential to do that? And would you need to FID the project before you actually sell down some interest?\nTom Mason: Great questions. Obviously, we've been busy with negotiating offtake contracts over the last - since our last earnings call, and we wish we'd maybe had a couple of extra weeks here before this call and we're optimistic close to an announcement on pretty important contract and - but some of these things just take time. They are 20-year contracts and significant dollars involved.  So we're working on a lot of different offtake contracts, still seeing very strong demand worldwide, both in Europe and in Asia. So things are going great. I think the people are - security of supply is becoming even more recognized around the world than it was even three, four months ago. So we're highly optimistic we'll get to the goal line on our offtake.  As far as the equity sell down, we're likely to start that process in the next couple of months. We want to kind of get to a critical mass of offtake contracts before going down that path. Obviously, the equity participants want to know kind of what our portfolio offtake contracts looks like, but that's just around the corner for us. And then I think - what was the last question?\nTomLong: The timing with net FID.\nTom Mason: The timing with net FID. Yes, we're still targeting FID by the end of the year. Obviously, the big project and lots of things have to come together, but things are looking really good.\nChase Mulvehill: Very perfect. Unrelated follow-up is really on the fractionation side. We saw the fire with Medford over in Conway. I'm guessing that's probably jobbing a little bit more rich gas down to Mont Belvieu. Obviously, it didn't impact 2Q, but when we think about 3Q, could you talk about whether you're seeing will rich gas kind of make its way down to Belvieu and the impact that this could have on kind of the fractionation market in the third quarter?\nMackie McCrea: You bet Jason, this is Mackie again. With without that, we're seeing significant volume growth for NGL barrels reaching a Mont Belvieu, both from Permian Basin and other areas of Texas and the Ford basin. Ironically, some of the barrels that were affected by that, we are now fracking at Mont Belvieu. And so what we are seeing is a very tightening of frac capacity, we think that's going to increase over the next six to nine months before some of these other fracs come on, including ours. So we see the value of any available capacity at Belvieu - Belvieu is going to get increasingly better. So we're pretty excited about that. And we're also excited that we kicked off the frac A, we'll push hard to get that done by the third quarter or earlier.\nChase Mulvehill: Do you know if you're seeing any of the NGL barrels making their way down from Conway? Or is there enough capacity there?\nMackie McCrea: I can't speak to what a lot of others are doing, but we are receiving barrels from Oklahoma delivered to our frac as a result of that for.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay. Awesome. I'll turn it back over.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Colton Bean from Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Company. Go ahead, Colton.\nColton Bean: Starting off on Gulf Run, you mentioned incremental demand and the potential to upsize the pipe, I guess in terms of upsize capacity, are you looking at something in the range of 2 Bcf a day or potentially beyond that? And then would you add compression ahead of in-service or just at a later date tied to commitments?\nMackie McCrea: I'd tell you, when we look at the Enable asset acquisition, we just keep turning over gears and how incredible it is in this time when the fastest-growing area in nation in Haynesville, there was already a 42-inch approved and being constructed. And as we have said, it should be in the ground by the end of the year. We did just complete an open season. It went exceptionally well. The demand to get volumes, not only out of North Louisiana, but other areas of the U.S. down Gulf Coast is enormous. We're going through discussions and negotiations with a large amount of producers and shippers that were interested in that, and we'll be making those decisions. We can add compression and add about 1 Bcf, but we also are looking at having to loop the line potentially all the way down to Lake Charles. So still a lot we're working on there, but we are in negotiations and certainly expect to talk more for our next earnings call.\nColton Bean: Mackie, just to confirm that you - it sounds like you can get up to north of 2.5 just for the compression.\nMackie McCrea: Yes, we can go from 1.65x to 2.6x just with compression.\nColton Bean: Great. And then maybe sticking on pipeline development. Can you explain on what you're seeing in terms of commercial interest on Warrior? And is there any reduced urgency from E&Ps? I think we've seen basis widened, but then some of the other brownfields have been a little bit slower to FID than expected. So just a bit tough to reconcile that at present.\nMackie McCrea: You said Warrior, right?\nColton Bean: Yes, Warrior, so thinking Permian just it seems like maybe the certainly slow, but yes -\nMackie McCrea: Yes. Certainly, with the announcement of the pipeline, some of the bigger producers that were worried about capacity. They've signed those up. However, we are talking to some of those already. In addition to that, we have a bunch of producers of course, upstream and then some very strong markets downstream. We have a pretty balanced customer base from both ends. We are seeing a tremendous amount of interest - and we do expect to hopefully make some headway, certainly before our next earnings call and still remain very optimistic that we'll get that to FID.\nColton Bean: And appreciate the color.\nTom Long: You bet.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brian Reynolds from UBS. Go ahead Brian.\nBrian Reynolds: Hi everyone - just curious if you can just talk about and you'll takeaway capacity out of the Permian and potential expansions there just given the recent processing plan announcement additionally to the frac A of the next year? Thanks.\nMackie McCrea: Okay this is Mackie again. Yes, we've already announced that we're building 2 more cryos, things like everybody that can say the word cryos announcing projects out there. Fortunately, we kind of - we're looking ahead years ago. We built a 24-inch and then we built a other 24-inch. So we've got capacity to not only handle the liquids from our plant that we're building plus additional plants. We also are a big takeaway from a lot of the other plants out in that area. I believe there's about 2.2 million barrels moving out forward basin - I mean, I'm sorry, out of the Permian Basin and about 35% to 36% of that is us, and we do see that increase for the remainder this year and beyond.\nBrian Reynolds: And just as a quick follow-up, do you see any need for expansion on your existing pipes or are you good for, I guess, the interim?\nMackie McCrea: We don't see that over the next year to two, but who knows. There's, still enormous opportunities to grow from the best rock in the world, multiple pay zones out in the Permian Basin. So - but we're sitting pretty good for the next year or two - and of course, we have the 30-inch from the fourth basin down and have plenty of capacity in that pipeline.\nBrian Reynolds: Great, I appreciate it. And as a quick as we talk about CCUS and some of the earlier questions. Just curious if you can just pursuing projects in Louisiana or the Northeast or Texas is there kind of a preference to pursue first or any incremental color around there?\nMackie McCrea: So around capturing CO2?\nBrian Reynolds: Correct yes.\nMackie McCrea: Okay yes, I think others have been asked that question. But the bottom line on that is where is the CO2 and where is the closest location to sequester it. And Louisiana is such an excellent state because they're one of the only states that we're aware of that have asked for primacy so that you could actually get a permit, a plastics permit approved by the state instead of going through the EPA, that hasn't been approved yet. But anyway, Louisiana is a little ahead of the game. There's a lot more treating, a lot more CO2 in North Louisiana. So there's more of a need to sequester CO2 there. And that's why we've kind of focused our efforts on a really attractive project that Tom and his team have worked very closely on that we're pretty excited about.\nBrian Reynolds: Great, appreciate it the color, have a good rest of the evening.\nMackie McCrea: Sure.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. Go ahead Michael.\nMichael Blum: Thanks, just wanted one quick follow-up on Warrior Pipeline. Can you just remind us whether there's any CapEx in the budget this year tied to Warrior?\nMackie McCrea: Michael is Mackie. There is some. We're not rushing that, but we certainly are way out in front of it as far as surveying and laying out the route. But no, there's no significant dollars in 2022.\nMichael Blum: Okay great. And then on Lake Charles, is there a certain percentage of the capacity that you want to contract before you move forward to FID. Just trying to look at kind of the signs where we should be looking for to know that you're going to get to FID by year-end?\nTom Long: Well, the bottom line of that entry is at what point are we going to go to our Board and our Executive Chairman to ask for approval. I think we've said publicly that that we can get to that 12% to 14% depending on the customer mix and of course, the infrastructure funds that will be a part of this, but that's probably a pretty good range, 12 million to 14 million tons, but certainly, we'll make that decision at the right time here towards the end of the year.\nMichael Blum: Okay great. And then just last one from me. if I heard right, it sounds like you either did expand or in the process of expanding your ethane export capacity at Marcus Hook. So just curious if I heard that right and where the capacity will be when the expansion is complete?\nMackie McCrea: Yes, Michael, it's not that material. We're - as you know, we have built out an extensive pipeline network that we have tremendous ability to grow we're close to maxing out what we can do both from an ethane standpoint and from an LPG standpoint. But we're looking at everything. We were able to eke out a little bit more little less than 10,000 barrels that we were able to expand, and we'll continue to look at those opportunities until we make the decision to significantly expand at Marcus Hook.\nMichael Blum: Okay got it, thanks. Thank you.\nMackie McCrea: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. Go ahead Keith.\nKeith Stanley: Hi afternoon. I wanted to start on capital allocation and make sure I got the message right. So the distribution, you've been very consistent in growing that every quarter. You said you'd be at the leverage target by year-end. So how does the capital priority shift, if at all, into next year in terms of distribution growth buybacks and growth capital expectations. Tom, it sounded in your comments like a little more focus on growth once the balance sheet and to grow distribution goals are met. Is that right?\nTom Long: Yes I don't know, Keith that I would sum it up as a shift. We're going to continue to focus on the balance sheet. But I think it's very important to note with all the projects we're talking about right now that are very good, high-returning projects. We're going to continue to look at that. But it's also worth noting the portion about returning capital to the unitholders. So we'll continue to evaluate that as from a distribution, we'll also continue to evaluate it, from even a unit buyback. So there's going to be various components here that are moving around, and we'll have a good, healthy discussion internally here with our Executive Chairman as well with our Board as we continue to focus on that. So anyway, this is a good question to be answering here. Right now, it's great to be at this place on the leverage. We're very, very excited about this. And it's - let's just call it, it's kind of a high-class evaluation to have to be doing. We're very pleased to be here at this stage and as quick we got here.\nKeith Stanley: Great, thanks for that. And a separate one, I just wanted to follow up on Lake Charles. So sound very optimistic on contracts. Any color you can give, plus or minus on where pricing has been? You kind of - you have tons of demand, obviously, from Europe and Asia. But you also have a lot of competing projects? And then relatedly, any update on how discussions are going on the cost side and the EPC contract, if that's kind of in line with what you were thinking so far? Thank you.\nThomas Mason: Yes, we - it's been a very competitive market in spite of the increased demand worldwide. And so we can't ignore competition in our pricing. However, I think the number of companies and customers around the world that have - that are stepping up, and that nontraditional players for LNG and traditional, the demand has just increased significantly. So we're pricing, we're moving, adjusting our prices up to reflect kind of anticipated a little bit higher cost on the EPC side. We're going through a big refresh process now. We'll get that number towards the end of this year. And so, we're obviously trying to balance the anticipated somewhat higher cost, but we still make a very, very competitive EPC price compared to our peers because of our Brownfield assets we have on the ground today. But it's a balancing between a competitive market, getting - trying to get a good return for the project.\nKeith Stanley: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein.\nJean Salisbury: Just following up on that last question obviously, I think it's fair to say that all LNG projects kind of want the same EPC. Would you consider just doing the 10 MTA instead of the 15 if you can lock in the EPC and you're not quite at the 12 MTA to 14 MTA contract level that you wanted to be out for the 15?\nThomas Mason: Yes, certainly, we'd consider that. I think we're - we think that overall, it's going to be kind of more cost competitive to do three trains versus two. But where we think we're going to be in the next few weeks with signed contracts, we're certainly in a position to do a 2-train deal if we want to go down that path. So we'll evaluate that during the course of the fall, but that's an option we could do.\nMackie McCrea: But I'll just add to that, we're extremely optimistic. Tom and his team are working with many companies in many countries, and we're highly confident that we'll get just fully sold out to the 15 million tons.\nJean Salisbury: That's great. And then could you just give more color on Energy Transfer's petchem strategy, especially around buy versus build?\nMackie McCrea: Sure. This is Mackie again. When Kelsey kind of gave us the directive that we need to step in to pet chem, we certainly are doing that, two perspectives: one, we're - from an M&A perspective, anything that's for sale, we'll take a look at pretty much like anything in the industry; and then on the organic side, we're excited the project that we're working on, we truly believe we're not just saying it. It's the most unique world-class facility anywhere on the - around the world. And we say that because where it's located, we're going to be able to move propane, butane, ethane and natural gasoline through four existing pipelines, all four of which we have significant capability of expanding. In addition to that, upstream of the cracker will have access to refined products like butane components and gasoline components. Who knows where the gasoline demand is going to go to the next 5 to 10 to 15 years. Some believe that that's going to get very depressed pricing, and we think that will be a very cheap feedstock for our customers. And also with the cracker and the pathosis technology that's part of our plant, we'll be able to track things like methanol and ethanol and mixed alcohols and even plastics into ethylene. So just an incredible amount of flexibility, and we think very advantageous to any other cracker in the world as far as the cost and value of the upstream feedstocks. And then you look at downstream, we have every intention to connect it to our new Spindletop ethylene storage facility that has a header system connected to multiple ethylene pipelines. We have every intention to connect all of this to Mont Belvieu as well as to some of the pipes going into Louisiana. And then, of course, at Nederland, we'll have the capability of exporting both ethylene and propylene. So once again, we're in the early stages. We have no intention of moving forward without a very big customer - I'm sorry, a very big partner on that. And we're structuring this agreement, and we'll move forward with tolling agreements. So this isn't going to be a petchem where we're going to be speculating a rule in the dice on the cyclical nature of profits from petchems. We're going to do this like we do all our deals. We're going to have a have a polling arrangement with guaranteed revenues and a guaranteed rate of return over a period of time. So we're not there yet, but we great team working on it, and we really are excited about that project, we can get that FID.\nJean Salisbury: Great. If I can sneak in 1 quick yes or no. Will Gulf Run be able to run at full capacity before Golden Pass starts when Gulf Run starts up later this year?\nMackie McCrea: Yes.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Cusimano from Pickering Energy Partners. Go ahead, Michael.\nMichael Cusimano: Hi, good afternoon. On the Woodford acquisition, can you talk about your existing Oklahoma utilization and the Woodford utilization? I'm trying to understand if there's like operational synergies part of the deal that maybe you can rationalize capacity like we've seen others in the industry deal through relocation or what have you of processing capacity.\nMackie McCrea: Yes. As we mentioned, have - our gathering system already connected. We have our intern intrastate, residue pipelines connected to it. It's very early on. This acquisition moved pretty quickly. So we'll continue to evaluate and certainly do like we do with any of our acquisitions or any of our new build cryos, where we'll integrate it in and figure out a way to best, most properly and efficiently operate that system. Fortunately or unfortunately, however you want to look at it is it's going to be pretty darn full just with the long-term dedications from a handful of producers today. But certainly, as we integrate and bring into our system, we'll create as much value as we can with that new asset with our existing assets.\nMichael Cusimano: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then I wanted to shift quickly to CapEx. I think I heard you said that some capital costs were may be deferred into '23, whereas some projects maybe move forward maybe '22 budget. Can you maybe help us wrap our head around what '23 could look like as we stand today without other additional projects in the backlog coming into the budget?\nTom Long: Yes. It's - as you know, our normal practice is with our fourth quarter announcement to put out the '23 CapEx guidance. But it's fair, it's a fair question in the sense that we're talking a lot - about of very, very good projects. We're here right now. So as we move forward with those and get those to FID, we will be transparent as those get approved and move forward, which will clearly move into 2023 CapEx guidance at the time. But at this point, I don't really have a number that we can give you, but very excited about some of these projects we're referring to. And we will update everyone as those get done.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, Michael.\nMichael Lapides: Thank you for taking my question. Just curious, the M&A environment right now, I mean, if I think about your history over time, you helped on tons of M&A over the years. Just curious, what type of assets do you think the M&A environment is very right for, meaning where there's lots of attractive things to do? And maybe on the other flip side of that, what type of assets do you think are either priced too high for your blood or simply not on the market even if there are things you'd love to have in the portfolio? I'm not looking for specific names, I'm just looking for asset types.\nTom Long: Well, thank you, Michael, on the specific name part, we do feel very, very strong that consolidation makes a lot of sense in the midstream space. So starting with the midstream space, we would - you would see us look around the assets we have right now, those assets that would be great bolt-ons for us, and we're going to stay focused on those. We do - you've seen a lot of them come to market. Rest assured, we have looked at. We looked at these, and we're going to continue to evaluate them. I think the second part of your question is what kind of makes sense from the standpoint of valuations? When we look at these things, we evaluate them based upon where we're currently trading. And when you look at the commercial synergies, the cost synergies, we're very, very careful in how we evaluate each one of these. And we remain disciplined on what we're doing. But just like the smaller one today we announced I know it's an all-cash transaction, but even if you were to do that one on a 50-50, it was accretive. It was accretive relatively small just because of the sheer size. I think that's a good example of what we'll continue to look at and how we evaluate these. But let me go back to the first part again as far as assets go. You've seen us talk - you've heard us talk about the petchem side of it. And we continue to evaluate moving downstream. And we continue to look at on the international front, too. We've talked about the Panama project. So there are other projects that we continue to look at that really kind of moving downstream, taking advantage of all the CapEx that we've spent over the last several years around our export facilities, et cetera. So it's going to be a natural fit with us. And as Mackie was highlighting on the petchem side of it, it's - there's no doubt that that's a natural fit for us. And those are the things we'll continue to look at here on that front. I don't know, Mackie, if you want to chime in if there's anything else, but that kind of sums up where we're spending most of our time and evaluations.\nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Tom Long for closing comments. Mr. Long, you may proceed.\nTom Long: Once again, thank all of you for joining us today. We really are excited to have the opportunity to talk to you about another great quarter and clearly a great year that we're seeing. Thank you for your support, we look forward to talking you in the near future.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Long",
            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer second quarter 2022 earnings call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team, who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, as well the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, which we expect to be filed tomorrow, August 4. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You will find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'd like to start today by looking at some of our second quarter highlights. We were pleased to report another strong quarter, during which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.23 billion and DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, was $1.88 billion. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $1.17 billion. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of approximately $730 million after distributions of $710 million and growth capital of approximately $440 million. On July 26, we announced a quarterly distribution of $0.23 per common unit or $0.92 on an annualized basis, which represents a more than 50% increase over the second quarter of 2021. As a reminder, future increases to distribution level will be evaluated quarterly with the ultimate goal of returning distributions to the previous level of $0.305 per quarter or $1.22 on an annualized basis while balancing our leverage target, growth opportunities and unit buybacks. Operationally, our diverse asset base saw throughput increases across all of our segments as rig counts continue to improve across the U.S., and we saw record midstream volumes as well record throughput on our NGL transportation pipelines, Mont Belvieu fractionators and terminals. In addition, construction continues to progress on several of our growth projects, which I will provide more details on shortly. I'll start with a brief update on the sale of Energy Transfer Canada. In March of this year, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our 51% interest in Energy Transfer Canada for cash proceeds of approximately $270 million. In addition, the sale is expected to reduce our consolidated debt by approximately $550 million. This sale allows us to divest of these noncore assets at an attractive valuation and utilize the cash proceeds to further deleverage our balance sheet and redeploy capital within our U.S. footprint. The transaction remains on track, and we continue to expect it to close this month. This week, Energy Transfer signed an agreement to acquire Woodford Express, LLC, a Mid-Continent gas gathering and processing system for approximately $485 million. This bolt-on opportunity will provide a roughly 450 million cubic foot per day of cryogenic gas processing and treating capacity in Grady County, Oklahoma as well more than 200 miles of low and mid-pressure gathering lines in the heart of the SCOOP play. The assets are already connected to our inter and intrastate systems as well our gas gathering system. The system is supported by dedicated acreage with long-term predominantly fixed fee contracts with active proven producers. We're excited to have these strong assets, quality customer contracts and established operations to our footprint in the Mid-Continent, all at an attractive valuation that will be immediately accretive to Energy Transfer unitholders. This transaction is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of this year, subject to regulatory review and other customary closing conditions. Now I'll walk you through recent developments and other growth projects. Year-to-date, Lake Charles LNG has executed five LNG offtake agreements for an aggregate of 5.8 million tons per annum. The purchase price in all these agreements is indexed to the Henry Hub benchmark plus a fixed liquefaction charge and the LNG will be delivered on to customer vessels on an FOB basis. The agreements will become fully effective upon the satisfaction of the conditions precedent by Energy Transfer LNG, including reaching FID. We're also in active negotiations with a number of other high-quality customers as we expect to make announcements of additional offtake agreements in the weeks ahead. As we previously stated, we expect to finance a significant portion of the of the capital cost of this project by means sale of equity in the project to infrastructure funds and possibly to one or more industry participants in conjunction with LNG offtake agreements. We continue to work toward achieving FID for this project by the end of this year, and we expect that our anticipated announcements of additional long-term LNG offtake agreements over the next several weeks will keep us on track for meeting this objective. Upon completion of the LNG project, we expect to realize significant incremental cash flows from transportation of natural gas on our trunk line pipeline system and other energy transfer pipelines upstream from Lake Charles. Recent events in Europe highlight the importance of LNG from the United States, a country with abundant natural gas supply and government support for LNG exports. These events have caused companies around the world to place increased importance on long-term security of natural gas supply. We believe that our Lake Charles LNG project will be a significant factor in the long-term solutions for global energy needs. Looking at the Mariner East pipeline system, which is fully commissioned and capable of transporting more than 365,000 barrels per day, including ethylene. For the second quarter of 2022, NGL volumes through both the Mariner East pipeline system and Marcus Hook terminal reached new records. And in July, we set a monthly throughput record for the combined Mariner East pipes, and we continue to see strong utilization of these pipes. In addition, we recently completed work at the terminal to allow us to increase the ethane exports out of Marcus Hook, and we continue evaluate all options to achieve incremental ethane and LPG exports out of Marcus Hook until we complete an expansion of the terminal. At our expanded Nederland Terminal, NGL export volumes were very strong during the second quarter, including export volumes under our ethane export joint venture. We had a record in the second quarter for ethane exports and year-to-date, we have loaded nearly 18 million barrels of ethane out the facility. The second tranche of satellites contract went into effect on July 1, which doubles the volume commitments from the initial term and we loaded the first vessel under this demand base agreement in July. For full year 2022, we continue to expect to load more than 40 million barrels of ethane with that increasing to as high 60 million barrels for 2023.  In total, we continue to export more NGLs than any other company or country, and our percentage of worldwide NGL exports remain at approximately 20% of the world market. We continue to see increase in NGL demand, both in the U.S. as well as from overseas customers seeking additional supply from the U.S., and we have sufficient commitments to move forward on an ethane export expansion. Even though we expect to expand our ethane export capabilities at both our Marcus Hook and Nederland terminals, these commitments provide us with the optionality of initially expanding at either terminal. In addition, due to the significant tightening and fractionation capacity, we recently resumed construction on Frac VIII, which was more than half funded when construction was paused in 2020. Frac VIII is expected to be in service in the third quarter of 2023 and will bring our total Mont Belvieu fractionation capacity to over 1.1 million barrels per day. In the second quarter, our Permian Basin plant inlet processing volumes were approximately 2.2 Bcf per day, which is a new record and due to significant producer demand and continued growth around the Permian Basin gathering and processing assets, we are adding additional capacity to meet increasing production from the basin. Construction of our new 200 million cubic foot per day GrayWolf processing plant in the Delaware Basin is underway. This plan is supported by new commitments and growth from existing customer contracts and remains on schedule to be in service by the end of this year. We are also moving forward with a second 200 million cubic foot per day processing plant in the Permian Basin. A portion of the growth capital associated with the Bear plant was included in our previous forecast, but we have accelerated some spend into 2022 to expedite the completion of this plant in order to meet growing demand. This plan is expected to be serviced in the second quarter of 2023. In addition, given the significant amount of demand we're seeing we are evaluating the necessity and potential timing of adding another processing plant in the region. Once in service, the volumes from tailgate of these plants will utilize our gas and NGL pipelines for takeaway, providing revenue streams for our intrastate and NGL segments on top of the incremental revenue for our midstream segment. In the meantime, we continue to heavily utilize the Permian be project to provide operational flexibility between our processing facilities in the Delaware and the Midland Basin. Crude terminal throughput increased nearly 20% over the second quarter of last year, driven by increased upstream pipeline throughput, a strategic petroleum reserve drawdown and additional market connectivity via the Ted Collins Link. At our Nederland Terminal, we have recently seen record crude volumes destined for the refinery and export markets. Overall, we expect to see exports continue to stay strong, largely due to the Ted Collins Link, which provides our systems with more market connectivity and access to deeper water as well as a quality management program, which ensures a higher-quality Midland WTI barrel as desired by our customers. We continue to make progress on the construction of the Gulf Run Pipeline, which is a 42-inch interstate natural gas pipeline with 1.65 Bcf per day of capacity. Gulf Run is backed by a 20-year commitment for 1.1 Bcf per day from Golden Pass LNG and will provide natural gas transportation between the Haynesville Shale and the Gulf Coast, connecting some of the most perfect natural gas producing regions in the U.S. with the LNG export market. Gulf Run remains on schedule to be complete by the end of this year. We recently completed a nonbinding open season Gulf Run due to growing producer demand. We were pleased with the results of the open season and customer discussions are ongoing, which will likely necessitate additional facilities beyond the initial design of 1.65 Bcf per day. Turning to the Warrior Pipeline Project, which is the most optimal solution for customers to transport gas out of the Permian in regard to timing, cost, flexibility and access premium markets. We are still evaluating the construction of this new intrastate pipeline from the Midland Basin to our extensive pipeline network south of the DFW area and remain optimistic that we can bring this project to FID. In the meantime, modernization and debottlenecking work on our Oasis pipeline continues, which will add an incremental 60 million cubic foot per day of much needed capacity out of the Permian Basin. This capacity is expected to be available by the end of this year. We also continue to evaluate opportunities in the petrochemical space, which would include developing a project along the Gulf Coast as well as potential M&A opportunities. We are in discussions with a number of high-quality customers as we work to secure long-term tolling type commitments prior to reaching FID. We also intend to have a significant partnership with one or more industry participants. If we are able to reach FID on this project, the ethylene and propylene production units would be synchronized into a world-class facility, providing unique feedstock and product flexibility. This would allow our customers to capitalize on access to the lowest cost feedstock through our comprehensive pipeline system as well as unparalleled access to downstream domestic and international markets through our pipelines, our underground storage facilities and our export terminals. Now for an update on our alternative energy activities. We are continuing to focus on efforts on reducing emissions across our pipeline we have established an internal task force to coordinate these efforts in conjunction with third-party consultants. We recently entered into a letter of intent with Capture Point Solutions to pursue the joint development of a carbon capture and sequestration hub in Louisiana. This project would involve the installation of carbon capture equipment and several natural gas treating plants in the Haynesville area and the transport by pipeline of CO2 to a sequestration site that Capture Point is developing. Preliminary cost estimates as well as projections of cash flow and tax credits indicate that this project will generate an attractive financial return. We continue to pursue a number of projects related to carbon capture, including sequestration, enhanced oil recovery and utilization projects. We are in active discussions with several developers of CO2 sequestration sites in close proximity to our existing facilities in other regions as well our proposed Lake Charles LNG liquefaction facility. That would be good candidates for carbon capture and sequestration. Now I'll take a closer look at our second quarter results. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $3.23 billion compared to $2.62 billion for the second quarter 2021. DCF tripled to the partners, as adjusted, was $1.88 billion for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $1.39 billion for the second quarter of 2021. Results for the second quarter included higher transportation volumes across all of our segments as well as a full quarter contribution from the Enable assets that were acquired in December of 2021. On July 26, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.23 per common unit or $0.92 on an annualized basis. This distribution will be paid on August 19 to unitholders of record as of the close business on August 8. This distribution represents a more than 50% increase over the second quarter of 2021. Turning to our results by segment, and starting with NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was $763 million compared to $736 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to higher fractionation margin higher transportation margin as well higher terminal service margin related to increased throughput at our Nederland and Marcus Hook terminals in the second quarter of 2022. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines increased to a record 1.9 million barrels per day compared to 1.7 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to a ramp-up in volumes through our propane and ethane export pipelines into our Nederland Terminal and higher volumes from the Permian and Eagle Ford regions as well as record volumes on our Mariner East pipeline. And our average fractionated volumes were also a record at 938,000 barrels per day compared to 833,000 barrels per day the second quarter of 2021. For our crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $562 million compared to $484 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to improved performance Bakken pipeline despite significant weather impacts during the quarter, increased throughput at our Gulf Coast terminals as well as the addition of the Enable assets in December of 2021. Crude oil transportation volumes increased to 4.3 million barrels per day compared to 4 million barrels per day for the same period last year, driven by higher crude oil prices and strong refinery demand. For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $903 million compared to $477 million for the second quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to the acquisition of Enable assets in December and an increase related to favorable NGL and natural gas prices as well as significant increases throughout the majority of our operating regions. Gathered gas volumes were 18.3 million MMBtus per day compared to 13.1 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year due to the addition of the Enable assets, increased production in South Texas in the Northeast as well as additional gathering capacity from the Permian Bridge pipeline in West Texas. Permian Basin volumes continue to be strong, and Permian Basin inlet volumes remained at or near record highs. We are utilizing the Permian Bridge daily to optimize our available processing capacity as well as increasing our processing capacity in the area to accommodate incremental demand we are seeing. In our Interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $397 million compared to $331 million for the second quarter of 2021. During the quarter, we benefited from the addition of the Enable assets as well as increased rates and higher utilization on the Transwestern Tiger, Rover and Frontline systems due to more favorable market conditions volume growth. We continue to see heavy utilization on many of our interstate pipelines, including Tiger, FGT, Stash and Rover. And for the end of the second quarter, basis spreads on our interstate pipelines began to widen creating stronger demand for capacity across our interstate network, and we expect that to continue throughout the rest of this year. And for our Interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $218 million compared to $224 million in the second quarter of last year. Absent benefits from Winter Storm Uri in both quarters, this segment would have been up approximately $30 million due to an increase in retained fuels related to higher natural gas prices. This was partially offset by lower storage optimization opportunities. Utilization of our HPL system remained strong due to increased demand from gas takeaway and our rig pipeline system continues to flow at or near capacity due to increased activity in the Haynesville. Now turning to our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance. Given our strong performance in the second quarter as well as continued demand for our products, as we move through the rest of the year, we now expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $12.6 billion to $12.8 billion. This is up compared to our previous guidance of $12.2 billion to $12.6 billion. And moving to a growth capital update. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, Energy Transfer spent approximately $825 million on organic growth projects, primarily in the midstream, Interstate and NGL and Refined Products segment, excluding Sun and USA Compression CapEx.  For full year 2022, we continue to expect growth capital expenditures to be between $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion, and we will likely be near the high end of that range as we have added new projects related to incremental demand that we are now seeing. These projects include the addition of capital related to frac A accelerated spend on new processing facilities in the Permian and a new connection for Gulf Run, which are all offset by deferral of some spend to 2023 based upon project timing. Now looking briefly at our liquidity position. As of June 30, 2022, total available liquidity under our revolving credit facility was approximately $2.44 billion. We continue to expect to generate a significant amount of cash flow this year, which will be strategically allocated in a manner that best positions us to continue to improve our leverage, invest in high-returning growth projects, return value to our unitholders. And we expect to continue to pay down debt throughout this year and beyond with excess cash flow from operations. We also expect to reach our leverage target range by the end of this year and going forward, expect our strong coverage and balance sheet strength to allow us to further prioritize growth within our capital allocation strategy. Our strong second quarter and performance was driven by significant volume growth across all of our segments as a result of improved production and increased demand, which we expect to continue throughout 2022. In addition, the Enable assets acquired at the end of 2021 continued to outperform our internal budget during the second quarter. We expect production improvements, market conditions and strong domestic and international demand for our products to positively impact all of our segments for the remainder of this year. We are pleased with the progress we have made toward reaching our leverage target range we remain focused on improving our financial flexibility and paying down debt in order to further strengthen our balance sheet. In addition, we will continue to evaluate returning additional capital to our equity unitholders through distribution growth on a quarterly basis. We remain bullish about the future of our industry and the growing worldwide demand for natural gas and natural gas liquids. As we look for additional ways to address the existing and new demand for our products, we will continue to evaluate and pursue strategic growth projects that enhance our existing asset base and generate attractive returns as part of the capital allocation strategy. Operator, please open the line up for our first question. No headwinds, Jeremy. Let me start off with that. This is Tom Long. We remain conservative on the price deck, and that is the primary driver. In other words, when you look at the first half of the year and the prices that we were able to realize in the first two quarters, we continue to look at the second half of the year, and we remain conservative on the price deck. I wouldn't give you any other headwinds that we see. The timing with net FID. You bet. Well, the bottom line of that entry is at what point are we going to go to our Board and our Executive Chairman to ask for approval. I think we've said publicly that that we can get to that 12% to 14% depending on the customer mix and of course, the infrastructure funds that will be a part of this, but that's probably a pretty good range, 12 million to 14 million tons, but certainly, we'll make that decision at the right time here towards the end of the year. Yes I don't know, Keith that I would sum it up as a shift. We're going to continue to focus on the balance sheet. But I think it's very important to note with all the projects we're talking about right now that are very good, high-returning projects. We're going to continue to look at that. But it's also worth noting the portion about returning capital to the unitholders. So we'll continue to evaluate that as from a distribution, we'll also continue to evaluate it, from even a unit buyback. So there's going to be various components here that are moving around, and we'll have a good, healthy discussion internally here with our Executive Chairman as well with our Board as we continue to focus on that. So anyway, this is a good question to be answering here. Right now, it's great to be at this place on the leverage. We're very, very excited about this. And it's - let's just call it, it's kind of a high-class evaluation to have to be doing. We're very pleased to be here at this stage and as quick we got here. Yes. It's - as you know, our normal practice is with our fourth quarter announcement to put out the '23 CapEx guidance. But it's fair, it's a fair question in the sense that we're talking a lot - about of very, very good projects. We're here right now. So as we move forward with those and get those to FID, we will be transparent as those get approved and move forward, which will clearly move into 2023 CapEx guidance at the time. But at this point, I don't really have a number that we can give you, but very excited about some of these projects we're referring to. And we will update everyone as those get done. Well, thank you, Michael, on the specific name part, we do feel very, very strong that consolidation makes a lot of sense in the midstream space. So starting with the midstream space, we would - you would see us look around the assets we have right now, those assets that would be great bolt-ons for us, and we're going to stay focused on those. We do - you've seen a lot of them come to market. Rest assured, we have looked at. We looked at these, and we're going to continue to evaluate them. I think the second part of your question is what kind of makes sense from the standpoint of valuations? When we look at these things, we evaluate them based upon where we're currently trading. And when you look at the commercial synergies, the cost synergies, we're very, very careful in how we evaluate each one of these. And we remain disciplined on what we're doing. But just like the smaller one today we announced I know it's an all-cash transaction, but even if you were to do that one on a 50-50, it was accretive. It was accretive relatively small just because of the sheer size. I think that's a good example of what we'll continue to look at and how we evaluate these. But let me go back to the first part again as far as assets go. You've seen us talk - you've heard us talk about the petchem side of it. And we continue to evaluate moving downstream. And we continue to look at on the international front, too. We've talked about the Panama project. So there are other projects that we continue to look at that really kind of moving downstream, taking advantage of all the CapEx that we've spent over the last several years around our export facilities, et cetera. So it's going to be a natural fit with us. And as Mackie was highlighting on the petchem side of it, it's - there's no doubt that that's a natural fit for us. And those are the things we'll continue to look at here on that front. I don't know, Mackie, if you want to chime in if there's anything else, but that kind of sums up where we're spending most of our time and evaluations. Once again, thank all of you for joining us today. We really are excited to have the opportunity to talk to you about another great quarter and clearly a great year that we're seeing. Thank you for your support, we look forward to talking you in the near future."

            "name": "Tom Mason",
            "content": "Great questions. Obviously, we've been busy with negotiating offtake contracts over the last - since our last earnings call, and we wish we'd maybe had a couple of extra weeks here before this call and we're optimistic close to an announcement on pretty important contract and - but some of these things just take time. They are 20-year contracts and significant dollars involved.  So we're working on a lot of different offtake contracts, still seeing very strong demand worldwide, both in Europe and in Asia. So things are going great. I think the people are - security of supply is becoming even more recognized around the world than it was even three, four months ago. So we're highly optimistic we'll get to the goal line on our offtake.  As far as the equity sell down, we're likely to start that process in the next couple of months. We want to kind of get to a critical mass of offtake contracts before going down that path. Obviously, the equity participants want to know kind of what our portfolio offtake contracts looks like, but that's just around the corner for us. And then I think - what was the last question? The timing with net FID. Yes, we're still targeting FID by the end of the year. Obviously, the big project and lots of things have to come together, but things are looking really good."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Mackie McCrea",
            "content": "Yes. This is Mackie, Jeremy. Really, that's a value-driven acquisition. It's situated in a great area in Oklahoma. As we mentioned, it has connectivity already with our gathering assets and also with the residue takeaway pipelines, and it just was one heck of a buy. If you look at the acreage and the producers that are committed under long-term contracts and the fees that are associated with that, we're very pleased with the price that we could pay for those assets. Yes. This is Mackie. And Tom, who leads our ESG team, can elaborate. But as we mentioned, we're chasing a project right now in North Louisiana that we're extremely excited about. It's one of those projects we may or may not exercise in. We certainly will allow our CO2 be captured. But what the new credits in this new bill would provide for a significantly higher rates of return with that tax credit going from up to the $85. So depending on how that plays out in this bill, that certainly will be a very positive for that type of project on creating very significant returns. You bet Jason, this is Mackie again. With without that, we're seeing significant volume growth for NGL barrels reaching a Mont Belvieu, both from Permian Basin and other areas of Texas and the Ford basin. Ironically, some of the barrels that were affected by that, we are now fracking at Mont Belvieu. And so what we are seeing is a very tightening of frac capacity, we think that's going to increase over the next six to nine months before some of these other fracs come on, including ours. So we see the value of any available capacity at Belvieu - Belvieu is going to get increasingly better. So we're pretty excited about that. And we're also excited that we kicked off the frac A, we'll push hard to get that done by the third quarter or earlier. I can't speak to what a lot of others are doing, but we are receiving barrels from Oklahoma delivered to our frac as a result of that for. I'd tell you, when we look at the Enable asset acquisition, we just keep turning over gears and how incredible it is in this time when the fastest-growing area in nation in Haynesville, there was already a 42-inch approved and being constructed. And as we have said, it should be in the ground by the end of the year. We did just complete an open season. It went exceptionally well. The demand to get volumes, not only out of North Louisiana, but other areas of the U.S. down Gulf Coast is enormous. We're going through discussions and negotiations with a large amount of producers and shippers that were interested in that, and we'll be making those decisions. We can add compression and add about 1 Bcf, but we also are looking at having to loop the line potentially all the way down to Lake Charles. So still a lot we're working on there, but we are in negotiations and certainly expect to talk more for our next earnings call. Yes, we can go from 1.65x to 2.6x just with compression. You said Warrior, right? Yes. Certainly, with the announcement of the pipeline, some of the bigger producers that were worried about capacity. They've signed those up. However, we are talking to some of those already. In addition to that, we have a bunch of producers of course, upstream and then some very strong markets downstream. We have a pretty balanced customer base from both ends. We are seeing a tremendous amount of interest - and we do expect to hopefully make some headway, certainly before our next earnings call and still remain very optimistic that we'll get that to FID. Okay this is Mackie again. Yes, we've already announced that we're building 2 more cryos, things like everybody that can say the word cryos announcing projects out there. Fortunately, we kind of - we're looking ahead years ago. We built a 24-inch and then we built a other 24-inch. So we've got capacity to not only handle the liquids from our plant that we're building plus additional plants. We also are a big takeaway from a lot of the other plants out in that area. I believe there's about 2.2 million barrels moving out forward basin - I mean, I'm sorry, out of the Permian Basin and about 35% to 36% of that is us, and we do see that increase for the remainder this year and beyond. We don't see that over the next year to two, but who knows. There's, still enormous opportunities to grow from the best rock in the world, multiple pay zones out in the Permian Basin. So - but we're sitting pretty good for the next year or two - and of course, we have the 30-inch from the fourth basin down and have plenty of capacity in that pipeline. So around capturing CO2? Okay yes, I think others have been asked that question. But the bottom line on that is where is the CO2 and where is the closest location to sequester it. And Louisiana is such an excellent state because they're one of the only states that we're aware of that have asked for primacy so that you could actually get a permit, a plastics permit approved by the state instead of going through the EPA, that hasn't been approved yet. But anyway, Louisiana is a little ahead of the game. There's a lot more treating, a lot more CO2 in North Louisiana. So there's more of a need to sequester CO2 there. And that's why we've kind of focused our efforts on a really attractive project that Tom and his team have worked very closely on that we're pretty excited about. Sure. Michael is Mackie. There is some. We're not rushing that, but we certainly are way out in front of it as far as surveying and laying out the route. But no, there's no significant dollars in 2022. Yes, Michael, it's not that material. We're - as you know, we have built out an extensive pipeline network that we have tremendous ability to grow we're close to maxing out what we can do both from an ethane standpoint and from an LPG standpoint. But we're looking at everything. We were able to eke out a little bit more little less than 10,000 barrels that we were able to expand, and we'll continue to look at those opportunities until we make the decision to significantly expand at Marcus Hook. Thank you. But I'll just add to that, we're extremely optimistic. Tom and his team are working with many companies in many countries, and we're highly confident that we'll get just fully sold out to the 15 million tons. Sure. This is Mackie again. When Kelsey kind of gave us the directive that we need to step in to pet chem, we certainly are doing that, two perspectives: one, we're - from an M&A perspective, anything that's for sale, we'll take a look at pretty much like anything in the industry; and then on the organic side, we're excited the project that we're working on, we truly believe we're not just saying it. It's the most unique world-class facility anywhere on the - around the world. And we say that because where it's located, we're going to be able to move propane, butane, ethane and natural gasoline through four existing pipelines, all four of which we have significant capability of expanding. In addition to that, upstream of the cracker will have access to refined products like butane components and gasoline components. Who knows where the gasoline demand is going to go to the next 5 to 10 to 15 years. Some believe that that's going to get very depressed pricing, and we think that will be a very cheap feedstock for our customers. And also with the cracker and the pathosis technology that's part of our plant, we'll be able to track things like methanol and ethanol and mixed alcohols and even plastics into ethylene. So just an incredible amount of flexibility, and we think very advantageous to any other cracker in the world as far as the cost and value of the upstream feedstocks. And then you look at downstream, we have every intention to connect it to our new Spindletop ethylene storage facility that has a header system connected to multiple ethylene pipelines. We have every intention to connect all of this to Mont Belvieu as well as to some of the pipes going into Louisiana. And then, of course, at Nederland, we'll have the capability of exporting both ethylene and propylene. So once again, we're in the early stages. We have no intention of moving forward without a very big customer - I'm sorry, a very big partner on that. And we're structuring this agreement, and we'll move forward with tolling agreements. So this isn't going to be a petchem where we're going to be speculating a rule in the dice on the cyclical nature of profits from petchems. We're going to do this like we do all our deals. We're going to have a have a polling arrangement with guaranteed revenues and a guaranteed rate of return over a period of time. So we're not there yet, but we great team working on it, and we really are excited about that project, we can get that FID. Yes. Yes. As we mentioned, have - our gathering system already connected. We have our intern intrastate, residue pipelines connected to it. It's very early on. This acquisition moved pretty quickly. So we'll continue to evaluate and certainly do like we do with any of our acquisitions or any of our new build cryos, where we'll integrate it in and figure out a way to best, most properly and efficiently operate that system. Fortunately or unfortunately, however you want to look at it is it's going to be pretty darn full just with the long-term dedications from a handful of producers today. But certainly, as we integrate and bring into our system, we'll create as much value as we can with that new asset with our existing assets."

I'd like to start today by looking at some of our first quarter highlights. We started the year off with a strong first quarter, where we generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 billion and DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, was $2.1 billion. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $1.5 billion. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of approximately $1.1 billion after distributions of $618 million and growth capital of approximately $390 million. On April 26, we were pleased to announce a quarterly cash distribution of $0.20 per common unit or $0.80 on an annualized basis, which represents a more than 30% increase over the first quarter of 2021. As a reminder, future increases to the distribution level will be evaluated quarterly with the ultimate goal of returning distributions to the previous level of $30.5 per quarter or $1.22 on an annual basis, while balancing our leverage target, growth opportunities and unit buybacks. Operationally, we have a brand franchise with assets in all the major producing basins in the U.S. and saw throughput increase our segments as rig counts continue to improve across the U.S. In addition, we completed construction of several growth projects, which I'll provide more details on shortly. In March of 2022, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our 51% interest in Energy Transfer Canada for cash proceeds of approximately $270 million. In addition, the sale is expected to reduce our consolidated debt by approximately $450 million. This sale allows us to divest of these noncore assets at an attractive valuation and utilize the cash proceeds to further deleverage our balance sheet and redeploy capital with our U.S. footprint. The transaction is on track and expected to close by the third quarter of 2022. Also in March of this year, we completed a $325 million bolt-on acquisition of underground storage assets and an ethylene storage header that further enhanced our Mont Belvieu and Nederland positions. This acquisition of the Spindletop asset provides us with an exceptional ethylene storage and transportation header system located strategically between our Mont Belvieu and our Nederland terminals. The header system is connected to multiple ethylene pipeline customers. In addition, it has 2 active storage caverns, 1 cavern under development and the potential to develop at least 4 or 5 more storage caverns. We believe this system will play a major role in connecting ethylene supply in markets along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast as we are seeing significant and unprecedented interest for many of the petchem players in utilizing not only the storage facilities, but also the ethylene header system. Now for a brief update on the integration of the Enable assets. We continue to expect the combined company to generate more than $100 million of annual run rate cost savings synergies, of which we expect to achieve $75 million in 2022. The majority of our back-office integration is complete, including integration of bank accounts, general ledger and treasury systems. We continue to identify and evaluate a number of commercial and operational synergies that are expected to enhance the operational capabilities of our systems by capitalizing on improved efficiencies and increasing utilization and profitability of our combined assets. This includes opportunities to run plants more efficiently, potentially converting pipelines to different products as well as optimizing our combined assets to provide customers on our enabled systems with access to premium markets further downstream through our vast energy transfer pipeline network. I'll now walk you through recent developments on our growth projects. In March, we announced that we have entered into 2 20-year LNG sale and purchase agreements for our Lake Charles LNG project with ENN Natural Gas and ENN Energy Holdings Limited. Under the 2 SPAs, ET LNG is expected to supply 1.8 million tonnes per annum of LNG to ENN Natural Gas and 0.9 million tonnes per annum of LNG to ENN Energy. On Monday of this week, we also announced the signing of a 20-year LNG purchase and sell agreement with a subsidiary of Gunvor Group for 2 million tonnes of LNG per annum. And yesterday, we announced the signing of another long-term LNG offtake agreement with SK Gas, an affiliate of the Korean conglomerate SK, for 0.4 metric tonnes per annum for a term of 18 years. The purchase price for all these agreements is indexed to the Henry Hub benchmark plus a fixed liquefaction charge and the LNG will be delivered on a free on board basis. The SPAs will become fully effective upon the satisfaction of the conditions precedent by ET LNG, including reaching FID. We are also in active negotiations with a number of other high qualified customers, and we expect to make an announcement of additional offtake agreements in the weeks ahead. As we have previously stated, we expect to finance a significant portion of the capital cost of this project by means of the sale of equity in the project to infrastructure funds and possibly to 1 or more industry participants in conjunction with the LNG offtake agreements. We are currently targeting FID for this project in the fourth quarter of this year. Recent events in Europe highlighted the importance of LNG from the United States, a country with abundant natural gas supply and strong geopolitical ties to Europe. We are hopeful that our Lake Charles LNG project will be a significant factor in the long-term solution for global energy needs. Looking at Mariner East pipeline system. During the first quarter of this year, we completed construction of the final phase of the Mariner East pipeline, which brought our total NGL capacity on the Mariner East pipeline system to more than 365,000 barrels per day, including ethane. For the first quarter of 2022, NGL volumes in the Mariner East pipeline system and Marcus Hook Terminal remains steady. Since the end of the first quarter, we have seen an uptick in volumes through the pipelines and expect to see incremental revenue and volume growth for the remainder of the year. And our Pennsylvania access project, which allows refined products to flow from the Midwest supply regions into Pennsylvania, New York and other markets in the Northeast, started flowing refined products in January of this year. At our expanded Nederland Terminal, NGL volumes remained strong during the first quarter, including export volumes under our Orbit ethane export joint venture. For the first quarter, we loaded approximately 8 million barrels of ethane out of the facility. And for full year 2022, we continue to expect to load more than 40 million barrels of ethane with that increasing to up to 60 million barrels for 2023. We also expect our LPG export volumes at Nederland to continue to grow in 2022. In total, we continue to export more NGLs than any other company or country and our percentage of worldwide NGL export remain at nearly 20% of the world market. We are seeing long-term increases in NGL demand and market value both here in the U.S. as well as internationally. We expect to participate in this growth as well as increase our market share as our franchise is uniquely well situated to benefit from this expanding market. We are seeing strong from overseas customers seeking additional supply from the United States, and we have recently secured sufficient commitments to move forward on the ethane expansion. Even though we expect to expand our ethane export capabilities at both Marcus Hook and Nederland Terminal terminals, these commitments provide us with the opportunity of expanding at either terminal. Therefore, we are evaluating which location would be best suited for our next ethane expansion project. We continue to evaluate the opportunity to develop a petchem project along the Gulf Coast. If we are able to reach FID, we believe that our cracker will be a very unique world-class facility, providing unparalleled access to the lowest cost feedstock through our pipeline systems, as well as unparalleled access to downstream domestic and international ethylene and propylene markets through our pipelines, our storage facilities and our export terminal. We're in discussions with a number of high-quality customers as we work to secure long-term tolling type commitments prior to reaching FID. And we also intend to have a significant partnership with one or more industry participants. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate potential M&A opportunities in the pet chem space. Turning to Cushing South Pipeline. In June 2021, we commenced service on the 65,000 barrel per day crude oil pipeline providing transportation service from our Cushing Terminal to our Nederland Terminal, which also provides access for Powder River and EJ Basin barrels to our Nederland Terminal via an upstream connection with our White Cliffs pipeline. In the first quarter of 2022, we completed Phase 2, which nearly doubled the pipeline's capacity to 120,000 barrels per day. The majority of the capacity is under take-or-pay contracts and the pipeline is already utilized in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 capacity to move volumes south to our Gulf Coast terminals, providing significant revenue potential as the arbs improve. Next, in April, we placed into service the Ted Collins Link, which provides market connectivity for our Houston terminal. The Ted Collins Link gives us the ability to fully load and export WTI barrels as well as low-gravity Bakken barrels out of the Houston market, demonstrating Energy Transfer's unique ability to provide a neat Bakken barrel to markets along the Gulf Coast. In April, we completed our inaugural shipment of oil from our Houston terminal for export utilizing this system and expect our export volumes to grow throughout the year. Our Permian Bridge project, connecting our gathering and processing assets in the Delaware and the Midland Basin, were placed into service in October of 2021. In addition, in the first quarter of 2022, we completed an expansion of Permian Bridge, which brought the pipeline's total capacity to over 200,000 Mcf per day. This project allows us to move rich gas out of the Midland Basin to utilize available Delaware processing capacity more efficiently, while also providing access to additional takeaway options. It is being utilized to provide operational flexibility between our processing facilities in the 2 basins. Current Permian Basin plant inlet processing volumes are over 2.2 Bcf per day and we're evaluating our options to meet increasing production from the basin. Construction of our new 200 million cubic foot per day GrayWolf processing plant in the Delaware Basin has commenced. The GrayWolf plant is supported by new commitments and growth from existing customer contracts and is expected to be in service by the end of this year. In addition to providing incremental revenue to our Midstream segment, once in service, the volumes from the tailgate of the plant will utilize our gas and NGL pipelines for takeaway, providing additional revenue streams for our intrastate and NGL segments. And due to significant producer demand, we anticipate moving forward with a second processing plant in the Permian Basin for which we are currently determining the best location. The plan has already included in our 2022 growth capital forecast. We continue to be very excited about our pipeline project from the Permian Basin to address the growing needs for additional natural gas takeaway. This project has significant advantages over competing projects. It would include the construction of a new intrastate pipeline from the Midland Basin to our extensive pipeline network south of the DFW area, paralleling existing right of way. From there, our vast pipeline systems provide significant flexibility to deliver natural gas to premier markets along the Texas Gulf Coast, including Katy, Beaumont and the Houston Ship Channel as well as to Carthage with potential deliveries to most major U.S. trading hubs and markets. Given the strong interest we are seeing for this project and ongoing producer discussions, we hope to announce additional information soon. In the meantime, we are working on time-sensitive surveys and the regulatory process has already begun. This project is an ideal solution for natural gas growth out of the Permian Basin and is clearly the best choice for customers in regard to timing, cost, flexibility and the access to multiple premium and liquid markets. Given the proposed route and our ability to utilize existing assets, we believe we could complete construction of the project in the 2 years or less once we have reached FID. In the meantime, modernization and demoded acting work on our Oasis pipeline continues, which will add an incremental 60,000 Mcf per day of much needed capacity out of the Permian Basin. This capacity is expected to be available by the end of 2022. Next, construction on the Gulf Run Pipeline, which is a 42-inch interstate natural gas pipeline with 1.65 Bcf of capacity is underway. Gulf Run is backed by a 20-year commitment for 1.1 Bcf per day from Golden Pass LNG and will provide natural gas transportation between the Haynesville Shale and the Gulf Coast, connecting some of the most prolific natural gas producing regions in the United States with the LNG export market. Pipeline construction is underway and is expected to be completed by the end of 2022. As demand continues to grow out of the Haynesville, we expect to move forward with an expansion project in the not-too-distant future. Turning to our Trans-Panama Gateway pipeline. We are working closely with the appropriate entities within Panama to successfully bring this project to fruition. Panama's geographic location and favorable investment climate make this an attractive project. We remain optimistic about the Trans-Panama Gateway pipeline and the significant value it will bring to markets around the world. Now for an update on our alternative energy activities. We continue to pursue a number of projects related to carbon capture, including sequestration, enhanced oil recovery and utilization projects. We are in active discussions with several developers who have applied for Class 6 sequestration permits with the EPA in Louisiana in close proximity to our facilities that would be good candidates for carbon capture and sequestration. Unfortunately, the approval process for these sequestration permits generally takes 2 to 3 years to obtain. However, in addition to our desire to lower our carbon footprint, we remain focused on our primary business, which is providing the essential energy infrastructure necessary to grow domestic energy production which is vital to ensuring our country's energy security and the growing needs worldwide, providing additional supplies of clean, affordable and reliable natural gas and vital natural gas liquids is the most logical and quickest way to reduce emissions, while also significantly improving the quality of life for billions of people in developing nations around the world. With the significant growth in our natural gas transportation and natural gas liquids segments, along with our extensive export capabilities through our NGL terminals and with line of sight to reach FID for our Lake Charles LNG project, we expect to continue to play an important role in reducing emissions while improving living conditions throughout the world. Now let's take a closer look at our first quarter results. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $3.3 billion compared to $5 billion for the first quarter of 2021. Results for the first quarter of 2021 included a contribution of approximately $2.4 billion from Winter Storm Uri. Excluding this contribution, first quarter 2022 adjusted EBITDA and would have been up approximately 25% over the first quarter of 2021. DCF attributable to the partners as adjusted was $2.1 billion for the first quarter of 2022 compared to $3.9 billion for the first quarter of 2021, again, as a result of the impact to the prior period from Winter Storm Uri. For the first quarter, we saw higher transportation volumes across all of our segments as well as a full quarter contribution from the available assets that were acquired in December 2021. On April 26, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.20 per common unit or $0.80 on an annualized basis. This distribution will be paid on May 19 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on May 9. This distribution represents a 30% increase over the first quarter of 2021 and represents another step in our plan to return additional value to unitholders, while maintaining our leverage ratio target of 4 times to 4.5 times debt-to-EBITDA. Now turning to results by segment, starting with NGL and refined products, adjusted EBITDA was $700 million compared to $647 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to higher fractionation and refinery services margins, higher terminal services margins related to increased throughput at our Nederland Terminal in the first quarter of 2022, as well as an increase in our Northeast blending and optimization activities. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines increased to 1.8 million barrels per day compared to 1.5 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to increased export volumes feeding into our Nederland Terminal and higher volumes from the Permian and Eagle Ford regions. And our average fractionated volumes were 804,000 barrels per day compared to 726,000 barrels per day for the first quarter of 2021. We recently tied our 1-day maximum throughput record through the fracs at over 960,000 barrels. And for the month of April, we reached an all-time monthly throughput record averaging well over 900,000 barrels per day. For our crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $593 million compared to $510 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to higher food transportation volumes on our Texas crude pipelines, improved performance on our Bakken and Bayou Bridge pipelines, increased throughput at our Gulf Coast terminals as well as the addition of the Enable assets in December of 2021. Crude oil transportation volumes increased 4.2 million barrels per day compared to 3.5 million barrels per day for the same period last year, driven by higher crude oil prices, higher refinery demand and Winter Storm Uri impacting crude oil production in the prior period. For our midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $807 million compared to $288 million for the first quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to the acquisition of the Enable assets in December of 2021 and an increase related to favorable NGL and natural gas prices as well as increased production in the Permian and South Texas regions. In addition, the first quarter of 2021 included a negative impact related to Winter Storm Uri that did not occur in the first quarter of 2022. Gathered gas volumes were 17.3 million MMBtus per day compared to 12 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year due to the addition of the Enable assets, increased production in South Texas as well as additional gathering capacity from the Permian Bridge pipeline in West Texas. Permian Basin volumes continue to be strong and Midland inlet volumes remain at or near record highs. We are utilizing the Permian Bridge daily to optimize our available processing capacity as well as increasing our processing capacity in the area to accommodate incremental demand we are seeing. In our interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $453 million compared to $453 million for the first quarter of 2021. During the quarter, we benefited from the addition of the Enable assets as well as the volume growth on our Transwestern Rover and Trunkline systems as a result of increased rates and higher utilization due to more favorable market conditions and volume growth in the Haynesville Shale. While volumes have continued to improve, this growth was partially offset by a decrease due to gains recorded in the first quarter of 2021 related to Winter Storm Uri operational gas sales. In addition, adjusted EBITDA was impacted by contract expirations and a shipper bankruptcy on our Tiger pipeline. More recently, we have seen steady growth in the interstate segment with Transwestern continuing to benefit from high prices and demand for gas delivery out west, and Trunkline and Tiger both seeing strong demand related to increased activity on the Gulf Coast and in the Haynesville Shale. In fact, we are currently seeing record volumes from Tiger. And for our interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $444 million compared to $2.8 million for the first quarter of last year. The change was primarily due to the absence of higher earnings from Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter of 2021, which was partially offset by the addition of the Enable assets in December of 2021. Since the end of the first quarter, we have seen heavy utilization on our HBL system due to increased demand for gas takeaway out of the Permian as well as strong volumes in South Texas. In addition, due to increased activity in the Haynesville Shale, our Rick pipeline system is currently flowing at or near capacity. We expect this demand to continue through the rest of 2022. Now turning to our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance, given our strong performance in the first quarter as well as continued increasing demand for our products as we move through the rest of the year, we now expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between $12.2 billion to $12.6 billion. This is up compared to our previous guidance of $11.8 billion to $12.2 billion. And moving to our growth capital update for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022, Energy Transfer spent approximately $390 million on organic growth projects, primarily in the midstream, interstate and NGL and refined products segment, excluding Sun and USA compression CapEx. For full year 2022, we now expect growth capital expenditures, including expenditures related to the recently acquired Enable assets to be between $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion compared to our previous forecast of $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion. Our revised growth capital reflects the addition of spend associated with our new Permian gas takeaway pipeline. Now looking briefly at our liquidity position as of March 31, 2022. Total available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities was approximately $2 billion, and our leverage ratio was 3.55x for the credit facility. We continue to have strong support from our banking partners, and in April 2022, we amended our $5 billion revolving credit facility to extend the maturity to April 2027, with substantially the same terms and pricing. We continue to expect to generate a significant amount of cash flows in 2022, which will be strategically allocated in a manner that best positions us to continue to improve our leverage, invest in high-returning growth projects and return value to our unitholders. And we expect to continue to pay down debt throughout the year with excess cash flow from operations. During the first quarter, we saw strong performance from all of our segments with significant volume growth supported by improved production and increased demand that we expect to continue throughout 2022. We have already seen further improvements in production, market conditions and domestic and international demand for our products since the end of the first quarter, and we remain bullish about the future of our industry and the need for natural gas and natural gas liquids. As we look for additional ways to address existing and new demand for our products, we will continue to evaluate and pursue strategic growth projects that enhance our existing asset base and generate attractive returns like our Permian gas pipeline project. And we will also look to make progress on the alternative energy front, which can further enhance and effectively grow our energy franchise. Operator, please open the line up for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And from Bernstein, we have Jean N. Salisbury. Please go ahead.\nJean Salisbury: I just have a couple of questions about Lake Charles. Exciting that you're targeting FID in fourth quarter of 2022, can you just kind of walk us through besides getting contracts, the other things that would need to happen for that? I think there was an engineering review going on. I think you need a FERC extension, getting a partner, but all of the stuff around reaching FID.\nThomas Mason: Yes. This is Tom Mason, I'm in charge of our LNG project, and we're really excited about where we are today. We've got really strong demand from really high-quality customers. We're really confident about reaching FID. Of course, the marketing and the offtake agreements is key to getting a deal done. The other things that you mentioned are underway that the update on the EPC bid process, bid refresh is underway. We filed an application for an extension of our construction deadline with the FERC. We understand that's in process, and we're confident that we'll receive approval of that in the near future. So I think things are going well, and we're really excited about it.\nJean Salisbury: Okay. So you see the contracting as sort of the time-critical path, I guess?\nThomas Mason: Yes. Yes. And we're -- world's kind of gone upside down with what's going on in Ukraine and it's kind of accelerated the demand. But yes, the contracts are the gating item that we're really making good progress.\nMarshall McCrea: This is Mackie. Let me add just one thing, if I could, Jean, sorry about that. I was listening to Tom Long and listened to Tom Mason and they're pretty even keeled laid back. And I don't think they're excited but they don't really show how excited we are in this LNG project has really taken off. It's sad it took a travesty like what's going on in Ukraine to wake up the world. It certainly has woken up Europe and Asia and China. Hopefully, they'll wake up some of our administrators, but Tom has done a fantastic job, and we've got an enormous amount of interest, as you can imagine, and we are shocked if we don't get to FID by the end of this year and look forward not only to get that project down the road and signed, but also look forward to all the upstream pipeline transportation business will come with that project.\nJean Salisbury: Well, that's a lot of excitement. I'm also excited. And then just as a follow-up to that, can you kind of comment on whether you're actually seeing European utilities sign contracts? It seems like there's been a lot of contracts recently, but not really from them. Do you see that as going through the marketers? Or just any commentary that you can provide on that would be helpful.\nThomas Mason: Well, it's an interesting question because the utilities are kind of struggling with trying to satisfy their immediate and near-term demand for gas, as you could imagine. But for long-term contracts, they're still interested. I think there's been kind of some issues with financial matters based on the high price of demand for natural gas currently. And so there could end up being some government guarantees for some of the longer-term offtake contracts, so we're certainly in contact with them. But you're right, there's kind of been a lack of real commitments for long-term contracts at this point.\nOperator: From JPMorgan, we have Jeremy Tonet. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: I just want to start off with the EBITDA guide uplift here. I want to dive in a little bit for what's happening in 2022 here. If you could break down the drivers, being it better-than-expected volumes? Or is it better-than-expected price that's the driver here? And if I look at the first quarter results, and I annualize that, granted, there's some seasonality in the business, so it would kind of point to over the high end of the new range. So just wondering what some of the puts and takes could be there?\nTom Long: This is Tom Long, Jeremy, I'll take off with that. Clearly, the first quarter, we're very, very excited about. We've got great results out of the optimization team. When you look at our assets, even as we went through, I think you'll note the intrastate segment. But as you look out through the rest of the year, we've been pretty conservative on pricing, which was another, obviously, a big component of it is we took the guidance up. And we've -- we were very intentional on staying conservative on that. So we'll see how the rest of the year really plays out. But I would say that the first quarter, you can see the amount we're up, and that's really basically the amount that we took the guidance up overall as the run rate. If you were really looking at that first quarter from a result standpoint, probably in the range of maybe $225 million to $250 million, you could put into the they call it the onetime type bucket, but not nonrecurring type. But at the same time, we do have a fantastic team and a great asset base. So optimization is something that will always play a big role in our results.\nJeremy Tonet: And as I think about the CapEx uplift there, -- just wondering, is that really just related to the Permian gas project? Are there other -- are there other projects to call out there for the CapEx raise? I'm just wondering, is '23 moving around as well higher? Just any kind of thoughts on the cadence of CapEx here would be helpful.\nMarshall McCrea: Yes. This is Mackie again, Jeremy. There are -- we've got a lot of moving parts, as you can imagine, to our partnership, where as you know, we're building GreyWolf, we have decided we are going to build another plant and try and figure out exactly where that's going to go. We have a lot of gathering opportunities. Most of our large projects, multibillion-dollar projects are built out, and that's really to earlier question, as we go into this year into future years, we're able to bring a lot of volume and a lot of revenue in those assets that we've already completed. But for the most part, it is -- we do have or in there, we do have GrayWolf and the portion of [Indiscernible] and do have GreyWolf and then this other plant that we've talked about expanding here in the near future.\nOperator: From UBS, we have Brian Reynolds. Please go ahead.\nBrian Reynolds: Maybe just as a follow-up to CapEx and maybe looking out a little bit further to 2023. We've seen some recent tractive capacity get added by peers. And your comments in the prepared remarks about reaching record frac volumes. I was just curious about how -- I mean your transfer is thinking about frac A at this point, just given that I believe it's half complete at this point. And potentially one of the CapEx needs left to complete that project?\nTom Long: Yes, Brian, that's a great question. As we speak, we're moving more volumes out of the Permian and more volumes out of the Eagle Ford than we've ever moved NGL volumes. So we are going to have to make that decision sooner than later. We're at our full max capacity right now running around 960. However, we don't want to move forward until we have secured long-term commitments for that net frac. We do anticipate that happening possibly in the next quarter-or-so, maybe sooner. But we're going to -- as we've done, we're going to be prudent around our capital and we'll spend that capital when needed, but we do anticipate making that decision in the not-too-distant future.\nBrian Reynolds: So just to clarify that could just be upside to '22 CapEx? Or is that mostly 23?\nTom Long: It'd be mostly in '23.\nBrian Reynolds: And then as my follow-up, a lot of progress on the LNG front with the recent flurry of contracts. Just kind of curious if you could provide some thought process around the ultimate ownership structure and potentially bringing in partners, whether that's a financing partner or a strategic partner, just given the ultimate interest in LNG and ultimately, how that would fit in the ultimate Energy Transfer portfolio?\nThomas Mason: Yes. This is Tom Mason. We -- as we previously announced, we plan to do some portion of equity sell down to primarily infrastructure funds. There's lots of money that are looking for high-quality, long-term cash flow from a project like this. So we think that's going to be a really good way of financing it. We expect that we keep at least 25% of the project, haven't made final decisions on that yet, but it's going to be -- there's just a lot of interest in the equity side of this project.\nOperator: From Wells Fargo, we have Praneet Satish. Please go ahead.\nPraneet Satish: Just sticking on Lake Charles. I guess if you didn't move ahead with the project, can you quantify how much of a gas demand pull this could have on your existing pipes? I guess it would be Trunkline and Gulf Run that feeds into it. How much spare capacity do you have on trunk line? Would you have to expand either Trunkline or Gulf Run because of Lake Charles?\nMarshall McCrea: Yes. This is Mackie, Praneet. Absolutely, we'll be looking to expand Trunkline, we'll be looking to expand Gulf Run as we talked about on this call, and we'll continue to pursue the project in West Texas, that will also -- we anticipate feed into this. So the beauty about our pipeline network, both intra and interstate, unlike most of our competitors, we can aggregate the large volumes from multiple basins and bring it to points like this to Henry Hub into Lake Charles. So we mentioned on -- when Tom started out and his reading is that we will be probably going out for an open season on golf run here sometime the latter part of May. We think there will be a significant amount of interest. But at the end of the day, we will be anticipate transporting up to 2.5 to 2.7 Bcf a day into Lake Charles into additional markets in that area through our pipeline network.\nPraneet Satish: And then I think you noted Haynesville production has really started to pick up the last few months. Are you seeing any interest for long-term contracts on your pipes in the region? And I guess, specifically, I'm asking about Tiger. Is there a path to maybe contract this pipe up? Or is it more kind of interruptible volumes that are flowing on it right now?\nMarshall McCrea: Well, as was mentioned earlier, we are almost at full capacity. A lot of that is month-to-month. However, we have even recently contracted up. I'll give you an example, we contracted up a producer that will ramp up to 550,000 a day that will utilize both Tiger capacity, Gulf Run capacity and capacity through our intrastate pipeline network in Carthage. So we just cater to whatever the producer looks for as far as what they're trying to get to on the Gulf Coast. And we -- our issue right now is we got to go find more capacity. Haynesville is growing faster or as fast as any other basin, and we will play an integral part like we already are in finding a way out of that area in Gulf Run, there's 1 major outlet along with our other intrastate pipelines and frontline.\nOperator: From Credit Suisse, we have Spiro Dounis. Please go ahead.\nSpiro Dounis: A few cleanup questions on Lake Charles, if we could. Just a multipart question here, but just curious how you guys are thinking about expected project returns? And maybe what sort of CapEx we could think about going forward? Is this a pretty typical midstream return, maybe 6 to 8 multiple? Or can you do better than that? And then as you think about getting to FID, is there a level of capacity you're trying to contract first? What does that look like? And then finally, some that you're talking to several partners here on this ultimately, how much of this project are you kind of willing to sell down? Is there a target number in mind?\nMarshall McCrea: This is Mackie. Sure. Tom may follow up on this, but we have a lot of projects in the capital to pursue those projects. We've got to be prudent about that. So there are certainly thresholds, and we certainly will make sure that we meet those thresholds. A lot of the revenue that we anticipate receiving from the LNG project is really from the pipeline infrastructure from bringing -- transporting natural gas to this facility. So at the end of the day, we'd have no problem on it as low as 25%. We'll operate it. We will bring all the volume in there, and we will be more than happy with that level. As far as what level to get to FID, as we've mentioned, we probably have twice the interest that we have capacity for right now in our 15 million tonnes, so we are highly optimistic that we will fully contract this out, but we'll certainly make that type of business decision as we get closer, especially as we get closer to the end of the year and get all these contracts lined up to when we'll move forward. But we'll make the right business at that time. But as we say, we're highly optimistic that we'll have this fully contracted by the end of the year.\nSpiro Dounis: Second one, on CapEx. You always talk about the sort of long-term CapEx run rate range of $500 million to $700 million for the growth side. And I haven't seen that reference in a while. And obviously, that was before Enable and really before this current environment. It sounds like you've got a lot in the hopper, a lot of exciting things to talk about. But just curious how you're thinking about that run rate going forward, especially as you're growing the distribution. What sort of CapEx annually should we think about you guys spending on forward to maintain your sort of capital parameters?\nTom Long: This is Tom Long. You've clearly touched upon the fact that we've got a lot of great projects here, no doubt. We haven't got any of them to FID. So the $500 million to $700 million that we put out, we're probably not prepared to put out 2023 at this stage. I will tell you as we go through the year and as these projects get approved, we probably will go ahead and update that. But at this time, this is -- we really don't have another further update other than these projects as we move forward to getting them to FID.\nOperator: From Goldman Sachs, we have Michael Lapides. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lapides: I have two, they're kind of unrelated. One, just in the Northeast, how are you thinking -- I know you just got Mariner East online. I know it's finishing up 2 and 2x and I know it's been a lengthy process. How are you thinking, though, about the potential to expand if there is potential to expand 2 times and 2x, or the broader kind of West to East system? And how do you think about it if there's opportunity to expand Marcus Hook?\nMarshall McCrea: Mike, this is Mackie. Gosh, we are so happy to be at the end of the road on Mariner after all these years. We've built an incredible north there of 3 different pipelines that can move a variety of products. We have enormous capability by just adding pumps to significantly increase the throughput on that. It's really where additional costs will come in for any storage or chilling type assets that we'll have to build at Marcus Hook. As we alluded to earlier on this call, we have sufficient volumes for another ethane expansion at Marcus Hook. We're not sure if that's best suited or if it's better to expand at Nederland next, we'll be making that decision over the coming weeks, but we certainly expect over the next year or 2 to be expanding Marcus Hook in a big way. As I said, we built quite a franchise with a lot of money, a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of stress. We're past all that. We've got an enormous amount of customers around the globe. We're talking to as many as 600,000 barrels a day of NGL markets out there. So there's plenty of markets out there. And so our job from a commercial standpoint is to go secure more commitments, which we have done, and we'll be moving forward on expanding Marcus Hook and Nederland over the next several years.\nMichael Lapides: And then one follow-up, totally unrelated to that. Can you -- we talked about it on multiple earnings calls and at multiple conferences. Can you give a little more detail on the potential project in Panama? Just -- I'm trying to get my arms around size around a little bit around kind of the terrain of route you're thinking about the complexity of construction. Is this kind of a multiyear construction process that could be a difficult construction process? And I'm trying to think about kind of a ballpark range of kind of dollar commitment on your end and whether you want to be the full owner of that type of project?\nTom Long: Yes, Mike, we're still pretty early in this process. We couldn't be, like a lot of this, more excited about the relationships that we built down there and the operating for that. It's premature to begin talking about capital or even the exact routes for a number of reasons. We're going through a process that's required in that country. But we're very excited. We think, at the end of the day, this could be a very significant international hub for the world, not just for the Caribbean or the Western Coast of North and South America, but also, of course, for Asia. So it's a little bit preliminary to get any major details, but we remain very excited about that.\nOperator: From Wolfe Research, we have Keith Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKeith Stanley: I wanted to start on the distribution. So you've now had 2 quarters where you raised it pretty quickly and pretty steadily. What factors are going to govern sort of the pace of increases going forward? And if the balance sheet is on track, I mean the business is doing very well. Is there any reason to think it won't be more of the same of what we've seen in the past 2 quarters until you get back to that $1.22 goal?\nTom Long: Yes. Keith, it's -- you probably touched upon one of the most commonly asked questions here right now. It's -- we really don't want to get out in front of the board. I know that we've been saying that we'll evaluate this quarter by quarter. Clearly, a great start to the year with the first quarter results and what we've seen. So let us kind of get through each quarter and have the discussion with our Board on this as we move forward. There's other things that are factored in here when we talk about our capital allocation, and that's a lot of these great projects that we're talking about here today. And likewise, just to continue to look at the leverage metrics. But I do want to reiterate what you said. We have made great progress toward moving toward our target of that 4 to 4.5. As you know, each agency calculates that a little bit differently. So I encourage you to reach out to each of them to see kind of where they're at. But we're getting closer to the 4.5, so let all those -- let us look at all those factors quarter-by-quarter as we move through the year, and that will go into that decision each quarter.\nKeith Stanley: And sorry, I have more on Lake Charles. First, just confirming, I mean, it's -- it sounds like 3 trains. I think, Mackie, you referred to 2.5 Bcf a day and the 15 Mcba capacity figure. So you're thinking 3 trains. And then second, I'm just thinking if you sold down the project to only a 25% ownership interest, just given the economics around that, what in your equity sort of investment need in the export facility then be an extremely small number?\nThomas Mason: Yes, this is Tom Mason. Yes, it would be -- obviously, we would expect to have some promoted interest from the -- on the equity side. So our capital requirements would be relatively small and of course, spaced over a 4-year period-or-so. So the returns can be quite good based on -- with little capital being deployed.\nTom Long: And this is Tom Long, I'll chime in a little bit more. I'll just add a little bit more to that. It's a little bit early to try to put a number on that. We haven't really -- other than having some inbounds, we really haven't started a lot of discussion on the equity until we move through the contracting phase. So it's one of those that over the next couple of quarters as we continue to -- Tom and his team continue to make great progress on the contracting that we will be able to put our thumb a little bit more on that number.\nKeith Stanley: And 3 trains is the right way to think about this at this point?\nTom Long: Yes, correct.\nOperator: From Tudor Pickering Holt, we have Colton Bean. Please go ahead.\nColton Bean: So just jumping back to the base business. Tom, you mentioned the optimization earnings and interest rate. I think when we look at the Waha to Katy spread, it was actually relatively flat quarter-on-quarter, but you all still saw a pretty significant step up there. So just wondering if you can update us on what the dynamics were that drove that optimization opportunity.\nMarshall McCrea: Yes, this is Mackie. There's a number of things, and we've said it before. It happened during Uri. We have such an extensive pipeline system throughout Texas. We have an incredible amount of storage strategically placed well in the Houston area and also in the DFW area. We're connected to the vast majority of the power plants either directly or indirectly, will connect to every major LDC in Texas. And so any time there's any kind of volatility or price movements, we're really able to capture that as well as spreads from day to day. There were times in that quarter where the spreads were higher from a going from East Texas to West Texas, there was a period of days where the basis spread was, gosh, I think $1 higher for at least a day-or-so higher in Waha and Katy. So it's just our optimization team optimizing our assets and our pipelines and our storage at every opportunity that we have. And with the assets we have, those opportunities arise quite often in a really cold weather times, high demand and also high heat days.\nColton Bean: And then just on the Enable now that you have the majority of operations integrated. Can you update us on the level of synergies you were able to realize in Q1? And when you'd expect to hit that $100 million run rate?\nTom Long: We have quantified it for the year of 20 -- about this year of 20 -- of $75 million is what we've put out there. As far as the first quarter, don't really have a specific number at this point for that number broke out. But I think overall, we still expect to hit that 75 this year. But I will say that we feel very good about the $100 million run rate annually as we look out. I think it's also just worth noting overall that all the results, we have moved very quickly on getting all these integrated, but I will tell you that all the results that have has come in even through the first quarters we've integrated have been above and beyond any of the projections that we had run in the merger as we were going through putting those numbers into the S1. So we're very, very excited about this transaction, and it's turning out to be a very, very good project for us. So acquisition.\nOperator: From Mizuho, we have Gabriel Moreen. Please go ahead.\nGabriel Moreen: Maybe I can ask on the proposed petchem cracker project. I just was wondering, clearly, it would exceed your cost of capital. I'm just wondering to what extent that project would, I guess, integrate with some of your other assets, whether NGL pipelines, whether you kind of be looking for commitments, further upstream with that project or whether it's really just a stand-alone -- view it as a stand-alone project?\nMarshall McCrea: Gabe, this is Mackie. No, absolutely not a stand-alone. It would be like we do all of our business. We look for synergistic benefits and revenues, both upstream and downstream. So the project that we're targeting and gaining a little momentum with a lot of very high-quality customers would give us access to what we believe will be very inexpensive or less expensive gasoline components a year from now when maybe gasoline demand will start kind of leveling out some. At some point, we do believe that some of the feedstock for this particular cracker that we're designing would be very advantageous to feed this. In addition to that, along with our Spindletop asset that we just bought and our plans to kind of connect the dots between Louisiana and Houston with an ethylene system and a propylene system. This petchem also have access downstream to not only our pipeline network and our storage network, but also have access to our export business for international deliveries. So no, we're looking -- yes, we're looking for a project very similar to LNG, where we'd probably be a minority interest with some promoted partners in that and would have it fully contracted with significant both upstream and downstream revenue as part of that branch.\nGabriel Moreen: And maybe if I could just follow up. Another Mid-Con processor this morning talked about the expectations for growth in '23. I'm just wondering if in any of your secondary basins you kind of concur with that expect in any of your secondary basis, you'd concur with expectations for growth in '23. And to the extent that that's the case, whether you'd be running out of space or you need to spend any CapEx there?\nTom Long: Yes. Let me do this just quickly go. So we talked about the Permian Basin, we're building a plant there. We're going to build another plant. We'll continue to evaluate that. In Haynesville, we'll continue to evaluate new pipelines out of that area. Eagle Ford, we're sitting pretty good, at least for the next year or 2, we've kind of built out, but we will be looking toward the end of this year of whether or not we need to expand that or not. So really stepping up in the Mid-Con in Oklahoma. We are -- we have seen the rigs move back in. We're getting our arms around the enabled assets. Our team is very excited about what's going on there. Our commercial team is working very hard on synergizing those plants and how to be more efficient and profitably operate those. Of course, ultimately, we will be bringing those NGLs into our system. But right now, we don't contemplate adding any additional cryogenic plants up in the Mid-Continent or in Oklahoma, we certainly watch that closely and make sure we stay ahead of that once they're needed.\nOperator: From Bank of America, we have Chase Mulvehill. Please go ahead.\nChase Mulvehill: I guess one question, I guess, related on the pet chem side. You talked about M&A opportunities in the pet chem space. So I don't know if you could talk about what part of the petchem value chain that you're targeting specifically here on the M&A side? And whether you're kind of looking to build scale in the petchem space? Or are you looking for maybe minority ownership so you can work closer with a petchem partner?\nTom Long: This is Tom Long. I'll take off and then Mackie may add a little bit more. But we have been evaluating various acquisition opportunities. We still feel like that's a good way to enter it. But at the same time, we've got a very good team and we're quite comfortable with starting with a greenfield type project. So we're going to continue to look at those. And yes, it would -- it could be a partial joint venture, if you will. We're quite open to that in order to be able to step into the skill set that it takes to move into this or it could be a total acquisition. So we're looking at basically all the above as we evaluate this, including a greenfield build.\nMarshall McCrea: Yes. I think the only thing I'd add to that is with Kelsey's desire to get into pet chem, we're going to look at everything that comes available, take any opportunity. And if once something looks attractive, we'll go after it.\nKevin Smith: That's the Kelsey disclaimer. A quick follow-up, sorry to come back to Lake Charles. But when we think about the permitting on like -- sorry, the contracting on Lake Charles, are you looking -- are these contracts just tolling fees? Or do they actually have some commodity upside exposure as well?\nThomas Mason: They're basically a liquefaction charge, but there is a component like most of the contracts on the Gulf Coast that are tied to Henry Hub plus a percentage above that. So there's -- the higher natural gas prices are there is room for additional cash flows from that.\nMarshall McCrea: Yes. And this is Mackie, I'll add 1 thing to that. We intend to contract out about 15 million tonnes. But as you know, that's nameplate, and there's fairly significant volume above that, that we'll be able to take advantage of as time goes on when we see a blowout in prices between the U.S. and Europe and Asia.\nOperator: We will now turn the call back over to Tom Long for closing remarks. Mr. Long, you may proceed.\nMarshall McCrea: This is Mackie, and before Tom does that, let me just say one thing. We've done this from time to time, but I kind of joked a little bit earlier how excited we are, and we are. We're excited about the assets that we have. We're excited about the employees that we have. And if you just kind of walk through real quickly, just in this quarter, our interest rate volumes were up 17%. Our interstate volumes were up 15%, our midstream volumes were up 14%. Our NGL's record volumes, as I alluded to earlier, were up 17%. We try to make a decision around our next frac in the next probably 6 months, really proud about our crude. We've grown over 20% from quarter-to-quarter in a very tough crude environment where there's not as many barrels available out there in the Permian and our team has done an excellent job there. And we've also really gained a lot of traction through our terminals and increased that by 17%. So as I mentioned earlier, what's happening with Ukraine, we hope will wake up our country and wake up our leaders to how important natural gas is and natural gas liquids are not only because of affordability, reliable and all that, but for security, not only for the U.S. but also for the world. So hopefully, we wake up because we need our leaders to.\nTom Long: All right. Well, thank all of you for joining us today, and we look forward to any follow-up questions you might have.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Long",
            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer first quarter 2022 earnings call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of our senior management team, who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based on our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, which we expect to be filed tomorrow, May 5. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'd like to start today by looking at some of our first quarter highlights. We started the year off with a strong first quarter, where we generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 billion and DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, was $2.1 billion. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $1.5 billion. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of approximately $1.1 billion after distributions of $618 million and growth capital of approximately $390 million. On April 26, we were pleased to announce a quarterly cash distribution of $0.20 per common unit or $0.80 on an annualized basis, which represents a more than 30% increase over the first quarter of 2021. As a reminder, future increases to the distribution level will be evaluated quarterly with the ultimate goal of returning distributions to the previous level of $30.5 per quarter or $1.22 on an annual basis, while balancing our leverage target, growth opportunities and unit buybacks. Operationally, we have a brand franchise with assets in all the major producing basins in the U.S. and saw throughput increase our segments as rig counts continue to improve across the U.S. In addition, we completed construction of several growth projects, which I'll provide more details on shortly. In March of 2022, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our 51% interest in Energy Transfer Canada for cash proceeds of approximately $270 million. In addition, the sale is expected to reduce our consolidated debt by approximately $450 million. This sale allows us to divest of these noncore assets at an attractive valuation and utilize the cash proceeds to further deleverage our balance sheet and redeploy capital with our U.S. footprint. The transaction is on track and expected to close by the third quarter of 2022. Also in March of this year, we completed a $325 million bolt-on acquisition of underground storage assets and an ethylene storage header that further enhanced our Mont Belvieu and Nederland positions. This acquisition of the Spindletop asset provides us with an exceptional ethylene storage and transportation header system located strategically between our Mont Belvieu and our Nederland terminals. The header system is connected to multiple ethylene pipeline customers. In addition, it has 2 active storage caverns, 1 cavern under development and the potential to develop at least 4 or 5 more storage caverns. We believe this system will play a major role in connecting ethylene supply in markets along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast as we are seeing significant and unprecedented interest for many of the petchem players in utilizing not only the storage facilities, but also the ethylene header system. Now for a brief update on the integration of the Enable assets. We continue to expect the combined company to generate more than $100 million of annual run rate cost savings synergies, of which we expect to achieve $75 million in 2022. The majority of our back-office integration is complete, including integration of bank accounts, general ledger and treasury systems. We continue to identify and evaluate a number of commercial and operational synergies that are expected to enhance the operational capabilities of our systems by capitalizing on improved efficiencies and increasing utilization and profitability of our combined assets. This includes opportunities to run plants more efficiently, potentially converting pipelines to different products as well as optimizing our combined assets to provide customers on our enabled systems with access to premium markets further downstream through our vast energy transfer pipeline network. I'll now walk you through recent developments on our growth projects. In March, we announced that we have entered into 2 20-year LNG sale and purchase agreements for our Lake Charles LNG project with ENN Natural Gas and ENN Energy Holdings Limited. Under the 2 SPAs, ET LNG is expected to supply 1.8 million tonnes per annum of LNG to ENN Natural Gas and 0.9 million tonnes per annum of LNG to ENN Energy. On Monday of this week, we also announced the signing of a 20-year LNG purchase and sell agreement with a subsidiary of Gunvor Group for 2 million tonnes of LNG per annum. And yesterday, we announced the signing of another long-term LNG offtake agreement with SK Gas, an affiliate of the Korean conglomerate SK, for 0.4 metric tonnes per annum for a term of 18 years. The purchase price for all these agreements is indexed to the Henry Hub benchmark plus a fixed liquefaction charge and the LNG will be delivered on a free on board basis. The SPAs will become fully effective upon the satisfaction of the conditions precedent by ET LNG, including reaching FID. We are also in active negotiations with a number of other high qualified customers, and we expect to make an announcement of additional offtake agreements in the weeks ahead. As we have previously stated, we expect to finance a significant portion of the capital cost of this project by means of the sale of equity in the project to infrastructure funds and possibly to 1 or more industry participants in conjunction with the LNG offtake agreements. We are currently targeting FID for this project in the fourth quarter of this year. Recent events in Europe highlighted the importance of LNG from the United States, a country with abundant natural gas supply and strong geopolitical ties to Europe. We are hopeful that our Lake Charles LNG project will be a significant factor in the long-term solution for global energy needs. Looking at Mariner East pipeline system. During the first quarter of this year, we completed construction of the final phase of the Mariner East pipeline, which brought our total NGL capacity on the Mariner East pipeline system to more than 365,000 barrels per day, including ethane. For the first quarter of 2022, NGL volumes in the Mariner East pipeline system and Marcus Hook Terminal remains steady. Since the end of the first quarter, we have seen an uptick in volumes through the pipelines and expect to see incremental revenue and volume growth for the remainder of the year. And our Pennsylvania access project, which allows refined products to flow from the Midwest supply regions into Pennsylvania, New York and other markets in the Northeast, started flowing refined products in January of this year. At our expanded Nederland Terminal, NGL volumes remained strong during the first quarter, including export volumes under our Orbit ethane export joint venture. For the first quarter, we loaded approximately 8 million barrels of ethane out of the facility. And for full year 2022, we continue to expect to load more than 40 million barrels of ethane with that increasing to up to 60 million barrels for 2023. We also expect our LPG export volumes at Nederland to continue to grow in 2022. In total, we continue to export more NGLs than any other company or country and our percentage of worldwide NGL export remain at nearly 20% of the world market. We are seeing long-term increases in NGL demand and market value both here in the U.S. as well as internationally. We expect to participate in this growth as well as increase our market share as our franchise is uniquely well situated to benefit from this expanding market. We are seeing strong from overseas customers seeking additional supply from the United States, and we have recently secured sufficient commitments to move forward on the ethane expansion. Even though we expect to expand our ethane export capabilities at both Marcus Hook and Nederland Terminal terminals, these commitments provide us with the opportunity of expanding at either terminal. Therefore, we are evaluating which location would be best suited for our next ethane expansion project. We continue to evaluate the opportunity to develop a petchem project along the Gulf Coast. If we are able to reach FID, we believe that our cracker will be a very unique world-class facility, providing unparalleled access to the lowest cost feedstock through our pipeline systems, as well as unparalleled access to downstream domestic and international ethylene and propylene markets through our pipelines, our storage facilities and our export terminal. We're in discussions with a number of high-quality customers as we work to secure long-term tolling type commitments prior to reaching FID. And we also intend to have a significant partnership with one or more industry participants. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate potential M&A opportunities in the pet chem space. Turning to Cushing South Pipeline. In June 2021, we commenced service on the 65,000 barrel per day crude oil pipeline providing transportation service from our Cushing Terminal to our Nederland Terminal, which also provides access for Powder River and EJ Basin barrels to our Nederland Terminal via an upstream connection with our White Cliffs pipeline. In the first quarter of 2022, we completed Phase 2, which nearly doubled the pipeline's capacity to 120,000 barrels per day. The majority of the capacity is under take-or-pay contracts and the pipeline is already utilized in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 capacity to move volumes south to our Gulf Coast terminals, providing significant revenue potential as the arbs improve. Next, in April, we placed into service the Ted Collins Link, which provides market connectivity for our Houston terminal. The Ted Collins Link gives us the ability to fully load and export WTI barrels as well as low-gravity Bakken barrels out of the Houston market, demonstrating Energy Transfer's unique ability to provide a neat Bakken barrel to markets along the Gulf Coast. In April, we completed our inaugural shipment of oil from our Houston terminal for export utilizing this system and expect our export volumes to grow throughout the year. Our Permian Bridge project, connecting our gathering and processing assets in the Delaware and the Midland Basin, were placed into service in October of 2021. In addition, in the first quarter of 2022, we completed an expansion of Permian Bridge, which brought the pipeline's total capacity to over 200,000 Mcf per day. This project allows us to move rich gas out of the Midland Basin to utilize available Delaware processing capacity more efficiently, while also providing access to additional takeaway options. It is being utilized to provide operational flexibility between our processing facilities in the 2 basins. Current Permian Basin plant inlet processing volumes are over 2.2 Bcf per day and we're evaluating our options to meet increasing production from the basin. Construction of our new 200 million cubic foot per day GrayWolf processing plant in the Delaware Basin has commenced. The GrayWolf plant is supported by new commitments and growth from existing customer contracts and is expected to be in service by the end of this year. In addition to providing incremental revenue to our Midstream segment, once in service, the volumes from the tailgate of the plant will utilize our gas and NGL pipelines for takeaway, providing additional revenue streams for our intrastate and NGL segments. And due to significant producer demand, we anticipate moving forward with a second processing plant in the Permian Basin for which we are currently determining the best location. The plan has already included in our 2022 growth capital forecast. We continue to be very excited about our pipeline project from the Permian Basin to address the growing needs for additional natural gas takeaway. This project has significant advantages over competing projects. It would include the construction of a new intrastate pipeline from the Midland Basin to our extensive pipeline network south of the DFW area, paralleling existing right of way. From there, our vast pipeline systems provide significant flexibility to deliver natural gas to premier markets along the Texas Gulf Coast, including Katy, Beaumont and the Houston Ship Channel as well as to Carthage with potential deliveries to most major U.S. trading hubs and markets. Given the strong interest we are seeing for this project and ongoing producer discussions, we hope to announce additional information soon. In the meantime, we are working on time-sensitive surveys and the regulatory process has already begun. This project is an ideal solution for natural gas growth out of the Permian Basin and is clearly the best choice for customers in regard to timing, cost, flexibility and the access to multiple premium and liquid markets. Given the proposed route and our ability to utilize existing assets, we believe we could complete construction of the project in the 2 years or less once we have reached FID. In the meantime, modernization and demoded acting work on our Oasis pipeline continues, which will add an incremental 60,000 Mcf per day of much needed capacity out of the Permian Basin. This capacity is expected to be available by the end of 2022. Next, construction on the Gulf Run Pipeline, which is a 42-inch interstate natural gas pipeline with 1.65 Bcf of capacity is underway. Gulf Run is backed by a 20-year commitment for 1.1 Bcf per day from Golden Pass LNG and will provide natural gas transportation between the Haynesville Shale and the Gulf Coast, connecting some of the most prolific natural gas producing regions in the United States with the LNG export market. Pipeline construction is underway and is expected to be completed by the end of 2022. As demand continues to grow out of the Haynesville, we expect to move forward with an expansion project in the not-too-distant future. Turning to our Trans-Panama Gateway pipeline. We are working closely with the appropriate entities within Panama to successfully bring this project to fruition. Panama's geographic location and favorable investment climate make this an attractive project. We remain optimistic about the Trans-Panama Gateway pipeline and the significant value it will bring to markets around the world. Now for an update on our alternative energy activities. We continue to pursue a number of projects related to carbon capture, including sequestration, enhanced oil recovery and utilization projects. We are in active discussions with several developers who have applied for Class 6 sequestration permits with the EPA in Louisiana in close proximity to our facilities that would be good candidates for carbon capture and sequestration. Unfortunately, the approval process for these sequestration permits generally takes 2 to 3 years to obtain. However, in addition to our desire to lower our carbon footprint, we remain focused on our primary business, which is providing the essential energy infrastructure necessary to grow domestic energy production which is vital to ensuring our country's energy security and the growing needs worldwide, providing additional supplies of clean, affordable and reliable natural gas and vital natural gas liquids is the most logical and quickest way to reduce emissions, while also significantly improving the quality of life for billions of people in developing nations around the world. With the significant growth in our natural gas transportation and natural gas liquids segments, along with our extensive export capabilities through our NGL terminals and with line of sight to reach FID for our Lake Charles LNG project, we expect to continue to play an important role in reducing emissions while improving living conditions throughout the world. Now let's take a closer look at our first quarter results. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $3.3 billion compared to $5 billion for the first quarter of 2021. Results for the first quarter of 2021 included a contribution of approximately $2.4 billion from Winter Storm Uri. Excluding this contribution, first quarter 2022 adjusted EBITDA and would have been up approximately 25% over the first quarter of 2021. DCF attributable to the partners as adjusted was $2.1 billion for the first quarter of 2022 compared to $3.9 billion for the first quarter of 2021, again, as a result of the impact to the prior period from Winter Storm Uri. For the first quarter, we saw higher transportation volumes across all of our segments as well as a full quarter contribution from the available assets that were acquired in December 2021. On April 26, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.20 per common unit or $0.80 on an annualized basis. This distribution will be paid on May 19 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on May 9. This distribution represents a 30% increase over the first quarter of 2021 and represents another step in our plan to return additional value to unitholders, while maintaining our leverage ratio target of 4 times to 4.5 times debt-to-EBITDA. Now turning to results by segment, starting with NGL and refined products, adjusted EBITDA was $700 million compared to $647 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to higher fractionation and refinery services margins, higher terminal services margins related to increased throughput at our Nederland Terminal in the first quarter of 2022, as well as an increase in our Northeast blending and optimization activities. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines increased to 1.8 million barrels per day compared to 1.5 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to increased export volumes feeding into our Nederland Terminal and higher volumes from the Permian and Eagle Ford regions. And our average fractionated volumes were 804,000 barrels per day compared to 726,000 barrels per day for the first quarter of 2021. We recently tied our 1-day maximum throughput record through the fracs at over 960,000 barrels. And for the month of April, we reached an all-time monthly throughput record averaging well over 900,000 barrels per day. For our crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $593 million compared to $510 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to higher food transportation volumes on our Texas crude pipelines, improved performance on our Bakken and Bayou Bridge pipelines, increased throughput at our Gulf Coast terminals as well as the addition of the Enable assets in December of 2021. Crude oil transportation volumes increased 4.2 million barrels per day compared to 3.5 million barrels per day for the same period last year, driven by higher crude oil prices, higher refinery demand and Winter Storm Uri impacting crude oil production in the prior period. For our midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $807 million compared to $288 million for the first quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to the acquisition of the Enable assets in December of 2021 and an increase related to favorable NGL and natural gas prices as well as increased production in the Permian and South Texas regions. In addition, the first quarter of 2021 included a negative impact related to Winter Storm Uri that did not occur in the first quarter of 2022. Gathered gas volumes were 17.3 million MMBtus per day compared to 12 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year due to the addition of the Enable assets, increased production in South Texas as well as additional gathering capacity from the Permian Bridge pipeline in West Texas. Permian Basin volumes continue to be strong and Midland inlet volumes remain at or near record highs. We are utilizing the Permian Bridge daily to optimize our available processing capacity as well as increasing our processing capacity in the area to accommodate incremental demand we are seeing. In our interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $453 million compared to $453 million for the first quarter of 2021. During the quarter, we benefited from the addition of the Enable assets as well as the volume growth on our Transwestern Rover and Trunkline systems as a result of increased rates and higher utilization due to more favorable market conditions and volume growth in the Haynesville Shale. While volumes have continued to improve, this growth was partially offset by a decrease due to gains recorded in the first quarter of 2021 related to Winter Storm Uri operational gas sales. In addition, adjusted EBITDA was impacted by contract expirations and a shipper bankruptcy on our Tiger pipeline. More recently, we have seen steady growth in the interstate segment with Transwestern continuing to benefit from high prices and demand for gas delivery out west, and Trunkline and Tiger both seeing strong demand related to increased activity on the Gulf Coast and in the Haynesville Shale. In fact, we are currently seeing record volumes from Tiger. And for our interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $444 million compared to $2.8 million for the first quarter of last year. The change was primarily due to the absence of higher earnings from Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter of 2021, which was partially offset by the addition of the Enable assets in December of 2021. Since the end of the first quarter, we have seen heavy utilization on our HBL system due to increased demand for gas takeaway out of the Permian as well as strong volumes in South Texas. In addition, due to increased activity in the Haynesville Shale, our Rick pipeline system is currently flowing at or near capacity. We expect this demand to continue through the rest of 2022. Now turning to our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance, given our strong performance in the first quarter as well as continued increasing demand for our products as we move through the rest of the year, we now expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between $12.2 billion to $12.6 billion. This is up compared to our previous guidance of $11.8 billion to $12.2 billion. And moving to our growth capital update for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022, Energy Transfer spent approximately $390 million on organic growth projects, primarily in the midstream, interstate and NGL and refined products segment, excluding Sun and USA compression CapEx. For full year 2022, we now expect growth capital expenditures, including expenditures related to the recently acquired Enable assets to be between $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion compared to our previous forecast of $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion. Our revised growth capital reflects the addition of spend associated with our new Permian gas takeaway pipeline. Now looking briefly at our liquidity position as of March 31, 2022. Total available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities was approximately $2 billion, and our leverage ratio was 3.55x for the credit facility. We continue to have strong support from our banking partners, and in April 2022, we amended our $5 billion revolving credit facility to extend the maturity to April 2027, with substantially the same terms and pricing. We continue to expect to generate a significant amount of cash flows in 2022, which will be strategically allocated in a manner that best positions us to continue to improve our leverage, invest in high-returning growth projects and return value to our unitholders. And we expect to continue to pay down debt throughout the year with excess cash flow from operations. During the first quarter, we saw strong performance from all of our segments with significant volume growth supported by improved production and increased demand that we expect to continue throughout 2022. We have already seen further improvements in production, market conditions and domestic and international demand for our products since the end of the first quarter, and we remain bullish about the future of our industry and the need for natural gas and natural gas liquids. As we look for additional ways to address existing and new demand for our products, we will continue to evaluate and pursue strategic growth projects that enhance our existing asset base and generate attractive returns like our Permian gas pipeline project. And we will also look to make progress on the alternative energy front, which can further enhance and effectively grow our energy franchise. Operator, please open the line up for our first question. This is Tom Long, Jeremy, I'll take off with that. Clearly, the first quarter, we're very, very excited about. We've got great results out of the optimization team. When you look at our assets, even as we went through, I think you'll note the intrastate segment. But as you look out through the rest of the year, we've been pretty conservative on pricing, which was another, obviously, a big component of it is we took the guidance up. And we've -- we were very intentional on staying conservative on that. So we'll see how the rest of the year really plays out. But I would say that the first quarter, you can see the amount we're up, and that's really basically the amount that we took the guidance up overall as the run rate. If you were really looking at that first quarter from a result standpoint, probably in the range of maybe $225 million to $250 million, you could put into the they call it the onetime type bucket, but not nonrecurring type. But at the same time, we do have a fantastic team and a great asset base. So optimization is something that will always play a big role in our results. Yes, Brian, that's a great question. As we speak, we're moving more volumes out of the Permian and more volumes out of the Eagle Ford than we've ever moved NGL volumes. So we are going to have to make that decision sooner than later. We're at our full max capacity right now running around 960. However, we don't want to move forward until we have secured long-term commitments for that net frac. We do anticipate that happening possibly in the next quarter-or-so, maybe sooner. But we're going to -- as we've done, we're going to be prudent around our capital and we'll spend that capital when needed, but we do anticipate making that decision in the not-too-distant future. It'd be mostly in '23. This is Tom Long. You've clearly touched upon the fact that we've got a lot of great projects here, no doubt. We haven't got any of them to FID. So the $500 million to $700 million that we put out, we're probably not prepared to put out 2023 at this stage. I will tell you as we go through the year and as these projects get approved, we probably will go ahead and update that. But at this time, this is -- we really don't have another further update other than these projects as we move forward to getting them to FID. Yes, Mike, we're still pretty early in this process. We couldn't be, like a lot of this, more excited about the relationships that we built down there and the operating for that. It's premature to begin talking about capital or even the exact routes for a number of reasons. We're going through a process that's required in that country. But we're very excited. We think, at the end of the day, this could be a very significant international hub for the world, not just for the Caribbean or the Western Coast of North and South America, but also, of course, for Asia. So it's a little bit preliminary to get any major details, but we remain very excited about that. Yes. Keith, it's -- you probably touched upon one of the most commonly asked questions here right now. It's -- we really don't want to get out in front of the board. I know that we've been saying that we'll evaluate this quarter by quarter. Clearly, a great start to the year with the first quarter results and what we've seen. So let us kind of get through each quarter and have the discussion with our Board on this as we move forward. There's other things that are factored in here when we talk about our capital allocation, and that's a lot of these great projects that we're talking about here today. And likewise, just to continue to look at the leverage metrics. But I do want to reiterate what you said. We have made great progress toward moving toward our target of that 4 to 4.5. As you know, each agency calculates that a little bit differently. So I encourage you to reach out to each of them to see kind of where they're at. But we're getting closer to the 4.5, so let all those -- let us look at all those factors quarter-by-quarter as we move through the year, and that will go into that decision each quarter. And this is Tom Long, I'll chime in a little bit more. I'll just add a little bit more to that. It's a little bit early to try to put a number on that. We haven't really -- other than having some inbounds, we really haven't started a lot of discussion on the equity until we move through the contracting phase. So it's one of those that over the next couple of quarters as we continue to -- Tom and his team continue to make great progress on the contracting that we will be able to put our thumb a little bit more on that number. Yes, correct. We have quantified it for the year of 20 -- about this year of 20 -- of $75 million is what we've put out there. As far as the first quarter, don't really have a specific number at this point for that number broke out. But I think overall, we still expect to hit that 75 this year. But I will say that we feel very good about the $100 million run rate annually as we look out. I think it's also just worth noting overall that all the results, we have moved very quickly on getting all these integrated, but I will tell you that all the results that have has come in even through the first quarters we've integrated have been above and beyond any of the projections that we had run in the merger as we were going through putting those numbers into the S1. So we're very, very excited about this transaction, and it's turning out to be a very, very good project for us. So acquisition. Yes. Let me do this just quickly go. So we talked about the Permian Basin, we're building a plant there. We're going to build another plant. We'll continue to evaluate that. In Haynesville, we'll continue to evaluate new pipelines out of that area. Eagle Ford, we're sitting pretty good, at least for the next year or 2, we've kind of built out, but we will be looking toward the end of this year of whether or not we need to expand that or not. So really stepping up in the Mid-Con in Oklahoma. We are -- we have seen the rigs move back in. We're getting our arms around the enabled assets. Our team is very excited about what's going on there. Our commercial team is working very hard on synergizing those plants and how to be more efficient and profitably operate those. Of course, ultimately, we will be bringing those NGLs into our system. But right now, we don't contemplate adding any additional cryogenic plants up in the Mid-Continent or in Oklahoma, we certainly watch that closely and make sure we stay ahead of that once they're needed. This is Tom Long. I'll take off and then Mackie may add a little bit more. But we have been evaluating various acquisition opportunities. We still feel like that's a good way to enter it. But at the same time, we've got a very good team and we're quite comfortable with starting with a greenfield type project. So we're going to continue to look at those. And yes, it would -- it could be a partial joint venture, if you will. We're quite open to that in order to be able to step into the skill set that it takes to move into this or it could be a total acquisition. So we're looking at basically all the above as we evaluate this, including a greenfield build. All right. Well, thank all of you for joining us today, and we look forward to any follow-up questions you might have."

            "name": "Thomas Mason",
            "content": "Yes. This is Tom Mason, I'm in charge of our LNG project, and we're really excited about where we are today. We've got really strong demand from really high-quality customers. We're really confident about reaching FID. Of course, the marketing and the offtake agreements is key to getting a deal done. The other things that you mentioned are underway that the update on the EPC bid process, bid refresh is underway. We filed an application for an extension of our construction deadline with the FERC. We understand that's in process, and we're confident that we'll receive approval of that in the near future. So I think things are going well, and we're really excited about it. Yes. Yes. And we're -- world's kind of gone upside down with what's going on in Ukraine and it's kind of accelerated the demand. But yes, the contracts are the gating item that we're really making good progress. Well, it's an interesting question because the utilities are kind of struggling with trying to satisfy their immediate and near-term demand for gas, as you could imagine. But for long-term contracts, they're still interested. I think there's been kind of some issues with financial matters based on the high price of demand for natural gas currently. And so there could end up being some government guarantees for some of the longer-term offtake contracts, so we're certainly in contact with them. But you're right, there's kind of been a lack of real commitments for long-term contracts at this point. Yes. This is Tom Mason. We -- as we previously announced, we plan to do some portion of equity sell down to primarily infrastructure funds. There's lots of money that are looking for high-quality, long-term cash flow from a project like this. So we think that's going to be a really good way of financing it. We expect that we keep at least 25% of the project, haven't made final decisions on that yet, but it's going to be -- there's just a lot of interest in the equity side of this project. Yes, this is Tom Mason. Yes, it would be -- obviously, we would expect to have some promoted interest from the -- on the equity side. So our capital requirements would be relatively small and of course, spaced over a 4-year period-or-so. So the returns can be quite good based on -- with little capital being deployed. They're basically a liquefaction charge, but there is a component like most of the contracts on the Gulf Coast that are tied to Henry Hub plus a percentage above that. So there's -- the higher natural gas prices are there is room for additional cash flows from that."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Marshall McCrea",
            "content": "This is Mackie. Let me add just one thing, if I could, Jean, sorry about that. I was listening to Tom Long and listened to Tom Mason and they're pretty even keeled laid back. And I don't think they're excited but they don't really show how excited we are in this LNG project has really taken off. It's sad it took a travesty like what's going on in Ukraine to wake up the world. It certainly has woken up Europe and Asia and China. Hopefully, they'll wake up some of our administrators, but Tom has done a fantastic job, and we've got an enormous amount of interest, as you can imagine, and we are shocked if we don't get to FID by the end of this year and look forward not only to get that project down the road and signed, but also look forward to all the upstream pipeline transportation business will come with that project. Yes. This is Mackie again, Jeremy. There are -- we've got a lot of moving parts, as you can imagine, to our partnership, where as you know, we're building GreyWolf, we have decided we are going to build another plant and try and figure out exactly where that's going to go. We have a lot of gathering opportunities. Most of our large projects, multibillion-dollar projects are built out, and that's really to earlier question, as we go into this year into future years, we're able to bring a lot of volume and a lot of revenue in those assets that we've already completed. But for the most part, it is -- we do have or in there, we do have GrayWolf and the portion of [Indiscernible] and do have GreyWolf and then this other plant that we've talked about expanding here in the near future. Yes. This is Mackie, Praneet. Absolutely, we'll be looking to expand Trunkline, we'll be looking to expand Gulf Run as we talked about on this call, and we'll continue to pursue the project in West Texas, that will also -- we anticipate feed into this. So the beauty about our pipeline network, both intra and interstate, unlike most of our competitors, we can aggregate the large volumes from multiple basins and bring it to points like this to Henry Hub into Lake Charles. So we mentioned on -- when Tom started out and his reading is that we will be probably going out for an open season on golf run here sometime the latter part of May. We think there will be a significant amount of interest. But at the end of the day, we will be anticipate transporting up to 2.5 to 2.7 Bcf a day into Lake Charles into additional markets in that area through our pipeline network. Well, as was mentioned earlier, we are almost at full capacity. A lot of that is month-to-month. However, we have even recently contracted up. I'll give you an example, we contracted up a producer that will ramp up to 550,000 a day that will utilize both Tiger capacity, Gulf Run capacity and capacity through our intrastate pipeline network in Carthage. So we just cater to whatever the producer looks for as far as what they're trying to get to on the Gulf Coast. And we -- our issue right now is we got to go find more capacity. Haynesville is growing faster or as fast as any other basin, and we will play an integral part like we already are in finding a way out of that area in Gulf Run, there's 1 major outlet along with our other intrastate pipelines and frontline. This is Mackie. Sure. Tom may follow up on this, but we have a lot of projects in the capital to pursue those projects. We've got to be prudent about that. So there are certainly thresholds, and we certainly will make sure that we meet those thresholds. A lot of the revenue that we anticipate receiving from the LNG project is really from the pipeline infrastructure from bringing -- transporting natural gas to this facility. So at the end of the day, we'd have no problem on it as low as 25%. We'll operate it. We will bring all the volume in there, and we will be more than happy with that level. As far as what level to get to FID, as we've mentioned, we probably have twice the interest that we have capacity for right now in our 15 million tonnes, so we are highly optimistic that we will fully contract this out, but we'll certainly make that type of business decision as we get closer, especially as we get closer to the end of the year and get all these contracts lined up to when we'll move forward. But we'll make the right business at that time. But as we say, we're highly optimistic that we'll have this fully contracted by the end of the year. Mike, this is Mackie. Gosh, we are so happy to be at the end of the road on Mariner after all these years. We've built an incredible north there of 3 different pipelines that can move a variety of products. We have enormous capability by just adding pumps to significantly increase the throughput on that. It's really where additional costs will come in for any storage or chilling type assets that we'll have to build at Marcus Hook. As we alluded to earlier on this call, we have sufficient volumes for another ethane expansion at Marcus Hook. We're not sure if that's best suited or if it's better to expand at Nederland next, we'll be making that decision over the coming weeks, but we certainly expect over the next year or 2 to be expanding Marcus Hook in a big way. As I said, we built quite a franchise with a lot of money, a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of stress. We're past all that. We've got an enormous amount of customers around the globe. We're talking to as many as 600,000 barrels a day of NGL markets out there. So there's plenty of markets out there. And so our job from a commercial standpoint is to go secure more commitments, which we have done, and we'll be moving forward on expanding Marcus Hook and Nederland over the next several years. Yes, this is Mackie. There's a number of things, and we've said it before. It happened during Uri. We have such an extensive pipeline system throughout Texas. We have an incredible amount of storage strategically placed well in the Houston area and also in the DFW area. We're connected to the vast majority of the power plants either directly or indirectly, will connect to every major LDC in Texas. And so any time there's any kind of volatility or price movements, we're really able to capture that as well as spreads from day to day. There were times in that quarter where the spreads were higher from a going from East Texas to West Texas, there was a period of days where the basis spread was, gosh, I think $1 higher for at least a day-or-so higher in Waha and Katy. So it's just our optimization team optimizing our assets and our pipelines and our storage at every opportunity that we have. And with the assets we have, those opportunities arise quite often in a really cold weather times, high demand and also high heat days. Gabe, this is Mackie. No, absolutely not a stand-alone. It would be like we do all of our business. We look for synergistic benefits and revenues, both upstream and downstream. So the project that we're targeting and gaining a little momentum with a lot of very high-quality customers would give us access to what we believe will be very inexpensive or less expensive gasoline components a year from now when maybe gasoline demand will start kind of leveling out some. At some point, we do believe that some of the feedstock for this particular cracker that we're designing would be very advantageous to feed this. In addition to that, along with our Spindletop asset that we just bought and our plans to kind of connect the dots between Louisiana and Houston with an ethylene system and a propylene system. This petchem also have access downstream to not only our pipeline network and our storage network, but also have access to our export business for international deliveries. So no, we're looking -- yes, we're looking for a project very similar to LNG, where we'd probably be a minority interest with some promoted partners in that and would have it fully contracted with significant both upstream and downstream revenue as part of that branch. Yes. I think the only thing I'd add to that is with Kelsey's desire to get into pet chem, we're going to look at everything that comes available, take any opportunity. And if once something looks attractive, we'll go after it. Yes. And this is Mackie, I'll add 1 thing to that. We intend to contract out about 15 million tonnes. But as you know, that's nameplate, and there's fairly significant volume above that, that we'll be able to take advantage of as time goes on when we see a blowout in prices between the U.S. and Europe and Asia. This is Mackie, and before Tom does that, let me just say one thing. We've done this from time to time, but I kind of joked a little bit earlier how excited we are, and we are. We're excited about the assets that we have. We're excited about the employees that we have. And if you just kind of walk through real quickly, just in this quarter, our interest rate volumes were up 17%. Our interstate volumes were up 15%, our midstream volumes were up 14%. Our NGL's record volumes, as I alluded to earlier, were up 17%. We try to make a decision around our next frac in the next probably 6 months, really proud about our crude. We've grown over 20% from quarter-to-quarter in a very tough crude environment where there's not as many barrels available out there in the Permian and our team has done an excellent job there. And we've also really gained a lot of traction through our terminals and increased that by 17%. So as I mentioned earlier, what's happening with Ukraine, we hope will wake up our country and wake up our leaders to how important natural gas is and natural gas liquids are not only because of affordability, reliable and all that, but for security, not only for the U.S. but also for the world. So hopefully, we wake up because we need our leaders to."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. And welcome to the Energy Transfer Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would like to turn the call over to Tom Long. Please go ahead.\nTom Long: Thank you, Operator, and good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to the Energy Transfer's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q for the full year ended December 31, 2023, which we expect to file this Friday, February 16. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures on our website. Let's start today by going over our financial results. For the full year 2023, we generated adjusted EBITDA $13.7 billion, which is up 5% over 2022 and is a partnership record. DCF, attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted $7.6 billion, which resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $3.6 billion. Operationally, we moved record volumes across all of our segments for the year ended 2023, which included record volumes on our legacy assets before including contributions from assets acquired in 2023. In addition, we exported a record amount of total NGLs out of our Nederland and Marcus Hook of terminals in 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2023, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.6 billion compared to $3.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. In our base business, we had strong performances across our operations, which included record volumes through our NGL pipelines and fractionators, as well as record volumes in our crude oil and midstream segments. DCF, attributable to the partners of ET, as adjusted, was $2 billion compared to $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $970 million. On January 25th, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.315 per common unit or $1.26 on an annualized basis. This distribution represents an increase of 3.3% from $0.305 paid in the fourth quarter of 2022. Last year, Energy Transfer\u2019s senior unsecured credit rating was upgraded by Standard & Poor's to BBB with a stable outlook. And last week, we were pleased to see that Fitch has also upgraded Energy Transfer's senior unsecured credit rating to BBB with a stable outlook. This continued third-party acknowledgment reiterates the emphasis we have placed on balancing growth while improving our balance sheet and reducing our leverage. And in 2023, we made meaningful progress toward reaching the low end of our leverage range. Based on our calculations of the rating agency's methodologies and pro forma for full year of acquisitions, our leverage ratios are now in the lower half of our 4 to 4.5 target range. As of December 31, 2023, the total available liquidity under our Revolving Credit Facilities was approximately $3.56 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we spent approximately $380 million on organic growth capital. And for full year 2023, we spent approximately $1.6 billion on organic growth capital, primarily in the midstream and NGL and refined product segments, excluding SUN and USA Compression CapEx. The reduction in capital relative to our most recent guidance is a result of deferring approximately $300 million from 2023 into 2024 due to project in-service timing needs. In January 2024, we issued $3 billion of aggregate principal amount of senior notes and $800 million of junior subordinated notes and used the proceeds to refinance existing indebtedness and for general partnership purposes. In addition, proceeds were used to redeem all of our outstanding Series C and Series D preferred units. We completed this redemption on February the 9th and we expect to redeem all of our outstanding Series E preferred units by May of 2024. Now turning to our results by segment for the fourth quarter, I'll start with NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was $1 billion compared to $928 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. This was primarily due to strong performances across for transportation, storage, terminal and fractionation operations as well as lower operating expenses. NGL transportation volumes increased 10% to 2.2 million barrels per day compared to 2 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes from the Permian region and on our NGL pipelines that deliver into our Nederland terminal as well as on the Mariner East pipeline system. Average fractionated volumes increased 16% to a partnership record 1.1 million barrels per day compared to 982, 000 barrels per day for the same period last year. Total NGL export volumes grew 13% over the fourth quarter of 2022 and 18% over full year of 2022. This was primarily driven by increased international demand for natural gas liquids. For 2023, we loaded more than 61 million barrels of ethane out of Nederland and nearly 27 million barrels of ethane out of Marcus Hook. For 2023, we continued to export more NGLs than any other company and maintained approximately 20% market share of worldwide NGL exports. For Midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $674 million compared to $632 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. We saw record throughput this quarter, which was primarily the result of the addition of the Crestwood assets, as well as higher volumes from existing customers in the Permian, South Texas, and Mid-Continent regions. The strong volume growth was partially offset by lower natural gas and NGL prices. Gathered gas volumes increased 5% to 20.3 million MMBTUs per day, compared to 19.4 million MMBTUs per day for the same period last year. For the crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $775 million, compared to $571 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. This was primarily due to higher volumes on several of our pipelines, higher terminal throughput, as well as the acquisitions of the Lotus and Crestwood assets in May and November of last year. Crude oil transportation volumes increased 39% to a record 5.9 million barrels per day, compared to 4.3 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This was a result of higher volumes on our Texas pipeline systems, and the Bakken and Bayou Bridge Pipeline, increased crude oil gathering volumes, as well as the acquisitions of Lotus and Crestwood. Without the additions of Lotus and Crestwood, adjusted EBITDA and crude oil transportation volumes would still have increased 16% and 8%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. In our interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $541 million, compared to $494 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily due to placing the Gulf Run Pipeline into service in December of 2022, as well as higher contracted volumes on several of our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines. Volumes increased 5% over the same period last year, due to the Gulf Run Pipeline being placed into service, as well as higher utilization on many of our interstate pipelines, including Transwestern, Rover, and Trunkline. We continue to fully utilize Zone 1 capacity on Gulf Run, and we are also maximizing deliveries into our Trunkline pipeline from Zone 2. Our team continues to work on the next phase of a potential capacity expansion to facilitate the transportation of natural gas from northern Louisiana to the Gulf Coast based upon customer demand. And for our intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $242 million compared to $433 million for the fourth quarter of last year. Benefits from new contracts on several of our Texas pipelines, as well as lower operating expenses, were more than offset by decreases from lower optimization opportunities. Now turning to our acquisition of Crestwood Equity Partners, which we completed in November of 2023, integration of the combined operations has been going very well. The combination of these complementary assets will allow us to continue to provide flexibility, reliable, and competitive services for our customers as we pursue additional commercial opportunities utilizing our improved connectivity and expanded footprint. We now expect to generate approximately $80 million of annual cost synergies by 2026, with $65 million in 2024. This is before any additional anticipated benefits from financial or commercial synergies. We are in the process of identifying and evaluating a number of commercial and operational synergies that are expected to enhance the operational capabilities of our systems by improving efficiencies and increasing the utilization and profitability of our combined assets. These synergies include optimizing our West Texas processing capacity given the newly acquired Crestwood plants, as well as utilizing spare NGO pipeline capacity out of the Delaware Basin and working with producers in West Texas and New Mexico to provide additional water gathering solutions. We're also looking at opportunities to move more barrels into our Bakken Pipeline system for transport to the Gulf Coast. And in the Northeast, we're evaluating options to transition LPG products previously transported by truck into our Mariner East pipeline system. Now turning to our growth projects and starting with our Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals, our NGL terminals continue to benefit from increased demand from both in the U.S. as well as from international customers. To address this demand, construction is underway on our expansion to the NGL export capacity at Nederland and we expect to be finished driving piles by the end of the month. This expansion is expected to give us the flexibility to load various products based upon customer demand. We continue to expect the project to be in service in mid-2025. In addition, we are building new refrigerated storage at Nederland, which will increase our butane storage capacity by 33% and will double our propane storage capacity. This will further increase our ability to keep customers' ships loaded on time. Also, we recently closed on the acquisition of two pipelines, one from Mont Belvieu at our Nederland Terminal and one from Mont Belvieu to the Ship Channel. We expect to have term transportation commitments on the Mont Belvieu to Nederland Pipeline in the near future, which will have the ability to flow at least 70, 000 barrels per day. This will provide much needed capacity for several products in high demand, both international and domestically. And we are in discussions to provide transportation for potentially multiple products on the pipeline that extends from Mont Belvieu to Houston. And at our Marcus Hook Terminal, we have commenced construction on the first phase of an optimization project that would add incremental ethane refrigeration and storage capacity. In addition, we have begun expanding our processing capacity at several of our existing 200 million cubic feet per day cryogenic processing plants. In total, we see opportunities to add approximately 100 to 150 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity in our west and south Texas regions at favorable capital cost when compared to building a new processing plant. In November, 2023, we announced a Heads of Agreement, or HOA, with TotalEnergies for crude offtake from our proposed Blue Marlin Offshore project. Additional customers remain very engaged and interested in our project, recognizing the value of fully loading VLCCs and the reduced execution risk that comes with repurposing existing underutilized assets. Next on an update for our Lake Charles LNG project, as most of you are aware, the Biden administration recently imposed a moratorium on the approval of LNG exports by the Department of Energy, while the DOE conducts studies to determine whether LNG exports are in the public interest. The Biden administration stated that these studies would focus on the cumulative impact of LNG exports on climate change, U.S. natural gas prices, and the impact of LNG facilities on local communities. The DOE most recently conducted similar studies in 2019 and based on the results of these studies, the DOE subsequently approved several LNG export projects. In light of the extremely low natural gas prices in the U.S. currently and the beneficial climate impacts from the use of natural gas compared to coal for power generation, it would be difficult to believe that these new studies won't continue to conclude that LNG exports are in the U.S. public interest. Lake Charles LNG applied for a new LNG export authorization in August of 2023 and requested approval by February of 2024. The recently announced moratorium on approvals of LNG export creates uncertainty as to when the DOE studies will be completed and whether the criteria for approving LNG export projects will be changed. Despite these uncertainties, Lake Charles LNG continues to pursue the development of the project and is extremely thankful for the continued support of its LNG customers. And now for an update on other projects. On the blue ammonia front, we are working with several companies to evaluate the feasibility of ammonia projects. That would include the opportunity to supply and transport natural gas to the ammonia facility and to transport CO2 to third-party sequestration sites. We're also looking at opportunities to provide other infrastructure services, including transport and sequestration, ammonia storage, and deep water marine loading on property near our Lake Charles and Nederland facilities. Additionally, we're working on carbon capture and sequestration projects to our processing plants and treating facilities in North Louisiana, South Texas, and West Texas. And we are evaluating other CO2 pipeline projects that would connect CO2 emitters to CO2 sequestration sites. Before moving to discuss our 2024 guidance, we wanted to quickly address another topic. Our practice is not to comment on pending litigation. However, given that we have received a number of questions about the Louisiana Pipeline matter, we would like to provide some important context. Recently, several third parties approached Energy Transfer about crossing various pipes we own and operate in Louisiana, including three of our common carrier pipelines, gathering systems and other lines. These three parties proposed between 140 and 160 crossings, as well as seeking to secure long segments of proposed parallel pipe within our existing rights of way and workspaces. As a consequence, we requested certain technical information from these parties regarding these crossings to allow us to evaluate their technical feasibility and potential issues between these new proposed pipes and our existing operations. The parties making these requests largely rejected or ignored our very reasonable request. Instead, on at least two occasions, they told us they would begin construction on these new pipes, whether we agreed to the crossings or not. At that point, we had no choice but to enforce our property rights by filing legal actions to prevent these crossings, pending our ability to evaluate the technical details of the crossing. In the process of enforcing our property rights, one of the requesting parties has alleged that Energy Transfer is using unfair or anti-competitive practices to block all pipeline crossings request in Louisiana in an effort to stifle competition and monopolize the pipeline capacity, moving gas from the Haynesville, and these practices are threatening the expansion of pipeline infrastructure in Louisiana. These statements are unfounded and false. In our opinion, these parties are skirting state and federal regulations and regulatory oversight by seeking to quickly build large diameter pipe, high pressure pipelines across state lines and calling them gathering. To this end, we encourage you to read the submission we filed in docket number 84356 in the 42nd Judicial District Court in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana, which set forth our positions on the facts and on the law. We do not want to litigate the matter on this earnings call. However, we want to underscore that Energy Transfer takes very seriously its obligations to operate its assets safely and reliably. Energy Transfer is simply seeking to protect its legal property rights under Louisiana law. Indeed, not a single court has found that ET somehow acted in bad faith in defending its lawful property rights. Nonetheless, any pipeline that is unable to agree to terms on pipeline crossing is free to exercise rights of condemnation or expropriation as applicable. To accomplish the crossings as it seeks to do so under state or federal law, Energy Transfer has never taken the position that others cannot cross us ever, just that they must satisfy us, that they will not adversely affect our existing lines, create additional costs for us, put us at risk under existing FERC certificate, and unjustifiably piggyback off of our efforts to build pipelines in compliance with state and federal rules, including in some cases significant environmental reviews. We appreciate that long distance transmission lines have become increasingly difficult to build, particularly given entrenched environmental opposition. No one knows that better than Energy Transfer. As we have been clear, Energy Transfer embraces markets and vigorous competition, but this also means respecting property rights and playing by the rules. And looking ahead at our 2024 organic growth capital guidance, we expect growth capital expenditures to be between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion for 2024, inclusive of the $300 million deferral from 2023, which will be spent primarily in the NGL and refined products and midstream segments. This capital is made up of expansions to our export facilities and storage tanks at Nederland optimization work at Marcus Hook and new pumping station to increase our NGL takeaway capacity from the Permian, new crude oil pipeline connections and new treating capacity in the Haynesville. In addition, this capital includes a large number of blocking and tackling projects, including processing plant capacity additions, compression and laterals to existing pipeline systems, additional gathering and compression build out, as well as improved efficiencies and emissions reductions work. We also continue to evaluate a number of other potential growth projects that we hope to bring to FID. However, as we look at our potential backlog of high-returning growth projects, we continue to expect our long-term annual growth capital run rate to be approximately $2 billion to $3 billion. Now turning to our 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance, giving the ability of our business to provide stable cash flows and operate through various market cycles, as well as our market outlook, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between $14.5 billion and $14.8 billion. In 2024, we expect utilization of assets within our core segments to remain strong and that recently acquired assets will provide growth and synergy opportunities. Worldwide demand for crude oil and natural gas, natural gas liquids and refined products continues to grow and we will continue to position ourselves to meet this demand by strategically targeting optimization and expansion projects that enhance our existing asset base, generate attractive returns and meet this growing demand for our product and services. As a result of our continued emphasis on strengthening our balance sheet, we're in the strongest financial position in Energy Transfer history and this will allow us the flexibility to balance pursuing new growth opportunities with further leverage reduction, maintaining our targeted distribution growth rate and increasing equity returns to our unit holders. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the lineup for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good afternoon. I just want to start off if I could, maybe some of the drivers that feed into the guidance here. We have seen a bit of volatility in commodity prices and the environment overall. Just wondering, I guess, latest expectation for producer activity in the Haynesville, what have you, how that factored in, or any other key drivers you call out for the upside versus the low side of the guidance?\nMackie McCrea : Hey Jeremy, this is Mackie here to start. Yes, with the lower gas prices in North Louisiana, certainly if they get any lower, we probably will see a slowdown, but right now we haven't seen it. Out in the Permian Basin, where we have a tremendous amount of assets, we see growth even in the lower gas price environment. With the higher oil prices, we continue to see growth and we are projecting modest, if not fairly significant growth out of the Permian Basin. Other areas, it varies, midcontinent, relatively flat, and other areas where our assets are pretty stable.\nTom Long: Jeremy, this is Tom, I think in addition, the pricing that you brought up in your question just then. We've used the forward curve in this. So this is the kind of latest forecast we have, we always stay kind of down the middle of the road with the range that we put out at the beginning of the year. So anything that we've seen, even here in the first quarter, et cetera, this would be our latest forecast, everything included. So feel good about it and look forward to another great year.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Okay. So, it sounds like kind of a conservative outlook on producer activity given where this trip is there. Maybe pivoting a little bit towards capital allocation, even with the capital program that you guys laid out as it is, it seems like there's going to be a significant amount of surplus cash flow. And now you've kind of hit stronger credit metrics, getting to BBB. Just wondering how you think about this surplus cash flow, what's the, I guess, priority ranking for the capital allocation at that point?\nMackie McCrea : Well, it's probably pretty consistent to where we've been. The main difference is that we have got to the lower side of our 4 to 4.5. And like we said before, it wouldn't even hurt to go a little bit lower if it gave us a little bit more dry powder to be able to continue to look at growth opportunities, et cetera. So if you kind of move through that, you go into the growth capital that we've talked about. We're obviously very disciplined on our projects and how we approve them and get them to FIDs. We're going to continue to focus on that likewise. And then we're going to look at the, of course, the distribution growth also that we put out there, 3% to 5%, which is the equity side of the equation. Based upon the CapEx spend and what we're seeing out there, remember we're always looking at this long term. We're not just looking at numbers that we're reporting for the quarter. But where we will continue to evaluate is of course unit buybacks, along with the distribution growth. So let's see how everything continues to play out. We couldn't agree with you more there a lot of free cash flow is when you do the math on the guidance, we've given out there. And with the other capital allocation topics that we've talked about here. So very good question. Thank you.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. So buybacks are not off the table at this point. Is this how to think about it?\nMackie McCrea : Oh, no, that's exactly right. Absolutely. They definitely are on the table.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein.\nJean Salisbury: Hi. Would it be possible to get a dash more detail on the projects in the CapEx budget for this year? I think I'm good on the NGL export projects. But could you talk a little more about the new NGL pumping capacity that you described the processing plants, like how many and where? Apologies, if I missed it during the prepared remarks.\nMackie McCrea : Hey, Jean, this is Mackie. I think I can cover that question. If you're looking at, if you're talking about our upgrade on some of our 200, 000 day cryos out in West Texas into the Delaware, we can very optimally and at a low cost compared to, adding a new processing plant at 20, 000 to 40, 000 UCF per cryo. So we are looking at that. We can move quicker on that. It's just adding compression in some cases, treating or dehas. We also have already done that in the Eagle Ford. We've already added about 50, 000 or 60 ,000 a day at very low cost. And then if you're on some of the other CapEx, if you're looking at our expansion at Nederland, we're looking at the ability, as Tom said, in his opening remarks of doubling our propane capacity and increasing our butane capacity by 33%. So even though the market's going to be really tight for the next 18 months, we have a tremendous amount of capability of increasing our export volumes starting about mid-2025. And not only are we excited about that, but the international market is very excited about that. And a lot of that that we've already, that we're in the process of expanding has already been sold out for three to five years once those projects come online. So we're doing the best we can to improve or have within our capital and meet the needs of our customers and obligations that we have.\nJean Salisbury: Great, thank you for that. And as a follow up, I believe that some of the original DAPL contracts roll this year. Can you discuss if you're blending and extending those or anything you can share? about that re-contracting process?\nMackie McCrea : You bet. This is Mackie again. As you can imagine, that's a very sensitive question from the standpoint of competition. But as far as when contracts fall off and kind of what our approach is, but I will answer it this way. We are very confident that we will keep our pipeline full and increase the volumes through time, certainly if the volumes grow in the Bakken. For the best outlet out of there, we can, at the best cost, we can feed all the refineries, or many of the refineries in the Midwest. We come down to the Gulf Coast, of course, and feed all the refineries in the Port Arthur area. And of course, through our Bayou Bridge Pipeline, we can, well volumes all the way to St. James. So there's no other pipeline that's even close, no other options than ours we feel really good about as contracts roll off, we'll do very well on re-contracting or selling on a spot basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Stanley with Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley: Hi, it's Keith. First question, you made some progress on repaying some of the preferred equity and you mentioned another series to take out in May. How are you viewing the preferred stock right now over the next few years and how do you kind of weigh using excess cash to repay that versus other uses?\nTom Long: Yes, listen, we're actually very excited at the fact that we're able to start bringing some of that back in as far as the perpetual prefers. I think you're going to see us to continue to look at those and as we look at even cash flow and where our cost of that is, it makes a lot of sense for us to continue to bring those back in. So I think that's how you'll see us kind of prioritize when you look at our deck, told you that, you'll see us working on those first going forward. It's probably worth mentioning that even with the Crestwood acquisition, as you know, we had some more come in with that. We're going to continue to be opportunistic on those. When they make sense, economic sense, we'll look at calling those, but we always are very diligent in looking at the math on those and as soon as they make economic sense, we will jump.\nKeith Stanley: Great, thanks. Second question, one of your peers recently said they think one to two new Permian gas take away projects move forward this year. I might have missed it, but I don't think you mentioned Warrior today. So my question is, do you agree with the view that one to two pipelines probably move forward and any updates on Warrior and how optimistic you are on moving that forward kind of with or without Lake Charles?\nMackie McCrea : Yes, this is Macky. I'll answer that. I guess an update on Warrior is we love to say where at FID we're sold out for 10 years, demand charge, and ready to go, but that's not where we're at. We have sold about 25% of our goal. We're in negotiations with about 1.6, 1.7 BCF of additional customers. All of them are looking for, or a lot of them are looking for different places to take the gas. There's no project that's even contemplated. It's anywhere close to Warrior where it provides access to almost every major city gate in the state of Texas. It goes to all the major hubs, Carthage, KD, et cetera. It also goes to a lot of the power plants either directly or indirectly were connected to the majority of power plants. So it's by far the best project that's out there with the pause from the DOE. There is a customer that was looking at that. That's going to pause a little bit. However, we continue to push forward. We're not saying that FID is imminent. We do think there will be another pipeline needed in the next two and a half years. And if that were to happen, we do believe it will be ours.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Reynolds with UBS.\nBrian Reynolds: Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe to follow up on some of the guidance on the EBITDA side relative to the S4 guide. I assume if you could just talk about maybe some of the differences between today's guidance and the S4. I assume a lot of it's related to some underlying growth CapEx assumptions that were in the S4, along with maybe some marketing that was included there. So it'd be great if you could just provide us an update on and maybe your expectations for marketing, which I believe you need to typically exclude from the guide. Thanks.\nTom Long: Yes, listen, I'll definitely start off here, and then if Mackie you want to add something more, you can. By far the largest driver on the difference between the S4 was the commodity prices. I think when you look at what we used back then when that was filed, we are substantially lower now with our commodity prices. So and then also deferring -- maybe deferring some of the capital, I think is another piece of that that you'll see in the difference between that S4 and now. So those are probably the two largest drivers.\nBrian Reynolds: Great, makes sense. And as a follow-up, just touching on M&A, Sonoco made a large acquisition over the past month. So kind of just curious from an ET value perspective, are there other opportunities to optimize ET system with additional access to different types of assets, whether it's crude or NGLs or refined products? Thanks.\nTom Long: Obviously, a great acquisition by Sonoco. It's a very, very good fit for them. And I will say there's not been discussion Sunoco. This was a Sunoco transaction and they are doing a great job of proceeding through getting all the approvals and even moving a little bit into the integrations. But I wouldn't say there's been any discussions on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jackie [inaudible] with Goldman Sachs.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hi. Good afternoon. First, I just want to start off on exports. It looks like for NGL exports continue to be strong, though slightly down a little bit quarter-over-quarter and how do you view exports going into \u201824? And do you see any upward pressure on margins as that dock capacity remains tight until you see those expansions online in mid-25?\nMackie McCrea : Yes. Jackie, this is Mackie. What a great business we have with our export at Nederland and at Marcus. We're very excited about what we've built and what we're building out. However, there's a lot of issues that are involved, especially with shipping. And so there's issues with Panama Canal or through the Red Sea, the timing of ship. Some months we may see direct basis and some months less. So every month, every quarter kind of have it\u2019s up and down. But overall, we see our steady where we've been and our slight growth pretty much completely fill up, our entire export capacity in the short term over the next 18 months, we believe we're going to see some very, very good margins for that business. For the spot business that we have available today, there's a significant overdemand in the international market than what the U.S. is capable of exporting, and we are positioned very well in the next 18 months to capture that upside. And then, as I mentioned earlier, we're very excited about bringing old projects that will bring in significant revenue for our export business.\nUnidentified Analyst : Got it. Great. Thanks. It makes sense. And then, just as a follow-up, we saw some partial contributions from the Crestwood acquisition this quarter. Wondering if you would be able to quantify what synergies you were able to capture for the remainder of \u201823, and if you see any additional opportunities at this point beyond that $80 million annual cost synergies disclosed and the potential timing of when you expect to see that downstream gain from the acquisition.\nTom Long: Yes. After you get a chance to start going through all the various costs in an organization, we always try to be fairly conservative. We're doing it with what information we have at the time, meaning public information. But after you get really further into these things and start looking at organizations, et cetera, I think you'll find that a lot of times you're always hopeful that you can't find more. So the $80 million run rate that we've talked about from a call standpoint is something that we feel very comfortable with and putting that number out there. And, of course, $65 million is what we put out for 2025. But when you start looking across its systems and all the other type of costs that are buried sometimes that, once again, you can't see when you're middle of these things are early in the process of them. It's always good to be able to find those, and I want to make sure we stop for a moment and give a huge complement to our team, who I know we've said before, is no one is better out there at integrating these companies than we are. We've had a lot of experience at it, and we move quickly, efficiently, and effectively as we go through it. But as mentioned in the prepared remarks up front, we've remained on multiple fronts, very excited about some of the commercial opportunities. I don't know, Mackie, you want to add anything more to that, what we said?\nMackie McCrea : Other than what you've did in the opening script, we're still digging in. Every acquisition that we do, we discover more and more under the rocks that we turn over to elaborate a little bit more on his opening remarks. We are seeing significant logistics and maybe even deferred on some cost, fully utilizing all of the assets when combined with the new Crestwood assets in the Delaware Basin. There are also some things we can do in the DJ Basin that we're looking at. Up in the Bakken, a lot of those barrels haven't found their way to our pipeline. We think now they will. So we think that will also bring more business to our total pipeline out of North Dakota and then the Northeast. We see some or starting to see some real commercial advantages to working together with that team and doing two things. One, helping that business grow distribution with propane and butane that Crestwood built and then on the other side where they can bring in volumes with their contracts and with their relationship into our Mariner franchise for deliveries to Marcus Hook. So as Tom said, we're just getting started but pretty excited about the things that we're already seeing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So I know you have a growth CapEx target of $2 billion to $3 billion but you also discussed quite a few potential projects in your prepared remarks today, some of which could be quite large. So I'm wondering if that\u2019s $3 billion is hard cap or would you consider going above that range, if the returns make sense?\nTom Long: Yes, listen, I'll start and then you go with Mackie. No, there's not a hard cap as we look at these. Once again, we'll evaluate projects that make economic sense and when we pull it all together, as recently gave the range of the 2.4 to 2.6 and keep in mind that that did include $300 million of rollover from 2023. That didn't make it into service at the time, so those got rolled into 2024. So make sure you bake that in there. But is there any more details on that with Michael, as far as your question here?\nMichael Blum: No, that covers it. I appreciate it. Maybe my second question, I just wanted to ask, obviously, you were very active in 2023 on the M&A front. So I wanted to just get your thoughts on what the landscape looks like in 2024 for you, and are you still kind of in digestion mode, or are you kind of ready to roll with the next deal present itself? Thanks.\nTom Long: Ready to roll. Michael, no, that is a good question. I think we've been saying for some time, we've been very consistent on our M&A discussions with everyone that we felt like it made a lot of sense in the midstream space, and you're seeing it. You're seeing it now. And we're going to continue to evaluate opportunities, but the other thing that's worth highlighting here is that we are staying very disciplined with these acquisitions to even doing someone with no premium, just doing at the market. And you can see the results. They're accretive. They're deleveraging. And it's the reason why we've ended up with the continued growth in our distributions at the same time that our balance sheet is strengthening, and it's showing in our ratings, et cetera. So it's one of those where it makes sense and where it's FID. And remember, as large as we are, there's a lot on the FID side. So we'll continue to evaluate and we'll continue to look at opportunities.\nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Long for any closing remarks.\nTom Long: Well, once again, I want to express a lot of appreciation to all of you for joining us today. We always thank you for a lot of really good questions, good dialogue, and as you can see, we've got a lot of really good things to talk about. And therefore, we look forward to continuing dialogue even after this call with anyone. So thank you, everyone. You all have a great day.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tom Long",
            "content": "Thank you, Operator, and good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to the Energy Transfer's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q for the full year ended December 31, 2023, which we expect to file this Friday, February 16. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures on our website. Let's start today by going over our financial results. For the full year 2023, we generated adjusted EBITDA $13.7 billion, which is up 5% over 2022 and is a partnership record. DCF, attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted $7.6 billion, which resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $3.6 billion. Operationally, we moved record volumes across all of our segments for the year ended 2023, which included record volumes on our legacy assets before including contributions from assets acquired in 2023. In addition, we exported a record amount of total NGLs out of our Nederland and Marcus Hook of terminals in 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2023, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.6 billion compared to $3.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. In our base business, we had strong performances across our operations, which included record volumes through our NGL pipelines and fractionators, as well as record volumes in our crude oil and midstream segments. DCF, attributable to the partners of ET, as adjusted, was $2 billion compared to $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $970 million. On January 25th, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.315 per common unit or $1.26 on an annualized basis. This distribution represents an increase of 3.3% from $0.305 paid in the fourth quarter of 2022. Last year, Energy Transfer's senior unsecured credit rating was upgraded by Standard & Poor's to BBB with a stable outlook. And last week, we were pleased to see that Fitch has also upgraded Energy Transfer's senior unsecured credit rating to BBB with a stable outlook. This continued third-party acknowledgment reiterates the emphasis we have placed on balancing growth while improving our balance sheet and reducing our leverage. And in 2023, we made meaningful progress toward reaching the low end of our leverage range. Based on our calculations of the rating agency's methodologies and pro forma for full year of acquisitions, our leverage ratios are now in the lower half of our 4 to 4.5 target range. As of December 31, 2023, the total available liquidity under our Revolving Credit Facilities was approximately $3.56 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we spent approximately $380 million on organic growth capital. And for full year 2023, we spent approximately $1.6 billion on organic growth capital, primarily in the midstream and NGL and refined product segments, excluding SUN and USA Compression CapEx. The reduction in capital relative to our most recent guidance is a result of deferring approximately $300 million from 2023 into 2024 due to project in-service timing needs. In January 2024, we issued $3 billion of aggregate principal amount of senior notes and $800 million of junior subordinated notes and used the proceeds to refinance existing indebtedness and for general partnership purposes. In addition, proceeds were used to redeem all of our outstanding Series C and Series D preferred units. We completed this redemption on February the 9th and we expect to redeem all of our outstanding Series E preferred units by May of 2024. Now turning to our results by segment for the fourth quarter, I'll start with NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was $1 billion compared to $928 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. This was primarily due to strong performances across for transportation, storage, terminal and fractionation operations as well as lower operating expenses. NGL transportation volumes increased 10% to 2.2 million barrels per day compared to 2 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes from the Permian region and on our NGL pipelines that deliver into our Nederland terminal as well as on the Mariner East pipeline system. Average fractionated volumes increased 16% to a partnership record 1.1 million barrels per day compared to 982, 000 barrels per day for the same period last year. Total NGL export volumes grew 13% over the fourth quarter of 2022 and 18% over full year of 2022. This was primarily driven by increased international demand for natural gas liquids. For 2023, we loaded more than 61 million barrels of ethane out of Nederland and nearly 27 million barrels of ethane out of Marcus Hook. For 2023, we continued to export more NGLs than any other company and maintained approximately 20% market share of worldwide NGL exports. For Midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $674 million compared to $632 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. We saw record throughput this quarter, which was primarily the result of the addition of the Crestwood assets, as well as higher volumes from existing customers in the Permian, South Texas, and Mid-Continent regions. The strong volume growth was partially offset by lower natural gas and NGL prices. Gathered gas volumes increased 5% to 20.3 million MMBTUs per day, compared to 19.4 million MMBTUs per day for the same period last year. For the crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $775 million, compared to $571 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. This was primarily due to higher volumes on several of our pipelines, higher terminal throughput, as well as the acquisitions of the Lotus and Crestwood assets in May and November of last year. Crude oil transportation volumes increased 39% to a record 5.9 million barrels per day, compared to 4.3 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This was a result of higher volumes on our Texas pipeline systems, and the Bakken and Bayou Bridge Pipeline, increased crude oil gathering volumes, as well as the acquisitions of Lotus and Crestwood. Without the additions of Lotus and Crestwood, adjusted EBITDA and crude oil transportation volumes would still have increased 16% and 8%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. In our interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $541 million, compared to $494 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily due to placing the Gulf Run Pipeline into service in December of 2022, as well as higher contracted volumes on several of our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines. Volumes increased 5% over the same period last year, due to the Gulf Run Pipeline being placed into service, as well as higher utilization on many of our interstate pipelines, including Transwestern, Rover, and Trunkline. We continue to fully utilize Zone 1 capacity on Gulf Run, and we are also maximizing deliveries into our Trunkline pipeline from Zone 2. Our team continues to work on the next phase of a potential capacity expansion to facilitate the transportation of natural gas from northern Louisiana to the Gulf Coast based upon customer demand. And for our intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $242 million compared to $433 million for the fourth quarter of last year. Benefits from new contracts on several of our Texas pipelines, as well as lower operating expenses, were more than offset by decreases from lower optimization opportunities. Now turning to our acquisition of Crestwood Equity Partners, which we completed in November of 2023, integration of the combined operations has been going very well. The combination of these complementary assets will allow us to continue to provide flexibility, reliable, and competitive services for our customers as we pursue additional commercial opportunities utilizing our improved connectivity and expanded footprint. We now expect to generate approximately $80 million of annual cost synergies by 2026, with $65 million in 2024. This is before any additional anticipated benefits from financial or commercial synergies. We are in the process of identifying and evaluating a number of commercial and operational synergies that are expected to enhance the operational capabilities of our systems by improving efficiencies and increasing the utilization and profitability of our combined assets. These synergies include optimizing our West Texas processing capacity given the newly acquired Crestwood plants, as well as utilizing spare NGO pipeline capacity out of the Delaware Basin and working with producers in West Texas and New Mexico to provide additional water gathering solutions. We're also looking at opportunities to move more barrels into our Bakken Pipeline system for transport to the Gulf Coast. And in the Northeast, we're evaluating options to transition LPG products previously transported by truck into our Mariner East pipeline system. Now turning to our growth projects and starting with our Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals, our NGL terminals continue to benefit from increased demand from both in the U.S. as well as from international customers. To address this demand, construction is underway on our expansion to the NGL export capacity at Nederland and we expect to be finished driving piles by the end of the month. This expansion is expected to give us the flexibility to load various products based upon customer demand. We continue to expect the project to be in service in mid-2025. In addition, we are building new refrigerated storage at Nederland, which will increase our butane storage capacity by 33% and will double our propane storage capacity. This will further increase our ability to keep customers' ships loaded on time. Also, we recently closed on the acquisition of two pipelines, one from Mont Belvieu at our Nederland Terminal and one from Mont Belvieu to the Ship Channel. We expect to have term transportation commitments on the Mont Belvieu to Nederland Pipeline in the near future, which will have the ability to flow at least 70, 000 barrels per day. This will provide much needed capacity for several products in high demand, both international and domestically. And we are in discussions to provide transportation for potentially multiple products on the pipeline that extends from Mont Belvieu to Houston. And at our Marcus Hook Terminal, we have commenced construction on the first phase of an optimization project that would add incremental ethane refrigeration and storage capacity. In addition, we have begun expanding our processing capacity at several of our existing 200 million cubic feet per day cryogenic processing plants. In total, we see opportunities to add approximately 100 to 150 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity in our west and south Texas regions at favorable capital cost when compared to building a new processing plant. In November, 2023, we announced a Heads of Agreement, or HOA, with TotalEnergies for crude offtake from our proposed Blue Marlin Offshore project. Additional customers remain very engaged and interested in our project, recognizing the value of fully loading VLCCs and the reduced execution risk that comes with repurposing existing underutilized assets. Next on an update for our Lake Charles LNG project, as most of you are aware, the Biden administration recently imposed a moratorium on the approval of LNG exports by the Department of Energy, while the DOE conducts studies to determine whether LNG exports are in the public interest. The Biden administration stated that these studies would focus on the cumulative impact of LNG exports on climate change, U.S. natural gas prices, and the impact of LNG facilities on local communities. The DOE most recently conducted similar studies in 2019 and based on the results of these studies, the DOE subsequently approved several LNG export projects. In light of the extremely low natural gas prices in the U.S. currently and the beneficial climate impacts from the use of natural gas compared to coal for power generation, it would be difficult to believe that these new studies won't continue to conclude that LNG exports are in the U.S. public interest. Lake Charles LNG applied for a new LNG export authorization in August of 2023 and requested approval by February of 2024. The recently announced moratorium on approvals of LNG export creates uncertainty as to when the DOE studies will be completed and whether the criteria for approving LNG export projects will be changed. Despite these uncertainties, Lake Charles LNG continues to pursue the development of the project and is extremely thankful for the continued support of its LNG customers. And now for an update on other projects. On the blue ammonia front, we are working with several companies to evaluate the feasibility of ammonia projects. That would include the opportunity to supply and transport natural gas to the ammonia facility and to transport CO2 to third-party sequestration sites. We're also looking at opportunities to provide other infrastructure services, including transport and sequestration, ammonia storage, and deep water marine loading on property near our Lake Charles and Nederland facilities. Additionally, we're working on carbon capture and sequestration projects to our processing plants and treating facilities in North Louisiana, South Texas, and West Texas. And we are evaluating other CO2 pipeline projects that would connect CO2 emitters to CO2 sequestration sites. Before moving to discuss our 2024 guidance, we wanted to quickly address another topic. Our practice is not to comment on pending litigation. However, given that we have received a number of questions about the Louisiana Pipeline matter, we would like to provide some important context. Recently, several third parties approached Energy Transfer about crossing various pipes we own and operate in Louisiana, including three of our common carrier pipelines, gathering systems and other lines. These three parties proposed between 140 and 160 crossings, as well as seeking to secure long segments of proposed parallel pipe within our existing rights of way and workspaces. As a consequence, we requested certain technical information from these parties regarding these crossings to allow us to evaluate their technical feasibility and potential issues between these new proposed pipes and our existing operations. The parties making these requests largely rejected or ignored our very reasonable request. Instead, on at least two occasions, they told us they would begin construction on these new pipes, whether we agreed to the crossings or not. At that point, we had no choice but to enforce our property rights by filing legal actions to prevent these crossings, pending our ability to evaluate the technical details of the crossing. In the process of enforcing our property rights, one of the requesting parties has alleged that Energy Transfer is using unfair or anti-competitive practices to block all pipeline crossings request in Louisiana in an effort to stifle competition and monopolize the pipeline capacity, moving gas from the Haynesville, and these practices are threatening the expansion of pipeline infrastructure in Louisiana. These statements are unfounded and false. In our opinion, these parties are skirting state and federal regulations and regulatory oversight by seeking to quickly build large diameter pipe, high pressure pipelines across state lines and calling them gathering. To this end, we encourage you to read the submission we filed in docket number 84356 in the 42nd Judicial District Court in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana, which set forth our positions on the facts and on the law. We do not want to litigate the matter on this earnings call. However, we want to underscore that Energy Transfer takes very seriously its obligations to operate its assets safely and reliably. Energy Transfer is simply seeking to protect its legal property rights under Louisiana law. Indeed, not a single court has found that ET somehow acted in bad faith in defending its lawful property rights. Nonetheless, any pipeline that is unable to agree to terms on pipeline crossing is free to exercise rights of condemnation or expropriation as applicable. To accomplish the crossings as it seeks to do so under state or federal law, Energy Transfer has never taken the position that others cannot cross us ever, just that they must satisfy us, that they will not adversely affect our existing lines, create additional costs for us, put us at risk under existing FERC certificate, and unjustifiably piggyback off of our efforts to build pipelines in compliance with state and federal rules, including in some cases significant environmental reviews. We appreciate that long distance transmission lines have become increasingly difficult to build, particularly given entrenched environmental opposition. No one knows that better than Energy Transfer. As we have been clear, Energy Transfer embraces markets and vigorous competition, but this also means respecting property rights and playing by the rules. And looking ahead at our 2024 organic growth capital guidance, we expect growth capital expenditures to be between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion for 2024, inclusive of the $300 million deferral from 2023, which will be spent primarily in the NGL and refined products and midstream segments. This capital is made up of expansions to our export facilities and storage tanks at Nederland optimization work at Marcus Hook and new pumping station to increase our NGL takeaway capacity from the Permian, new crude oil pipeline connections and new treating capacity in the Haynesville. In addition, this capital includes a large number of blocking and tackling projects, including processing plant capacity additions, compression and laterals to existing pipeline systems, additional gathering and compression build out, as well as improved efficiencies and emissions reductions work. We also continue to evaluate a number of other potential growth projects that we hope to bring to FID. However, as we look at our potential backlog of high-returning growth projects, we continue to expect our long-term annual growth capital run rate to be approximately $2 billion to $3 billion. Now turning to our 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance, giving the ability of our business to provide stable cash flows and operate through various market cycles, as well as our market outlook, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between $14.5 billion and $14.8 billion. In 2024, we expect utilization of assets within our core segments to remain strong and that recently acquired assets will provide growth and synergy opportunities. Worldwide demand for crude oil and natural gas, natural gas liquids and refined products continues to grow and we will continue to position ourselves to meet this demand by strategically targeting optimization and expansion projects that enhance our existing asset base, generate attractive returns and meet this growing demand for our product and services. As a result of our continued emphasis on strengthening our balance sheet, we're in the strongest financial position in Energy Transfer history and this will allow us the flexibility to balance pursuing new growth opportunities with further leverage reduction, maintaining our targeted distribution growth rate and increasing equity returns to our unit holders. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the lineup for the first question. Jeremy, this is Tom, I think in addition, the pricing that you brought up in your question just then. We've used the forward curve in this. So this is the kind of latest forecast we have, we always stay kind of down the middle of the road with the range that we put out at the beginning of the year. So anything that we've seen, even here in the first quarter, et cetera, this would be our latest forecast, everything included. So feel good about it and look forward to another great year. Yes, listen, we're actually very excited at the fact that we're able to start bringing some of that back in as far as the perpetual prefers. I think you're going to see us to continue to look at those and as we look at even cash flow and where our cost of that is, it makes a lot of sense for us to continue to bring those back in. So I think that's how you'll see us kind of prioritize when you look at our deck, told you that, you'll see us working on those first going forward. It's probably worth mentioning that even with the Crestwood acquisition, as you know, we had some more come in with that. We're going to continue to be opportunistic on those. When they make sense, economic sense, we'll look at calling those, but we always are very diligent in looking at the math on those and as soon as they make economic sense, we will jump. Yes, listen, I'll definitely start off here, and then if Mackie you want to add something more, you can. By far the largest driver on the difference between the S4 was the commodity prices. I think when you look at what we used back then when that was filed, we are substantially lower now with our commodity prices. So and then also deferring -- maybe deferring some of the capital, I think is another piece of that that you'll see in the difference between that S4 and now. So those are probably the two largest drivers. Obviously, a great acquisition by Sonoco. It's a very, very good fit for them. And I will say there's not been discussion Sunoco. This was a Sunoco transaction and they are doing a great job of proceeding through getting all the approvals and even moving a little bit into the integrations. But I wouldn't say there's been any discussions on that. Yes. After you get a chance to start going through all the various costs in an organization, we always try to be fairly conservative. We're doing it with what information we have at the time, meaning public information. But after you get really further into these things and start looking at organizations, et cetera, I think you'll find that a lot of times you're always hopeful that you can't find more. So the $80 million run rate that we've talked about from a call standpoint is something that we feel very comfortable with and putting that number out there. And, of course, $65 million is what we put out for 2025. But when you start looking across its systems and all the other type of costs that are buried sometimes that, once again, you can't see when you're middle of these things are early in the process of them. It's always good to be able to find those, and I want to make sure we stop for a moment and give a huge complement to our team, who I know we've said before, is no one is better out there at integrating these companies than we are. We've had a lot of experience at it, and we move quickly, efficiently, and effectively as we go through it. But as mentioned in the prepared remarks up front, we've remained on multiple fronts, very excited about some of the commercial opportunities. I don't know, Mackie, you want to add anything more to that, what we said? Yes, listen, I'll start and then you go with Mackie. No, there's not a hard cap as we look at these. Once again, we'll evaluate projects that make economic sense and when we pull it all together, as recently gave the range of the 2.4 to 2.6 and keep in mind that that did include $300 million of rollover from 2023. That didn't make it into service at the time, so those got rolled into 2024. So make sure you bake that in there. But is there any more details on that with Michael, as far as your question here? Ready to roll. Michael, no, that is a good question. I think we've been saying for some time, we've been very consistent on our M&A discussions with everyone that we felt like it made a lot of sense in the midstream space, and you're seeing it. You're seeing it now. And we're going to continue to evaluate opportunities, but the other thing that's worth highlighting here is that we are staying very disciplined with these acquisitions to even doing someone with no premium, just doing at the market. And you can see the results. They're accretive. They're deleveraging. And it's the reason why we've ended up with the continued growth in our distributions at the same time that our balance sheet is strengthening, and it's showing in our ratings, et cetera. So it's one of those where it makes sense and where it's FID. And remember, as large as we are, there's a lot on the FID side. So we'll continue to evaluate and we'll continue to look at opportunities. Well, once again, I want to express a lot of appreciation to all of you for joining us today. We always thank you for a lot of really good questions, good dialogue, and as you can see, we've got a lot of really good things to talk about. And therefore, we look forward to continuing dialogue even after this call with anyone. So thank you, everyone. You all have a great day."

            "name": "Mackie McCrea",
            "content": "Hey Jeremy, this is Mackie here to start. Yes, with the lower gas prices in North Louisiana, certainly if they get any lower, we probably will see a slowdown, but right now we haven't seen it. Out in the Permian Basin, where we have a tremendous amount of assets, we see growth even in the lower gas price environment. With the higher oil prices, we continue to see growth and we are projecting modest, if not fairly significant growth out of the Permian Basin. Other areas, it varies, midcontinent, relatively flat, and other areas where our assets are pretty stable. Well, it's probably pretty consistent to where we've been. The main difference is that we have got to the lower side of our 4 to 4.5. And like we said before, it wouldn't even hurt to go a little bit lower if it gave us a little bit more dry powder to be able to continue to look at growth opportunities, et cetera. So if you kind of move through that, you go into the growth capital that we've talked about. We're obviously very disciplined on our projects and how we approve them and get them to FIDs. We're going to continue to focus on that likewise. And then we're going to look at the, of course, the distribution growth also that we put out there, 3% to 5%, which is the equity side of the equation. Based upon the CapEx spend and what we're seeing out there, remember we're always looking at this long term. We're not just looking at numbers that we're reporting for the quarter. But where we will continue to evaluate is of course unit buybacks, along with the distribution growth. So let's see how everything continues to play out. We couldn't agree with you more there a lot of free cash flow is when you do the math on the guidance, we've given out there. And with the other capital allocation topics that we've talked about here. So very good question. Thank you. Oh, no, that's exactly right. Absolutely. They definitely are on the table. Hey, Jean, this is Mackie. I think I can cover that question. If you're looking at, if you're talking about our upgrade on some of our 200, 000 day cryos out in West Texas into the Delaware, we can very optimally and at a low cost compared to, adding a new processing plant at 20, 000 to 40, 000 UCF per cryo. So we are looking at that. We can move quicker on that. It's just adding compression in some cases, treating or dehas. We also have already done that in the Eagle Ford. We've already added about 50, 000 or 60 ,000 a day at very low cost. And then if you're on some of the other CapEx, if you're looking at our expansion at Nederland, we're looking at the ability, as Tom said, in his opening remarks of doubling our propane capacity and increasing our butane capacity by 33%. So even though the market's going to be really tight for the next 18 months, we have a tremendous amount of capability of increasing our export volumes starting about mid-2025. And not only are we excited about that, but the international market is very excited about that. And a lot of that that we've already, that we're in the process of expanding has already been sold out for three to five years once those projects come online. So we're doing the best we can to improve or have within our capital and meet the needs of our customers and obligations that we have. You bet. This is Mackie again. As you can imagine, that's a very sensitive question from the standpoint of competition. But as far as when contracts fall off and kind of what our approach is, but I will answer it this way. We are very confident that we will keep our pipeline full and increase the volumes through time, certainly if the volumes grow in the Bakken. For the best outlet out of there, we can, at the best cost, we can feed all the refineries, or many of the refineries in the Midwest. We come down to the Gulf Coast, of course, and feed all the refineries in the Port Arthur area. And of course, through our Bayou Bridge Pipeline, we can, well volumes all the way to St. James. So there's no other pipeline that's even close, no other options than ours we feel really good about as contracts roll off, we'll do very well on re-contracting or selling on a spot basis. Yes, this is Macky. I'll answer that. I guess an update on Warrior is we love to say where at FID we're sold out for 10 years, demand charge, and ready to go, but that's not where we're at. We have sold about 25% of our goal. We're in negotiations with about 1.6, 1.7 BCF of additional customers. All of them are looking for, or a lot of them are looking for different places to take the gas. There's no project that's even contemplated. It's anywhere close to Warrior where it provides access to almost every major city gate in the state of Texas. It goes to all the major hubs, Carthage, KD, et cetera. It also goes to a lot of the power plants either directly or indirectly were connected to the majority of power plants. So it's by far the best project that's out there with the pause from the DOE. There is a customer that was looking at that. That's going to pause a little bit. However, we continue to push forward. We're not saying that FID is imminent. We do think there will be another pipeline needed in the next two and a half years. And if that were to happen, we do believe it will be ours. Yes. Jackie, this is Mackie. What a great business we have with our export at Nederland and at Marcus. We're very excited about what we've built and what we're building out. However, there's a lot of issues that are involved, especially with shipping. And so there's issues with Panama Canal or through the Red Sea, the timing of ship. Some months we may see direct basis and some months less. So every month, every quarter kind of have it's up and down. But overall, we see our steady where we've been and our slight growth pretty much completely fill up, our entire export capacity in the short term over the next 18 months, we believe we're going to see some very, very good margins for that business. For the spot business that we have available today, there's a significant overdemand in the international market than what the U.S. is capable of exporting, and we are positioned very well in the next 18 months to capture that upside. And then, as I mentioned earlier, we're very excited about bringing old projects that will bring in significant revenue for our export business. Other than what you've did in the opening script, we're still digging in. Every acquisition that we do, we discover more and more under the rocks that we turn over to elaborate a little bit more on his opening remarks. We are seeing significant logistics and maybe even deferred on some cost, fully utilizing all of the assets when combined with the new Crestwood assets in the Delaware Basin. There are also some things we can do in the DJ Basin that we're looking at. Up in the Bakken, a lot of those barrels haven't found their way to our pipeline. We think now they will. So we think that will also bring more business to our total pipeline out of North Dakota and then the Northeast. We see some or starting to see some real commercial advantages to working together with that team and doing two things. One, helping that business grow distribution with propane and butane that Crestwood built and then on the other side where they can bring in volumes with their contracts and with their relationship into our Mariner franchise for deliveries to Marcus Hook. So as Tom said, we're just getting started but pretty excited about the things that we're already seeing."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Tom Long, Co-CEO of Energy Transfer. Please go ahead.\nTom Long: Thank you, Operator, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Energy Transfer's third quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon as well as the slides posted to our Web site. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which we expect to file tomorrow November 2. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures on our Web site. We will start today by going over our financial results for the third quarter of 2023. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.5 billion, compared to $3.1 billion for the third quarter of 2022. In our base business, we had strong performance across our operations, including record volumes through our NGL pipelines, fractionators, and NGL and refined products' terminals, as well as record volumes in our crude segment. In addition, volumes in our intrastate and midstream segments remained near records. DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer as adjusted was $2 billion, compared to $1.6 billion for the third quarter of 2022. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of $1 billion. On October 20, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.3125 per common unit or $1.25 on an annualized basis. This distribution represents an increase from the $0.2650 in the third quarter of 2022. In August, Energy Transfer's senior unsecured credit rating was upgraded by S&P to BBB with a stable outlook. We are pleased to have this third-party recognition of all the hard work that we have done over the last several years, and as we have placed significant focus on our balance sheet in leverage reduction. As of September 30, 2023, the total available liquidity under our revolving credit facility was approximately $2.12 billion. During the third quarter of 2023, we spent $418 million on organic growth capital. And in October, we completed the sale of $4 billion of aggregate principal amount of senior notes, and used the proceeds to repay borrowings on our revolving credit facility, and pre-funded 2024 maturities. Now turning to our results by segment for the third quarter, starting with NGL and refined products, adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion compared to $634 million for the third quarter of 2022. This was primarily due to strong performances across our transportation, storage, terminal, and fractionation operations. We also saw strong contributions from our optimization of hedged NGL and refined products inventories, where we recorded $107 million in marketing margin compared to a loss of $126 million in the third quarter of last year. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly-owned and joint venture pipelines increased 14% to a record 2.2 million barrels per day, compared to 1.9 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes from the Permian region and on our NGL pipelines that delivered into our Nederland Terminal, as well as on the Mariner East pipeline system. Average fractionated volumes increased 9% to a record 1 million barrels per day, compared to 940,000 barrels per day for the same period last year. Total NGL export volumes grew more than 20% over the third quarter of 2022, setting a new partnership record. This was primarily driven by increased international demand for NGLs. Through the first nine months of this year, we loaded more than 47 million barrels of ethane out of Nederland, and approximately 21 million barrels of ethane out of Marcus Hook. In total, we continue to export more NGLs than any other company during the third quarter, and maintained an approximately 20% market share of worldwide NGL exports, as well as nearly 40% of U.S. exports. For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $631 million compared to $868 million for the third quarter of 2022. We saw near record throughput again this quarter, which was the result of growth in the majority of our operating regions. The strong volume growth was more than offset by significantly lower natural gas and NGL prices. Gathered gas volumes increased 4% to 19.8 million MMBtus per day, compared to 19.1 MMBtus per day for the same period last year. For our crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $706 million compared to $461 million for the third quarter of 2022. This was primarily due to higher volumes on several of our pipelines, as well as the acquisition of the Lotus assets in May of this year. In addition, G&A expenses decreased $126 million as a result of a one-time charge related to the resolution of a legal matter in the prior period. Crude oil transportation volumes were a record 5.6 million barrels per day, compared to 4.6 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This was a result of higher volumes on our Texas pipeline systems, the Bakken Pipeline, as well as the acquisition of the Lotus assets in May of this year. In our interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $491 million, compared to $409 million in the third quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily due to placing the Gulf Run Pipeline into service in December of 2022, as well as higher contracted volumes and interruptible utilization on several of our wholly-owned and joint venture pipeline. Volumes increased 15% over the same period last year due to the Gulf Run Pipeline being placed into service, as well as higher utilization on many of our interstate pipeline, including Transwestern, Rover, Panhandle and Trunkline. We continue to fully utilize Zone 1 capacity on Gulf Run, and we are also maximizing deliveries into our Trunkline Pipeline from Zone 2. And for our intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $244 million, compared to $301 million in the third quarter of last year. Benefits from favorable storage optimization and new contracts on our Texas and Haynesville pipelines as well as lower operating expenses were more than offset by decreases resulting from lower spreads across our intrastate pipeline network, and lower natural gas pricing. Now, turning to our acquisition of Crestwood Equity Partners, which we announced in August of this year, as many of you have probably seen, earlier this week, Crestwood unit holders voted to approve the merger between Energy Transfer and Crestwood. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to DCF per unit upon closing. In addition, this transaction will extend Energy Transfer's position in the value chain deeper into the Williston and Delaware basins, while also providing entry into the Powder River Basin. These assets are expected to compliment Energy Transfer's downstream fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu, as well as its hydrocarbon export capabilities from both our Nederland and Marcus Hook terminals. We also expect benefits within our NGL and refined products and crude oil businesses with the addition of strategically located storage in terminal assets. We now expect the acquisition to close on November 3, and we expect to achieve approximately $40 million in annual cost synergies before additional anticipated benefits from financial and commercial synergies. Turning to our growth projects and starting with our Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals, September and October were our best months ever across our NGL export terminals. And these terminals continue to benefit from increased demand, both in the U.S. and as well as from international customers. Earlier this year, we FID'd an expansion to our NGL export capacity at Nederland in order to address the growing demand. We expect this expansion, which is projected to cost approximately $1.25 billion, to add up to 250,000 barrels per day of export capacity. The project is expected to be in service in mid 2025, and will give us flexibility to load various products based upon customer demand. Construction is underway, and we look forward to providing more specifics on this expansion as it progresses. We also continue to pursue an optimization project at our Marcus Hook Terminal that we project would add incremental ethane refrigeration and storage capacity. At Mont Belvieu, we placed Frac VIII into service in August, which brought our total Mont Belvieu fractionation capacity to over 1.15 million barrels per day. As a result, in October, throughput at our fractionators reached an all-time high. Out in the Delaware Basin, we have placed 200 million cubic foot per day processing plants into service since December of 2022, and we now have a total of eight -- 200 million cubic foot per day processing plants operating in the Delaware Basin. Our plant inlet remains near record highs, and we continue to contemplate the necessity and potential timing of adding another processing plant in the Permian Basin while considering any available new capacity that we acquire via the Crestwood acquisition. Next, an update on our Lake Charles LNG project; we continue to see significant interest in our LNG capacity from U.S. producers and international markets. We are in negotiations with several significant equity partners that are ultimately targeting retaining an interest of approximately 20% for Energy Transfer. These potential equity partners are also interested in substantial volumes of LNG offtake. We are in negotiations to finalize our EPC contract, and we are receiving tremendous support from domestic and international customers, community stakeholders, and other interested constituents who are actively encouraging the Department of Energy to approve our pending export authorization application on an expedited basis. And now for an update on a few other projects on the carbon capture and sequestration front, we are continuing to make progress with CapturePoint. This project entails the capture of CO2 from our treating plants in north Louisiana and the construction of a pipeline to a sequestration site in central Louisiana. We are continuing to work with Oxy to develop a CCS project in Lake Charles, Louisiana area. This would include the construction of a CO2 pipeline connecting our industrial facilities to Oxy's proposed sequestration site. On the blue ammonia front, we are working with several companies to evaluate the feasibility of ammonia projects that would include significant natural gas supply opportunities, deep water dock access, and other infrastructure services on existing Energy Transfer property near our Lake Charles and Nederland facilities. Additionally, we are working on CCS projects related to our processing plants and treating facilities in south Texas and west Texas, and we are evaluating other CO2 pipeline projects that would connect CO2 emitters to CO2 sequestration sites in the Houston ship channel corridor. Finally, we are evaluating the use of some of our existing 250,000 acres of land in Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky for wind, solar, forestry, carbon credits, and other uses. The Virginia Department of Energy has spent considerable time and effort evaluating a variety of projects on 65,000 acres located in southwest Virginia. Now, looking at our growth capital spend for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Energy Transfer spent $1.2 billion on organic growth projects, primarily in the midstream and NGL refined product segments, excluding SUN and USA Compression CapEx. For full-year 2023, we expect growth capital expenditures to come in slightly below our previously announced guidance of $2 billion, including growth capital related to Crestwood. Looking ahead, we continue to evaluate a number of other potential growth projects that we hope to bring to FID. We expect to provide our 2024 growth capital outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call. However, as we look forward to our potential backlog of high returning growth projects, we continue to expect our long-term annual growth capital run rate to be approximately $2 billion to $3 billion. Now, for adjusted EBITDA guidance, for the full-year 2023, we now expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between $13.5 billion and $13.6 billion, including two months of Crestwood. We continue to see strong volumes and stable cash flows throughout our business segments, with recently completed growth projects contributing several records in the third quarter. Looking ahead, we are excited to close on the acquisition of Crestwood later this week. We look forward to working with the new Crestwood employees as we integrate these new assets into our Energy Transfer franchise. We believe the combination of these businesses will present strategic commercial opportunities and efficiencies. We expect the newly acquired Crestwood asset as well as the growth projects completed throughout this year to provide additional opportunities and positive momentum for the rest of this year and going into next year. We will continue to pursue strategic optimization and expansion projects that enhance our existing asset base, generate attractive returns, and meet the growing demand for our products and services. Our financial position remain strong, and we remain committed to our targeted annual distribution growth rate, which we will continue to balance with leverage reduction, increasing equity returns, and maintaining sufficient cash flow to pursue growth opportunities. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line up for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. I'll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question will be from Jeremy Tonet of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good afternoon.\nMackie McCrea: Hey, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to start off, if I could, if you could just provide high-level thoughts for us, as the platform sits now after a number of acquisitions and projects, what type of organic growth level do you see innate in your business? What type of EBITDA growth [via base] (ph) business do you see? And also at the same time, how does this impact your capital allocation philosophy? In there's a somewhat newer slide in the deck there that maybe alludes to buybacks potential there or distribution increases as well. So, just wondering if you could update us on these fronts?\nTom Long: Yes, for sure, Jeremy, and good afternoon to you. Listen, we've put out the guidance of that $2 billion to $3 billion a year. And we still have at least a mid-teen-type returns or high-teen-type returns. So, you can see the growth rate from there. We're going to stay with that 3% to 5% growth rate on the distributions at this time. Clearly, we talk about that at every single board meeting. So, that's kind of the math on the growth that you can see. Now, remember, we still have the 85%-15% fixed versus floating. Now, it's moved into more of 90%-10% just because the commodity prices are lower, so that scales around based upon where those prices are, from that standpoint. So, when you factor all that in and then all the other optimization opportunities that we will definitely jump on when those opportunities present themselves, I think you can look at that type of growth rate. But I will say that we're going to stay with our normal schedule, meaning that with the fourth quarter results we will update the 2024 EBITDA guidance -- adjusted EBITDA guidance with you. And the second party, Jeremy, did you want to just talk about the unitholder buyback, is that the second part of your -- the question there?\nJeremy Tonet: Yes, overall capital allocation and thoughts in light of what you talked about for organic opportunities.\nTom Long: Yes. Well, it's -- the capital allocation is real consistent with what we've been saying for a while, and which we're going to continue to focus on the balance sheet. And it's a great place to be as you start approaching the low end of our 4 to 4.5 times leverage target. So, I think when you continue to look out, you look at all these growth projects, you look at the distribution growth that we're looking at, that the unitholder buyback clearly remains as a option that we'll look at. You're probably going to look at being at the very low end of that range, if not a [three handle] (ph) on it, the upper three, where you could start seeing opportunistically starting to buy back units. But that's the way that you should probably look at that.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful there, thanks. And then, just want to shift gears a little bit towards Permian, just wondering if you could provide us thoughts. I think you touched on it a bit in your prepared remarks as far as growth opportunities there. But just wondering how you see the scaling over time, particularly as it relates to the NGL business and opportunities along that value chain? Seemed like the NGL and products business had quite a nice step up this quarter, and just wondering if you could highlight a bit more of what was happening there?\nMackie McCrea: Yes, Jeremy, this is Mackie. What an exciting area. You look at the consolidation that's going on upstream, a lot of that, of course, is around the bigger deals in the Permian Basin. And as you know and most on this call, nobody is better positioned to capitalize that than Energy Transfer, from every standpoint, from gathering, processing, NGL takeaway, intra-interstate pipeline takeaway, crude takeaway. And so, it all kind of begins upstream with our G&P group and our NGL team working to purchase not only those barrels from our affiliate, but also barrels from others out in that basin. And we couldn't be more excited and well-positioned to meet the growth there. And it feeds into our partnership revenue stream when you take all that downstream, and then ultimately frac it, and a lot it is, of course, hitting our export markets now. So, what an incredible area of the world that we've heavily invested in and we see it paying off for many years to come.\nJeremy Tonet: And if I could just follow up real quick on that, I guess on the other side of the NGL equation, just how much demand do you see materializing? How that impacts pricing for NGLs, do you see the LPGs continuing to price to export or just any broader thoughts on the NGL supply-demand dynamics and impact on NGL pricing?\nMackie McCrea: It's hard to overexaggerate the ethane and, more importantly, the LPG growth. Assets cannot be built quick enough in the U.S. to meet the international demand or by [indiscernible] PDHs that are being built in Asia, and especially in China. There's a lot of ethane crackers that are being built. So, you really can't build quick enough. But we're being very prudent. We've announced our Flexport project that's under budget, on track. So, we expect to have that in service by the third quarter of '25. We're close to fully filling that out. And we're analyzing another expansion, it would be a much less expensive expansion, and a much less cost per barrel to expand more. So, we're going to continue to make sure that all of the gas that we're gathering and processing, that we have a home for all those liquids. So, we're looking ahead, and we see significant growth in our NGL business, especially our export business, both on the Gulf Coast and Marcus Hook, once again, for many years to come.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it, makes sense, seems to certainly build momentum for your Panama initiatives there. Thank you for the color. I'll leave it there.\nMackie McCrea: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Spiro Dounis of Citi. Please go ahead.\nSpiro Dounis: Thanks, operator. Afternoon, guys. Just want to go back one of Jeremy's questions actually. And Tom, fully respect that you're not in a position to provide '24 guidance yet, but maybe just looking at the S4 filing from Crestwood as we look to 2024. I know it's not guidance, but some of those pro forma numbers seem to indicate you guys will be approaching $15 billion in EBITDA next year, on a combined basis. And so, pretty meaningful step up from 2023. So, just wondering, qualitatively or however you see fit, could you help us bridge from 2023 to those S4 numbers, what parts of the business could be driving that upside?\nTom Long: Yes. No, listen, it's great to be talking about a number that has a 15 handle on it. So, let's start with that. When you look at that S4, remember that those were estimates. We take our estimates very seriously when we file these things, obviously. And we are still in the process of finishing up the 2024 budget numbers, et cetera, which all go into the guidance. And that's the reason we'll always wait till that fourth quarter to come out with the very best numbers that we can. But listen, Spiro, we sure hope we hit these numbers. It would be great even if we came out with something more. But let us get through that before we put out any type of official guidance on that. We're so excited about everything we're seeing at this stage with closing on the transaction on Friday, it's going to give us now the opportunity even start digging deeper into the other synergies that we didn't make in any of the estimates especially the commercial synergies. So, let us get through the close on Friday and we're going to be very excited to be able to talk about what the '24 numbers should look like, but yes what a great place to be able to earnings numbers this size so -- \nSpiro Dounis: Yes. No, fair enough and do your best to stay patient. One quick follow-up once again going back to capital return, just as we think about the distribution wrote here on the Cadence now that's become predictable when you talk about the 3% to 5% range. I guess I'm just curious, what would you need to see the flex toward the higher end of that range? Is that a function of getting leverage lowered or is it something else you really focused on?\nTom Long: Well, the leverage is within our targets. So, I wouldn't want to necessarily guide you toward that 4% to 4.5%. You can already see that we've got the one upgrade from S&P like we've mentioned. And the other two, have us on the positive outlook, and we're going to continue to work with them to get those up to that triple the levels. So, I think the other components we always look at is we're always looking out at the coverage ratio, making sure that we're staying in a good solid range there but as much as any we're also looking a lot at the growth opportunities. So, the usual capital allocation debates that you have, any company has here and that's what we're going to evaluate. But it's not a matter of looking any one single point in time it is a matter of looking out with the best crystal ball we have over the next three, four, or five years. So, we try to make decisions here that we stick with without kind of jumping up and down or moving around with.\nSpiro Dounis: Got it. I'll leave it there, Tom. Thanks for your time.\nTom Long: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Michael Blum of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMichael Blum: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask on CapEx close in terms of this year just what exactly is driving the reduction there, slight reduction. And then, for next year, if I recall correctly your last update, I know you see your long term run rate I think is to 2 to 3 billion but I think at least as of last update you said, you don't even have to go in community projects for '24 or so. Just want to get the latest update on where that stands as well.\nTom Long: Yes, Michael. Good afternoon. You know as far as the first part of your question, I would say that we continue to work on some very, very good projects. Some of that it's going to be never set a timing, but even with that, I want to be careful using that word because it doesn't mean that 2024 is necessarily going to go up. That blends straight in to the second part of your question. If you really kind of look at that 2 to 3 billion, you could use $750 million a year that are just kind of those growth capital projects that well connects all the other great projects we have that are good high returning projects that help with the utilization, optimization of our system overall, especially with the M&A that we've been so successful on a lot of this projects fall in that category of that $750 million. I will say that well, some of the stuff that we've talked about and I know Mackie's talked about here is that those who have the other projects that aren't necessarily the FID, so we can't say that we've got all of that fill in right now by any means the other 2 billion or so from that standpoint we're continuing to work on them. I think we feel good about a lot of the projects, so once again it's probably 750 million and then we'll be talking more about the other projects as we get them to FID the one that we get highlighted and prepare remarks, of course was Flexport, so -- \nMichael Blum: Got it. Okay, that helps. Thank you. And then, it sounds like a pretty encouraging update on Lake Charles. So, I guess, what I'm wondering is what would be the earliest timeframe from your perspective where you think Lake Charles could actually get the FID and then in service?\nMackie McCrea: Hey, Matt, this is Mackie. Tough question in that, we've got a lot of balls in the air, we've covered it pretty well with Tom's remarks, so we're sending a really good position. We really need to get the DOE to extend the permit. We think they will. As we said, a lot of folks involved behind the scenes trying to make that happen, including other countries, other businesses in other countries, but we're just keeping our head down pushing. We don't really have a lot of estimates. We're hopeful that we'll have something to the DOE, sometimes kind of mid first quarter we're pushing, and others are also pushing and to maybe do that sooner, we don't know. It's the regulatory agency that we're working closely with, and I hope to make that happen sooner than later. But at the meantime, Tom Mason's team are working hard back over there now, trying to finalize a lot of these contracts and agreements around equity as well as new LNG offtakers. So, it's hard to kind of predict that, but everything went exceptionally well, in the second quarter could be a possibility, but we'll see how things go in the next three or four months.\nMichael Blum: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Brian Reynolds of UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrian Reynolds: Hi, good morning, everyone. Maybe to follow up on some CapEx questions as it relates to the Permian natural gas egress seems like we could be seeing the last brownfield expansion get contracted here over the near future. But beyond that, seems like we need a larger pipe, which Warrior still exists out there. So, just as it relates to the Warrior Project at this juncture, has the scope or size the project changed or evolved since you started marketing the project a few years ago, just to perhaps meet specific customer needs and to get the project that ultimately FID? Thanks.\nMackie McCrea: Yes, Brian, this is Mackie again. Yes, we actually started really aggressively marketing this first part of this year, but we are pushing hard, and we've mentioned we've get about 25% already signed up. We're working on several other shippers that would bring us to about 60% or 65%. But we're going to be pretty careful on this, we're very careful, like we always are, we're going to be prudent, we're not going to move forward with that on FID until we have a substantial amount of that capacity sold out. And also, it will feed into not only markets that we're already connected to with our intrastate network, but also, we'll have a lot of momentum if some of these other LNG projects get to FID. So, we're kind of like a lot of these big projects working on, they're just taking time, we see spread other than a few days or weeks where it blows out a little bit, spreads are very tight, there's not a lot of pain. Right now, for the most part, we think that's going to get really difficult as we go in '24 until the next pipelines built. So, we do think we'll pick up more momentum and we're going to push hard and kind of similar to a comments around LNG. We hope to maybe get the FID on Warrior, sometime maybe in the second quarter of next year.\nBrian Reynolds: Great, super helpful. And maybe to just touch on the M&A for the year with Crestwood, and Lotus coming into the fold here, can you just maybe talk about how some of these acquisitions have maybe perhaps helped defer some capital. I know Crestwood has some Permian processing capacity and I think you alluded to, and the prepared remarks that some of that excess processing capacity might be able to defer a processing plant a little bit. So, how should we think about processing capacity for '24, '25? Do we need to see another new build coming in next year, or could we see some capital get deferred into the following year as it relates to maybe the crude side Lotus or Crestwood on the NGL on processing side? Thanks.\nMackie McCrea: Yes, this is Mackie again. Yes, as you can understand, we haven't been able to really dig into the Crestwood assets yet. We don't close officially till Friday, but from a high level we certainly recognize some capacities, they were really in all regions as well from the back in and the powder, as well as the Delaware. We are constantly evaluating when is the next time to kick off the next trial to make sure we meet our obligations that we signed up producers, but clearly we believe that this is going to give us some time to defer that decision. We're thinking we're going to make that decision first quarter of next year, whether we're going to start pick up another plant, that's probably going to push it back at least three to six months, so we'll see. And as we fully are able to analyze and look at these assets and see how they would just fully blend in but we're pretty confident that a minimum is going to delay building a new pilot at least some period of time.\nBrian Reynolds: Great, thanks. I appreciate it. I'll leave it there and then enjoy the rest of your afternoon. Thanks.\nMackie McCrea: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Jean Ann Salisbury of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Hi. There's a lot of new NGL pipes coming to the Permian in 2025. I think ET is actually the only main company not doing an expansion. How well-positioned are Lone Star and West Texas Gateway to whether that contractual duration-wise, and does it drive more interest in inorganic opportunities in the basin?\nMackie McCrea: Yes, Jean, this is Mackie again. We have noticed that there's a lot of pipelines announced here in the last couple of days, but what we try to do as a partnership is not really worry about what others are announcing or what others are building. We kind of focus on what do we need to build to accommodate our customers and to meet the demand growth of those that we're working with, and we are very well positioned right now. We move about a third of every barrel of NGL that's produced in the Permian Basin. We have the ability to move 100-plus thousand more barrels. We can add pumps and move probably in the neighborhood of 250,000 more barrels, so we've got some kind of dry powder or dry capacity, available capacity we'll be able to expand on. So, I think any kind of considerations or determinations from us are probably a year or longer away on even contemplating another pipeline. We're positioned pretty well to move everything we've signed up in addition to more growth that we expect from our G&P business.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Great. That makes sense. To be clear, I'm certainly not pushing you to expand Lone Star, but that's super helpful. And for your Nederland NGL export expansion, I know that you're talking to a lot of ethane counterparties, but it seems like you haven't quite signed the contracts yet. Is there a way to think about it that given how tight LPG export capacity is, it'll probably start mostly as LPG, and then as your ethane contracts eventually get signed and kicked in, a greater share will become ethane?\nMackie McCrea: Yes, I think I would answer it this way. We are in constant dialogue and negotiations across the board. We have probably at least 140,000 barrels of ethane customers that we're negotiating with right now, of which some prefer Marcus Hooks on the Gulf Coast. We'll have the ability to swing the volume between either one. But clearly, LPG is also in high demand. So, we're -- there's not a shortage of international customers. And we're very excited, as we've said earlier, that we're not only very well positioned to meet that, but also very well positioned to meet the growth two years from now and beyond. So, we do think space is going to get pretty tight. As you can see by results, we're moving more volume. We're hitting records on almost every aspect of our NGL business, including our export, and we're seeing the margins widen. We think we'll see that over the next couple of years, and then we'll have new contracts lined up to come online on our Flex port. So, we're pretty excited. We got in this export business a little later than most of our competitors, certainly our biggest competitor. We've kind of gone from nowhere to the leading exporter in the world, and we're proud of that. Proud of our commercial team that's done all these deals. Proud of our E&C team who builds these assets so quickly, proud of our operating team led by Greg Mcilwain, who runs these systems efficiently and reliably, and more importantly, safely. So, we are very proud of our team and what we've done over the last five or six years to kind of start from nowhere and grow to where we're at today, and we have such a bright future on the assets that we are building now and the contracts that we have in place.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Great, I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from John Mackay of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJohn Mackay: Hey, everyone. Thanks for the time. Maybe just taking that last piece, I mean, talking about exports probably being the tightest part of the value chain for you right now, at least that's what we're picking up on. But I guess if you're looking across the kind of broader ET and kind of ET combined Crestwood footprint right now, where else are you seeing relative tightness and a call on the market, either you guys or others, to add incremental capacity? Is it the Haynesville? Is it more on processing in the Permian, just curious your thoughts overall, if we're looking maybe beyond export?\nTom Long: Yes. Let me just hit every region real quickly to kind of address, I hope, your question. And so, you start in the northeast, we're positioned incredibly well. On any kind of product growth up there, whether it's ethane or LPG, we are kind of the only outlet with our mariner franchise. So, we call it dry powder or available capacity, whatever you want to call it, we are ready to capture any kind of growth up there. And then, as you come further south, we mentioned that we've got the ability to grow our transport volumes from the Permian Basin fairly significantly. We're expanding our Flex port fairly significantly. And we haven't really hit on this on this call, but there is a lot of gas in north Louisiana. Yes, it's slowed down a little bit with gas prices here the last two or three months. We think it's going to pick back up as prices have improved and will continue to improve. There's enormous reserves there. But on top of that, we have multiple intrastate and interstate pipelines that feed into east Texas and north Louisiana. And so, we're very optimistic on our Gulf Run expansion. We can add compression and add a Bcf a day, but we think it's much more likely that we will sign up enough to loop our existing Gulf Run Zone 2 pipeline, especially aligned with LNG, if we get that FID. But we see that as certainly a huge growth area for us on a large pipeline project somewhere in the future, along with what we've already talked about, our Warrior expert project and other areas. So, depending on where the area is, we're either situated very well to grow with next no capital, or we have such an excellent position to aggregate volumes to support a project like Gulf Run, an expansion project like Gulf Run.\nJohn Mackay: All right, that's clear. Thank you. Maybe just following up, if we're thinking about '23 guidance overall, can you just maybe a quick breakdown of how much of the step-up was Crestwood versus kind of underlying business outperformance? And maybe if you're touching on the Gulf Run contributions third quarter interstate was particularly strong, or third quarter gas overall was pretty strong, particularly for kind of a shoulder season. Is this a clean new run rate from here, or are there any kind of one-offs in there? Thanks.\nMackie McCrea: Yes, no, listen, I think the best way to look at that as far as the guidance goes in the split between the two is the guidance we had coming into this quarter that we provided in the second quarter was 13.1 billion to 13.4 billion, as you know. As you really looked at the new numbers we gave, you can probably say that the existing business was right at the top end of that range, and the rest of it would be Crestwood, but Crestwood would be net transaction cost. So, that's what we're currently expecting right now. Still maybe some moving pieces as we get into the fourth quarter, but we feel pretty good about the 13.5 to 13.6.\nJohn Mackay: All right, that's clear. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Neel Mitra of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nNeel Mitra: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, it seems that Cushing inventories are extremely low right now, so wanted to understand how your Centurion flows and your overall Lotus acquisition was able to materialize on this dynamic in the third quarter?\nMackie McCrea: Yes, you bet. This is Mackie again. Yes, I have to do a shout out to Chris Hefty and his team and what they've done over the last two years has just been phenomenal as you look at Enable and kind of what it's done over the last year and a half and the synergies that we've found and the same with WEX. And Lotus is the same thing. We continue to look at significant commercial synergies around blending. As we have made an announcement, we are looping pipes so that we can move more volume to benefit when the spread blows out between Midland and Cushing. So, we're slowly positioning ourselves to become a much bigger player to be able to move volumes between the Cushing and Midland areas, as well as, of course, to the Gulf Coast, to our Houston and Nederland Terminal. And I think, likewise, we're going to see with Crestwood a lot of the same synergies. So, we're pretty excited about our ability to buy these assets at the values we're able to buy at. They're great standalone companies and assets. And then, once we blend them in, like your question with Lotus, we're finding significant synergies that we didn't recognize as we were pursuing these acquisitions.\nNeel Mitra: Got it. And then, my second question, you've had a lot of success building Permian to Mexico natural gas pipelines and it seems like the utilizations on Comanche Trail and Trans-Pecos are picking up and you have a competitor looking to build a pipeline to the border as well. With some of the West Coast LNG demand and increased industrial demand in West Mexico, are you seeing any appetite for pipeline expansions down to the border or possibly participating in a new project to move gas to Mexico?\nMackie McCrea: This is Mackie again. No, we're not pursuing anything right now. As you mentioned, we are ramping up our two pipelines out in West Texas that deliver to Mexico. We still have quite a bit of capacity to fill up to fully utilize those pipelines. We have some pipelines in South Texas that we deliver either directly into Mexico or into other larger diameter pipelines, but no, we don't have anything on the drawing board. Yes, we are aware of some proposed pipelines out of the WAHA area and heading west, but we aren't involved in any of those projects at this time.\nNeel Mitra: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Final question will come from Gabe Moreen of Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nGabe Moreen: As sort of the uplift in pricing on your interstate gas pipelines and storage, it seems like if I'm reading it right, some of that uplift may be accelerating. Can you just talk about sort of how you feel your position, rate case outcomes aside, and to what extent that's still going to be winded to your backs going forward into 2024?\nMackie McCrea: Hey, Gabe, this is Mackie, and I apologize. We started hearing about halfway through your question. Sorry.\nGabe Moreen: Okay. Can you hear me now, Mackie?\nMackie McCrea: Yes.\nGabe Moreen: Okay, great. I was just going to say to what extent repricing your interstate gas pipeline and storage capacity is going to be winded to your backs in 2024? It seems like some of that's accelerating as we progress through 2023.\nMackie McCrea: Yes, years ago this wasn't fun to talk about. It is now. When you look at the value, for example, on the MEP or on Tiger or on Gulf Run or even on SESH, we're seeing growing, growing demand on all of those assets. GW, I mean, just pick an asset, and most of what we're doing right now is either at tariff or close to tariff. The demand is there. A lot of the gas throughout this country is trying to find its way to the Gulf Coast. We're very well-positioned to benefit from that with all the pipelines I just mentioned and others. So, we don't really, unlike years past, we might have had some concern when contracts were terminating of what we could do with that available capacity. I mean, Tiger is a great example. I mean, Tiger was about half empty with spreads down to $0.05 or $0.06, and now we're running at full at much bigger spread. And so, we're pretty excited about any available capacity. Once it comes out from the contract, we think worst case we'll roll it over it somewhere, if not higher rates than we already are at unless we're already at tariff.\nGabe Moreen: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn to call back over to Mr. Tom Long for closing remarks.\nTom Long: Once again, I thank all of you for joining us today. We greatly appreciate all your support. And we look forward to talking to you in the near future.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our conference today. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tom Long",
            "content": "Thank you, Operator, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Energy Transfer's third quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon as well as the slides posted to our Web site. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which we expect to file tomorrow November 2. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures on our Web site. We will start today by going over our financial results for the third quarter of 2023. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.5 billion, compared to $3.1 billion for the third quarter of 2022. In our base business, we had strong performance across our operations, including record volumes through our NGL pipelines, fractionators, and NGL and refined products' terminals, as well as record volumes in our crude segment. In addition, volumes in our intrastate and midstream segments remained near records. DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer as adjusted was $2 billion, compared to $1.6 billion for the third quarter of 2022. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of $1 billion. On October 20, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.3125 per common unit or $1.25 on an annualized basis. This distribution represents an increase from the $0.2650 in the third quarter of 2022. In August, Energy Transfer's senior unsecured credit rating was upgraded by S&P to BBB with a stable outlook. We are pleased to have this third-party recognition of all the hard work that we have done over the last several years, and as we have placed significant focus on our balance sheet in leverage reduction. As of September 30, 2023, the total available liquidity under our revolving credit facility was approximately $2.12 billion. During the third quarter of 2023, we spent $418 million on organic growth capital. And in October, we completed the sale of $4 billion of aggregate principal amount of senior notes, and used the proceeds to repay borrowings on our revolving credit facility, and pre-funded 2024 maturities. Now turning to our results by segment for the third quarter, starting with NGL and refined products, adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion compared to $634 million for the third quarter of 2022. This was primarily due to strong performances across our transportation, storage, terminal, and fractionation operations. We also saw strong contributions from our optimization of hedged NGL and refined products inventories, where we recorded $107 million in marketing margin compared to a loss of $126 million in the third quarter of last year. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly-owned and joint venture pipelines increased 14% to a record 2.2 million barrels per day, compared to 1.9 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes from the Permian region and on our NGL pipelines that delivered into our Nederland Terminal, as well as on the Mariner East pipeline system. Average fractionated volumes increased 9% to a record 1 million barrels per day, compared to 940,000 barrels per day for the same period last year. Total NGL export volumes grew more than 20% over the third quarter of 2022, setting a new partnership record. This was primarily driven by increased international demand for NGLs. Through the first nine months of this year, we loaded more than 47 million barrels of ethane out of Nederland, and approximately 21 million barrels of ethane out of Marcus Hook. In total, we continue to export more NGLs than any other company during the third quarter, and maintained an approximately 20% market share of worldwide NGL exports, as well as nearly 40% of U.S. exports. For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $631 million compared to $868 million for the third quarter of 2022. We saw near record throughput again this quarter, which was the result of growth in the majority of our operating regions. The strong volume growth was more than offset by significantly lower natural gas and NGL prices. Gathered gas volumes increased 4% to 19.8 million MMBtus per day, compared to 19.1 MMBtus per day for the same period last year. For our crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $706 million compared to $461 million for the third quarter of 2022. This was primarily due to higher volumes on several of our pipelines, as well as the acquisition of the Lotus assets in May of this year. In addition, G&A expenses decreased $126 million as a result of a one-time charge related to the resolution of a legal matter in the prior period. Crude oil transportation volumes were a record 5.6 million barrels per day, compared to 4.6 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This was a result of higher volumes on our Texas pipeline systems, the Bakken Pipeline, as well as the acquisition of the Lotus assets in May of this year. In our interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $491 million, compared to $409 million in the third quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily due to placing the Gulf Run Pipeline into service in December of 2022, as well as higher contracted volumes and interruptible utilization on several of our wholly-owned and joint venture pipeline. Volumes increased 15% over the same period last year due to the Gulf Run Pipeline being placed into service, as well as higher utilization on many of our interstate pipeline, including Transwestern, Rover, Panhandle and Trunkline. We continue to fully utilize Zone 1 capacity on Gulf Run, and we are also maximizing deliveries into our Trunkline Pipeline from Zone 2. And for our intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $244 million, compared to $301 million in the third quarter of last year. Benefits from favorable storage optimization and new contracts on our Texas and Haynesville pipelines as well as lower operating expenses were more than offset by decreases resulting from lower spreads across our intrastate pipeline network, and lower natural gas pricing. Now, turning to our acquisition of Crestwood Equity Partners, which we announced in August of this year, as many of you have probably seen, earlier this week, Crestwood unit holders voted to approve the merger between Energy Transfer and Crestwood. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to DCF per unit upon closing. In addition, this transaction will extend Energy Transfer's position in the value chain deeper into the Williston and Delaware basins, while also providing entry into the Powder River Basin. These assets are expected to compliment Energy Transfer's downstream fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu, as well as its hydrocarbon export capabilities from both our Nederland and Marcus Hook terminals. We also expect benefits within our NGL and refined products and crude oil businesses with the addition of strategically located storage in terminal assets. We now expect the acquisition to close on November 3, and we expect to achieve approximately $40 million in annual cost synergies before additional anticipated benefits from financial and commercial synergies. Turning to our growth projects and starting with our Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals, September and October were our best months ever across our NGL export terminals. And these terminals continue to benefit from increased demand, both in the U.S. and as well as from international customers. Earlier this year, we FID'd an expansion to our NGL export capacity at Nederland in order to address the growing demand. We expect this expansion, which is projected to cost approximately $1.25 billion, to add up to 250,000 barrels per day of export capacity. The project is expected to be in service in mid 2025, and will give us flexibility to load various products based upon customer demand. Construction is underway, and we look forward to providing more specifics on this expansion as it progresses. We also continue to pursue an optimization project at our Marcus Hook Terminal that we project would add incremental ethane refrigeration and storage capacity. At Mont Belvieu, we placed Frac VIII into service in August, which brought our total Mont Belvieu fractionation capacity to over 1.15 million barrels per day. As a result, in October, throughput at our fractionators reached an all-time high. Out in the Delaware Basin, we have placed 200 million cubic foot per day processing plants into service since December of 2022, and we now have a total of eight -- 200 million cubic foot per day processing plants operating in the Delaware Basin. Our plant inlet remains near record highs, and we continue to contemplate the necessity and potential timing of adding another processing plant in the Permian Basin while considering any available new capacity that we acquire via the Crestwood acquisition. Next, an update on our Lake Charles LNG project; we continue to see significant interest in our LNG capacity from U.S. producers and international markets. We are in negotiations with several significant equity partners that are ultimately targeting retaining an interest of approximately 20% for Energy Transfer. These potential equity partners are also interested in substantial volumes of LNG offtake. We are in negotiations to finalize our EPC contract, and we are receiving tremendous support from domestic and international customers, community stakeholders, and other interested constituents who are actively encouraging the Department of Energy to approve our pending export authorization application on an expedited basis. And now for an update on a few other projects on the carbon capture and sequestration front, we are continuing to make progress with CapturePoint. This project entails the capture of CO2 from our treating plants in north Louisiana and the construction of a pipeline to a sequestration site in central Louisiana. We are continuing to work with Oxy to develop a CCS project in Lake Charles, Louisiana area. This would include the construction of a CO2 pipeline connecting our industrial facilities to Oxy's proposed sequestration site. On the blue ammonia front, we are working with several companies to evaluate the feasibility of ammonia projects that would include significant natural gas supply opportunities, deep water dock access, and other infrastructure services on existing Energy Transfer property near our Lake Charles and Nederland facilities. Additionally, we are working on CCS projects related to our processing plants and treating facilities in south Texas and west Texas, and we are evaluating other CO2 pipeline projects that would connect CO2 emitters to CO2 sequestration sites in the Houston ship channel corridor. Finally, we are evaluating the use of some of our existing 250,000 acres of land in Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky for wind, solar, forestry, carbon credits, and other uses. The Virginia Department of Energy has spent considerable time and effort evaluating a variety of projects on 65,000 acres located in southwest Virginia. Now, looking at our growth capital spend for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Energy Transfer spent $1.2 billion on organic growth projects, primarily in the midstream and NGL refined product segments, excluding SUN and USA Compression CapEx. For full-year 2023, we expect growth capital expenditures to come in slightly below our previously announced guidance of $2 billion, including growth capital related to Crestwood. Looking ahead, we continue to evaluate a number of other potential growth projects that we hope to bring to FID. We expect to provide our 2024 growth capital outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call. However, as we look forward to our potential backlog of high returning growth projects, we continue to expect our long-term annual growth capital run rate to be approximately $2 billion to $3 billion. Now, for adjusted EBITDA guidance, for the full-year 2023, we now expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between $13.5 billion and $13.6 billion, including two months of Crestwood. We continue to see strong volumes and stable cash flows throughout our business segments, with recently completed growth projects contributing several records in the third quarter. Looking ahead, we are excited to close on the acquisition of Crestwood later this week. We look forward to working with the new Crestwood employees as we integrate these new assets into our Energy Transfer franchise. We believe the combination of these businesses will present strategic commercial opportunities and efficiencies. We expect the newly acquired Crestwood asset as well as the growth projects completed throughout this year to provide additional opportunities and positive momentum for the rest of this year and going into next year. We will continue to pursue strategic optimization and expansion projects that enhance our existing asset base, generate attractive returns, and meet the growing demand for our products and services. Our financial position remain strong, and we remain committed to our targeted annual distribution growth rate, which we will continue to balance with leverage reduction, increasing equity returns, and maintaining sufficient cash flow to pursue growth opportunities. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line up for our first question. Yes, for sure, Jeremy, and good afternoon to you. Listen, we've put out the guidance of that $2 billion to $3 billion a year. And we still have at least a mid-teen-type returns or high-teen-type returns. So, you can see the growth rate from there. We're going to stay with that 3% to 5% growth rate on the distributions at this time. Clearly, we talk about that at every single board meeting. So, that's kind of the math on the growth that you can see. Now, remember, we still have the 85%-15% fixed versus floating. Now, it's moved into more of 90%-10% just because the commodity prices are lower, so that scales around based upon where those prices are, from that standpoint. So, when you factor all that in and then all the other optimization opportunities that we will definitely jump on when those opportunities present themselves, I think you can look at that type of growth rate. But I will say that we're going to stay with our normal schedule, meaning that with the fourth quarter results we will update the 2024 EBITDA guidance -- adjusted EBITDA guidance with you. And the second party, Jeremy, did you want to just talk about the unitholder buyback, is that the second part of your -- the question there? Yes. Well, it's -- the capital allocation is real consistent with what we've been saying for a while, and which we're going to continue to focus on the balance sheet. And it's a great place to be as you start approaching the low end of our 4 to 4.5 times leverage target. So, I think when you continue to look out, you look at all these growth projects, you look at the distribution growth that we're looking at, that the unitholder buyback clearly remains as a option that we'll look at. You're probably going to look at being at the very low end of that range, if not a [three handle] (ph) on it, the upper three, where you could start seeing opportunistically starting to buy back units. But that's the way that you should probably look at that. Yes. No, listen, it's great to be talking about a number that has a 15 handle on it. So, let's start with that. When you look at that S4, remember that those were estimates. We take our estimates very seriously when we file these things, obviously. And we are still in the process of finishing up the 2024 budget numbers, et cetera, which all go into the guidance. And that's the reason we'll always wait till that fourth quarter to come out with the very best numbers that we can. But listen, Spiro, we sure hope we hit these numbers. It would be great even if we came out with something more. But let us get through that before we put out any type of official guidance on that. We're so excited about everything we're seeing at this stage with closing on the transaction on Friday, it's going to give us now the opportunity even start digging deeper into the other synergies that we didn't make in any of the estimates especially the commercial synergies. So, let us get through the close on Friday and we're going to be very excited to be able to talk about what the '24 numbers should look like, but yes what a great place to be able to earnings numbers this size so -- Well, the leverage is within our targets. So, I wouldn't want to necessarily guide you toward that 4% to 4.5%. You can already see that we've got the one upgrade from S&P like we've mentioned. And the other two, have us on the positive outlook, and we're going to continue to work with them to get those up to that triple the levels. So, I think the other components we always look at is we're always looking out at the coverage ratio, making sure that we're staying in a good solid range there but as much as any we're also looking a lot at the growth opportunities. So, the usual capital allocation debates that you have, any company has here and that's what we're going to evaluate. But it's not a matter of looking any one single point in time it is a matter of looking out with the best crystal ball we have over the next three, four, or five years. So, we try to make decisions here that we stick with without kind of jumping up and down or moving around with. All right. Thank you. Yes, Michael. Good afternoon. You know as far as the first part of your question, I would say that we continue to work on some very, very good projects. Some of that it's going to be never set a timing, but even with that, I want to be careful using that word because it doesn't mean that 2024 is necessarily going to go up. That blends straight in to the second part of your question. If you really kind of look at that 2 to 3 billion, you could use $750 million a year that are just kind of those growth capital projects that well connects all the other great projects we have that are good high returning projects that help with the utilization, optimization of our system overall, especially with the M&A that we've been so successful on a lot of this projects fall in that category of that $750 million. I will say that well, some of the stuff that we've talked about and I know Mackie's talked about here is that those who have the other projects that aren't necessarily the FID, so we can't say that we've got all of that fill in right now by any means the other 2 billion or so from that standpoint we're continuing to work on them. I think we feel good about a lot of the projects, so once again it's probably 750 million and then we'll be talking more about the other projects as we get them to FID the one that we get highlighted and prepare remarks, of course was Flexport, so -- Yes. Let me just hit every region real quickly to kind of address, I hope, your question. And so, you start in the northeast, we're positioned incredibly well. On any kind of product growth up there, whether it's ethane or LPG, we are kind of the only outlet with our mariner franchise. So, we call it dry powder or available capacity, whatever you want to call it, we are ready to capture any kind of growth up there. And then, as you come further south, we mentioned that we've got the ability to grow our transport volumes from the Permian Basin fairly significantly. We're expanding our Flex port fairly significantly. And we haven't really hit on this on this call, but there is a lot of gas in north Louisiana. Yes, it's slowed down a little bit with gas prices here the last two or three months. We think it's going to pick back up as prices have improved and will continue to improve. There's enormous reserves there. But on top of that, we have multiple intrastate and interstate pipelines that feed into east Texas and north Louisiana. And so, we're very optimistic on our Gulf Run expansion. We can add compression and add a Bcf a day, but we think it's much more likely that we will sign up enough to loop our existing Gulf Run Zone 2 pipeline, especially aligned with LNG, if we get that FID. But we see that as certainly a huge growth area for us on a large pipeline project somewhere in the future, along with what we've already talked about, our Warrior expert project and other areas. So, depending on where the area is, we're either situated very well to grow with next no capital, or we have such an excellent position to aggregate volumes to support a project like Gulf Run, an expansion project like Gulf Run. Once again, I thank all of you for joining us today. We greatly appreciate all your support. And we look forward to talking to you in the near future."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Mackie McCrea",
            "content": "Hey, Jeremy. Yes, Jeremy, this is Mackie. What an exciting area. You look at the consolidation that's going on upstream, a lot of that, of course, is around the bigger deals in the Permian Basin. And as you know and most on this call, nobody is better positioned to capitalize that than Energy Transfer, from every standpoint, from gathering, processing, NGL takeaway, intra-interstate pipeline takeaway, crude takeaway. And so, it all kind of begins upstream with our G&P group and our NGL team working to purchase not only those barrels from our affiliate, but also barrels from others out in that basin. And we couldn't be more excited and well-positioned to meet the growth there. And it feeds into our partnership revenue stream when you take all that downstream, and then ultimately frac it, and a lot it is, of course, hitting our export markets now. So, what an incredible area of the world that we've heavily invested in and we see it paying off for many years to come. It's hard to overexaggerate the ethane and, more importantly, the LPG growth. Assets cannot be built quick enough in the U.S. to meet the international demand or by [indiscernible] PDHs that are being built in Asia, and especially in China. There's a lot of ethane crackers that are being built. So, you really can't build quick enough. But we're being very prudent. We've announced our Flexport project that's under budget, on track. So, we expect to have that in service by the third quarter of '25. We're close to fully filling that out. And we're analyzing another expansion, it would be a much less expensive expansion, and a much less cost per barrel to expand more. So, we're going to continue to make sure that all of the gas that we're gathering and processing, that we have a home for all those liquids. So, we're looking ahead, and we see significant growth in our NGL business, especially our export business, both on the Gulf Coast and Marcus Hook, once again, for many years to come. Thank you. Hey, Matt, this is Mackie. Tough question in that, we've got a lot of balls in the air, we've covered it pretty well with Tom's remarks, so we're sending a really good position. We really need to get the DOE to extend the permit. We think they will. As we said, a lot of folks involved behind the scenes trying to make that happen, including other countries, other businesses in other countries, but we're just keeping our head down pushing. We don't really have a lot of estimates. We're hopeful that we'll have something to the DOE, sometimes kind of mid first quarter we're pushing, and others are also pushing and to maybe do that sooner, we don't know. It's the regulatory agency that we're working closely with, and I hope to make that happen sooner than later. But at the meantime, Tom Mason's team are working hard back over there now, trying to finalize a lot of these contracts and agreements around equity as well as new LNG offtakers. So, it's hard to kind of predict that, but everything went exceptionally well, in the second quarter could be a possibility, but we'll see how things go in the next three or four months. Yes, Brian, this is Mackie again. Yes, we actually started really aggressively marketing this first part of this year, but we are pushing hard, and we've mentioned we've get about 25% already signed up. We're working on several other shippers that would bring us to about 60% or 65%. But we're going to be pretty careful on this, we're very careful, like we always are, we're going to be prudent, we're not going to move forward with that on FID until we have a substantial amount of that capacity sold out. And also, it will feed into not only markets that we're already connected to with our intrastate network, but also, we'll have a lot of momentum if some of these other LNG projects get to FID. So, we're kind of like a lot of these big projects working on, they're just taking time, we see spread other than a few days or weeks where it blows out a little bit, spreads are very tight, there's not a lot of pain. Right now, for the most part, we think that's going to get really difficult as we go in '24 until the next pipelines built. So, we do think we'll pick up more momentum and we're going to push hard and kind of similar to a comments around LNG. We hope to maybe get the FID on Warrior, sometime maybe in the second quarter of next year. Yes, this is Mackie again. Yes, as you can understand, we haven't been able to really dig into the Crestwood assets yet. We don't close officially till Friday, but from a high level we certainly recognize some capacities, they were really in all regions as well from the back in and the powder, as well as the Delaware. We are constantly evaluating when is the next time to kick off the next trial to make sure we meet our obligations that we signed up producers, but clearly we believe that this is going to give us some time to defer that decision. We're thinking we're going to make that decision first quarter of next year, whether we're going to start pick up another plant, that's probably going to push it back at least three to six months, so we'll see. And as we fully are able to analyze and look at these assets and see how they would just fully blend in but we're pretty confident that a minimum is going to delay building a new pilot at least some period of time. Thank you. Yes, Jean, this is Mackie again. We have noticed that there's a lot of pipelines announced here in the last couple of days, but what we try to do as a partnership is not really worry about what others are announcing or what others are building. We kind of focus on what do we need to build to accommodate our customers and to meet the demand growth of those that we're working with, and we are very well positioned right now. We move about a third of every barrel of NGL that's produced in the Permian Basin. We have the ability to move 100-plus thousand more barrels. We can add pumps and move probably in the neighborhood of 250,000 more barrels, so we've got some kind of dry powder or dry capacity, available capacity we'll be able to expand on. So, I think any kind of considerations or determinations from us are probably a year or longer away on even contemplating another pipeline. We're positioned pretty well to move everything we've signed up in addition to more growth that we expect from our G&P business. Yes, I think I would answer it this way. We are in constant dialogue and negotiations across the board. We have probably at least 140,000 barrels of ethane customers that we're negotiating with right now, of which some prefer Marcus Hooks on the Gulf Coast. We'll have the ability to swing the volume between either one. But clearly, LPG is also in high demand. So, we're -- there's not a shortage of international customers. And we're very excited, as we've said earlier, that we're not only very well positioned to meet that, but also very well positioned to meet the growth two years from now and beyond. So, we do think space is going to get pretty tight. As you can see by results, we're moving more volume. We're hitting records on almost every aspect of our NGL business, including our export, and we're seeing the margins widen. We think we'll see that over the next couple of years, and then we'll have new contracts lined up to come online on our Flex port. So, we're pretty excited. We got in this export business a little later than most of our competitors, certainly our biggest competitor. We've kind of gone from nowhere to the leading exporter in the world, and we're proud of that. Proud of our commercial team that's done all these deals. Proud of our E&C team who builds these assets so quickly, proud of our operating team led by Greg Mcilwain, who runs these systems efficiently and reliably, and more importantly, safely. So, we are very proud of our team and what we've done over the last five or six years to kind of start from nowhere and grow to where we're at today, and we have such a bright future on the assets that we are building now and the contracts that we have in place. Yes, no, listen, I think the best way to look at that as far as the guidance goes in the split between the two is the guidance we had coming into this quarter that we provided in the second quarter was 13.1 billion to 13.4 billion, as you know. As you really looked at the new numbers we gave, you can probably say that the existing business was right at the top end of that range, and the rest of it would be Crestwood, but Crestwood would be net transaction cost. So, that's what we're currently expecting right now. Still maybe some moving pieces as we get into the fourth quarter, but we feel pretty good about the 13.5 to 13.6. Yes, you bet. This is Mackie again. Yes, I have to do a shout out to Chris Hefty and his team and what they've done over the last two years has just been phenomenal as you look at Enable and kind of what it's done over the last year and a half and the synergies that we've found and the same with WEX. And Lotus is the same thing. We continue to look at significant commercial synergies around blending. As we have made an announcement, we are looping pipes so that we can move more volume to benefit when the spread blows out between Midland and Cushing. So, we're slowly positioning ourselves to become a much bigger player to be able to move volumes between the Cushing and Midland areas, as well as, of course, to the Gulf Coast, to our Houston and Nederland Terminal. And I think, likewise, we're going to see with Crestwood a lot of the same synergies. So, we're pretty excited about our ability to buy these assets at the values we're able to buy at. They're great standalone companies and assets. And then, once we blend them in, like your question with Lotus, we're finding significant synergies that we didn't recognize as we were pursuing these acquisitions. This is Mackie again. No, we're not pursuing anything right now. As you mentioned, we are ramping up our two pipelines out in West Texas that deliver to Mexico. We still have quite a bit of capacity to fill up to fully utilize those pipelines. We have some pipelines in South Texas that we deliver either directly into Mexico or into other larger diameter pipelines, but no, we don't have anything on the drawing board. Yes, we are aware of some proposed pipelines out of the WAHA area and heading west, but we aren't involved in any of those projects at this time. Hey, Gabe, this is Mackie, and I apologize. We started hearing about halfway through your question. Sorry. Yes. Yes, years ago this wasn't fun to talk about. It is now. When you look at the value, for example, on the MEP or on Tiger or on Gulf Run or even on SESH, we're seeing growing, growing demand on all of those assets. GW, I mean, just pick an asset, and most of what we're doing right now is either at tariff or close to tariff. The demand is there. A lot of the gas throughout this country is trying to find its way to the Gulf Coast. We're very well-positioned to benefit from that with all the pipelines I just mentioned and others. So, we don't really, unlike years past, we might have had some concern when contracts were terminating of what we could do with that available capacity. I mean, Tiger is a great example. I mean, Tiger was about half empty with spreads down to $0.05 or $0.06, and now we're running at full at much bigger spread. And so, we're pretty excited about any available capacity. Once it comes out from the contract, we think worst case we'll roll it over it somewhere, if not higher rates than we already are at unless we're already at tariff."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note today's event is being recorded. I now like to turn the conference over to, Tom Long. Please go ahead.\nTom Long: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer\u2019s second quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, which we expect to file tomorrow August, the 3. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'd like to start today by going over our financial results for the second quarter of 2023. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.12 billion, compared to $3.23 billion for the second quarter of 2022. In our base business, we had strong performance from our operations, which delivered record volumes across our Intrastate and midstream segments, as well as through our NGL pipelines, and NGL and refined products terminals, including record NGL volumes exported out of our Nederland and Marcus Hook terminals.  Our volume growth was more than offset by significantly lower quarterly average natural gas and NGL prices, which declined 70% and 45% respectively over the second quarter of last year. DCF. Approval to the partners of Energy Transfer as adjusted was $1.55 billion, compared to $1.88 billion for the second quarter of 2022. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of $579 million.  On July 25, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.31 per common unit, or $1.24 on an annualized basis. This distribution represents an increase from $0.23 paid in the second quarter of 2022. We continue to target a 3% to 5% annual distribution growth rate, while balancing our leverage reduction, increasing equity returns and maintaining sufficient cash flow to invest and our incredible backlog of growth opportunities. As of June 30, 2023, the total available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities was approximately $2.36 billion.  Now turning to results by segment for the second quarter, I'll start with NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was $837 million, compared to $763 million for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to higher transportation, storage and terminal services margins related to increased volumes and higher rates, partially offsetting this with a $51 million negative impact, due to timing of the recognition of gains on hedged NGL inventory during the current period. We expect to fully realize the offsetting gains over the next two quarters. Adjusting for this non-cash timing matter around hedging, adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter would have been $888 million.  NGL transportation volumes on our wholly-owned and joint venture pipelines increased 13% to a record 2.2 million barrels per day, compared to 1.9 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes from the Permian region, and on our NGL pipelines that deliver into our Nederland terminal, as well as on the Mariner East pipeline system. Average fractionated volumes increased 5% to a record 989,000 barrels per day, compared to 938,000 barrels per day for the second quarter of 2022. For the month of April, throughput averaged over 1 million barrels per day, which was a new monthly record.  NGL export volumes grew 15% over the second quarter of 2022, driven by record NGL exports out of both our Nederland and Marcus Hook terminals. This was primarily driven by the second tranche of satellites contract going into effect on July 1, 2022, as well as increased international demand for natural gas liquids. Year-to-date, we have loaded more than 30 million barrels of ethane out of Nederland. And we are also exporting record volumes of ethane out of Marcus Hook. In total, we continue to export more NGLs than any other company and maintain approximately 20% market share of worldwide NGL exports as well as nearly 40% of U.S. exports.  For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $579 million, compared to $903 million for the second quarter of 2022. We saw record throughput as a result of growth in the majority of our operating regions. The strong volume growth was more than offset by significantly lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, as well as increased operating expenses. Gathered gas volumes increased 8% to 19.8 million MMBtus per day compared to 18.3 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year.  For our crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $674 million, compared to $562 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to higher volumes on several of our pipelines increased throughput at our Gulf Coast and Permian terminals, as well as the acquisition of the Lotus assets in May of this year. Crude oil transportation volumes were a record 5.3 million barrels per day, compared to 4.3 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This was a result of higher volumes on our Texas pipeline systems, the Bakken pipeline, and the Bayou bridge pipeline, as well as the acquisition of the Lotus assets in May of this year.  Excluding the Lotus assets, crude oil volumes were still up approximately 10% compared to the same period last year, which was also a record. Integration of the Lotus assets is going as planned, and we continue to discover additional commercial synergies that are in excess of our original forecast. In our interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $441 million, compared to $397 million for the second quarter of 2022.  This increase was primarily due to higher contracted volumes and rates on several of our wholly-owned and joint venture pipelines, as well as placing the Gulf Run pipeline into service in December of 2022. Volumes increased 17% over the same period last year due to the Gulf Run pipeline being placed into service, as well as higher utilization on many of our interstate pipelines, including Transwestern, Tiger, Pebble and Trunkline.  For our Intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $216 million, compared to $218 million in the second quarter of last year. Benefits from new contracts in Texas and the Haynesville as well as lower operating expenses were offset by decreases in retained fuel revenues resulting from lower natural gas prices, and fewer pipeline optimization opportunities. Utilization on our EOIT and rig systems increased due to higher demand for gas takeaway, and increased production in the Haynesville Shale.  Now turning to our growth projects, and we'll start with our Lake Charles LNG project. In May of 2022, we received an extension from FERC of the deadline for the completion of the construction of Lake Charles LNG facility to December of 2028. And in June 2022, we applied to the DOE for an extension of the DOEs deadline for the commencement of exports. As many of you are now aware, in April of this year, the DOD denied our request for this extension, and in June, the DOE denied our request for rehearing of this decision.  We have had discussions with the DOE subsequent to this decision and we believe the best path forward with the DOE is to file an application for a new export authorization. We expect to file this application in August and during the DOEs review of this application, we intend to continue to work with our existing customers, prospective equity investors and other stakeholders to progress the development of this project.  In this regard in July, we entered into three non-binding HOAs related to the long term LNG offtake from this project for an aggregate of 3.6 million metric tons per annum. One of the HOAs is with Chesapeake and Gunvor for 1 million metric tons per annum. A second HOA is with EQT for 1 million metric tonnes per annum. And the third HOA is with a Japanese customer for 1.6 metric tons per annum. The HOAs are subject to negotiation and execution of definitive agreements.  Now turning to our Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals. These terminals continue to benefit from increased demand both in the U.S. as well as from international customers. We remain bullish that there will be significant long term growth in international demand for ethane and LPG products, as we are well positioned to benefit from that demand. Last quarter, we FID-ed an expansion to our NGL export capacity at Nederland in order to address this demand.  We expect this expansion which is projected to cost approximately $1.25 billion to add up to 250,000 barrels per day of export capacity. This project is expected to be in service in mid-2025, and will give us flexibility to load various products based on based upon customer demand. We look forward to providing more specifics on this expansion in the near future.  We also continue to pursue FID on an optimization project at our Marcus Hook terminal that would add incremental ethane refrigeration and storage capacity. At Mont Belview, we expect frac 8 to be mechanically complete in the next couple of weeks, which would put it into full service around September the first. This addition will bring our total Mont Belview fractionation capacity to over 1.1 5 million barrels per day.  Out in the Delaware basin, we placed our 200 million cubic foot per day Grey Wolf processing plant into service in December of 2022. And in June, we placed the Bear plant into service, which is our eighth 200 million cubic foot per day processing plant in the Delaware basin. These plants are supported by new commitments and growth from our existing customers. In addition, we continue to evaluate the necessity and potential timing of adding another processing plant in the Permian Basin. Turning to the Gulf Run pipeline, which we placed into service in December of 2022. Gulf Run provides natural gas transportation between our upstream pipeline network and from the Haynesville shale for delivery to the Gulf Coast, connecting some of the most prolific natural gas-producing regions in the United States with the LNG export market as well as many markets along the Gulf Coast. We continue to utilize a significant portion of Zone 1 capacity on Gulf Run. And during the second quarter, we added additional long-term customer volume commitments through Zone 2, which are being delivered into our Trunkline Pipeline. We have very limited available capacity in the near term and are fully subscribed beginning January of 2025. As a result, we are in discussions to add approximately 1 Bcf of capacity via compression, which will require minimal capital investment. Depending on demand, we also have the ability to loop the system to another approximately 2 Bcf of capacity. On the alternative energy front, we continue to make progress on our carbon capture and storage project with Capture Point that is related to our North Louisiana treating plants. An application for a Class 6 permit for this sequestration site was followed by Capture Point with the EPA in June of last year. Also we are working with Oxy related to its Magnolia hub in Allen Parish, Louisiana, North of the Lake Charles Industrial Complex. We are working together to obtain long-term commitments of CO2 from industrial customers in the Lake Charles, Louisiana area. If this project reaches FID, Energy Transfer would construct a CO2 pipeline to connect the customers to Oxy sequestration site in Allen Parish, Louisiana. We are also continuing to have discussions with third parties related to the development of ammonia facilities at sites along the Gulf Coast, where we have docks with Deepwater access. Now looking at our growth capital spend for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Energy Transfer spent $794 million on organic growth projects, primarily in the midstream, NGL and refined products and interstate segments, excluding Sun and USA compression CapEx. For full year 2023, we continue to expect growth capital expenditures to be approximately $2 billion, which will be spent primarily in the midstream, NGL refined products, interstate and crude segments. As a reminder, this capital outlook includes the NGL export expansion projects at Nederland as well as expenditures related to the Lotus acquisition. A significant amount of our 2023 growth capital spend is comprised of projects that are already online or are expected to be online and contributing cash flow before the end of this year at very attractive returns, including Frac A, the Bear processing plant and new treating capacity in the Haynesville. Additionally, we continue to evaluate a number of other potential growth projects that we hope to bring to FID. As we look forward to this potential backlog of high-returning growth projects, we now expect our long-term annual growth capital run rate to be approximately $2 billion to $3 billion. Now for our adjusted EBITDA guidance. As we get further into the year, we now expect our 2023 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $13.1 billion to $13.4 billion, which slightly tightens our range while keeping the midpoint the same. As a reminder, with the current forward curve for commodity prices and spreads, our guidance does not assume the same upside benefits from pricing and spreads that we experienced in 2022. Our base business continues to perform well, generating strong volumes and providing stable cash flows, which demonstrates our ability to operate through a volatile macro environment. We remain bullish about the future of our industry and the growing worldwide demand for all of our products, and our assets are strategically positioned to take advantage of new growth opportunities to meet this demand. As such, we continue to pursue strategic optimization and expansion projects that enhance our existing asset base and generate attractive returns. Our financial position remains strong. And we remain committed to our targeted distribution growth rates and the lower end of our leverage target, which we continue to balance while maintaining significant free cash flow for growth. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the lineup for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Spiro Dounis from Citi. Please go ahead. \nSpiro Dounis: Guys, first question, maybe just go to Lake Charles quickly. Two-part question there. So one, do you have any sense on the DOE timing at this point to approve a new non-FDA authorization? And Tom, I want to make sure I heard you correctly. I believe you mentioned working with equity investors on the project. You actually identified potential equity counterparties yet? Or was that just more of a general statement?\nMackie McCrea: Yes, this is Mackie. Let me start, and Tom may add to it. Yes, for confidentiality reasons, we can't talk about who our equity partners. Maybe we can say that we have two very significant partners at a minimum, one that is one to step up for a large amount of the equity as well as a lot of the offtake. And I'll just make a quick comment. We've worked pretty hard on this project. We slowed down during the pandemic. Mason and his team did a great job picking this back up when Ukraine war started. We had tremendous momentum, signed up a lot, 8 million or 9 million tonnes developed relationships all around the world, really good relationships.  A lot of those folks I've met over the last three or four months that really believe in our project, and then lowering the whole DOE cut the legs out from under us kind of by surprise without us even expecting it. So we kind of read gearing. We've spent a great deal of time with the DOE over the last several weeks. We have a real important meeting next week with them. And we're being optimistic that they'll work with us to exponentially go down this new path that we're going down to try to get an export authorization approved by them.  But in the meantime, as Tom said, we are continuing to work with not only existing customers, but with new customers. And as I said, we have some equity partners that really believe in this project, and we'll be excited to have them part of the team as we work diligently towards FID.\nSpiro Dounis: Great. That's helpful color, Matt. Second one is going to switch gears a bit here, but just in thinking about TTM. I think it was maybe two quarters ago, it sounded like you were hoping to be able to be in a position to announce something later in '23, but it also sounded market dependent, basically, I think, sort of looking for things to get better. And I guess we haven't seen that yet. So just curious, where are you in that process? How much is that delayed and maybe new sort of timing? I'm thinking about an announcement there?\nMackie McCrea: Yes, I'll give a little background first. So we're talking about that earlier today. Nederland is such a gem for any partnership, but especially for ours. If you look at what sits at Nederland, in all of our connectivity to all the refineries, we actually are connected to over 25% of refining capacity from that area in South Texas. We have the ability to move large volumes of feedstocks to that facility. We've got four pipelines from Mont Belvieu with ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline that can feed the petchem facility.  And as I just mentioned, there's a lot of belief over the next 5 or 10 years by some, that there's going to be an issue of getting -- of finding a home for gasoline components, which would also feed -- or could be very good feedstocks for our petchem project. And then you add that to our ability to deliver to ethylene and propylene downstream of this project as well as the export markets, we couldn't be more excited.  This is a very unique world-class facility, and we have an extreme amount of interest. We are focused with one equity partner today, who's very interested in a significant portion of ownership and also a significant portion of takeaway capacity. They actually have assembled a very large team working with us. And at the appropriate time, we'll be able to talk more about it.  But yes, just like a lot of our projects, it is going to take time. It's a very unique cracker like nothing else in the world, not only because of what it can crack and what it can do, but also logistically with the advantages it has over any other crackers. So we're very excited about it, and we have a great team led by Raj and others working that project. And we do believe at some point in the road, we'll get to FID, but it is going to be down the roadways.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good afternoon. Just want to pick up with, I think, some of the comments towards the end there with regards to capital allocation priorities. And now that the leverage has come in a bit, just wondering how you balance, I guess, capital at this point, be it distribution growth seems like it's a focus there, but also kind of tuck-in M&A has been something that ET has done over time. And it seems like there might be larger industry consolidation of foot right now. At the same time, buybacks has been topical in the industry. So just wondering if you could kind of walk us through the latest thoughts on capital allocation?\nTom Long: Yes, Jeremy, this is Tom. Still a very, very good question. So I always appreciate it. As you know, we have focused on the debt. We're very, very obviously pleased to have it down into our 4 -- kind of 4.5 range kind of at the top of it. So we'll continue to look at moving down maybe towards the lower end of that like we mentioned in the prepared remarks. But moving on past the debt side, the balance sheet side of it, we're going to continue to focus on a lot of the projects that we've talked about here.  I know we've got a fantastic team that's coming up with a lot of really, really good investment opportunities that continue to expand the great footprint that we've built. And we're just very, very excited about a lot of these and excited about the returns that we're getting on them. So you're going to see us continue to do that. But the distribution growth is the other piece of it. Moving on to that one, where we've put out that guidance of 3% to 5%, and we feel very good each quarter as each quarter goes by is to where we are on that. So we're going to continue to allocate toward that. The unit buybacks still remain on the radar screen. But I will say that right now, we're continuing to focus on investing in the company as well as the balance sheet and of course, the distribution growth to given back to our equities. But I do want to go ahead and expand a little bit on one other item you brought up in there, and that was the M&A side of it. We do still remain very optimistic that you're going to see consolidation in the midstream space, and that's something that we feel like we're very, very good at. You can see from all the acquisitions that we've done, we can always make them very accretive. And they've got us to where we are today as well as within the organic growth projects that come along with each one of these. So we're going to continue to stay very focused on that side of it and allocate a lot of time toward that piece of it, too.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. And maybe picking up with that, some of the recent acquisitions, be it Lotus or even looking back at Enable, if you could kind of walk us through synergy capture, where it stands now versus expectations at that time? Just curious how things have materialized.\nTom Long: Okay. Listen, why don't you let me start with that a little bit, especially on the cost side. And then Mackie will -- he's got a lot of great things to talk about there. So if you look at really both of those, and we'll start with the Enable one. That one just continues to exceed anything that we ever expected on that. So even if you go back to the S4 and you look at what forecast we had in there, we're significantly higher, a good probably 40% or 50% higher than what we were anticipating. And a lot of that was -- some of that was cost synergies, but there was a lot of commercial synergies that are now we're seeing every day as we continue to work through that. And once again, Mackie will expand on that. But I'll comment a little bit on the Lotus. Obviously staying disciplined the same way we did with Enable as to what we're transacting on these acquisitions, at what level we're transacting at. They work for us. They're accretive, and they're deleveraging. And likewise, on that one, we have achieved every bit of the cost savings that we were anticipating on that. But likewise, that one is still new. We just closed in May, but we're still seeing a lot of opportunities on that one also. And Mackie, I'll hand off if you want to add anything more on the commercial side on both of those.\nMackie McCrea: Okay. Yes. Chris Hefty and his team have done an unbelievable job. Those acquisitions that Tom just talked about have been incredible. Tom hit on a little bit, Enable. We keep finding things. We were able to move volumes out of Louisiana to Enable down to some of our East Texas assets and just a lot of things that we're finding that are very beneficial. Our WEX acquisition, it is what it is. We bought it at a great multiple, and it's proven out at that multiple or better. So we're very pleased with that one. And then Lotus, gosh, we've just closed it in our crude team gets excited every week about something new. Some new routes, some new blending opportunities, some new additions that we can add to move more throughput on some areas we didn't think about. So as I just mentioned, what great acquisitions that will end up paying off a lot more than we anticipated when we purchased them.\nTom Long: And Jeremy, I'd like to just add real quick. When you have the very, very strong talent we do internally, the more tools you can provide to them, it is just truly amazing what we find out of each one of these.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Reynolds from UBS. Please go ahead. \nBrian Reynolds: Hi, good afternoon everyone. Maybe to start off on the long-term annual capital run rate, growth CapEx run rate of $2 billion to $3 billion. I was curious if you could just touch a little bit more perhaps on what these projects could look like, differentiating between perhaps traditional midstream-based business opportunities versus some of these low carbon opportunities that you discussed, LNG, CCUS transport and ammonia? Thanks.\nMackie McCrea: Okay. It's Mackie again. Yes, we've got a lot of things already in the works that we've already got FID on. We're moving forward on. And then as we've talked about some of these and there's a lot of other opportunities that we're chasing, we certainly are looking at some renewable opportunities. For example, CapturePoint. As we talked about in the opening remarks, it will be a great project for us, not just because it will be transporting, sequestering CO2, but it also helps us with our upstream contracts on treating and transportation.  So there's added benefits to that. And then some of the other projects that we're looking at will also be contributors. But from a capital perspective, it will be pretty minimal compared to a lot of these other projects that we're working on that we've already committed to and a lot of the ones that we think will get to FID over the coming six months and 12-month period.\nTom Long: And the only other thing I would add to this, as you know, we do continue to work or look at and spend more time on more of these downstream projects like what Mackie has mentioned. But we are spending some time on the international front likewise in looking at various projects.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Thanks. And maybe to follow up on Lake Charles LNG. A lot of HOAs signed during the quarter were some notable E&P counterparties that have previously voiced interest in equity ownership in an LNG facility. So just given the tight existing time line that you currently have with the DOE, I was just kind of curious if there's any change in tone or capital structure in your view for Lake Charles in terms of appetite for ET to perhaps own incremental equity and ownership perhaps than a few months ago, just given the fast pace of HOAs that have been signed over the past few weeks. Thanks.\nMackie McCrea: Yes, this is Mackie. No, nothing has really changed there. We kind of have a target of around 25% of equity ownership. That hasn't changed. We won't really talk about who the equity partners potentially are. I mentioned a few without naming them, but yes, there's more than that. There are some producers that expressed interest. And so there's a wide range. As we kind of consummate some of the bigger equity commitments, then we'll go to whatever remaining commitments that we need to attain that kind of 75% of partners in the project. So, nothing has changed as far as our strategy around Lake Charles.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein. Please go ahead. \nJean Ann Salisbury : I think you may have more exposure to lower gas price in your midstream segment than I had realized. Can you give any more color on how that exposure works? If there's floors? If you hedge out gas price? Is it as simple as if gas price goes back up next year, that segment will improve?\nTom Long: Yes. Jean Ann, this is Tom. The natural gas prices, that's correct, the sensitivity is there, especially in the midstream. But we want to make sure we add in there the ethane component that's included in there. So when you start looking at where those prices were, going on the liquid side, that likewise has rolled into that impact. And that's the reason even in our materials that we put out, we put in that kind of 5% to 10% of sensitivities related to commodity prices. We use spreads at 0 to kind of 5%. But you're seeing us really kind of stay in line with that. I do think it's worth noting that when you do get down to a certain level, that you are able to kind of have floors on some of the contracts that provide kind of a downside protection on these things. But once again, when you get with the whole decisions we make on all the processing we do, when to reject as far as ethane rejection goes and when we extract. But it's really based upon not just the natural gas prices, but the ethane prices also, liquids prices.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Got it. Okay. And then just the latest on the up sea [ph] potential. And if you've kind of had any interest from investors that count [ph] on MLPs that they'd be interested in the up sea?\nTom Long: Yes. No, you bet. We do continue to spend time on that and evaluate it. We haven't advanced it to market type studies or anything else. But we do have various discussions with banks, et cetera, on views on the market side of it. Where a lot of the time is really spent on the structuring also. We want to make sure that we get this thing structured in a way that is a win-win for all. So we're continuing to look at that. So it's clearly on the radar screen, something we're going to continue to move forward, move down the field, so to speak, and kind of come out at the right time that makes sense.\nOperator: The next question comes from Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nKeith Stanley : Hi, thank you. Maybe starting with Gulf Run and the compression expansion project. Can you talk to what customers are saying on the timing of needing more takeaway? And I guess, could that project move forward as soon as this year? Are the needs there that quickly? Or the Haynesville needs more time to recover?\nMackie McCrea: Yes, this is Mackie. No, we don't expect to get the FID on expansion on Gulf Run. As Tom said in the opening remarks, our team has done a great job of selling out the capacity by January of '25. As he mentioned, we're sold out on 1.65 Bcf on the Zone 2 portion of Gulf Run. But no, we'll remain in negotiations. A lot of that depends on some of the LNG facilities to get to FID. A lot of it will depend on some commitments that we're looking at further downstream on markets along the Gulf Coast, even as far away as Florida.  And then also, there's some producer push on a lot of that to get down to markets either off Trunkline or potentially even off FGT. So we're still a way away from that, but we'll remain discussions. And there's a great deal of interest to move more volume, of course, from the growing Haynesville and other areas down to the Gulf Coast.\nKeith Stanley: Okay. Great. And second question, I just wanted to follow up on the $2 billion to $3 billion long-term CapEx run rate. And it's obviously very manageable within cash flows for the company, but it's a little higher than what you've spent. You did $2 billion last year and targeting $2 billion for this year. So can you just give some big picture comments on why you'd expect CapEx to potentially go a little higher in the future? And does that reflect bigger projects? Does that reflect -- I think, Tom, you mentioned looking a little more at international, just how you're thinking about that and spending potentially going up a little?\nTom Long: You bet. And like I say, a very good question here on this. When you really look at the scale of Energy Transfer now, the size and then you start looking at all the projects that Mackie previously mentioned, with the existing footprint we have, but also continuing to move downstream with some of the other petchem international, so when you really start looking at all that, we do not have projects that are specifically identified within that.  This is a number that we're just using based upon the sheer size that we've become, start running over $13 billion a year. So don't have really a whole lot more description at this point, other than just kind of guiding you toward all the various projects that we have on the drawing board, so to speak.\nMackie McCrea: Let me add, if I could, one thing is that we are going to be pretty disappointed if we're not pushing against that $3 billion, because the projects that we're chasing are really good rates of return. And everything that we're chasing has synergistic revenues, not part of the IRRs, both upstream and downstream, in many cases. So from the standpoint, from a commercial perspective, I'm going to be disappointed if we -- if our team DOEsn't push closer to $3 billion or even more at the greatest return that we're targeting.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nMichael Blum: Thanks, good afternoon everyone. Yes, I wanted to ask about the recent really spike in ethane prices. There's definitely been some issues with processing efficiencies and fractionation facilities being impacted. So just wonder if you can just, a, were any of your facilities impacted by the extreme heat we've seen in the South? And then, b, should we think of this as an event that you probably benefited from? Or could this be a drag on Q3?\nMackie McCrea: Mike, this is Mackie. Yes, there's a lot of noise made around this that we're a little taking aback by because it really had zero impact on us. We're one of the only -- probably the only company in the U.S. that controls the vast majority of our frac products. So we remain long with everything. That's, of course, why we're expanding our export capabilities, et cetera. But we kind of dug into it. Actually, RVM had a pretty good article. You may be alluding to some of that. We believe it's a combination of a lot of things. What RVM mentioned was a little bit what you said. You have cryos that struggling with heat, production struggles in heat. We've seen pretty excessive heats -- I mean, temperatures. That's been 2% to 3% impact.  Frac struggle a little bit more, 5% to 7% of what we've kind of seen on matter or others have seen. There's also kind of a shortage of inventory since that's not really tracked. And some rumors got out that the inventories were really short. And so it's kind of a lot of those factors, but a number of companies, unlike us, that were rejecting. It takes some time to start recovering and figuring out a way to get that to Mont Belvieu.  So that took a few days. We also heard there were some crackers out there that were actually selling their ethane because prices have gotten so bad. So it was a pretty short-lived run-up in ethane prices. No impact on us whatsoever or our customers. And so it was just a kind of a conglomeration of a lot of different things that happened over a short period of time.\nMichael Blum: Okay. Good. No, that's helpful. And then I wanted to ask about LPG and ethane exports. It seems like your volumes are still very strong through the first half of the year. What are you expecting for the balance of the year on both LPG and ethane volumes? If you could just speak generally to what you're seeing in those end markets right now.\nMackie McCrea: Yes. It's Mackie here. As we look at the future and we look at the negotiations we have going on, we talked about this earlier today. We're in discussions with over 500,000 barrels of ethane demand potentially coming online in the next three or four years. Of that, there's probably 150 to 180 that's highly likely we will contract. So there's a huge demand for ethane. On the propane front, as everybody probably knows, there's a lot of PDHs being built. There's five or six already completed in China, and there's another -- a total of another about 12 more. So there's a lot of propane demand out there and a lot of propane being built. So we are very bullish, of course, that's why we're expanding as quickly as we can, very bullish on volumes increasing, especially at Nederland.  We'll always have a little pullback at the Marcus Hook. Because of location up there, a lot of those barrels stay locally, how we are able to take a lot of what flows and take it to much higher-priced market from a margin standpoint. But certainly in the South, we remain very optimistic. We're already seeing volumes stronger next month than we saw here in July. So we remain very bullish not only the next quarter or 2, but bullish long term.  There is a significant growth on really everything we do for natural gas liquids. And even gosh, we were talking about oil today. There was more oil consumed in the world last quarter than there've ever been. So the run away from oil and the slowdown oils happening. If anything, it's increasing. So that was a long-winded answer to we remain very bullish.\nMichael Blum: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Neel Mitra from Bank of America.\nNeel Mitra : First question, you obviously have some very capable upstream assets that can be expanded with Gulf Run and Trunkline. Are you looking at expanding those separately from the Lake Charles decision? In other words, if you were to twin those pipelines for other facilities, would you still be able to manage to get the gaps down to Lake Charles in an efficient way so that both sets of projects can work?\nMackie McCrea: Yes, this is Mackie again. Our team is looking to move as much gas through our pipeline network and expand our network to whatever markets there are. So yes, simultaneously with making sure that we will have the pipeline and volume support for LNG once it gets to FID. We also have teams working daily on delivering to other LNG facilities and to other markets everywhere, not only in the Gulf Coast, but where anybody is looking for gas. So yes, we'll continue to chase markets and look to expand the Gulf Run, Truckline, other assets to meet any demands that are out there that we end up contracting.\nNeel Mitra: Great. And then for the follow-up, just on your commentary around M&A, can you be a little bit more specific? Do you have a preference for asset packages versus corporate M&A? Any specific commodities? And then how would you look at your leverage profile? Would you look to go above 4.5 times temporarily if there was something that was attractive? Or would that be kind of the governor that you wouldn't want to exceed that from the very beginning?\nTom Long: Yes. Listen, when we look at these various transactions, whether it be on the company side or whether it be on an asset acquisition, either one of them, we always evaluate how the connectivity is to our current assets. And some of it could be moving maybe a little bit further downstream with value add. But a lot of it, we always evaluate as to the connectivity so that we can get more commercial synergies with the footprint we have. And when you start looking at this across all the commodities, natural gas, natural gas liquids and the crude oil, you can see how we've built the franchise here that we have and being able to take product from wellhead all the way through export facilities. So we're going to continue to look at them on that basis as to where the value comes in. So let's go to the metrics, which is the second part, which really relates to the first part of my question, too, on the answer that I just gave you on that piece of it. And that is the accretion piece of it. And that's how we're able to be able to go in with a lot of these and get the accretion is because of the connectivity and what we're able to do with the product all the way downstream. And so when we will kind of walk through these and evaluate them, we're careful. We're disciplined in how we look at these various commercial synergies, but we have a great team that is able to extract a lot at. But the other component, besides just accretion to a DCF per unit basis, is the leverage. That's the other piece of it. And you'll see, with the transactions we're doing, we will always evaluate these things as to what is the combination of equity and cash that we use. So we don't have intention of going back above from a leverage standpoint. And we think we've got a great currency to be able to work with here. But most importantly, we've got a great team that's able to go in and extract the value as we walk through the integration of our acquisitions.\nNeel Mitra: Okay, great. Thank you very much. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Long for any closing remarks.\nMackie McCrea: This is Mackie real quick before Tom closes out. I was thinking about, we're meeting with Bill Berg and our team kind of preparation for this. And they made some great points is that -- and everybody knows this, I believe. But Tom mentioned this earlier. We believe we have the best team running any midstream in the United States by far, and a lot of them are sitting in this room. We think we have the best base of business, a very strong base with record volumes in several segments every quarter.  We're delivering on the projects that we're building with Gulf Run and Gray Wolf at the end of last year. And then, of course, we just brought on Bear. We're having, once again with Chris Hefty's great efforts around M&A. We've got Lotus really kind of kicking in, and then we've got the frac going on.  That, combined with strong cash flow stability, our disciplined M&A strategy, we are incredibly well positioned for growth. So if you can't tell it in our voices, we are very excited about where we sit, the assets that we have throughout the country and what the future holds for our partnership and really for our industry. So we're pretty excited, if you can't tell in our voices.\nTom Long: No, I think that's a wrap, Mackie. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Long",
            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer's second quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, which we expect to file tomorrow August, the 3. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'd like to start today by going over our financial results for the second quarter of 2023. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.12 billion, compared to $3.23 billion for the second quarter of 2022. In our base business, we had strong performance from our operations, which delivered record volumes across our Intrastate and midstream segments, as well as through our NGL pipelines, and NGL and refined products terminals, including record NGL volumes exported out of our Nederland and Marcus Hook terminals.  Our volume growth was more than offset by significantly lower quarterly average natural gas and NGL prices, which declined 70% and 45% respectively over the second quarter of last year. DCF. Approval to the partners of Energy Transfer as adjusted was $1.55 billion, compared to $1.88 billion for the second quarter of 2022. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of $579 million.  On July 25, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.31 per common unit, or $1.24 on an annualized basis. This distribution represents an increase from $0.23 paid in the second quarter of 2022. We continue to target a 3% to 5% annual distribution growth rate, while balancing our leverage reduction, increasing equity returns and maintaining sufficient cash flow to invest and our incredible backlog of growth opportunities. As of June 30, 2023, the total available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities was approximately $2.36 billion.  Now turning to results by segment for the second quarter, I'll start with NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was $837 million, compared to $763 million for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to higher transportation, storage and terminal services margins related to increased volumes and higher rates, partially offsetting this with a $51 million negative impact, due to timing of the recognition of gains on hedged NGL inventory during the current period. We expect to fully realize the offsetting gains over the next two quarters. Adjusting for this non-cash timing matter around hedging, adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter would have been $888 million.  NGL transportation volumes on our wholly-owned and joint venture pipelines increased 13% to a record 2.2 million barrels per day, compared to 1.9 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes from the Permian region, and on our NGL pipelines that deliver into our Nederland terminal, as well as on the Mariner East pipeline system. Average fractionated volumes increased 5% to a record 989,000 barrels per day, compared to 938,000 barrels per day for the second quarter of 2022. For the month of April, throughput averaged over 1 million barrels per day, which was a new monthly record.  NGL export volumes grew 15% over the second quarter of 2022, driven by record NGL exports out of both our Nederland and Marcus Hook terminals. This was primarily driven by the second tranche of satellites contract going into effect on July 1, 2022, as well as increased international demand for natural gas liquids. Year-to-date, we have loaded more than 30 million barrels of ethane out of Nederland. And we are also exporting record volumes of ethane out of Marcus Hook. In total, we continue to export more NGLs than any other company and maintain approximately 20% market share of worldwide NGL exports as well as nearly 40% of U.S. exports.  For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $579 million, compared to $903 million for the second quarter of 2022. We saw record throughput as a result of growth in the majority of our operating regions. The strong volume growth was more than offset by significantly lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, as well as increased operating expenses. Gathered gas volumes increased 8% to 19.8 million MMBtus per day compared to 18.3 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year.  For our crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $674 million, compared to $562 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to higher volumes on several of our pipelines increased throughput at our Gulf Coast and Permian terminals, as well as the acquisition of the Lotus assets in May of this year. Crude oil transportation volumes were a record 5.3 million barrels per day, compared to 4.3 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This was a result of higher volumes on our Texas pipeline systems, the Bakken pipeline, and the Bayou bridge pipeline, as well as the acquisition of the Lotus assets in May of this year.  Excluding the Lotus assets, crude oil volumes were still up approximately 10% compared to the same period last year, which was also a record. Integration of the Lotus assets is going as planned, and we continue to discover additional commercial synergies that are in excess of our original forecast. In our interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $441 million, compared to $397 million for the second quarter of 2022.  This increase was primarily due to higher contracted volumes and rates on several of our wholly-owned and joint venture pipelines, as well as placing the Gulf Run pipeline into service in December of 2022. Volumes increased 17% over the same period last year due to the Gulf Run pipeline being placed into service, as well as higher utilization on many of our interstate pipelines, including Transwestern, Tiger, Pebble and Trunkline.  For our Intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $216 million, compared to $218 million in the second quarter of last year. Benefits from new contracts in Texas and the Haynesville as well as lower operating expenses were offset by decreases in retained fuel revenues resulting from lower natural gas prices, and fewer pipeline optimization opportunities. Utilization on our EOIT and rig systems increased due to higher demand for gas takeaway, and increased production in the Haynesville Shale.  Now turning to our growth projects, and we'll start with our Lake Charles LNG project. In May of 2022, we received an extension from FERC of the deadline for the completion of the construction of Lake Charles LNG facility to December of 2028. And in June 2022, we applied to the DOE for an extension of the DOEs deadline for the commencement of exports. As many of you are now aware, in April of this year, the DOD denied our request for this extension, and in June, the DOE denied our request for rehearing of this decision.  We have had discussions with the DOE subsequent to this decision and we believe the best path forward with the DOE is to file an application for a new export authorization. We expect to file this application in August and during the DOEs review of this application, we intend to continue to work with our existing customers, prospective equity investors and other stakeholders to progress the development of this project.  In this regard in July, we entered into three non-binding HOAs related to the long term LNG offtake from this project for an aggregate of 3.6 million metric tons per annum. One of the HOAs is with Chesapeake and Gunvor for 1 million metric tons per annum. A second HOA is with EQT for 1 million metric tonnes per annum. And the third HOA is with a Japanese customer for 1.6 metric tons per annum. The HOAs are subject to negotiation and execution of definitive agreements.  Now turning to our Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals. These terminals continue to benefit from increased demand both in the U.S. as well as from international customers. We remain bullish that there will be significant long term growth in international demand for ethane and LPG products, as we are well positioned to benefit from that demand. Last quarter, we FID-ed an expansion to our NGL export capacity at Nederland in order to address this demand.  We expect this expansion which is projected to cost approximately $1.25 billion to add up to 250,000 barrels per day of export capacity. This project is expected to be in service in mid-2025, and will give us flexibility to load various products based on based upon customer demand. We look forward to providing more specifics on this expansion in the near future.  We also continue to pursue FID on an optimization project at our Marcus Hook terminal that would add incremental ethane refrigeration and storage capacity. At Mont Belview, we expect frac 8 to be mechanically complete in the next couple of weeks, which would put it into full service around September the first. This addition will bring our total Mont Belview fractionation capacity to over 1.1 5 million barrels per day.  Out in the Delaware basin, we placed our 200 million cubic foot per day Grey Wolf processing plant into service in December of 2022. And in June, we placed the Bear plant into service, which is our eighth 200 million cubic foot per day processing plant in the Delaware basin. These plants are supported by new commitments and growth from our existing customers. In addition, we continue to evaluate the necessity and potential timing of adding another processing plant in the Permian Basin. Turning to the Gulf Run pipeline, which we placed into service in December of 2022. Gulf Run provides natural gas transportation between our upstream pipeline network and from the Haynesville shale for delivery to the Gulf Coast, connecting some of the most prolific natural gas-producing regions in the United States with the LNG export market as well as many markets along the Gulf Coast. We continue to utilize a significant portion of Zone 1 capacity on Gulf Run. And during the second quarter, we added additional long-term customer volume commitments through Zone 2, which are being delivered into our Trunkline Pipeline. We have very limited available capacity in the near term and are fully subscribed beginning January of 2025. As a result, we are in discussions to add approximately 1 Bcf of capacity via compression, which will require minimal capital investment. Depending on demand, we also have the ability to loop the system to another approximately 2 Bcf of capacity. On the alternative energy front, we continue to make progress on our carbon capture and storage project with Capture Point that is related to our North Louisiana treating plants. An application for a Class 6 permit for this sequestration site was followed by Capture Point with the EPA in June of last year. Also we are working with Oxy related to its Magnolia hub in Allen Parish, Louisiana, North of the Lake Charles Industrial Complex. We are working together to obtain long-term commitments of CO2 from industrial customers in the Lake Charles, Louisiana area. If this project reaches FID, Energy Transfer would construct a CO2 pipeline to connect the customers to Oxy sequestration site in Allen Parish, Louisiana. We are also continuing to have discussions with third parties related to the development of ammonia facilities at sites along the Gulf Coast, where we have docks with Deepwater access. Now looking at our growth capital spend for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Energy Transfer spent $794 million on organic growth projects, primarily in the midstream, NGL and refined products and interstate segments, excluding Sun and USA compression CapEx. For full year 2023, we continue to expect growth capital expenditures to be approximately $2 billion, which will be spent primarily in the midstream, NGL refined products, interstate and crude segments. As a reminder, this capital outlook includes the NGL export expansion projects at Nederland as well as expenditures related to the Lotus acquisition. A significant amount of our 2023 growth capital spend is comprised of projects that are already online or are expected to be online and contributing cash flow before the end of this year at very attractive returns, including Frac A, the Bear processing plant and new treating capacity in the Haynesville. Additionally, we continue to evaluate a number of other potential growth projects that we hope to bring to FID. As we look forward to this potential backlog of high-returning growth projects, we now expect our long-term annual growth capital run rate to be approximately $2 billion to $3 billion. Now for our adjusted EBITDA guidance. As we get further into the year, we now expect our 2023 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $13.1 billion to $13.4 billion, which slightly tightens our range while keeping the midpoint the same. As a reminder, with the current forward curve for commodity prices and spreads, our guidance does not assume the same upside benefits from pricing and spreads that we experienced in 2022. Our base business continues to perform well, generating strong volumes and providing stable cash flows, which demonstrates our ability to operate through a volatile macro environment. We remain bullish about the future of our industry and the growing worldwide demand for all of our products, and our assets are strategically positioned to take advantage of new growth opportunities to meet this demand. As such, we continue to pursue strategic optimization and expansion projects that enhance our existing asset base and generate attractive returns. Our financial position remains strong. And we remain committed to our targeted distribution growth rates and the lower end of our leverage target, which we continue to balance while maintaining significant free cash flow for growth. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the lineup for our first question. Yes, Jeremy, this is Tom. Still a very, very good question. So I always appreciate it. As you know, we have focused on the debt. We're very, very obviously pleased to have it down into our 4 -- kind of 4.5 range kind of at the top of it. So we'll continue to look at moving down maybe towards the lower end of that like we mentioned in the prepared remarks. But moving on past the debt side, the balance sheet side of it, we're going to continue to focus on a lot of the projects that we've talked about here.  I know we've got a fantastic team that's coming up with a lot of really, really good investment opportunities that continue to expand the great footprint that we've built. And we're just very, very excited about a lot of these and excited about the returns that we're getting on them. So you're going to see us continue to do that. But the distribution growth is the other piece of it. Moving on to that one, where we've put out that guidance of 3% to 5%, and we feel very good each quarter as each quarter goes by is to where we are on that. So we're going to continue to allocate toward that. The unit buybacks still remain on the radar screen. But I will say that right now, we're continuing to focus on investing in the company as well as the balance sheet and of course, the distribution growth to given back to our equities. But I do want to go ahead and expand a little bit on one other item you brought up in there, and that was the M&A side of it. We do still remain very optimistic that you're going to see consolidation in the midstream space, and that's something that we feel like we're very, very good at. You can see from all the acquisitions that we've done, we can always make them very accretive. And they've got us to where we are today as well as within the organic growth projects that come along with each one of these. So we're going to continue to stay very focused on that side of it and allocate a lot of time toward that piece of it, too. Okay. Listen, why don't you let me start with that a little bit, especially on the cost side. And then Mackie will -- he's got a lot of great things to talk about there. So if you look at really both of those, and we'll start with the Enable one. That one just continues to exceed anything that we ever expected on that. So even if you go back to the S4 and you look at what forecast we had in there, we're significantly higher, a good probably 40% or 50% higher than what we were anticipating. And a lot of that was -- some of that was cost synergies, but there was a lot of commercial synergies that are now we're seeing every day as we continue to work through that. And once again, Mackie will expand on that. But I'll comment a little bit on the Lotus. Obviously staying disciplined the same way we did with Enable as to what we're transacting on these acquisitions, at what level we're transacting at. They work for us. They're accretive, and they're deleveraging. And likewise, on that one, we have achieved every bit of the cost savings that we were anticipating on that. But likewise, that one is still new. We just closed in May, but we're still seeing a lot of opportunities on that one also. And Mackie, I'll hand off if you want to add anything more on the commercial side on both of those. And Jeremy, I'd like to just add real quick. When you have the very, very strong talent we do internally, the more tools you can provide to them, it is just truly amazing what we find out of each one of these. And the only other thing I would add to this, as you know, we do continue to work or look at and spend more time on more of these downstream projects like what Mackie has mentioned. But we are spending some time on the international front likewise in looking at various projects. Yes. Jean Ann, this is Tom. The natural gas prices, that's correct, the sensitivity is there, especially in the midstream. But we want to make sure we add in there the ethane component that's included in there. So when you start looking at where those prices were, going on the liquid side, that likewise has rolled into that impact. And that's the reason even in our materials that we put out, we put in that kind of 5% to 10% of sensitivities related to commodity prices. We use spreads at 0 to kind of 5%. But you're seeing us really kind of stay in line with that. I do think it's worth noting that when you do get down to a certain level, that you are able to kind of have floors on some of the contracts that provide kind of a downside protection on these things. But once again, when you get with the whole decisions we make on all the processing we do, when to reject as far as ethane rejection goes and when we extract. But it's really based upon not just the natural gas prices, but the ethane prices also, liquids prices. Yes. No, you bet. We do continue to spend time on that and evaluate it. We haven't advanced it to market type studies or anything else. But we do have various discussions with banks, et cetera, on views on the market side of it. Where a lot of the time is really spent on the structuring also. We want to make sure that we get this thing structured in a way that is a win-win for all. So we're continuing to look at that. So it's clearly on the radar screen, something we're going to continue to move forward, move down the field, so to speak, and kind of come out at the right time that makes sense. You bet. And like I say, a very good question here on this. When you really look at the scale of Energy Transfer now, the size and then you start looking at all the projects that Mackie previously mentioned, with the existing footprint we have, but also continuing to move downstream with some of the other petchem international, so when you really start looking at all that, we do not have projects that are specifically identified within that.  This is a number that we're just using based upon the sheer size that we've become, start running over $13 billion a year. So don't have really a whole lot more description at this point, other than just kind of guiding you toward all the various projects that we have on the drawing board, so to speak. Yes. Listen, when we look at these various transactions, whether it be on the company side or whether it be on an asset acquisition, either one of them, we always evaluate how the connectivity is to our current assets. And some of it could be moving maybe a little bit further downstream with value add. But a lot of it, we always evaluate as to the connectivity so that we can get more commercial synergies with the footprint we have. And when you start looking at this across all the commodities, natural gas, natural gas liquids and the crude oil, you can see how we've built the franchise here that we have and being able to take product from wellhead all the way through export facilities. So we're going to continue to look at them on that basis as to where the value comes in. So let's go to the metrics, which is the second part, which really relates to the first part of my question, too, on the answer that I just gave you on that piece of it. And that is the accretion piece of it. And that's how we're able to be able to go in with a lot of these and get the accretion is because of the connectivity and what we're able to do with the product all the way downstream. And so when we will kind of walk through these and evaluate them, we're careful. We're disciplined in how we look at these various commercial synergies, but we have a great team that is able to extract a lot at. But the other component, besides just accretion to a DCF per unit basis, is the leverage. That's the other piece of it. And you'll see, with the transactions we're doing, we will always evaluate these things as to what is the combination of equity and cash that we use. So we don't have intention of going back above from a leverage standpoint. And we think we've got a great currency to be able to work with here. But most importantly, we've got a great team that's able to go in and extract the value as we walk through the integration of our acquisitions. No, I think that's a wrap, Mackie. Thank you. Appreciate it."

            "content": "Yes, this is Mackie. Let me start, and Tom may add to it. Yes, for confidentiality reasons, we can't talk about who our equity partners. Maybe we can say that we have two very significant partners at a minimum, one that is one to step up for a large amount of the equity as well as a lot of the offtake. And I'll just make a quick comment. We've worked pretty hard on this project. We slowed down during the pandemic. Mason and his team did a great job picking this back up when Ukraine war started. We had tremendous momentum, signed up a lot, 8 million or 9 million tonnes developed relationships all around the world, really good relationships.  A lot of those folks I've met over the last three or four months that really believe in our project, and then lowering the whole DOE cut the legs out from under us kind of by surprise without us even expecting it. So we kind of read gearing. We've spent a great deal of time with the DOE over the last several weeks. We have a real important meeting next week with them. And we're being optimistic that they'll work with us to exponentially go down this new path that we're going down to try to get an export authorization approved by them.  But in the meantime, as Tom said, we are continuing to work with not only existing customers, but with new customers. And as I said, we have some equity partners that really believe in this project, and we'll be excited to have them part of the team as we work diligently towards FID. Yes, I'll give a little background first. So we're talking about that earlier today. Nederland is such a gem for any partnership, but especially for ours. If you look at what sits at Nederland, in all of our connectivity to all the refineries, we actually are connected to over 25% of refining capacity from that area in South Texas. We have the ability to move large volumes of feedstocks to that facility. We've got four pipelines from Mont Belvieu with ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline that can feed the petchem facility.  And as I just mentioned, there's a lot of belief over the next 5 or 10 years by some, that there's going to be an issue of getting -- of finding a home for gasoline components, which would also feed -- or could be very good feedstocks for our petchem project. And then you add that to our ability to deliver to ethylene and propylene downstream of this project as well as the export markets, we couldn't be more excited.  This is a very unique world-class facility, and we have an extreme amount of interest. We are focused with one equity partner today, who's very interested in a significant portion of ownership and also a significant portion of takeaway capacity. They actually have assembled a very large team working with us. And at the appropriate time, we'll be able to talk more about it.  But yes, just like a lot of our projects, it is going to take time. It's a very unique cracker like nothing else in the world, not only because of what it can crack and what it can do, but also logistically with the advantages it has over any other crackers. So we're very excited about it, and we have a great team led by Raj and others working that project. And we do believe at some point in the road, we'll get to FID, but it is going to be down the roadways. Okay. Yes. Chris Hefty and his team have done an unbelievable job. Those acquisitions that Tom just talked about have been incredible. Tom hit on a little bit, Enable. We keep finding things. We were able to move volumes out of Louisiana to Enable down to some of our East Texas assets and just a lot of things that we're finding that are very beneficial. Our WEX acquisition, it is what it is. We bought it at a great multiple, and it's proven out at that multiple or better. So we're very pleased with that one. And then Lotus, gosh, we've just closed it in our crude team gets excited every week about something new. Some new routes, some new blending opportunities, some new additions that we can add to move more throughput on some areas we didn't think about. So as I just mentioned, what great acquisitions that will end up paying off a lot more than we anticipated when we purchased them. Okay. It's Mackie again. Yes, we've got a lot of things already in the works that we've already got FID on. We're moving forward on. And then as we've talked about some of these and there's a lot of other opportunities that we're chasing, we certainly are looking at some renewable opportunities. For example, CapturePoint. As we talked about in the opening remarks, it will be a great project for us, not just because it will be transporting, sequestering CO2, but it also helps us with our upstream contracts on treating and transportation.  So there's added benefits to that. And then some of the other projects that we're looking at will also be contributors. But from a capital perspective, it will be pretty minimal compared to a lot of these other projects that we're working on that we've already committed to and a lot of the ones that we think will get to FID over the coming six months and 12-month period. Yes, this is Mackie. No, nothing has really changed there. We kind of have a target of around 25% of equity ownership. That hasn't changed. We won't really talk about who the equity partners potentially are. I mentioned a few without naming them, but yes, there's more than that. There are some producers that expressed interest. And so there's a wide range. As we kind of consummate some of the bigger equity commitments, then we'll go to whatever remaining commitments that we need to attain that kind of 75% of partners in the project. So, nothing has changed as far as our strategy around Lake Charles. Yes, this is Mackie. No, we don't expect to get the FID on expansion on Gulf Run. As Tom said in the opening remarks, our team has done a great job of selling out the capacity by January of '25. As he mentioned, we're sold out on 1.65 Bcf on the Zone 2 portion of Gulf Run. But no, we'll remain in negotiations. A lot of that depends on some of the LNG facilities to get to FID. A lot of it will depend on some commitments that we're looking at further downstream on markets along the Gulf Coast, even as far away as Florida.  And then also, there's some producer push on a lot of that to get down to markets either off Trunkline or potentially even off FGT. So we're still a way away from that, but we'll remain discussions. And there's a great deal of interest to move more volume, of course, from the growing Haynesville and other areas down to the Gulf Coast. Let me add, if I could, one thing is that we are going to be pretty disappointed if we're not pushing against that $3 billion, because the projects that we're chasing are really good rates of return. And everything that we're chasing has synergistic revenues, not part of the IRRs, both upstream and downstream, in many cases. So from the standpoint, from a commercial perspective, I'm going to be disappointed if we -- if our team DOEsn't push closer to $3 billion or even more at the greatest return that we're targeting. Mike, this is Mackie. Yes, there's a lot of noise made around this that we're a little taking aback by because it really had zero impact on us. We're one of the only -- probably the only company in the U.S. that controls the vast majority of our frac products. So we remain long with everything. That's, of course, why we're expanding our export capabilities, et cetera. But we kind of dug into it. Actually, RVM had a pretty good article. You may be alluding to some of that. We believe it's a combination of a lot of things. What RVM mentioned was a little bit what you said. You have cryos that struggling with heat, production struggles in heat. We've seen pretty excessive heats -- I mean, temperatures. That's been 2% to 3% impact.  Frac struggle a little bit more, 5% to 7% of what we've kind of seen on matter or others have seen. There's also kind of a shortage of inventory since that's not really tracked. And some rumors got out that the inventories were really short. And so it's kind of a lot of those factors, but a number of companies, unlike us, that were rejecting. It takes some time to start recovering and figuring out a way to get that to Mont Belvieu.  So that took a few days. We also heard there were some crackers out there that were actually selling their ethane because prices have gotten so bad. So it was a pretty short-lived run-up in ethane prices. No impact on us whatsoever or our customers. And so it was just a kind of a conglomeration of a lot of different things that happened over a short period of time. Yes. It's Mackie here. As we look at the future and we look at the negotiations we have going on, we talked about this earlier today. We're in discussions with over 500,000 barrels of ethane demand potentially coming online in the next three or four years. Of that, there's probably 150 to 180 that's highly likely we will contract. So there's a huge demand for ethane. On the propane front, as everybody probably knows, there's a lot of PDHs being built. There's five or six already completed in China, and there's another -- a total of another about 12 more. So there's a lot of propane demand out there and a lot of propane being built. So we are very bullish, of course, that's why we're expanding as quickly as we can, very bullish on volumes increasing, especially at Nederland.  We'll always have a little pullback at the Marcus Hook. Because of location up there, a lot of those barrels stay locally, how we are able to take a lot of what flows and take it to much higher-priced market from a margin standpoint. But certainly in the South, we remain very optimistic. We're already seeing volumes stronger next month than we saw here in July. So we remain very bullish not only the next quarter or 2, but bullish long term.  There is a significant growth on really everything we do for natural gas liquids. And even gosh, we were talking about oil today. There was more oil consumed in the world last quarter than there've ever been. So the run away from oil and the slowdown oils happening. If anything, it's increasing. So that was a long-winded answer to we remain very bullish. Yes, this is Mackie again. Our team is looking to move as much gas through our pipeline network and expand our network to whatever markets there are. So yes, simultaneously with making sure that we will have the pipeline and volume support for LNG once it gets to FID. We also have teams working daily on delivering to other LNG facilities and to other markets everywhere, not only in the Gulf Coast, but where anybody is looking for gas. So yes, we'll continue to chase markets and look to expand the Gulf Run, Truckline, other assets to meet any demands that are out there that we end up contracting. This is Mackie real quick before Tom closes out. I was thinking about, we're meeting with Bill Berg and our team kind of preparation for this. And they made some great points is that -- and everybody knows this, I believe. But Tom mentioned this earlier. We believe we have the best team running any midstream in the United States by far, and a lot of them are sitting in this room. We think we have the best base of business, a very strong base with record volumes in several segments every quarter.  We're delivering on the projects that we're building with Gulf Run and Gray Wolf at the end of last year. And then, of course, we just brought on Bear. We're having, once again with Chris Hefty's great efforts around M&A. We've got Lotus really kind of kicking in, and then we've got the frac going on.  That, combined with strong cash flow stability, our disciplined M&A strategy, we are incredibly well positioned for growth. So if you can't tell it in our voices, we are very excited about where we sit, the assets that we have throughout the country and what the future holds for our partnership and really for our industry. So we're pretty excited, if you can't tell in our voices."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded. And now, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host today, Tom Long. Sir, please go ahead.\nTom Long: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer first quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, which we expect to file this Thursday, May 4. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'd like to start today by going over our financial results. We were pleased with our results for the first quarter of 2023, during which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.43 billion, which was up from $3.34 billion for the first quarter of 2022. Results for the first quarter benefited from record volumes across our interstate and midstream segments, as well as through our NGL pipelines and NGL and refined products terminals, which included a record amount of LPGs exported out of our Nederland terminal and a record amount of ethane exported out of both Netherlands and Marcus Hook terminals during the quarter. DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, was $2.01 billion compared to $2.08 billion for the first quarter of 2022. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of $1.04 billion. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of $640 million after distributions of $967 million and growth capital of $407 million. On April 26, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.3075 per common unit or $1.23 on an annualized basis. This distribution represents an increase from $0.3050 per common unit paid for the fourth quarter of 2022. Although we cannot guarantee future performance, we expect to make ongoing quarterly increases to our common unit distribution of a $0.0025 on a quarterly basis or $0.01 on an annualized basis and we are now targeting 3% to 5% annual distribution growth rate. This targeted growth rate allows us to provide some clarity to our equity holders on future distributions. We continue to balance our leverage reduction and increasing equity returns, all while maintaining sufficient cash flow to invest in our incredible backlog of growth opportunities. Inclusive of the targeted distribution growth rate, we still expect to be at the lower end of our 4 times to 4.5 times leverage ratio target range going forward based on our calculation of the rating agencies' leverage ratios. As of March 31, 2023, the total available liquidity under our revolving credit facility was approximately $3.01 billion. Now turning to results by segment for the first quarter, I'll start with NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was $939 million compared to $700 million for the same period last year. This change was primarily due to higher margins from transportation, fractionation, storage and terminal services, as well as an increase in northeast blending and optimization. Also included in the increase was approximately $50 million from the recognition of gains on hedged NGL inventory, which is primarily related to the physical loss recorded in the third quarter of last year. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines increased 13% to a record 2 million barrels per day compared to 1.8 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes from the Permian region and our Mariner East Pipeline System, as well as on our NGL pipelines that deliver into our Nederland Terminal. Average fractionated volumes increased 18% to an average 949,000 barrels per day compared to 804,000 barrels per day for the first quarter of 2022. NGL export volumes grew more than 20% over the first quarter of 2022, driven by record ethane and LPG exports out of our Nederland Terminal as well as record ethane exports out of the Marcus Hook Terminal. This was primarily driven by the second tranche of satellite's contract going into effect on July 1, as well as increased international demand for natural gas liquids. In the first quarter, we loaded more than 14 million barrels of ethane out of Nederland. In total, we continue to export more NGL than any other company or country with our percentage of worldwide NGL exports remaining at approximately 20% of the global market. For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $641 million compared to $807 million for the first quarter 2022. This was primarily due to the lower natural gas and NGL prices, as well as increased operating expenses, which were partially offset by increased throughput in all of our operating regions. In addition, the first quarter of 2023 included a onetime positive adjustment of approximately $40 million. Gathered gas volumes increased 14% to a record 19.8 million MMBtus per day compared to 17.3 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year. For the crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $526 million compared to $593 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to lower volumes on the Bakken Pipeline and lower optimization gains compared to the first quarter of 2022. The reduction in optimization was entirely attributable to the timing differences between physical and financial settlements. We expect to recognize $25 million gain in the second quarter related to this activity. In addition, the first quarter of 2023 included a onetime negative adjustment of approximately $35 million. These were partially offset by higher throughput on several of our pipeline systems and higher export demand. Crude oil transportation volumes were 4.24 million barrels per day compared to 4.22 million barrel per day for the same period last year. This was a result of higher volumes on our Texas pipeline systems and the Bayou Bridge pipeline, as well as placing the Ted Collins Link pipeline into service in the second quarter of 2022, which were offset by lower volumes on the Bakken Pipeline as a result of weather-related production impacts. In the Interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $536 million compared to $453 million for the first quarter of 2022. This was due to increased transportation revenue related to higher contracted volumes and rates on several of our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines, as well as placing the Gulf Run Pipeline into service in December of 2022. Volumes increased 11% over the same period last year due to the Gulf Run pipeline being placed into service, as well as higher utilization on many of our Interstate pipelines, including Transwestern, Pebble, Trunkline, MEP and SESH. And for our Intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $409 million compared to $444 million in the first quarter of last year. This was due to lower pipeline optimization opportunities and decreased retained fuel revenues related to lower natural gas prices, which were partially offset by increased storage optimization opportunities and higher fees on assets in the Haynesville and Oklahoma. Utilization on our EOIT, HPL and Rig Systems increased due to higher demand from gas takeaway from growing production in a number of our operating basins. Looking briefly at recent developments, we are excited about the closing of our acquisition of Lotus Midstream for approximately $900 million in cash and 44.5 million Energy Transfer common units. Lotus owns and operates [Centurion] (ph) Pipeline, a fully integrated crude pipeline terminal system in the Permian Basin. This acquisition will enhance Energy Transfer's crude pipeline footprint across the Permian Basin with the addition of approximately 3,000 miles of crude gathering and transportation lines that extend from Southeast Mexico to Cushing, Oklahoma. In addition, the assets provide direct access to other major hubs including Midland, Colorado City, Wink and Crane, and will increase our storage capacity at Midland by approximately 2 million barrels per day. Now turning to our growth projects. I'll start with an update on our Lake Charles LNG project. In May 2022, we received an extension from FERC of the deadline for completion of the construction of Lake Charles LNG facility to December of 2028. And in June 2022, we applied to the Department of Energy. As many are now aware, on April 25, the Department of Energy denied our request for this extension. We strongly disagree with this decision and we plan to file an appeal with the DOE within 30 days of the DOE decision. Now turning to Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals. NGL demand both in the U.S. as well as from international customers continues to increase. We are bullish that there will be significant growth in the international demand for many years to come and we are well positioned to benefit from that demand. In order to address this growth, we have recently FID and expansion to our NGL export capacity at Nederland which we expect to add up to 250,000 barrels per day of export capacity. This expansion which is projected to cost approximately $1.25 billion will give us tremendous flexibility to load different products as well as new products based upon customer demand and market dynamics at the time. The expansion is expected to be in service in mid-2025. We look forward to providing more specifics on this expansion in the near future. We also continue to pursue an optimization project at our Marcus Hook Terminal would add incremental ethane refrigeration and storage capacity. Next at Mont Belvieu, fractionation throughput averaged over 1 million barrels per day for the month of April, which is a new monthly record. And we continue to expect frac eight to be in service in the third quarter of 2023. This addition will bring our total Mont Belvieu fractionation capacity to approximately $1.15 million barrels per day. And in the Delaware Basin, we placed our 200 million cubic foot per day Grey Wolf processing plant into service in December of 2022. As a reminder, this plant is supported by new commitments and growth from existing customer contracts. And construction continues on the Bear plant, our eighth 200 million cubic foot per day processing plant in the Delaware Basin. This plant remains on schedule to be in service in the second quarter of 2023. In addition, we continue to evaluate the necessity and potential time of adding another processing plant in the Permian Basin. Regarding Permian takeaway, we also completed modernization and debottlenecking work on our Oasis pipeline during the first quarter, which added at least an incremental 60,000 Mcf per day of takeaway capacity out of the Permian Basin. We also placed the Gulf Run pipeline into service in December of 2022. Gulf Run provides natural gas transportation between our upstream pipeline network and from the Haynesville, Shell for delivery to the Gulf Coast connecting some of the most prolific natural gas producing regions in the U.S. with the LNG export market, as well as many markets along the Gulf Coast. We were already utilizing a significant portion of Zone 1 capacity on Gulf Run and we have added additional customer commitments through Zone 2, which is being delivered into our trunk line pipeline. In addition to these ongoing projects, we continue to evaluate a number of other potential growth projects that over the long term could provide strong returns and significant upside to our business. We remain optimistic that we can bring these projects to FID and will share any significant updates on these potential projects at the appropriate time. One the Alternative Energy front, we continue to make progress on our carbon capture and storage project with CapturePoint that is related to our north Louisiana treating plants. A Class 6 permit for this sequestration site was filed by CapturePoint with the EPA in June of 2022. Also we recently executed a letter of intent with Oxy related to Oxy's Magnolia hub in Allen Parish, Louisiana, north of the Lake Charles Industrial Complex. Pursuant to the letter of intent, Energy Transfer and Oxy are working together to obtain long term commitments of CO2 from industrial customers in the Lake Charles, Louisiana area. If this project reaches FID, Energy Transfer would construct a CO2 pipeline to connect the customers in Oxy's sequestration site in Allan Parish, Louisiana. Now looking at our growth capital project for the first quarter ended March 31, 2023, Energy Transfer spent $407 million on organic growth projects, primarily in the midstream and NGL and Refined Products segment, excluding SUN and USA Compression CapEx. For full year 2023, we now expect growth capital expenditures to be approximately $2 billion, which will be spent primarily in the midstream, NGL and refined products and Interstate segments. This capital outlook has been updated to include the NGL export expansion project at Nederland, as well as the expenditures related to the Lotus acquisition. A significant amount of our 2023 growth capital spend is comprised of projects that are expected to be online and contributing cash flow before the end of 2023 at very attractive returns, including frac 8, the Bear processing plant and new treating capacity in the Haynesville. Now for our adjusted EBITDA guidance, we are updating our guidance to include EBITDA associated with the Lotus acquisition. As a result, we now expect our 2023 adjusted EBITDA to be between $13.05 billion and $13.45 billion. As a reminder, with the current forward curve for commodity prices and spreads, our guidance does not assume the same upside benefits from pricing and spreads that we experienced in 2022. Our base business continues to provide stable cash flows and demonstrates our ability to operate through various market cycles and we expect utilization in all of our core segments to increase. In addition, we continue to create opportunities for optimization and expansion driven by sustained domestic and international demand for our products and services. We remain bullish about the future of our industry and the growing worldwide demand for all of our products. As part of our capital allocation strategy, we will continue to look for new ways to address this demand through the pursuit of strategic growth projects that enhance our existing asset base and generate attractive returns. In addition, we will continue to place emphasis on strategically allocating cash flow in a manner that balances our targeted 3% to 5% annual distribution growth rate and our commitment to our 4 times to 4.5 times leverage target, all while maintaining significant free cash flow for growth. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line-up for our first question.\nOperator: Yes, thank you. At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks, everyone. I'm wondering if you can break down how much of the EBITDA guidance, the increase of $150 million. Is that due to Lotus versus just better performance in the base business?\nTom Long: Yeah. Michael, this is Tom. Majority of it clearly was the Lotus acquisition, but I will say with strong performance you saw in the first quarter, we were able to bump that up a little bit, but it's a smallest piece of the bump. So it's great to be able to continue to increase it and obviously very excited about the contribution of Lotus as we got that one closed in fairly short over. So\u2026\nMichael Blum: Great. And then just want to get a little more insight into the change in distribution policy. It seems like last quarter or certainly last few quarters you were thinking more once a year and now you're going to this quarterly distribution? And then can you talk a little bit about what would drive the range from between 3% and 5%? Thanks.\nTom Long: Yes, Michael, we clearly have very good discussions with our directors every quarter and you can hopefully translate from this the strength of our business and the ability to be able to continue to grow our distributions. And when we looked at it and had the discussion on it, we decided that we would just continue to bump on a quarterly basis. And the 3% to 5%, when you really kind of look out forecast, we all wish we had the perfect crystal ball. But we thought that was a good sustainable target to put in. But keep in mind, we will always continue to evaluate this distribution level on a quarterly basis. So maybe you'll be asking this question again as we get into the next quarter. But after good dialogue, I will say that it's great to be here and great to be in the position that we can see leverage coming down and all these growth opportunities in funding them at the same time to be able to grow distribution. So it's a great place to be.\nMichael Blum: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Reynolds with UBS.\nBrian Reynolds: Hi, good morning, everyone. Maybe as a follow-up to the guidance question, but maybe a focus on spread opportunities. On the last call, you kind of highlighted $400 million to $600 million of spread opportunities across the business. But now with the Lotus acquisition, you have a new market with future opportunities in the future. So kind of curious if you can just update us on just kind of base business spread opportunities for the balance of the year, particularly on the crude side? Thanks.\nMackie McCrea: Yes. This is Mackie. When you say spread opportunities, they're numerous depending on exactly what you're talking about.\nBrian Reynolds: I guess, just focus on the base business with nat gas opportunities and then in relation to Lotus as well just given new market opportunities?\nMackie McCrea: Okay. So around nat gas, there is another pipeline being built prior to that. We expect and anticipate the spreads across Texas to widen significantly. They really haven't yet even with Freeport coming back online. However, look at the growth out there, I think we hit 17.6 Bcf. So the growth just continues and we do expect those spreads to widen at least over the next year and a half till next pipeline project comes online. And then around the crude spreads, it's overbuilt -- the industry has overbuilt it. It's going to be that way for a little ways. But Lotus is such a great acquisition for us. We -- Chris Hefty and his team continue to create deals on -- with Enable and with [WEX and then with this project, we're so excited we can buy them to kind of multiples, we're buying and bringing all those barrels into our system will not help the spread, but certainly will help our revenue if we continue to keep our pipelines full across Texas.\nTom Long: And there's one thing to highlight, if you look at the slides that we posted out there, you noticed, we update the piece of the total pie on the sensitivities. It used to be 0% to 2.5% related to the spreads. We did take that up a little bit to 0% to 5%. So we have increased that a little bit. Not material when you compare it to the size of Energy Transfer, but it still is something that we did take up a little bit.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. I appreciate the incremental color. Maybe to just touch on growth CapEx. It seems like most of the raise is due to Lotus and then the Nederland NGL expansion announcement. Just given just recent peer announcements with the focus on exports, and just the opportunity set for Energy Transfer at both Marcus Hook and Nederland. Just kind of curious of how we should think about future projects, could Nederland be upsized or how are you thinking about Marcus Hook opportunities as well? Thanks.\nMackie McCrea: Yes, this is Mackie again. Could it be upsized? It's being upsized. And it needs to be upsized quicker than we can do it. The global demand for ethane and propane and butane is incredible. If you look at the PH (ph) facilities that are being built around the world over the next 12 to 18 months and also the growing demand for ethane, we are probably one of the most bullish companies in the industry where we think NGL process and demand will go over the next three years to five years, if not longer. So we have the tremendous capability both at Nederland and at Marcus Hook in expanding this expansion that we've talked about today. We're very excited about, we pretty much maxed out what we can do right now with our facilities. We\u2019re moving as quickly as we can to get these built. They should be service by the middle of 2025. We've already secured a number of contracts -- long-term contracts and we have an enormous base load of customers that we're negotiating with and very excited about that. And as we've always advertised, we're the only company that can export both in the Gulf Coast and also Middle East. And so ultimately, we also anticipate that we will be expanding at Marcus Hook, our ethane capabilities -- exporting more ethane. And so, we have set this up in such a way that we can source ethane out of Nederland. And once we are able to secure enough ethane in the Northeast, we can move those customers up to our Marcus Hook facility and then reload new customers into Nederland. So we feel very blessed, I guess, for having these assets and our ability to meet the world demand for these growing products.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. I appreciate all the color. I'll leave it there. Enjoy rest of your afternoon. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Hi. Putting aside the denial of the Lake Charles' extension, I just wanted to get an update on the contracting and EPC environment, it sounds extremely competitive out there?\nTom Long: Yes, we anticipated a question around LNG. So I'm going to make a little broader statement than your question, if you don't mind, and that may help on some potential other questions. People have asked us how do we feel? What's our thoughts and what happened 10 days ago? And a lot of adjective and things that we said, I can't say on this call, but I can't say things like upset and frustrated and shocked and surprise. But at the end of the day, it was just wrong. It was wrong and it was political. And what also was wrong is what's happened over in Europe and really in the U.S. And that really came to fruition here this past year when Russia attacked Ukraine and everybody now is not denying the need for natural gas, not for five to 10 years, but for 25, 30, 40 years. And everybody knows that and thank goodness for a warm winter [indiscernible] catastrophic both economically and from a human standpoint. So we jumped to Lake Charles, we've been working on Lake Charles for a number of years. We've spent over $200 million. We have worked our tails off to try to get this project online. Then the pandemic hit, that slowed us down significantly. And then, of course, as I just mentioned Russia attacked Ukraine. It flipped to $180 million and all of a sudden everybody woke up and the demand has increased astronomically. And we beefed up our team. We began traveling throughout the world throughout Asia and Europe. We've done that consistently over the last year. We immediately asked for an extension from FERC. They gave us that extension, May of last year. We then asked the DOE in June of last year for an extension. We are in negotiations to your question as we speak with over 20 million tons of additional customers on top of what we've already signed up. We have significant equity players that we're in negotiations with. And for months, we've been given every indication that the DOE would approve our extension. And then low and behold, here recently, they've come out and said that because of a new policy, they are not going to extend our request. And they've cited the lack of progress. So here's the DOE citing the lack of progress. They have not asked us onetime over the last year how we progress it. They don't know if we're out there right now of building facilities. We already have four tanks built. We already have a dock built. It's a brownfield unlike some of our competitors. And so it needless to say a little frustrated. Additionally, we've had one customer come to us after we heard that 10 days ago and said they'll go another direction at least for now. And we think it's extremely important to reverse this decision as quickly as possible so it doesn't harm us more than it already has. And so, we will be asking as Tom mentioned earlier, we will be asking for rehearing and we're hoping that reasonable and rational minds at the DOE will prevail and they'll reverse what was an arbitrary and capricious political decision.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Okay. Yes, you really have put a lot of work into it over the last year and before that as well. So thank you for that. Just with a follow-up on something else. Energy Transfer has not been shy about your belief that the sector needs more integration. Can you speak to how you evaluate these opportunities? Looking at Lotus and Enable, is it fair to say that upstream flow into your is kind of a major filter of what you would be looking for?\nTom Long: Absolutely. We do evaluate a lot of the various opportunities that are good bolt-ons if you will to our system. But even if you look at some of the last ones, as you know, the Enable, the Lotus, the Woodford Express. When you really look at these, they all just further enhance our top asset base of the midstream space. And it's something we're going to continue to pursue on those opportunities that make sense but here's the next piece that we always evaluate very carefully and that is that it's accretive. We always want to look at these things and make sure they're going to bring incremental value to our equity holders. And they have, they've all been very accretive to us. And we're always very conservative in how we run our numbers. So we feel like that every acquisition we've made has exceeded any forecast that we put on there. So that's how you -- we've been able to continue to get the coverage up, get the distributions back up to where they are, while at the same time, the leverage coming down. So we're going to continue to follow that model as we look, meaning looking at the various areas that are good bolt-ons for us. And the more tools we can give the fantastic team we have, the better off we're going to be for the long term.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Great. That's all for me. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Keith Stanley of Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley: Hi, thank you. Quick follow-up on the guidance, so just the math behind it. So the Q1 obviously had a really strong quarter. If you annualize that, you're at $137 billion of EBITDA and the updated guide is $13.25 billion at the midpoint. So I know Tom you listed some of the inventory swings and things like that, but are there any other unique items in Q1 you just outperformed on spread, marketing type items that you're assuming don't repeat over the balance of the year or how should we think about that updated guidance?\nTom Long: Yes, that's actually a very good question. Keith, glad you asked it. When you really kind of look at our earnings by quarter throughout the year. The first quarter is generally the strongest. I think you can go back and look at that. And so, when we forecast out at the remainder of the year, we will generally bake in what we see from -- everything from a volume, pricing, et cetera. So what you're looking at once again is that first quarter and that's not the way that it plays out as far as just annualizing that first quarter. And it's going to be a lot of the things you mentioned in there, whether it be some of the spreads we see, pricing, et cetera. So if you just take the forward curve on the pricing and you look at it, I think you'll kind of see what -- how we look at it when we look at the forecast going up a year. But once again, this is guidance. It's our numbers that we're currently seeing and currently targeting. And as you know, those can move around. But as of right now, we feel good about it every quarter when we come out with updated guidance, we feel good about the numbers that we're providing.\nKeith Stanley: Great. That's helpful. Second question just on the leverage target, the 4% to 4.5%. Some of your peers have moved lower over time. And Tom, when you talk, you still talk to reducing leverage. So do you see the company ever aspiring to go below 4 times eventually or is the goal to get the BBB flat credit rating and less of a focus on a number?\nTom Long: Yeah. Our goal is to get to that BBB flat. If it goes below four, we're okay with that. We won't be upset with that, but I will tell you that's still the target. But here's where I'd like to expand on that a bit. Not all these leverage metrics when they come out of the same. As you know, leverage is only one metric. You have to also look at the makeup of the earnings stream, you have to look at the scale of the company and the size. And when you start looking through all those various components like what a rating agency uses, we clearly are strong in all those areas. So our leverage metric, when we put it out, we think it's what fits for us. We think that BBB is a good place to be and that's what we're going to continue to target.\nKeith Stanley: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good afternoon.\nTom Long: Good afternoon. Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: I just want to pick up with Permian egress on the natural gas side if I could. And I want to see the latest thoughts on Warrior and outlook for that project and how you see I guess Waha spreads ebbing and flowing, we've seen volatility there and it seems like takeaway tightness could be back again. So just wondering what thoughts you could provide us on the basin as a whole and the outlook for Warrior at this point?\nMackie McCrea: Jeremy this is Mackie again. Yes, Warrior, we made announcements on the last earnings call that we signed about 25% to 30% of our target, we're still at that level. However, we are in negotiations with over 2 Bcf of additional interest. This is primarily interest on market pull along the Gulf Coast and in the southeast and other parts of South Texas. As I think most know on this call, there's other projects that are being built and other projects being looked at, but nothing compares to our project. We don't have to lay as much pipe to provide the services that others are trying to provide. Our 42 inches pipe would be built if that's where it ends up getting to an FID would be able to [TFW] (ph) and it would enter into our significant Intrastate system that would feed a Katie [indiscernible] and ultimately into our Louisiana interstates to get to the Gulf Coast. So we have -- because the other project is being built, people aren't quite as panicked. Also we're not seeing the blowout we thought we would see by now across Texas. It's been kind of as you said ebb and flow between $0.40 and $0.80. We do think that's going to blow out and we were firm believers that in the next 2.5 to 3 years there's been a significant need for more capacity and we do believe that will be our pipeline. So our team is diligently working on that. It's going to be one of those projects we have sufficient commitments from great customers that give us a guaranteed rates of return and at that time we'll announce it, but we're still very excited and working hard to get to the finish line.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That is helpful there. And I was just wondering if you could touch a little bit more on Lotus and what those assets mean in your hands as opposed to a standalone and what ET's balance sheet could bring to bear as far as marketing or other opportunities with those assets?\nTom Long: It'd probably be a better question for the guys that report or to me on -- in late, report to me on the crude side, we are so excited. Those assets adds, we believe, so much value it does a lot of things for us. One, we've always wanted to be able to get to Cushing. All we have to do is ride 30 miles and we can move fairly significant volumes to Cushion when those blow out or when our customers want to go that direction. We'll have access to Wink, which is a growing area hub for oil that we don't have access to date, which benefits us in many ways. We also have access to Crane, which is kind of one of the main receipt points for the pipelines heading to Corpus. There's a lot of opportunity to blend and create value there off our system and there will be. And then we also have the ability to move more barrels over to our Colorado City area where we have significant takeaway to our Permian Express systems. In addition to that, there's numerous blending opportunities at Midland, we're adding several million barrels more of storage. So it's hard to kind of, I guess, relate how excited we are and the multiple that we paid for those we think will improve on significantly within a year or two and look forward seeing all those barrels enter our system and also help support our cross sell capacity opportunities.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.\nChase Mulvehill: Hey, good afternoon. I guess if we could talk about the NGL and Refined Products segment, for the second quarter in a row, you generated more than $900 million of EBITDA for this segment. And I realize that there's a lot of marketing and optimization benefits that are included in the results over the last couple of quarters. I don't know if you could kind of hold our hand a little bit and bridge kind of 1Q and 2Q kind of how you're thinking about puts and takes for 2Q? And then obviously in the back half, you got frac 8 coming online. But just trying to understand kind of how we should think about this segment in 2Q and through the back half of the year?\nTom Long: Yes. How to -- encourage you to think about it is excited. We -- as we stated earlier, we've set some records in our NGL business. In fact, we were talking about before this call toward the end of April, we actually hit all-time daily records out of Midland for our NGL transport. We hit all-time U.S. NGL transport and we also hit a one day half for frac. So we're hitting records along our NGL systems and with the -- like as we mentioned, the growing demand we just couldn't be more excited about the assets that we have. As we mentioned in our statements earlier, we hit some records for ethane both at Nederland in the first quarter as well as Marcus Hook. And so we sit in such a great position in both areas. One, our [American] (ph) franchise is locked and loaded. I mean, we've got a tremendous capability that all we have to do is add pumps and can double our capacity up there as we can bring on more volumes upstream. We already have permits to expand our ethane capabilities up to 140,000 barrels a day and we'll continue to pursue that project and get that FID. And then of course, we have Nederland, which is such a gem for us in so many different ways, but certainly on the NGL perspective, it's ironic in kind of humorous inside our partnership. We kind of have a battle going on it Nederland between the usage of our docks between crude and NGL and likely NGL has been kicking the tail of crude and we'll continue to do that. And the benefits of that are, we're now starting to move a lot more of our barrels over to Houston. Those assets are starting to really pay off for us. We're hitting kind of record export levels for crude out of Houston. So that's been a good move to kind of ship those volumes. But anyway, we're so well positioned with our four pipelines moving ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline from Mont Belvieu. And we're very excited about the expansion project that we've just got approved and look forward to getting that online in the next couple of years.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay, perfect. Unrelated follow-up on the midstream segment. EBITDA was basically flat sequentially despite lower natural gas prices. So I guess maybe two questions here related to that. Number one, have you mostly hit the fee floors on your natural gas side for your pops? And then number two, if today's lower NGL prices hold, how should we think about potential further downside for the midstream segment in kind of 2Q and 3Q?\nTom Long: Yes, downside on midstream, the way I describe that is, lower commodity prices. I mean certainly one of the biggest impacts quarter-to-quarter this year on our midstream business was lower commodity prices compared to where they were a year ago. It kind of hard to believe we'll see natural gas go lower than two. We remain pretty bullish on where oil prices are as well as NGL and the growing demand for NGL. So we remain very bullish. I didn't mention this a moment ago, but another record we also set three or four days ago is that we were now processing more gas in the Permian Basin than we've ever processed. So we are very optimistic about our volumes, about our spreads in the midstream. And so the only challenge to those are commodity prices and we feel like they've kind of bottomed out. We feel like with anything we're more optimistic on commodity price improvements as we go deeper into 2023 than what we've seen the first quarter.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay. Perfect. I'll turn it over. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Gabe Moreen with Mizuho.\nGabe Moreen: Hey, good afternoon everyone. Just sticking on gas prices a little bit. I'm curious whether $2 gas has had any impact in terms of producer outlook for supporting expansions in the Haynesville or the Marcellus at the moment? And particularly as it relates to Gulf Run and your potential to expand that pipe there?\nMackie McCrea: Yes, you did hone in on probably the area where we are starting to see some rigs set down and also completions being delayed really both in Haynesville and also in Marcelles to a certain degree. So $2 dry gas prices is not great for those areas. In regards to how it impact, people are looking long term, producers aren't that and the price we're going to stay at $2 for the next four or five years. So discussions that we've had, the deals that we've done and deals that we're negotiating to extend, to expand our capacity to the Gulf Coast through our network of pipelines that are ongoing and that demand will increase. We are in a little bit of a low here. As we've been in the second quarter of 2023, we're probably possibly sat in that for the next quarter or so, but we'll come out of this and a lot of gas in North Louisiana and even more market growth along the Gulf Coast and in the Southeast. So love those assets. In fact, that kind of opens up one comment I want to make. We are now selling our space across North Louisiana on Tiger on MEP and then on [indiscernible] sashed all the way down to Florida. We're selling at tariff rates. And in some of this we're also selling at tariff rates that we think will be able to get up to 10 year contract. So it's funny. Hang on the pipe and it gets valuable sooner or later across all capacity, across Louisiana and all the way to Florida is becoming very bad.\nGabe Moreen: Thanks, Mackie. And then maybe if I can also ask about the $2 billion growth CapEx figure now for 2023 to the extent that you're looking at additional stuff, would you characterize it as a good chance that other projects get FID in that $2 billion CapEx figure potentially goes higher for this year?\nMackie McCrea: Yes. Gosh. I guess I'd be a little disappointed if we don't get some projects approved. How much of those dollars spend in 2023 remains to be seen. Of course, some of these bigger dollar projects that we're talking about, we don't anticipate any significant dollars contributing to capital needs in 2023, even if they get to FID in the next three to six months. But we've got a very aggressive team of commercial folks in all of segments and we're chasing deals everywhere. And so, we -- don't see anything overly material from the standpoint of huge capital needs, but we'll continue to have gathering needs and adding compression and things like that that will add of revenue for our assets.\nGabe Moreen: Thanks, Mac.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Marc Solecitto with Barclays.\nMarc Solecitto: Hi, good afternoon. As we think about OpEx in the NGL segment and particularly on the frac side, can you just remind us how we should think about the impact from lower nat gas prices in that segment and how that flows through to your gas and utility costs?\nTom Long: Yes, it's kind of twofold. One, we are able to gain some upside on the energy that we keep based on the Houston [indiscernible] price versus what we charge for. So we're harmed a little bit there from the standpoint of revenue. However, with lower prices, we also benefit from the operation side of that. So we kind of have both sides of the cost there. But, yes, with the lower gas prices, we aren't benefiting as much on the excess energy that we keep compared to what we charge back to our customers.\nMarc Solecitto: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just to circle back on Lake Charles and not to put the carriers before the horse, but just to touch on the progress that you have made. Wondering if there's been any update on the EPC side?\nTom Long: As I think everybody knows, we're working with two different companies and we expect to get one of those [indiscernible] here soon and the next within next 10 or 12 days. And we are very pleased with what we're seeing and where we think the costs will come in, but we will be seeing some of those kind of final numbers in the very near future.\nMarc Solecitto: Got it. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question and answer session. I would like to turn the floor to Tom Long for any closing comments.\nTom Long: Well once again, we thank all of you for joining us today. As you can see, we're very excited about all the great stuff we have going on. So we look forward to talking with you soon and thank all of you for your support.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Long",
            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer first quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, which we expect to file this Thursday, May 4. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'd like to start today by going over our financial results. We were pleased with our results for the first quarter of 2023, during which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.43 billion, which was up from $3.34 billion for the first quarter of 2022. Results for the first quarter benefited from record volumes across our interstate and midstream segments, as well as through our NGL pipelines and NGL and refined products terminals, which included a record amount of LPGs exported out of our Nederland terminal and a record amount of ethane exported out of both Netherlands and Marcus Hook terminals during the quarter. DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, was $2.01 billion compared to $2.08 billion for the first quarter of 2022. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of $1.04 billion. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of $640 million after distributions of $967 million and growth capital of $407 million. On April 26, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.3075 per common unit or $1.23 on an annualized basis. This distribution represents an increase from $0.3050 per common unit paid for the fourth quarter of 2022. Although we cannot guarantee future performance, we expect to make ongoing quarterly increases to our common unit distribution of a $0.0025 on a quarterly basis or $0.01 on an annualized basis and we are now targeting 3% to 5% annual distribution growth rate. This targeted growth rate allows us to provide some clarity to our equity holders on future distributions. We continue to balance our leverage reduction and increasing equity returns, all while maintaining sufficient cash flow to invest in our incredible backlog of growth opportunities. Inclusive of the targeted distribution growth rate, we still expect to be at the lower end of our 4 times to 4.5 times leverage ratio target range going forward based on our calculation of the rating agencies' leverage ratios. As of March 31, 2023, the total available liquidity under our revolving credit facility was approximately $3.01 billion. Now turning to results by segment for the first quarter, I'll start with NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was $939 million compared to $700 million for the same period last year. This change was primarily due to higher margins from transportation, fractionation, storage and terminal services, as well as an increase in northeast blending and optimization. Also included in the increase was approximately $50 million from the recognition of gains on hedged NGL inventory, which is primarily related to the physical loss recorded in the third quarter of last year. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines increased 13% to a record 2 million barrels per day compared to 1.8 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes from the Permian region and our Mariner East Pipeline System, as well as on our NGL pipelines that deliver into our Nederland Terminal. Average fractionated volumes increased 18% to an average 949,000 barrels per day compared to 804,000 barrels per day for the first quarter of 2022. NGL export volumes grew more than 20% over the first quarter of 2022, driven by record ethane and LPG exports out of our Nederland Terminal as well as record ethane exports out of the Marcus Hook Terminal. This was primarily driven by the second tranche of satellite's contract going into effect on July 1, as well as increased international demand for natural gas liquids. In the first quarter, we loaded more than 14 million barrels of ethane out of Nederland. In total, we continue to export more NGL than any other company or country with our percentage of worldwide NGL exports remaining at approximately 20% of the global market. For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $641 million compared to $807 million for the first quarter 2022. This was primarily due to the lower natural gas and NGL prices, as well as increased operating expenses, which were partially offset by increased throughput in all of our operating regions. In addition, the first quarter of 2023 included a onetime positive adjustment of approximately $40 million. Gathered gas volumes increased 14% to a record 19.8 million MMBtus per day compared to 17.3 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year. For the crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $526 million compared to $593 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to lower volumes on the Bakken Pipeline and lower optimization gains compared to the first quarter of 2022. The reduction in optimization was entirely attributable to the timing differences between physical and financial settlements. We expect to recognize $25 million gain in the second quarter related to this activity. In addition, the first quarter of 2023 included a onetime negative adjustment of approximately $35 million. These were partially offset by higher throughput on several of our pipeline systems and higher export demand. Crude oil transportation volumes were 4.24 million barrels per day compared to 4.22 million barrel per day for the same period last year. This was a result of higher volumes on our Texas pipeline systems and the Bayou Bridge pipeline, as well as placing the Ted Collins Link pipeline into service in the second quarter of 2022, which were offset by lower volumes on the Bakken Pipeline as a result of weather-related production impacts. In the Interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $536 million compared to $453 million for the first quarter of 2022. This was due to increased transportation revenue related to higher contracted volumes and rates on several of our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines, as well as placing the Gulf Run Pipeline into service in December of 2022. Volumes increased 11% over the same period last year due to the Gulf Run pipeline being placed into service, as well as higher utilization on many of our Interstate pipelines, including Transwestern, Pebble, Trunkline, MEP and SESH. And for our Intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $409 million compared to $444 million in the first quarter of last year. This was due to lower pipeline optimization opportunities and decreased retained fuel revenues related to lower natural gas prices, which were partially offset by increased storage optimization opportunities and higher fees on assets in the Haynesville and Oklahoma. Utilization on our EOIT, HPL and Rig Systems increased due to higher demand from gas takeaway from growing production in a number of our operating basins. Looking briefly at recent developments, we are excited about the closing of our acquisition of Lotus Midstream for approximately $900 million in cash and 44.5 million Energy Transfer common units. Lotus owns and operates [Centurion] (ph) Pipeline, a fully integrated crude pipeline terminal system in the Permian Basin. This acquisition will enhance Energy Transfer's crude pipeline footprint across the Permian Basin with the addition of approximately 3,000 miles of crude gathering and transportation lines that extend from Southeast Mexico to Cushing, Oklahoma. In addition, the assets provide direct access to other major hubs including Midland, Colorado City, Wink and Crane, and will increase our storage capacity at Midland by approximately 2 million barrels per day. Now turning to our growth projects. I'll start with an update on our Lake Charles LNG project. In May 2022, we received an extension from FERC of the deadline for completion of the construction of Lake Charles LNG facility to December of 2028. And in June 2022, we applied to the Department of Energy. As many are now aware, on April 25, the Department of Energy denied our request for this extension. We strongly disagree with this decision and we plan to file an appeal with the DOE within 30 days of the DOE decision. Now turning to Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals. NGL demand both in the U.S. as well as from international customers continues to increase. We are bullish that there will be significant growth in the international demand for many years to come and we are well positioned to benefit from that demand. In order to address this growth, we have recently FID and expansion to our NGL export capacity at Nederland which we expect to add up to 250,000 barrels per day of export capacity. This expansion which is projected to cost approximately $1.25 billion will give us tremendous flexibility to load different products as well as new products based upon customer demand and market dynamics at the time. The expansion is expected to be in service in mid-2025. We look forward to providing more specifics on this expansion in the near future. We also continue to pursue an optimization project at our Marcus Hook Terminal would add incremental ethane refrigeration and storage capacity. Next at Mont Belvieu, fractionation throughput averaged over 1 million barrels per day for the month of April, which is a new monthly record. And we continue to expect frac eight to be in service in the third quarter of 2023. This addition will bring our total Mont Belvieu fractionation capacity to approximately $1.15 million barrels per day. And in the Delaware Basin, we placed our 200 million cubic foot per day Grey Wolf processing plant into service in December of 2022. As a reminder, this plant is supported by new commitments and growth from existing customer contracts. And construction continues on the Bear plant, our eighth 200 million cubic foot per day processing plant in the Delaware Basin. This plant remains on schedule to be in service in the second quarter of 2023. In addition, we continue to evaluate the necessity and potential time of adding another processing plant in the Permian Basin. Regarding Permian takeaway, we also completed modernization and debottlenecking work on our Oasis pipeline during the first quarter, which added at least an incremental 60,000 Mcf per day of takeaway capacity out of the Permian Basin. We also placed the Gulf Run pipeline into service in December of 2022. Gulf Run provides natural gas transportation between our upstream pipeline network and from the Haynesville, Shell for delivery to the Gulf Coast connecting some of the most prolific natural gas producing regions in the U.S. with the LNG export market, as well as many markets along the Gulf Coast. We were already utilizing a significant portion of Zone 1 capacity on Gulf Run and we have added additional customer commitments through Zone 2, which is being delivered into our trunk line pipeline. In addition to these ongoing projects, we continue to evaluate a number of other potential growth projects that over the long term could provide strong returns and significant upside to our business. We remain optimistic that we can bring these projects to FID and will share any significant updates on these potential projects at the appropriate time. One the Alternative Energy front, we continue to make progress on our carbon capture and storage project with CapturePoint that is related to our north Louisiana treating plants. A Class 6 permit for this sequestration site was filed by CapturePoint with the EPA in June of 2022. Also we recently executed a letter of intent with Oxy related to Oxy's Magnolia hub in Allen Parish, Louisiana, north of the Lake Charles Industrial Complex. Pursuant to the letter of intent, Energy Transfer and Oxy are working together to obtain long term commitments of CO2 from industrial customers in the Lake Charles, Louisiana area. If this project reaches FID, Energy Transfer would construct a CO2 pipeline to connect the customers in Oxy's sequestration site in Allan Parish, Louisiana. Now looking at our growth capital project for the first quarter ended March 31, 2023, Energy Transfer spent $407 million on organic growth projects, primarily in the midstream and NGL and Refined Products segment, excluding SUN and USA Compression CapEx. For full year 2023, we now expect growth capital expenditures to be approximately $2 billion, which will be spent primarily in the midstream, NGL and refined products and Interstate segments. This capital outlook has been updated to include the NGL export expansion project at Nederland, as well as the expenditures related to the Lotus acquisition. A significant amount of our 2023 growth capital spend is comprised of projects that are expected to be online and contributing cash flow before the end of 2023 at very attractive returns, including frac 8, the Bear processing plant and new treating capacity in the Haynesville. Now for our adjusted EBITDA guidance, we are updating our guidance to include EBITDA associated with the Lotus acquisition. As a result, we now expect our 2023 adjusted EBITDA to be between $13.05 billion and $13.45 billion. As a reminder, with the current forward curve for commodity prices and spreads, our guidance does not assume the same upside benefits from pricing and spreads that we experienced in 2022. Our base business continues to provide stable cash flows and demonstrates our ability to operate through various market cycles and we expect utilization in all of our core segments to increase. In addition, we continue to create opportunities for optimization and expansion driven by sustained domestic and international demand for our products and services. We remain bullish about the future of our industry and the growing worldwide demand for all of our products. As part of our capital allocation strategy, we will continue to look for new ways to address this demand through the pursuit of strategic growth projects that enhance our existing asset base and generate attractive returns. In addition, we will continue to place emphasis on strategically allocating cash flow in a manner that balances our targeted 3% to 5% annual distribution growth rate and our commitment to our 4 times to 4.5 times leverage target, all while maintaining significant free cash flow for growth. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line-up for our first question. Yeah. Michael, this is Tom. Majority of it clearly was the Lotus acquisition, but I will say with strong performance you saw in the first quarter, we were able to bump that up a little bit, but it's a smallest piece of the bump. So it's great to be able to continue to increase it and obviously very excited about the contribution of Lotus as we got that one closed in fairly short over. So... Yes, Michael, we clearly have very good discussions with our directors every quarter and you can hopefully translate from this the strength of our business and the ability to be able to continue to grow our distributions. And when we looked at it and had the discussion on it, we decided that we would just continue to bump on a quarterly basis. And the 3% to 5%, when you really kind of look out forecast, we all wish we had the perfect crystal ball. But we thought that was a good sustainable target to put in. But keep in mind, we will always continue to evaluate this distribution level on a quarterly basis. So maybe you'll be asking this question again as we get into the next quarter. But after good dialogue, I will say that it's great to be here and great to be in the position that we can see leverage coming down and all these growth opportunities in funding them at the same time to be able to grow distribution. So it's a great place to be. And there's one thing to highlight, if you look at the slides that we posted out there, you noticed, we update the piece of the total pie on the sensitivities. It used to be 0% to 2.5% related to the spreads. We did take that up a little bit to 0% to 5%. So we have increased that a little bit. Not material when you compare it to the size of Energy Transfer, but it still is something that we did take up a little bit. Yes, we anticipated a question around LNG. So I'm going to make a little broader statement than your question, if you don't mind, and that may help on some potential other questions. People have asked us how do we feel? What's our thoughts and what happened 10 days ago? And a lot of adjective and things that we said, I can't say on this call, but I can't say things like upset and frustrated and shocked and surprise. But at the end of the day, it was just wrong. It was wrong and it was political. And what also was wrong is what's happened over in Europe and really in the U.S. And that really came to fruition here this past year when Russia attacked Ukraine and everybody now is not denying the need for natural gas, not for five to 10 years, but for 25, 30, 40 years. And everybody knows that and thank goodness for a warm winter [indiscernible] catastrophic both economically and from a human standpoint. So we jumped to Lake Charles, we've been working on Lake Charles for a number of years. We've spent over $200 million. We have worked our tails off to try to get this project online. Then the pandemic hit, that slowed us down significantly. And then, of course, as I just mentioned Russia attacked Ukraine. It flipped to $180 million and all of a sudden everybody woke up and the demand has increased astronomically. And we beefed up our team. We began traveling throughout the world throughout Asia and Europe. We've done that consistently over the last year. We immediately asked for an extension from FERC. They gave us that extension, May of last year. We then asked the DOE in June of last year for an extension. We are in negotiations to your question as we speak with over 20 million tons of additional customers on top of what we've already signed up. We have significant equity players that we're in negotiations with. And for months, we've been given every indication that the DOE would approve our extension. And then low and behold, here recently, they've come out and said that because of a new policy, they are not going to extend our request. And they've cited the lack of progress. So here's the DOE citing the lack of progress. They have not asked us onetime over the last year how we progress it. They don't know if we're out there right now of building facilities. We already have four tanks built. We already have a dock built. It's a brownfield unlike some of our competitors. And so it needless to say a little frustrated. Additionally, we've had one customer come to us after we heard that 10 days ago and said they'll go another direction at least for now. And we think it's extremely important to reverse this decision as quickly as possible so it doesn't harm us more than it already has. And so, we will be asking as Tom mentioned earlier, we will be asking for rehearing and we're hoping that reasonable and rational minds at the DOE will prevail and they'll reverse what was an arbitrary and capricious political decision. Absolutely. We do evaluate a lot of the various opportunities that are good bolt-ons if you will to our system. But even if you look at some of the last ones, as you know, the Enable, the Lotus, the Woodford Express. When you really look at these, they all just further enhance our top asset base of the midstream space. And it's something we're going to continue to pursue on those opportunities that make sense but here's the next piece that we always evaluate very carefully and that is that it's accretive. We always want to look at these things and make sure they're going to bring incremental value to our equity holders. And they have, they've all been very accretive to us. And we're always very conservative in how we run our numbers. So we feel like that every acquisition we've made has exceeded any forecast that we put on there. So that's how you -- we've been able to continue to get the coverage up, get the distributions back up to where they are, while at the same time, the leverage coming down. So we're going to continue to follow that model as we look, meaning looking at the various areas that are good bolt-ons for us. And the more tools we can give the fantastic team we have, the better off we're going to be for the long term. Yes, that's actually a very good question. Keith, glad you asked it. When you really kind of look at our earnings by quarter throughout the year. The first quarter is generally the strongest. I think you can go back and look at that. And so, when we forecast out at the remainder of the year, we will generally bake in what we see from -- everything from a volume, pricing, et cetera. So what you're looking at once again is that first quarter and that's not the way that it plays out as far as just annualizing that first quarter. And it's going to be a lot of the things you mentioned in there, whether it be some of the spreads we see, pricing, et cetera. So if you just take the forward curve on the pricing and you look at it, I think you'll kind of see what -- how we look at it when we look at the forecast going up a year. But once again, this is guidance. It's our numbers that we're currently seeing and currently targeting. And as you know, those can move around. But as of right now, we feel good about it every quarter when we come out with updated guidance, we feel good about the numbers that we're providing. Yeah. Our goal is to get to that BBB flat. If it goes below four, we're okay with that. We won't be upset with that, but I will tell you that's still the target. But here's where I'd like to expand on that a bit. Not all these leverage metrics when they come out of the same. As you know, leverage is only one metric. You have to also look at the makeup of the earnings stream, you have to look at the scale of the company and the size. And when you start looking through all those various components like what a rating agency uses, we clearly are strong in all those areas. So our leverage metric, when we put it out, we think it's what fits for us. We think that BBB is a good place to be and that's what we're going to continue to target. Good afternoon. Jeremy. It'd probably be a better question for the guys that report or to me on -- in late, report to me on the crude side, we are so excited. Those assets adds, we believe, so much value it does a lot of things for us. One, we've always wanted to be able to get to Cushing. All we have to do is ride 30 miles and we can move fairly significant volumes to Cushion when those blow out or when our customers want to go that direction. We'll have access to Wink, which is a growing area hub for oil that we don't have access to date, which benefits us in many ways. We also have access to Crane, which is kind of one of the main receipt points for the pipelines heading to Corpus. There's a lot of opportunity to blend and create value there off our system and there will be. And then we also have the ability to move more barrels over to our Colorado City area where we have significant takeaway to our Permian Express systems. In addition to that, there's numerous blending opportunities at Midland, we're adding several million barrels more of storage. So it's hard to kind of, I guess, relate how excited we are and the multiple that we paid for those we think will improve on significantly within a year or two and look forward seeing all those barrels enter our system and also help support our cross sell capacity opportunities. Yes. How to -- encourage you to think about it is excited. We -- as we stated earlier, we've set some records in our NGL business. In fact, we were talking about before this call toward the end of April, we actually hit all-time daily records out of Midland for our NGL transport. We hit all-time U.S. NGL transport and we also hit a one day half for frac. So we're hitting records along our NGL systems and with the -- like as we mentioned, the growing demand we just couldn't be more excited about the assets that we have. As we mentioned in our statements earlier, we hit some records for ethane both at Nederland in the first quarter as well as Marcus Hook. And so we sit in such a great position in both areas. One, our [American] (ph) franchise is locked and loaded. I mean, we've got a tremendous capability that all we have to do is add pumps and can double our capacity up there as we can bring on more volumes upstream. We already have permits to expand our ethane capabilities up to 140,000 barrels a day and we'll continue to pursue that project and get that FID. And then of course, we have Nederland, which is such a gem for us in so many different ways, but certainly on the NGL perspective, it's ironic in kind of humorous inside our partnership. We kind of have a battle going on it Nederland between the usage of our docks between crude and NGL and likely NGL has been kicking the tail of crude and we'll continue to do that. And the benefits of that are, we're now starting to move a lot more of our barrels over to Houston. Those assets are starting to really pay off for us. We're hitting kind of record export levels for crude out of Houston. So that's been a good move to kind of ship those volumes. But anyway, we're so well positioned with our four pipelines moving ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline from Mont Belvieu. And we're very excited about the expansion project that we've just got approved and look forward to getting that online in the next couple of years. Yes, downside on midstream, the way I describe that is, lower commodity prices. I mean certainly one of the biggest impacts quarter-to-quarter this year on our midstream business was lower commodity prices compared to where they were a year ago. It kind of hard to believe we'll see natural gas go lower than two. We remain pretty bullish on where oil prices are as well as NGL and the growing demand for NGL. So we remain very bullish. I didn't mention this a moment ago, but another record we also set three or four days ago is that we were now processing more gas in the Permian Basin than we've ever processed. So we are very optimistic about our volumes, about our spreads in the midstream. And so the only challenge to those are commodity prices and we feel like they've kind of bottomed out. We feel like with anything we're more optimistic on commodity price improvements as we go deeper into 2023 than what we've seen the first quarter. Yes, it's kind of twofold. One, we are able to gain some upside on the energy that we keep based on the Houston [indiscernible] price versus what we charge for. So we're harmed a little bit there from the standpoint of revenue. However, with lower prices, we also benefit from the operation side of that. So we kind of have both sides of the cost there. But, yes, with the lower gas prices, we aren't benefiting as much on the excess energy that we keep compared to what we charge back to our customers. As I think everybody knows, we're working with two different companies and we expect to get one of those [indiscernible] here soon and the next within next 10 or 12 days. And we are very pleased with what we're seeing and where we think the costs will come in, but we will be seeing some of those kind of final numbers in the very near future. Well once again, we thank all of you for joining us today. As you can see, we're very excited about all the great stuff we have going on. So we look forward to talking with you soon and thank all of you for your support."

            "name": "Mackie McCrea",
            "content": "Yes. This is Mackie. When you say spread opportunities, they're numerous depending on exactly what you're talking about. Okay. So around nat gas, there is another pipeline being built prior to that. We expect and anticipate the spreads across Texas to widen significantly. They really haven't yet even with Freeport coming back online. However, look at the growth out there, I think we hit 17.6 Bcf. So the growth just continues and we do expect those spreads to widen at least over the next year and a half till next pipeline project comes online. And then around the crude spreads, it's overbuilt -- the industry has overbuilt it. It's going to be that way for a little ways. But Lotus is such a great acquisition for us. We -- Chris Hefty and his team continue to create deals on -- with Enable and with [WEX and then with this project, we're so excited we can buy them to kind of multiples, we're buying and bringing all those barrels into our system will not help the spread, but certainly will help our revenue if we continue to keep our pipelines full across Texas. Yes, this is Mackie again. Could it be upsized? It's being upsized. And it needs to be upsized quicker than we can do it. The global demand for ethane and propane and butane is incredible. If you look at the PH (ph) facilities that are being built around the world over the next 12 to 18 months and also the growing demand for ethane, we are probably one of the most bullish companies in the industry where we think NGL process and demand will go over the next three years to five years, if not longer. So we have the tremendous capability both at Nederland and at Marcus Hook in expanding this expansion that we've talked about today. We're very excited about, we pretty much maxed out what we can do right now with our facilities. We're moving as quickly as we can to get these built. They should be service by the middle of 2025. We've already secured a number of contracts -- long-term contracts and we have an enormous base load of customers that we're negotiating with and very excited about that. And as we've always advertised, we're the only company that can export both in the Gulf Coast and also Middle East. And so ultimately, we also anticipate that we will be expanding at Marcus Hook, our ethane capabilities -- exporting more ethane. And so, we have set this up in such a way that we can source ethane out of Nederland. And once we are able to secure enough ethane in the Northeast, we can move those customers up to our Marcus Hook facility and then reload new customers into Nederland. So we feel very blessed, I guess, for having these assets and our ability to meet the world demand for these growing products. Jeremy this is Mackie again. Yes, Warrior, we made announcements on the last earnings call that we signed about 25% to 30% of our target, we're still at that level. However, we are in negotiations with over 2 Bcf of additional interest. This is primarily interest on market pull along the Gulf Coast and in the southeast and other parts of South Texas. As I think most know on this call, there's other projects that are being built and other projects being looked at, but nothing compares to our project. We don't have to lay as much pipe to provide the services that others are trying to provide. Our 42 inches pipe would be built if that's where it ends up getting to an FID would be able to [TFW] (ph) and it would enter into our significant Intrastate system that would feed a Katie [indiscernible] and ultimately into our Louisiana interstates to get to the Gulf Coast. So we have -- because the other project is being built, people aren't quite as panicked. Also we're not seeing the blowout we thought we would see by now across Texas. It's been kind of as you said ebb and flow between $0.40 and $0.80. We do think that's going to blow out and we were firm believers that in the next 2.5 to 3 years there's been a significant need for more capacity and we do believe that will be our pipeline. So our team is diligently working on that. It's going to be one of those projects we have sufficient commitments from great customers that give us a guaranteed rates of return and at that time we'll announce it, but we're still very excited and working hard to get to the finish line. Yes, you did hone in on probably the area where we are starting to see some rigs set down and also completions being delayed really both in Haynesville and also in Marcelles to a certain degree. So $2 dry gas prices is not great for those areas. In regards to how it impact, people are looking long term, producers aren't that and the price we're going to stay at $2 for the next four or five years. So discussions that we've had, the deals that we've done and deals that we're negotiating to extend, to expand our capacity to the Gulf Coast through our network of pipelines that are ongoing and that demand will increase. We are in a little bit of a low here. As we've been in the second quarter of 2023, we're probably possibly sat in that for the next quarter or so, but we'll come out of this and a lot of gas in North Louisiana and even more market growth along the Gulf Coast and in the Southeast. So love those assets. In fact, that kind of opens up one comment I want to make. We are now selling our space across North Louisiana on Tiger on MEP and then on [indiscernible] sashed all the way down to Florida. We're selling at tariff rates. And in some of this we're also selling at tariff rates that we think will be able to get up to 10 year contract. So it's funny. Hang on the pipe and it gets valuable sooner or later across all capacity, across Louisiana and all the way to Florida is becoming very bad. Yes. Gosh. I guess I'd be a little disappointed if we don't get some projects approved. How much of those dollars spend in 2023 remains to be seen. Of course, some of these bigger dollar projects that we're talking about, we don't anticipate any significant dollars contributing to capital needs in 2023, even if they get to FID in the next three to six months. But we've got a very aggressive team of commercial folks in all of segments and we're chasing deals everywhere. And so, we -- don't see anything overly material from the standpoint of huge capital needs, but we'll continue to have gathering needs and adding compression and things like that that will add of revenue for our assets."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Energy Transfer's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call to Tom Long. Please go ahead.\nThomas Long: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team who are going to be able to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon. As a reminder, our earnings release contains a thorough MD&A that goes through the segment results in detail, and we encourage everyone to look at their release as well as the slides posted to our website to gain a full understanding of the quarter and our growth opportunities. Also as a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which we expect to file tomorrow, November 7. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. Let's start with the financial results. For the third quarter of 2024, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.96 billion. compared to $3.54 billion for the third quarter of 2023. We had record volumes through our crude oil midstream gathering and NGL pipelines as well as through our NGL fractionators. In addition, we saw strong crude and NGL exports during the quarter and increased volumes through our refined products pipelines. DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, was $1.99 billion, consistent with the third quarter of last year. And for the first 9 months of 2024, we spent approximately $1.7 billion on organic growth capital, primarily in the Midstream and NGL and refined products segments, excluding SUN and USA Compression CapEx. Now turning results by segment for the third quarter. We'll start with NGL and Refined Products. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.01 billion compared to $1.08 billion for the third quarter of 2023. This was primarily due to growth across our Mariner East pipeline operations as well as strong NGL exports which were offset by lower gains from the optimization of hedged NGL inventory as we recognized over $100 million in gains in the third quarter of last year compared to $30 million this year. For Midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $816 million compared to $631 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford as well as the addition of the Crestwood and WTG assets in November 2023 and July 2024, respectively. In addition, during the quarter, we recognized $70 million in proceeds from a onetime business interruption claim. For the Crude Oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $768 million compared to $706 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to record crude oil transportation throughput, higher crude oil exports, which were up 49%, the recently formed Permian joint venture with SUN as well as the acquisition of the Crestwood and WTG assets. Excluding these acquisitions, crude oil transportation throughput on our base business increased 4%. For the interstate natural gas segment, adjusted EBITDA was $460 million compared to $491 million for the third quarter of 2023. During the quarter, we saw higher demand on Panhandle, Trunkline and Gulf Run. This was offset by lower IT utilization in dry gas areas due to the lower gas prices and weaker spreads. Additionally, we had higher operating expenses primarily due to a onetime benefit recorded in the third quarter of 2023 that reduced operating expenses and increased maintenance project costs. And for the intrastate natural gas segment, adjusted EBITDA was $329 million compared to $244 million in the third quarter of last year. The increase was primarily due to approximately $100 million of increased gains related to pipeline optimization opportunities. Turning to our recently completed acquisition of WTG which enhances our Permian Basin operations and downstream businesses. Integration of the combined assets is underway, and we have recently approved several projects that are expected to enhance reliability, reduce losses and improve the overall efficiencies of the system for our customers. Also in July, Energy Transfer and Sunoco LP announced the formation of a joint venture combining their respective crude oil and produced water gathering assets in the Permian Basin. We're making good progress on integrating the combined systems and are executing on synergies and growth opportunities that will drive additional value while expanding our market and service offerings for our customers. No turning to our 2024 organic growth capital guidance and our growth projects, we now expect 2024 growth capital expenditures to be approximately $2.9 billion. which will be spent primarily in the NGL and Refined Products and Midstream segments. At our Nederland Terminal, construction of the expansions to our NGL export capacity continues to progress. and the project remains on schedule for an anticipated in-service for the initial phase in mid-2025. At Mont Belvieu, as mentioned on our last call, we have approved our ninth fractionator, which will have a design capacity of 165,000 barrels per day and is expected to be in service in Q4 of 2026. This will bring our total fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu to more than 1.3 million barrels per day. Taking a look at our Permian processing expansions. We recently completed the 50 million cubic foot per day upgrade to our Orla East processing plant. And construction continues on upgrades to three other processing facilities, which will add incremental processing capacity in West Texas of approximately 150 million cubic feet per day. Additionally, construction of the 200 million cubic feet per day Badger processing plant in the Permian Basin is underway. As a reminder, this plant, which is expected to be in service in mid-2025, will utilize an idle plant that is being relocated to the Delaware Basin. Looking at our crude assets, we recently completed construction of a 30-mile pipeline to add a direct connection from Midland to our pipeline that flows from the Permian Basin to Cushing. As a result, we are now able to transport approximately 100,000 barrels per day of crude oil from our terminals in Midland, Texas to our terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma. For a brief update around power generation opportunities. With forecasted AI and data center growth creating rising electrical needs, and the necessity for grid reliability becoming increasingly important, it is clear that natural gas will play a significant role in helping meet this demand. Given Energy Transfer's extensive interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline footprint, we are the best positioned to capitalize on the anticipated rise in natural gas demand for AI data centers, natural gas power plants and industrial and onshore manufacturing for decades to come. We have never seen this level of activity from a demand pull standpoint and these opportunities are truly spread across our natural gas footprint from Arizona to Florida and from Texas to Michigan. We currently serve gas-fired power plants in 15 states with approximately 185 plants served via direct or indirect connections throughout these states, and our opportunities have only increased since our last call. We have had requests to connect to approximately 45 power plants that we do not currently serve in 11 states that in aggregate could consume gas loads up to 6 Bcf per day. In addition, we have had requests from over 40 prospective data centers in 10 states. These data centers in aggregate could consume gas loads up to 10 Bcf per day. Some of these may be behind the electric meter for reliability purposes. Many of these developers are still working to determine optimal locations and are seeking information on pipeline proximity and cost to connect. In addition to support our own operations and increase system reliability for Energy Transfer and our customers in Texas, we have started construction on eight 10-megawatt natural gas-fired electric generation facilities. The first of these facilities is expected to be in service in the first quarter of next year, with the remainder expected to be in service throughout 2025 and 2026. We also continue to make progress on the development of several other growth projects, including our Lone Star pipe optimizations, Warrior, Blue Marlin offshore oil project like Charles LNG, a carbon capture and sequestration project with CapturePoint, and Blue Ammonia hubs at Lake Charles and Nederland. We look forward to providing more updates on these projects as customer discussions advance, and we bring them closer to FID. Looking at EBITDA guidance. We continue to expect 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be between $15.3 billion to $15.5 billion. Our results reflect the strength of our assets and the benefit of having a diverse geographic footprint and multiple product offerings. We remain excited about our business and the demand for these products and our services, both domestically and internationally. We have seen a wide range of estimates for new power demand and the broad consensus suggests that natural gas fuel power demand will increase significantly in the future. We are already seeing increasing power needs across several of our natural gas pipelines driven by AI, data center and power plant growth. Given our extensive natural gas pipeline network, particularly in Texas and Oklahoma, we believe that Energy Transfer is one of the best positioned companies in the industry to help meet this demand. We also continue to maintain a strong liquidity position with a balance sheet that allows the flexibility to fund organic growth opportunities while also further reducing our leverage, maintaining our targeted distribution growth rate and increasing equity returns to our unitholders. This now concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line up for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: This Slide 5, as you laid out here, it seems pretty interesting, and thank you for all the details on the call. 45 plants, 6 bcf a number of other demand pull sounds pretty sizable here. And so granted that there's a lot uncertain at this point still. But when do you think this could start entering the plan? How could this impact the ET growth outlook? And how much operating leverage do you see the system having to this trend?\nMarshall McCrea: Jimmy, this is Mackie. Certainly a question we anticipated. We've heard for 4 years how we're transitioning out of fossil fuels. And very clearly, we're going in a different direction. And even the liberals have figured out that we're transitioning into more natural gas and more natural gas liquids. So we feel very fortunate as a partnership looking at our assets throughout the United States, we can benefit with our footprint as described on the page that you referenced. So we're -- for the last 4 or 5 years, we've been chasing every possible power plant or a large gas consumer on any of our pipelines. This is kind of just a follow-up to that with this all of a sudden rush to build data centers and additional power plants. So we're way ahead of the curve. We are very excited about the opportunities this is going to create for our partnership throughout multiple states in the South and through the Midwest with our ability to move large volumes to these pipelines and our access to our own storage for immediate delivery to power plants where those services are necessary. We just are very excited about the future. In Tom's prepared remarks, we showed we're chasing like 16 Bcf. Do we expect to get that? No. But do we expect to get our fair share of that throughout these assets. And kind of a last comment on that. I was with the team last week, and we were looking through this. And it's ironic. It's almost crazy where a lot of these power plants and data centers are being potentially positioned are within 2 or 3 miles of our pipeline. It's almost like they had already come to us first and we're the most optimum places to our assets, whether they're close to cities or close to our storage facility. So we're really excited about where most of these data centers and power plants are going in close proximity to our system and our team is well prepared and down the road in a lot of negotiations to take advantage of those opportunities.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Makes sense. Certainly seems like affordable and reliable natural gas is appealing. Wanted to move along, I guess, I think there was an announcement regarding a South Mississippi Pipeline open season there. And just wondering, I guess, what type of expansions do you see off the system going forward? And how could that impact, I guess, your growth CapEx outlook going forward within your capital allocation parameters?\nMarshall McCrea: Yes, Jeremy, this is Mackie again. That's another project that's needed kind of desperately over the next 4 or 5 years. The growth in natural gas demand on the East Coast and Florida is just enormous, and it's going up by the day because of population, everything else. And so we do have an open season out there. We have a tremendous response, a lot of interest, the forward curve from kind of Perryville area to Florida are enormous. So we're very excited of that. It's way premature on kind of timing of how that will go and the capital involved, but we do see an opportunity there, and we think there's a real possibility, we'll be a part of that growth.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. And just one last quick one, if I could. It seemed like Diamondback was talking a bit about your partnership on their call recently here and just wondering what that means for Permian egress as you see it, it seems like Warrior, they outlined quite the case for the need there. Just wondering, do you see this being a sooner rather than later event with an FID here?\nMarshall McCrea: Yes. Yes, I know I said on the last call that I'd be disappointed if we didn't announce it. We're certainly not on this call, going to announce FID, but I won't say we're disappointed. We've made tremendous progress. We are very likely, within weeks, getting to FID. We're not there yet, but we've made a lot of strides. It's a unique pipeline in that it is producer push to a certain degree, but it's also a market pull. So it's both directions needed. It ties into -- I was trying to describe this. Most of you all probably know our system well. But if you think about energy intrastate system in Texas. It's almost like a hand that extends out of the fourth basin, where we have a pipeline, 36-inch going to Northeast Texas, connected to multiple 42-inch pipes. We had two 42 inches going to cartage or our intrastate markets as well as interstate pipelines there. We also have two of our own pipelines. We have a 42-inch that goes down to Southeast, kind of Port Arthur, Texas, where we tie to -- or tied to interstate pipelines as well as Golden Pass and Sempra and just a lot of upside there, and of course, 42 and 36 that ultimately goes to Katy and the Houston Ship Channel. And of course, we have pipelines -- our Houston pipeline system that goes to Agua Dulce. So we're so uniquely set up to take advantage of offering the most flexibility to all of these markets. What we're missing is years ago when we built the first, second, third 42 and 36-inch pipes on the fourth Basin, we anticipated that basin being at 8 9,10 Bcf by now. Well with what happened just population growth there and really what happened was all these other shelves that became more profitable and made more sense for producers, it slowed down dramatically. So we had a lot of idle -- not idle, a lot of underused capacity. We're using all these pipes, but we've got capacity unutilized. And so water is exciting and that it's going to be a great project for us, but it's also going to benefit from this underutilized capacity to go to all these points I just described. And so we hope to be to FID, if it's not days in the coming weeks, we actually have already locked in an option to purchase steel. So we know that price for the majority of the steel. We feel good about that. And we're kind of structuring this where we anticipate announcing it when we get to FID, if we do, and it will be a good project with a good rate of return, where we'll have the ability to add compression in the future, a significant amount to move 700,000, 800,000 more than what we anticipated initially, and the reason that's important, that's why we'll feed all these new power plants that are coming on, all these new data centers that are happening. So it's an important project for us, and we do intend to get it to the finish line.\nJeremy Tonet: That's great to hear. Sounds like a lot of operating leverage across the system.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bank of America.\nJean Ann Salisbury: With the lifting of the LNG permit band assuming possibly more imminent, can you just remind us of the status of Lake Charles on EPC contracts, et cetera?\nMarshall McCrea: Well, I'm looking at Tom Mason and he's assured me and his team that once Trump elected, and we get some rational, reasonable people running this country that we will get that to FID. So we're very excited about that. We've still got a lot of work to do. We've got partners we'll need to bring in the course financing, but we do have a lot of momentum. We hope to announce some significant new markets that we've signed up by the end of the year. We've got a good EPC contract executed, and we're very optimistic that what happened yesterday is going to really help that and many other parts of our business to move forward. So yes, we're very bullish on getting LNG to finish line.\nJean Ann Salisbury: And then one more on Slide 5. Can you comment on the potential to expand Transwestern to the West. Could you do that with just compression? Or would it be a pretty significant looping project to meet that demand?\nMarshall McCrea: Yes. What a great question. Everybody is kind of focused going east, and there -- it's probably likely there's going to be a need going west and I'll kind of leave it at that for this point. But to answer your question more directly, not a lot we can do to significantly increase from an efficiency standpoint, the volumes going we're pretty maxed out when you look at kind of how the contracts are structured where our compression is, we can't move a whole lot more, but we certainly think there's some potential for projects to move more gas to the west at some point.\nOperator: The next question is from Manav Gupta with UBS.\nManav Gupta: It's been a quarter since you completed the acquisition of WTG. And I'm just trying to understand how is that integration going? Do the assets meet your expectations? And also, could you provide us an update on the SUN JV? How are things progressing over there?\nMarshall McCrea: Yes. This is Mackie again. Gosh, WTG was a great acquisition. We're so excited about it. We identified some issues that we knew we would have to deal with when we closed, and we started dealing with those. We have running some other issues around the existing plants and even the plant that was built as we were closing. We're working through those issues, and like I said, we're so bullish. We have incredible amount of just high-quality acreage, hundreds of thousands of acres dedicated to those assets. And on top of that, we have hundreds of thousands of acres that are top leased that right now are going to somebody else, but in future years will come to us. So what a great asset just stand alone from a GMP perspective. But then when you add on the -- what it's going to do for our NGL and downstream business there as well as feeding into our pipelines. We're very excited about what that acquisition is going to do for our partnership. And then jumping over to Sunoco, I don't know how many of you guys follow them, but listened to their call this morning, and Joe Kim and Karl Fails, most guys have done an unbelievable job with that partnership. They -- not only the mass amount of distribution on fine products but also the terminals, not only here, but in Europe, they're just doing a an incredible job and NuStar put them into a much bigger way in the midstream business. And what a perfect fit for us. We have a pretty extensive system throughout the Permian Basin, but coincidentally, we just didn't have a big presence in Howard County in Dawson and some of those counties where the new store assets were. So it was just a perfect situation to form a JV that kind of benefited in three ways. One, where we can offer a really good service to those producers. And then two, where we can benefit from a classic case of kind of 1 plus 1 is more than 2. This is one of those situations. We've already identified numerous blending opportunities, lending the third parties, exchanging barrels, feeding our downstream pipeline system. So we're very excited about the progress we made on the integration, and we're also excited about the growth opportunities that we're seeing in those assets and Sunoco is already great partners with us. They're partners on the JC Nolan line, moving diesel from Houston to the Permian Basin. And so we look forward to growing this partnership with them and excited to be a part of it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays.\nTheresa Chen: Maybe first, on the data center and natural gas infrastructure theme feeding that demand. I think one question is of magnitude, how much of the 16 Bcf per day that you will eventually realize. But -- another question would be one of returns. Can you talk about how those types of projects and the returns could potentially compare to what's in your existing backlog today? And just the competitive dynamics that have developed given the incremental competition from many peers.\nMarshall McCrea: You bet. This is Mackie again. Yes, I guess the way we answer that question is we don't look at it any differently. We've got IRR, rate of return hurdles that we look to meet on all of our projects that make sense. We also look for other synergistic revenues that are tied to our projects. But as far as the competitive aspect to your question, gosh, we sit in a great spot. If you could just look at where we're looking at some of these significant data centers, especially in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, there's just nobody that can provide the service that we can for the price that we can. We've got big diameter pipe, especially if we can get Warrior to finish line. That's going to be a huge influx of the Permian Basin supply. We have unparalleled ability to get move gas around the state from our storage facilities. We have massive storage and ability to increase our storage in the DFW area as well as down around Houston. So, yes, there's going to be a lot of competition. As I said earlier, do we expect to get 16 Bcf? No. We do expect to get our fair share. And in Texas, a considerable part of that as well as we're optimistic in other states. And so we think we will look to achieve the same return hurdles that we do on all of our projects, and we're quite confident that we'll be able to do that on a pretty significant volume.\nTheresa Chen: Got it. And in terms of spending for this year, it looks like your growth capital budget decreased by $200 million even though there's a new bullet point within Midstream, the new Delaware processing plant. So have you added a project decreased spending? What are the moving parts there, please?\nDylan Bramhall: Yes. Theresa, this is Dylan. There's a couple of buckets really when we're looking at that total cost decrease. First of all, we've got a number of projects that are coming in at lower cost here. I think we're -- the DMC team is doing a great job there on in stuff constructive, but we do have some reduced costs. Secondly, we have several projects. Well, we're always adding stuff. We have several that we've either reduce scopes or had outright cancellations really due to return hurdles not being met. We're being disciplined on those. And then third, there are some smaller amounts that have been pushed out and deferred into next year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley: Wanted to start on the Flexport LPG export project. You referenced an initial phase in mid-2025. When would the full 250,000 barrels a day of capacity be online? And then can you just remind us how contracted the facility is and how much spot exposure you might have to the arb spread?\nMarshall McCrea: You bet. This is Mackie again. Once again, we are on track for the third quarter. We need it for all the products that are coming in. We're excited about that. It's a little bit difficult to exactly answer that question because it is 250,000 barrels a day. But as we continue to fully contract the facility there may be a little bit more ethane or a little bit less ethane depending on the LPG contracts and also the ethylene part of it. But for the most part, we expect it to be fully contracted. Typically, these aren't 7- to 10-year agreements, they're 3- to 5-year agreements, but we not only expect to be fully contracted, the international demand for ethane and LPG continues to grow through the roof with all the PDHs built throughout the world, especially in China, and there's just an insatiable demand for LPG all over the world. And so we are trying to stay ahead of that. We're very bullish on what we're doing at Nederland, and we will definitely be expanding beyond what we're doing today.\nKeith Stanley: Second question, just the guidance for the year on EBITDA was maintained. The high end of the range would imply that EBITDA will be down quarter-over-quarter in Q4? Are there any headwinds to be mindful of for Q4 besides the insurance gain item in Midstream?\nThomas Long: Short answer is no. Keith. We don't have any headwinds going into the quarter. But as you know, we're always fairly conservative as to how we forecast out and the guidance numbers we put out there. So here's the two items that I would put back at you. Number one, we don't have anything baked in for optimization that could possibly occur during the quarter. So we'll see how -- as we get through the end of December, what may present itself. But the second item is really around the natural gas spreads across Texas. And right now, we're staying pretty conservative as we look out. But a few differing views based upon how those spreads move up and down, and they can be pretty volatile. But even if you look at the month of October, you can see they stayed pretty strong. So once again, that's another upside. So if you take those two items in, you can see that we will clearly be at the top end of that range, depending on what view you have.\nOperator: The next question is from Gabe Moreen with Mizuho.\nGabriel Moreen: Just had a quick question on cadence of additional processing capacity announcements. I know you've got a couple of plants set here for '25 in expansions. Some of your competitors are now already in the back half of '26 though, in terms of announcing additions. I'm just curious how things stand in the Q where you think you'll be announcing a new stuff and the extent you feel you need to kind of get ahead of the curve here in announcing plans for '26.\nMarshall McCrea: Yes. Gabe, this is Mackie again. Yes, we've already announced a course Badger that's under construction and will be online next year. We just brought on Red Lake 3 kind of getting that lined out as we speak. We've got Red Lake 4 coming on in the second quarter of next year. We've got another project that's not fully to FID, but close called Mustang Draw, which will be in the Midland Basin to try to stay ahead of the growth behind WTG and other Midland growth. We're also looking at another plant in the Delaware. We're still in the process of increasing our capacity in Red Bluff and other plants in West Texas, where we are just adding compression and increased capacity fairly significantly. So we don't really pay attention or worry about what others are announcing. We're just worried about what we've contracted and stand ahead of that, and we have a consistent pipeline of what we've already announced and what we see in the future with just phenomenal continued growth out of the Permian Basin that just keeps giving. And with the new Barnett and Woodford type plays that are kind of being discovered in the Central Basin, we just continue to be, I guess, very fortunate to have such a big asset base in that basin.\nGabriel Moreen: And maybe if I can follow up also, just in terms of exposure to gas prices, and I think some of the volume declines we've seen in the Haynesville year-on-year and things like that. I'm just wondering to what extent you're embedding in guidance for the back half of this year or even thinking about into next year, some sort of recovery in volumes in places like the Haynesville that may have been impacted by dry gas prices.\nDylan Bramhall: Yes. Let me try to answer that, and I don't do a very good job. Tom will tell me. But it's funny. We always feel very fortunate when we look at our assets because we are by far the most diversified pipeline company in the U.S. by far. And so if our crude division is hurt a little bit, it seems like our NGLs picks up vice versa. And it was interesting as we were looking at these numbers preparing for this really over the last several months and looking at the results, even within our pipeline segments, if you look at -- you just referred to some residue areas, if you -- lean residue areas, if you look at, for example, our interstate pipelines, yes, we were down significantly. I think it was around 900,000 a day on Tiger and Rover together. But then you look at Panhandle and you look at Trunkline, we're up over 1.1 Bcf. So even embedded in our pipeline segments, we have offsetting gains that will offset some tough times. So where we have more of our lean gas -- residue gas that comes from our rich areas, we performed very well. Yes, we've had some tightening of spreads on Rover and Tiger, but we see those coming back. In fact, we just recently signed another long-term deal on Rover, a 10-year deal, significant volume. We're in the open season right now. There's enormous reserves that we all know in the Haynesville, we have no worries whatsoever that Tiger and Gulf Run for the future will begin to grow again and remain full for many years to come. A lot of that going further downstream. So we feel very hedged, I guess, is the word on the way our pipelines are set up. And where we struggle a little bit or where our producers struggle a little bit, we're making it up in other areas of our pipeline business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: I wanted to go back to the Slide 5 with all the growing demand that you're seeing on the natural gas side. I guess given all this percolating gas demand, how does that fit in with your CapEx spending framework of, I think, $2 billion to $3 billion per year? Do you think that given all these opportunities that could possibly trend higher over time?\nDylan Bramhall: Yes, Michael, this is Dylan again. Good question. I think as we've discussed the $2 billion to $3 billion. If you look at the slides we put out recently, we've called it illustrative, but we have started talking about a $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion run rate, and that's really just the result of just getting bigger as a company and bigger more opportunities and a number of acquisitions we've done recently that have added to the footprint. But -- and the additional cash flow that clearly supports a capital spend like that. But even within that, as we look out, we talk about some of these bigger projects that we're looking at, such as a Warrior the spend on those can be lumpy as they work. And so even though that's kind of an illustrative framework, we can be below or above that in any given year based on timing.\nMichael Blum: Great. And then I just wanted to ask on Slide 7, you list the Sabina 1 pipeline as a proposed project. I'm wondering if you could talk about the scope of that project and where you are in the process?\nMarshall McCrea: Yes, Michael, this is Mackie. We bought the Sabina assets a while back. We -- Sabina 2, we will bring on service first quarter of next year, excited about that. We anticipated a number of barrels to make that a good project for us. We actually are close to closing twice that amount of barrels. So that's a natural gasoline project that we're very excited about. And what came with that asset was also Sabina 1, which gets us across the ship channel over to some crackers. And we're chasing a number of opportunities there. So we still got some work to do. to fully benefit from what that pipeline can offer our partnership, but we're very excited about what's happening on Sabina 2 and the revenues that will start flowing in the first quarter of next year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Zackery Van Everen with TPH.\nZackery Van Everen: Just one on the Permian. We saw Matterhorn come online recently, and it's been flowing about, call it, 1.5 Bcf a day. I was curious if when that came online, you guys saw a production jump on the gas side on your Permian system? Or do we think most of that gas flowing right now is just shifting from other pipes?\nMarshall McCrea: This is Mackie. It's a great question. In fact, we didn't even though there was that much gas flowing on it. So that's news to us. We thought it was significantly less than that. But yes, for example, WTG, we are flowing gas off of those assets into Matterhorn. But other than that, as far as our assets go, we don't have direct access to it. So most of that gas is flowing through our own assets.\nZackery Van Everen: Got you. And then maybe going back to Warrior, it sounds like you're very close. Interesting that you note that, some of it will be a supply push, some demand pull. Based on conversations and contracting, do you have an idea of what that mix will be? And then is there a possibility that some of this gas connects into that South Mississippi project from Carthage and goes all the way over to that market?\nMarshall McCrea: It's Mackie again. Yes. I guess we wouldn't get the specifics exactly where all that's going. I guess I would answer your question this way. It's weighted a little bit heavier towards market pool than it is on producer push. But a lot of our customers will have the option. For example, if they're taking their gas to Carthage, yes, they'll have the ability to go through our Gulf Run or Tiger system into a project that we're looking at from a Perryville East. So it certainly could potentially feed that. But right now, our customers are kind of pulling in different directions going east, and we'll fill up a lot of our assets, both intrastate and interstate.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs.\nJohn Mackay: I wanted to maybe, again, just go back to Slide 5, like everyone else. Can you break this down a little bit for us maybe on what could be an inter-state opportunity versus what could come in the Texas intrastates. And I guess kind of the crux of what I'm thinking here is maybe time lines because we can obviously get it online a little faster probably in Texas than elsewhere. Just trying to frame up what that breakdown could look like.\nDylan Bramhall: Yes, I can answer that. There are so many projects that are out there, so many data centers and so many power plants even unrelated to data centers that we're chasing. It's probably a fair statement that we can move quicker and other companies can move quicker in Texas when looking at some of these other states. However, if you look at Arizona and some of the opportunities there around data centers, those could move fairly quickly. And then you look at some even up in the Midwest, there's some opportunities that may move fairly quickly as well. However, Texas certainly is probably the lead for us and where we're -- how far along we are with signing [indiscernible] agreements and actually showing cost and prices to some of those projects. And as I mentioned earlier, Texas, we have a little bit better ability to feed some of that out of our storage facilities, which some of these power plants are really going to be -- that support the data centers are really going to be peaker units. They're going to be pulling off the grid and then pulling gas if the grid goes down, but kind of long-winded answer to we agree with you that probably these opportunities will move a little bit quicker in Texas. But gosh, there's a lot of companies chasing all over our assets, and some of them may come quicker than we realize today.\nJohn Mackay: I appreciate that. And maybe just second one for me. Could you just give us an update post the WTG acquisition, how you're thinking about your Permian NGL position in terms of what your capacity is going to be versus what you guys can flow from your own plants?\nMarshall McCrea: Yes, great question. We're in the process of expanding our cross haul capacity on our Lone Star NGL line as we speak, and that should be completed, I believe, sometime middle of next year. and we're in good shape with what we've already signed up and what we're anticipating from WTG. But clearly, over the next 2 or 3 years, we see the volumes continue to grow, we will be looking at whether it's adding additional pumps or some type of pipeline looping because at some point, we will exceed the capacity which whenever dream would come so quickly years ago when we built all these 24 and 30-inch pipes. But right now, we're sitting pretty good, at least for the next 2 or 3 years to accommodate the contracts that we have today and what we kind of foresee on our assets over the next year or 2.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Tom Long for closing remarks.\nMarshall McCrea: Before we do that, this is Mackie. I was hoping somebody would ask a question about there's probably people in this room that are uncomfortable that I'm talking right now. But we had questions on an earlier call about the election. And I don't know what you guys think about it, but gosh, what an incredible refreshing, shocking result over the last 24 hours. This industry has gone through a lot over the last 4 years. And not only is this administration that is sensationalized and has misinformed and has through climate change fear mongering have really tried to influence Americans. And it's incredibly refreshing to see what happened 24 hours ago that Americans have woken up and at least the majority of Americans, more than half, recognized what was happening. And with this country, we have started with the constitution, the greatest document ever built the start of the country, and we have laws. And I believe that that's what this election is saying to the world and to this country is that the majority of Americans still believe in our country. They still believe that we should have law and order. They still believe that if you want to come to this country, it's a simple process. You just go through the legal process and you can enter. But when you have an administration that is, for all practical purposes, doing everything they can to allow tens of millions of people to come into this country over the last 4 years. When many of them probably are coming in are good people that just won't be an American dream, but look what's come with them. Look at all the drugs and the games and everything, and they're doing it for one reason for political power and just how insane and how sick is that at one of our parties is so enraged for political power they are willing to create safety issues for our country. So anyway, parlay that into the oil and gas industry and just the attack that we've had in the last 4 years, what a breadth of fresh air the Trump administration is going to bring. I mean, we all believe that we need to be regulated. We're not arguing that we don't need to be regulated. But what we're asking for is reasonable, not onerous regulation that can be done in a matter of a few years, instead of years and hundreds of not billions of dollars of getting projects in line. And then worse, when you get them in line, we're asking that the agencies trying to bully companies and allow the projects they have permits to go forward. I mean there are statutes that require permits to be done with certain periods of times that aren't being honored that are being ignored by these agencies. So we are so excited about what's happened in the last 24 days. We're excited for this country. We're excited for the world really for the international market that needs our LNG in the developing world that underbid world that's developing that needs our LPG. So what an incredible turn of events what's happened and especially for our partnership. I mean, we were talking this morning, we've been blessed and fortunate over the last year with the Kelcy's leadership and direction, all the great employees that we have an incredible assets that we have. We just in such a wonderful spot, but we believe that what happened yesterday, Energy Transfer has an incredible future for the next 3 or 4 years and many years to come. So we're very grateful and thankful and God is good. Things happen and it's time to heal our land and get back to where this all started years ago.\nUnknown Executive: Thank you all for joining us. We look forward to talking to you. Bye, bye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

And where we struggle a little bit or where our producers struggle a little bit, we're making it up in other areas of our pipeline business. Yes, Michael, this is Dylan again. Good question. I think as we've discussed the $2 billion to $3 billion. If you look at the slides we put out recently, we've called it illustrative, but we have started talking about a $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion run rate, and that's really just the result of just getting bigger as a company and bigger more opportunities and a number of acquisitions we've done recently that have added to the footprint. But -- and the additional cash flow that clearly supports a capital spend like that. But even within that, as we look out, we talk about some of these bigger projects that we're looking at, such as a Warrior the spend on those can be lumpy as they work. And so even though that's kind of an illustrative framework, we can be below or above that in any given year based on timing. Yes, I can answer that. There are so many projects that are out there, so many data centers and so many power plants even unrelated to data centers that we're chasing. It's probably a fair statement that we can move quicker and other companies can move quicker in Texas when looking at some of these other states. However, if you look at Arizona and some of the opportunities there around data centers, those could move fairly quickly. And then you look at some even up in the Midwest, there's some opportunities that may move fairly quickly as well. However, Texas certainly is probably the lead for us and where we're -- how far along we are with signing [indiscernible] agreements and actually showing cost and prices to some of those projects. And as I mentioned earlier, Texas, we have a little bit better ability to feed some of that out of our storage facilities, which some of these power plants are really going to be -- that support the data centers are really going to be peaker units. They're going to be pulling off the grid and then pulling gas if the grid goes down, but kind of long-winded answer to we agree with you that probably these opportunities will move a little bit quicker in Texas. But gosh, there's a lot of companies chasing all over our assets, and some of them may come quicker than we realize today."

            "name": "Marshall McCrea",
            "content": "Jimmy, this is Mackie. Certainly a question we anticipated. We've heard for 4 years how we're transitioning out of fossil fuels. And very clearly, we're going in a different direction. And even the liberals have figured out that we're transitioning into more natural gas and more natural gas liquids. So we feel very fortunate as a partnership looking at our assets throughout the United States, we can benefit with our footprint as described on the page that you referenced. So we're -- for the last 4 or 5 years, we've been chasing every possible power plant or a large gas consumer on any of our pipelines. This is kind of just a follow-up to that with this all of a sudden rush to build data centers and additional power plants. So we're way ahead of the curve. We are very excited about the opportunities this is going to create for our partnership throughout multiple states in the South and through the Midwest with our ability to move large volumes to these pipelines and our access to our own storage for immediate delivery to power plants where those services are necessary. We just are very excited about the future. In Tom's prepared remarks, we showed we're chasing like 16 Bcf. Do we expect to get that? No. But do we expect to get our fair share of that throughout these assets. And kind of a last comment on that. I was with the team last week, and we were looking through this. And it's ironic. It's almost crazy where a lot of these power plants and data centers are being potentially positioned are within 2 or 3 miles of our pipeline. It's almost like they had already come to us first and we're the most optimum places to our assets, whether they're close to cities or close to our storage facility. So we're really excited about where most of these data centers and power plants are going in close proximity to our system and our team is well prepared and down the road in a lot of negotiations to take advantage of those opportunities. Yes, Jeremy, this is Mackie again. That's another project that's needed kind of desperately over the next 4 or 5 years. The growth in natural gas demand on the East Coast and Florida is just enormous, and it's going up by the day because of population, everything else. And so we do have an open season out there. We have a tremendous response, a lot of interest, the forward curve from kind of Perryville area to Florida are enormous. So we're very excited of that. It's way premature on kind of timing of how that will go and the capital involved, but we do see an opportunity there, and we think there's a real possibility, we'll be a part of that growth. Yes. Yes, I know I said on the last call that I'd be disappointed if we didn't announce it. We're certainly not on this call, going to announce FID, but I won't say we're disappointed. We've made tremendous progress. We are very likely, within weeks, getting to FID. We're not there yet, but we've made a lot of strides. It's a unique pipeline in that it is producer push to a certain degree, but it's also a market pull. So it's both directions needed. It ties into -- I was trying to describe this. Most of you all probably know our system well. But if you think about energy intrastate system in Texas. It's almost like a hand that extends out of the fourth basin, where we have a pipeline, 36-inch going to Northeast Texas, connected to multiple 42-inch pipes. We had two 42 inches going to cartage or our intrastate markets as well as interstate pipelines there. We also have two of our own pipelines. We have a 42-inch that goes down to Southeast, kind of Port Arthur, Texas, where we tie to -- or tied to interstate pipelines as well as Golden Pass and Sempra and just a lot of upside there, and of course, 42 and 36 that ultimately goes to Katy and the Houston Ship Channel. And of course, we have pipelines -- our Houston pipeline system that goes to Agua Dulce. So we're so uniquely set up to take advantage of offering the most flexibility to all of these markets. What we're missing is years ago when we built the first, second, third 42 and 36-inch pipes on the fourth Basin, we anticipated that basin being at 8 9,10 Bcf by now. Well with what happened just population growth there and really what happened was all these other shelves that became more profitable and made more sense for producers, it slowed down dramatically. So we had a lot of idle -- not idle, a lot of underused capacity. We're using all these pipes, but we've got capacity unutilized. And so water is exciting and that it's going to be a great project for us, but it's also going to benefit from this underutilized capacity to go to all these points I just described. And so we hope to be to FID, if it's not days in the coming weeks, we actually have already locked in an option to purchase steel. So we know that price for the majority of the steel. We feel good about that. And we're kind of structuring this where we anticipate announcing it when we get to FID, if we do, and it will be a good project with a good rate of return, where we'll have the ability to add compression in the future, a significant amount to move 700,000, 800,000 more than what we anticipated initially, and the reason that's important, that's why we'll feed all these new power plants that are coming on, all these new data centers that are happening. So it's an important project for us, and we do intend to get it to the finish line. Well, I'm looking at Tom Mason and he's assured me and his team that once Trump elected, and we get some rational, reasonable people running this country that we will get that to FID. So we're very excited about that. We've still got a lot of work to do. We've got partners we'll need to bring in the course financing, but we do have a lot of momentum. We hope to announce some significant new markets that we've signed up by the end of the year. We've got a good EPC contract executed, and we're very optimistic that what happened yesterday is going to really help that and many other parts of our business to move forward. So yes, we're very bullish on getting LNG to finish line. Yes. What a great question. Everybody is kind of focused going east, and there -- it's probably likely there's going to be a need going west and I'll kind of leave it at that for this point. But to answer your question more directly, not a lot we can do to significantly increase from an efficiency standpoint, the volumes going we're pretty maxed out when you look at kind of how the contracts are structured where our compression is, we can't move a whole lot more, but we certainly think there's some potential for projects to move more gas to the west at some point. Yes. This is Mackie again. Gosh, WTG was a great acquisition. We're so excited about it. We identified some issues that we knew we would have to deal with when we closed, and we started dealing with those. We have running some other issues around the existing plants and even the plant that was built as we were closing. We're working through those issues, and like I said, we're so bullish. We have incredible amount of just high-quality acreage, hundreds of thousands of acres dedicated to those assets. And on top of that, we have hundreds of thousands of acres that are top leased that right now are going to somebody else, but in future years will come to us. So what a great asset just stand alone from a GMP perspective. But then when you add on the -- what it's going to do for our NGL and downstream business there as well as feeding into our pipelines. We're very excited about what that acquisition is going to do for our partnership. And then jumping over to Sunoco, I don't know how many of you guys follow them, but listened to their call this morning, and Joe Kim and Karl Fails, most guys have done an unbelievable job with that partnership. They -- not only the mass amount of distribution on fine products but also the terminals, not only here, but in Europe, they're just doing a an incredible job and NuStar put them into a much bigger way in the midstream business. And what a perfect fit for us. We have a pretty extensive system throughout the Permian Basin, but coincidentally, we just didn't have a big presence in Howard County in Dawson and some of those counties where the new store assets were. So it was just a perfect situation to form a JV that kind of benefited in three ways. One, where we can offer a really good service to those producers. And then two, where we can benefit from a classic case of kind of 1 plus 1 is more than 2. This is one of those situations. We've already identified numerous blending opportunities, lending the third parties, exchanging barrels, feeding our downstream pipeline system. So we're very excited about the progress we made on the integration, and we're also excited about the growth opportunities that we're seeing in those assets and Sunoco is already great partners with us. They're partners on the JC Nolan line, moving diesel from Houston to the Permian Basin. And so we look forward to growing this partnership with them and excited to be a part of it. You bet. This is Mackie again. Yes, I guess the way we answer that question is we don't look at it any differently. We've got IRR, rate of return hurdles that we look to meet on all of our projects that make sense. We also look for other synergistic revenues that are tied to our projects. But as far as the competitive aspect to your question, gosh, we sit in a great spot. If you could just look at where we're looking at some of these significant data centers, especially in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, there's just nobody that can provide the service that we can for the price that we can. We've got big diameter pipe, especially if we can get Warrior to finish line. That's going to be a huge influx of the Permian Basin supply. We have unparalleled ability to get move gas around the state from our storage facilities. We have massive storage and ability to increase our storage in the DFW area as well as down around Houston. So, yes, there's going to be a lot of competition. As I said earlier, do we expect to get 16 Bcf? No. We do expect to get our fair share. And in Texas, a considerable part of that as well as we're optimistic in other states. And so we think we will look to achieve the same return hurdles that we do on all of our projects, and we're quite confident that we'll be able to do that on a pretty significant volume. You bet. This is Mackie again. Once again, we are on track for the third quarter. We need it for all the products that are coming in. We're excited about that. It's a little bit difficult to exactly answer that question because it is 250,000 barrels a day. But as we continue to fully contract the facility there may be a little bit more ethane or a little bit less ethane depending on the LPG contracts and also the ethylene part of it. But for the most part, we expect it to be fully contracted. Typically, these aren't 7- to 10-year agreements, they're 3- to 5-year agreements, but we not only expect to be fully contracted, the international demand for ethane and LPG continues to grow through the roof with all the PDHs built throughout the world, especially in China, and there's just an insatiable demand for LPG all over the world. And so we are trying to stay ahead of that. We're very bullish on what we're doing at Nederland, and we will definitely be expanding beyond what we're doing today. Yes. Gabe, this is Mackie again. Yes, we've already announced a course Badger that's under construction and will be online next year. We just brought on Red Lake 3 kind of getting that lined out as we speak. We've got Red Lake 4 coming on in the second quarter of next year. We've got another project that's not fully to FID, but close called Mustang Draw, which will be in the Midland Basin to try to stay ahead of the growth behind WTG and other Midland growth. We're also looking at another plant in the Delaware. We're still in the process of increasing our capacity in Red Bluff and other plants in West Texas, where we are just adding compression and increased capacity fairly significantly. So we don't really pay attention or worry about what others are announcing. We're just worried about what we've contracted and stand ahead of that, and we have a consistent pipeline of what we've already announced and what we see in the future with just phenomenal continued growth out of the Permian Basin that just keeps giving. And with the new Barnett and Woodford type plays that are kind of being discovered in the Central Basin, we just continue to be, I guess, very fortunate to have such a big asset base in that basin. Yes, Michael, this is Mackie. We bought the Sabina assets a while back. We -- Sabina 2, we will bring on service first quarter of next year, excited about that. We anticipated a number of barrels to make that a good project for us. We actually are close to closing twice that amount of barrels. So that's a natural gasoline project that we're very excited about. And what came with that asset was also Sabina 1, which gets us across the ship channel over to some crackers. And we're chasing a number of opportunities there. So we still got some work to do. to fully benefit from what that pipeline can offer our partnership, but we're very excited about what's happening on Sabina 2 and the revenues that will start flowing in the first quarter of next year. This is Mackie. It's a great question. In fact, we didn't even though there was that much gas flowing on it. So that's news to us. We thought it was significantly less than that. But yes, for example, WTG, we are flowing gas off of those assets into Matterhorn. But other than that, as far as our assets go, we don't have direct access to it. So most of that gas is flowing through our own assets. It's Mackie again. Yes. I guess we wouldn't get the specifics exactly where all that's going. I guess I would answer your question this way. It's weighted a little bit heavier towards market pool than it is on producer push. But a lot of our customers will have the option. For example, if they're taking their gas to Carthage, yes, they'll have the ability to go through our Gulf Run or Tiger system into a project that we're looking at from a Perryville East. So it certainly could potentially feed that. But right now, our customers are kind of pulling in different directions going east, and we'll fill up a lot of our assets, both intrastate and interstate. Yes, great question. We're in the process of expanding our cross haul capacity on our Lone Star NGL line as we speak, and that should be completed, I believe, sometime middle of next year. and we're in good shape with what we've already signed up and what we're anticipating from WTG. But clearly, over the next 2 or 3 years, we see the volumes continue to grow, we will be looking at whether it's adding additional pumps or some type of pipeline looping because at some point, we will exceed the capacity which whenever dream would come so quickly years ago when we built all these 24 and 30-inch pipes. But right now, we're sitting pretty good, at least for the next 2 or 3 years to accommodate the contracts that we have today and what we kind of foresee on our assets over the next year or 2. Before we do that, this is Mackie. I was hoping somebody would ask a question about there's probably people in this room that are uncomfortable that I'm talking right now. But we had questions on an earlier call about the election. And I don't know what you guys think about it, but gosh, what an incredible refreshing, shocking result over the last 24 hours. This industry has gone through a lot over the last 4 years. And not only is this administration that is sensationalized and has misinformed and has through climate change fear mongering have really tried to influence Americans. And it's incredibly refreshing to see what happened 24 hours ago that Americans have woken up and at least the majority of Americans, more than half, recognized what was happening. And with this country, we have started with the constitution, the greatest document ever built the start of the country, and we have laws. And I believe that that's what this election is saying to the world and to this country is that the majority of Americans still believe in our country. They still believe that we should have law and order. They still believe that if you want to come to this country, it's a simple process. You just go through the legal process and you can enter. But when you have an administration that is, for all practical purposes, doing everything they can to allow tens of millions of people to come into this country over the last 4 years. When many of them probably are coming in are good people that just won't be an American dream, but look what's come with them. Look at all the drugs and the games and everything, and they're doing it for one reason for political power and just how insane and how sick is that at one of our parties is so enraged for political power they are willing to create safety issues for our country. So anyway, parlay that into the oil and gas industry and just the attack that we've had in the last 4 years, what a breadth of fresh air the Trump administration is going to bring. I mean, we all believe that we need to be regulated. We're not arguing that we don't need to be regulated. But what we're asking for is reasonable, not onerous regulation that can be done in a matter of a few years, instead of years and hundreds of not billions of dollars of getting projects in line. And then worse, when you get them in line, we're asking that the agencies trying to bully companies and allow the projects they have permits to go forward. I mean there are statutes that require permits to be done with certain periods of times that aren't being honored that are being ignored by these agencies. So we are so excited about what's happened in the last 24 days. We're excited for this country. We're excited for the world really for the international market that needs our LNG in the developing world that underbid world that's developing that needs our LPG. So what an incredible turn of events what's happened and especially for our partnership. I mean, we were talking this morning, we've been blessed and fortunate over the last year with the Kelcy's leadership and direction, all the great employees that we have an incredible assets that we have. We just in such a wonderful spot, but we believe that what happened yesterday, Energy Transfer has an incredible future for the next 3 or 4 years and many years to come. So we're very grateful and thankful and God is good. Things happen and it's time to heal our land and get back to where this all started years ago."

            "name": "Thomas Long",
            "content": "Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team who are going to be able to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon. As a reminder, our earnings release contains a thorough MD&A that goes through the segment results in detail, and we encourage everyone to look at their release as well as the slides posted to our website to gain a full understanding of the quarter and our growth opportunities. Also as a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which we expect to file tomorrow, November 7. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. Let's start with the financial results. For the third quarter of 2024, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.96 billion. compared to $3.54 billion for the third quarter of 2023. We had record volumes through our crude oil midstream gathering and NGL pipelines as well as through our NGL fractionators. In addition, we saw strong crude and NGL exports during the quarter and increased volumes through our refined products pipelines. DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, was $1.99 billion, consistent with the third quarter of last year. And for the first 9 months of 2024, we spent approximately $1.7 billion on organic growth capital, primarily in the Midstream and NGL and refined products segments, excluding SUN and USA Compression CapEx. Now turning results by segment for the third quarter. We'll start with NGL and Refined Products. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.01 billion compared to $1.08 billion for the third quarter of 2023. This was primarily due to growth across our Mariner East pipeline operations as well as strong NGL exports which were offset by lower gains from the optimization of hedged NGL inventory as we recognized over $100 million in gains in the third quarter of last year compared to $30 million this year. For Midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $816 million compared to $631 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford as well as the addition of the Crestwood and WTG assets in November 2023 and July 2024, respectively. In addition, during the quarter, we recognized $70 million in proceeds from a onetime business interruption claim. For the Crude Oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $768 million compared to $706 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to record crude oil transportation throughput, higher crude oil exports, which were up 49%, the recently formed Permian joint venture with SUN as well as the acquisition of the Crestwood and WTG assets. Excluding these acquisitions, crude oil transportation throughput on our base business increased 4%. For the interstate natural gas segment, adjusted EBITDA was $460 million compared to $491 million for the third quarter of 2023. During the quarter, we saw higher demand on Panhandle, Trunkline and Gulf Run. This was offset by lower IT utilization in dry gas areas due to the lower gas prices and weaker spreads. Additionally, we had higher operating expenses primarily due to a onetime benefit recorded in the third quarter of 2023 that reduced operating expenses and increased maintenance project costs. And for the intrastate natural gas segment, adjusted EBITDA was $329 million compared to $244 million in the third quarter of last year. The increase was primarily due to approximately $100 million of increased gains related to pipeline optimization opportunities. Turning to our recently completed acquisition of WTG which enhances our Permian Basin operations and downstream businesses. Integration of the combined assets is underway, and we have recently approved several projects that are expected to enhance reliability, reduce losses and improve the overall efficiencies of the system for our customers. Also in July, Energy Transfer and Sunoco LP announced the formation of a joint venture combining their respective crude oil and produced water gathering assets in the Permian Basin. We're making good progress on integrating the combined systems and are executing on synergies and growth opportunities that will drive additional value while expanding our market and service offerings for our customers. No turning to our 2024 organic growth capital guidance and our growth projects, we now expect 2024 growth capital expenditures to be approximately $2.9 billion. which will be spent primarily in the NGL and Refined Products and Midstream segments. At our Nederland Terminal, construction of the expansions to our NGL export capacity continues to progress. and the project remains on schedule for an anticipated in-service for the initial phase in mid-2025. At Mont Belvieu, as mentioned on our last call, we have approved our ninth fractionator, which will have a design capacity of 165,000 barrels per day and is expected to be in service in Q4 of 2026. This will bring our total fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu to more than 1.3 million barrels per day. Taking a look at our Permian processing expansions. We recently completed the 50 million cubic foot per day upgrade to our Orla East processing plant. And construction continues on upgrades to three other processing facilities, which will add incremental processing capacity in West Texas of approximately 150 million cubic feet per day. Additionally, construction of the 200 million cubic feet per day Badger processing plant in the Permian Basin is underway. As a reminder, this plant, which is expected to be in service in mid-2025, will utilize an idle plant that is being relocated to the Delaware Basin. Looking at our crude assets, we recently completed construction of a 30-mile pipeline to add a direct connection from Midland to our pipeline that flows from the Permian Basin to Cushing. As a result, we are now able to transport approximately 100,000 barrels per day of crude oil from our terminals in Midland, Texas to our terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma. For a brief update around power generation opportunities. With forecasted AI and data center growth creating rising electrical needs, and the necessity for grid reliability becoming increasingly important, it is clear that natural gas will play a significant role in helping meet this demand. Given Energy Transfer's extensive interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline footprint, we are the best positioned to capitalize on the anticipated rise in natural gas demand for AI data centers, natural gas power plants and industrial and onshore manufacturing for decades to come. We have never seen this level of activity from a demand pull standpoint and these opportunities are truly spread across our natural gas footprint from Arizona to Florida and from Texas to Michigan. We currently serve gas-fired power plants in 15 states with approximately 185 plants served via direct or indirect connections throughout these states, and our opportunities have only increased since our last call. We have had requests to connect to approximately 45 power plants that we do not currently serve in 11 states that in aggregate could consume gas loads up to 6 Bcf per day. In addition, we have had requests from over 40 prospective data centers in 10 states. These data centers in aggregate could consume gas loads up to 10 Bcf per day. Some of these may be behind the electric meter for reliability purposes. Many of these developers are still working to determine optimal locations and are seeking information on pipeline proximity and cost to connect. In addition to support our own operations and increase system reliability for Energy Transfer and our customers in Texas, we have started construction on eight 10-megawatt natural gas-fired electric generation facilities. The first of these facilities is expected to be in service in the first quarter of next year, with the remainder expected to be in service throughout 2025 and 2026. We also continue to make progress on the development of several other growth projects, including our Lone Star pipe optimizations, Warrior, Blue Marlin offshore oil project like Charles LNG, a carbon capture and sequestration project with CapturePoint, and Blue Ammonia hubs at Lake Charles and Nederland. We look forward to providing more updates on these projects as customer discussions advance, and we bring them closer to FID. Looking at EBITDA guidance. We continue to expect 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be between $15.3 billion to $15.5 billion. Our results reflect the strength of our assets and the benefit of having a diverse geographic footprint and multiple product offerings. We remain excited about our business and the demand for these products and our services, both domestically and internationally. We have seen a wide range of estimates for new power demand and the broad consensus suggests that natural gas fuel power demand will increase significantly in the future. We are already seeing increasing power needs across several of our natural gas pipelines driven by AI, data center and power plant growth. Given our extensive natural gas pipeline network, particularly in Texas and Oklahoma, we believe that Energy Transfer is one of the best positioned companies in the industry to help meet this demand. We also continue to maintain a strong liquidity position with a balance sheet that allows the flexibility to fund organic growth opportunities while also further reducing our leverage, maintaining our targeted distribution growth rate and increasing equity returns to our unitholders. This now concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line up for our first question. Short answer is no. Keith. We don't have any headwinds going into the quarter. But as you know, we're always fairly conservative as to how we forecast out and the guidance numbers we put out there. So here's the two items that I would put back at you. Number one, we don't have anything baked in for optimization that could possibly occur during the quarter. So we'll see how -- as we get through the end of December, what may present itself. But the second item is really around the natural gas spreads across Texas. And right now, we're staying pretty conservative as we look out. But a few differing views based upon how those spreads move up and down, and they can be pretty volatile. But even if you look at the month of October, you can see they stayed pretty strong. So once again, that's another upside. So if you take those two items in, you can see that we will clearly be at the top end of that range, depending on what view you have."

I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You will find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'll start today by going over our financial results, for the second quarter of 2024, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.76 billion, compared to $3.1 million for the second quarter of 2023. This number includes over $80 million of transaction expense. Absent these transaction cost, adjusted EBITDA would have been over $3.8 billion. We had record volumes through our crude oil and NGL pipelines, as well as record NGL exports. We also saw strong performance from our NGL fractionators and our refined products pipelines and terminals. DCF a trivial to the partners of Energy Transfer as adjusted was $2 billion compared to $1.6 billion for the second quarter of 2023. And for the six months of 2024, we spent approximately $1 billion on organic growth capital, primarily in the midstream and NGL and Refined Products segments, excluding SUN and USA compression CapEx. Now turning to our results by segment for the second quarter and let's start with NGL and Refined Products. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.07 billion, compared to $837 million for the second quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to growth across our transportation, fractionation and terminal operations including records in both Mariner East and Permian Pipeline volumes, as well as NGL exports. In addition, we had higher gains from the optimization of hedged NGL inventory. For Midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $693 million, compared to $579 million for the second quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the addition of the Crestwood assets as well as higher volumes in the Permian Basin. For our Crude Oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $801 million compared to $674 million for the second quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to record crude oil transportation throughput. And increase in our total crude oil exports, which were up 11% as well as the acquisitions of the Lotus and Crestwood assets in May and November of 2023 respectively. Excluding these acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA and Crude Oil transportation volumes on our base business increased 4% and 8% respectively. In our Interstate segment, adjusted EBA was $392 million compared to $441 million the second quarter of 2023. During the quarter, we saw higher contracted volumes on Trunk Line, Pebble, Gulf Run & MRT. This was offset by lower operational gas sales, maintenance project cost of $12 million, as well as a $35 million reduction in revenue for shipper refunds related to our Pebble rate case. For the Intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $328 million, compared to $216 million in the second quarter of last year. The increase was primarily due to approximately $75 million of an increased gains related to pipeline optimization opportunities, as well as favorable storage optimization opportunities. In July 2024, Energy Transfer completed the acquisition of WTG, which provides Energy Transfer with increased access to growing supplies of natural gas and NGL volumes and enhances our Permian operations and downstream businesses. Integration of the combined assets is underway and we are really excited about great customer base and the growing gas supply behind this asset. Since closing the transaction, the $200 million cubic foot per day Red Lake 3 processing plant was placed into service. We expect volumes to ramp up quickly as more residue takeaway becomes available. Also in July 2024. Energy Transfer and Sunoco LP announced the formation of joint venture combining the respective crude oil and produced water gathering assets in the Permian Basin. This is another exciting opportunity that highlights the creativity and optionality our family of partnerships brings to the table when we work together to expand our market and service offerings for our customers. Now turning to our growth projects and starting with our Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals. Construction of the expansions to our NGL export capacity at Nederland continues to progress and we remain on schedule for anticipated in service in Mid-2025 for the initial phases of the project. And at our Marcus Hook terminal, construction continues to rest[Ph] on the first phase of an optimization project. Turning to Lone Star Express, our 90,000 barrels per day expansion project remains on schedule to be in service in 2026 bringing our total capacity of NGL transportation to over 1 million barrels per day out of the Permian Basin. We recently approved our ninth fractionator at Mont Belvieu, frac 9 will have a design capacity of 165,000 barrels per day and is expected to be in service in Q4 of 2026. This will bring our total fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu to more than 1.3 million barrels per day. In addition, we recently placed a previously unutilized 2 million barrels butane storage well back into service, bringing our current NGL storage capacity of Mont Belvieu to approximately 62 million barrels. Now taking a look at our Permian processing expansions. Construction continues on upgrades to our existing processing facilities, which will add approximately 200 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity in West Texas and in June we announced plans to construct the 200 million cubic feet per day Badger processing plant in the Permian Basin. This plant which is expected to be in service in Mid 2025 will utilize an idle plant that is to be relocated to the Delaware Basin, which will help save capital versus building a new plant. In North Louisiana, we placed trains one and two of our Ajax treating facility into service in July. These trains have a combined treating capacity of approximately 300 million cubic feet per day. Now for a brief update on our opportunities around Pap generation with forecast for electricity demand growth becoming increasingly bullish and the need for grid reliability becoming progressively more important, it is clear that natural gas will play a significant role in helping meet this demand. Given Energy Transfer\u2019s extensive Interstate and Intrastate natural gas pipeline footprint, we believe we are extremely well positioned to benefit from the anticipated rise in natural gas needs. We currently serve gas fired power plants in 15 States with approximately 185 plants served via direct or indirect connections throughout these states and we have recently signed deals across our systems to provide gas loads of over 500,000 MMBtus per day. In addition, as mentioned last quarter, we have approved the construction of eight 10 megawatt natural gas fired electric generation facilities to support the Partnership\u2019s operations in Texas. We continue to expect these facilities to go into service throughout 2025 and 2026. These facilities are expected to increase system reliability for Energy Transfer and for our customers. We also continue to make progress on the development of several other growth projects including our Warrior, Blue Marlin offshore project, Lake Charles LNG, a carbon capture and sequestration project with capture point and blue ammonia hubs at Lake Charles and Nederland. We look forward to providing more updates on these projects as customer discussions advance and we bring them closer to FID. Looking ahead at our 2024 organic growth capital guidance, we now expect 2024 growth capital expenditures to be approximately $3.1 billion, which will be spent primarily in the NGL and refined products and Midstream segments. The primary driver of the increases from our previous guidance of $2.9 billion is the addition of growth capital related to WTG and quicker returning projects in the Crude Oil segment related to the Crestwood acquisition. Now turning to our adjusted EBITDA guidance. We are raising our 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to be between $15.3 billion to $15.5 billion, compared to our prior guidance range of $15 billion to $15.3 billion. Our 2024 guidance has been updated to include our acquisition of WTG, which closed on July 15th and outperformance in the base business even with over $100 million transaction cost also included within our full year guidance. We continue to be excited about our business and the demand for our products and services both domestically and internationally. We're in a strong position to help meet this demand with strategic optimization and expansion projects that enhance our existing asset base and generate attractive returns. And we expect to maintain the flexibility to balance organic growth opportunities with further leverage reduction maintaining our targeted distribution growth rates and increasing equity returns to our unit holders. In addition, we are pleased to see that in June, Moody's upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating to be double A 2, which further demonstrates the strides that we have made to strengthen our balance sheet and financial position This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line up for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet : Hi, good afternoon.\nTom Long: Good afternoon, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet : Just wanted to start off if I could, appreciate the color on the call, but as it relates to WTG with a month in the books, I was just wondering if you could talk a bit more I guess, and what you see as far as the commercial opportunities there and similarly, with the JV with SUN and NuStar just wondering what new opportunities that you see in front of you post these deals?\nMackie McCrea: Hey Jeremy, this is Mackey. I\u2019ll start with the first one. We're very excited about WTG. Excuse me. As you just said, we're barely almost a month into it. We still have a lot of rocks to turnover but we couldn\u2019t be more excited not only just the asset itself and it\u2019s very credit worthy producers that are supporting that long-term large acreage dedications and all that discuss and support the cryos. But what\u2019s even more exciting to us that we don\u2019t even put in our numbers when we do acquisitions like this to had kind of really feed into our residue business, our downstream residue business as well as Lone Star NGL transport and fractionation business. So we're just getting our arms around it. We're very excited about, there's enormous growth in that part of the Midland Basin that we have had little exposure to on the gas side. So we're very excited and looking forward to a lot of good things coming out of that acquisition. With NuStar, we\u2019re excited about that too. Joe Kim has done an incredible job growing Sunoco. They\u2019ve kind of been in different areas and they're evolving kind of entire areas. The pipeline side and we welcome we have a really good partnership with them right now and JC Nolan that\u2019s got really - what\u2019s gone really well moving diesel from the Gulf Coast to West Texas. We've got some deals with them up in the Northeast on transporting our refined products and a lot of stuff going on. With the great partners we look very much forward to what we're going to do with them and that JV. Once again, new news, we're getting our arms around that. But the bottom-line is that's going to be a lot better for both our partnerships than just one-on-one it's going to be a lot add up to a lot more than three or four on what we're already seeing provide a lot of benefits to the producers out there as we team up, but also a lot of downstream value for both our partnerships. So we're excited about to both of them.\nJeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you and just want to pivot to the Permian itself, if I could, curious how you guys see the egress situation right now across the three different hydrocarbon chains and the need for incremental takeaway, do you still see more discussion with Warrior at this point? And how do you think about the Crude Oil takeaway side as well?\nMackie McCrea: Okay, I'll tell you about \u2013 I\u2019ll start with the Crude Oil. We don't see a lot with Crude Oil. We do see there need to be quite a bit more growth to fill up what's there? We're probably a year or two away from any concerns around that at least from our business standpoint, but we'll certainly keep an eye on that. But on Warrior, yeah, we've had some questions both internally but mainly externally about what does the announcement going to [Indiscernible] do at Warrior. I\u2019ll just summarize that as zero. The vast majority of the customers that we've already signed up and that we're pressing the sign of over the next 60 to 90 days have no desire for either the their gas to be in South Texas or the markets that are supporting this project. So by no means is that slowing us down. We're very and I know we've talked about this quarter after quarter, but it has picked up steam. There is a tremendous market east not south but east heading through Texas and other parts of the country really. And so we're very excited about where we sit on Warrior and I'll just say that I'll be disappointed certainly am implying that we're almost FID but I'll be disappointed if we're not announcing FID by our next earnings call. We are working hard and we'll see if we can get there. If we do announce that it will be fully sold out. We are not going to take any risk on overbuilding out of that basin but there is still a lot of gas and oil growth for many years to come out of that basin in our opinion. And then a last one, we mentioned all three, but NGLs we never worry about what others are doing around NGLs. We will build the necessary pipelines to move NGLs out of that area to meet the contracts we have with our customers.\nJeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you for that.\nMackie McCrea: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs.\nJohn Mackay: Hey, good morning, good afternoon. Thanks for the time. I wanted to and you touched on a couple of these drivers, but maybe just a little more on the underlying business performance for the guidance update. Maybe just a little more color there and kind of how that looks for the back half of the year?\nTom Long: Yeah John, this is, Tom. I\u2019ll start and then Mackie can add more on. As we said in the prepared to march with feel very good about the base business and that's the reason why we've were able to bring it up in addition to the acquisitions, not just the WTG. So. When you really look at it, I think the optimization group, a lot of the stuff we've been able to do, we just continue to be able to see additional benefits as we look out over the year. But no, it was great to be able to continue to walk the guidance up for the year, even in this commodity environment because as you know we get a lot of extra pop, when natural gas prices are up - higher et cetera, but even with that we're able to continue to extract good value out of the optimization group, so.\nJohn Mackay: And then if we\u2019re - thanks for that. If we're looking at the CapEx side, obviously talking about WTG as a bit of a new growth platform to your point on the Midland side. Maybe if you could just frame up kind of how you're thinking about you're broader CapEx look at CapEx look over the next couple years now the footprint is bigger, now that you\u2019ve kind of pulled into some of the NuStar assets as well. How that should trend versus your two to three you\u2019ve talked about in the past?\nTom Long: That\u2019s actually a very, very good question As you know, we just now closed on these some of these transactions and we are working through it right now. So, we'll - as usual we'll come out with our 2025 guidance whenever we get to the fourth quarter earnings release and at that time, we will have able to scrub kind of the normal runrate, but you absolutely nailed it. With our growth and our scale our size and with everything we're doing, let us scrub that a little bit more. So we won't just do give you the 2025 number. We will also kind of give you that ongoing runrate. But as of right now, we've always had that $2 billion to $3 billion. It if anything it'll be it'll be probably at that $3 billion. But let us let us do some more work on that before you give any official long-term runrate.\nJohn Mackay: Okay. That makes sense. Appreciate the time. Thank you.\nTom Long: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes with Keith Stanley with Wolf Research.\nKeith Stanley: Hi, good afternoon. First just wanted to ask on M&A. Most of your recent deals including WTG and then buying G&P businesses and leveraging the NGLs. Is that still the main focus for future M&A? Or could you broaden it out? And then, with the with the JV with SUN could that that partnership potentially play a role in M&A or is the JV exclusively about optimizing the existing assets?\nMackie McCrea: Yeah, I will start with the end of that question, yeah right now the way that is structured the JV in the Midland basin is not to go out and acquire it. That\u2019s not to say that if there is some gathering assets or other assets in that area that fall kind of within that AMI that we wouldn't approach that together and that\u2019s certainly in our agreement with them. But right now, the main focus is really developing out those systems together and achieve as much of the upside that we can't downstream of that partnership with our other businesses and further downstream revenues.\nTom Long: Yeah, and listen, I'll chime in here. This is Tom kind of the first part of your question just in general where we focus. First off, we still felt like consolidation is going to occur in the Midstream similar to what is happening in the Midstream and when you see how diversified we are across all the commodities and we go all the way from the wellhead to the water to our export facilities. We're looking really pretty much across the board. We wouldn't want to dial into any specific area, but the way you ask the question was actually very good, just like what Mackie said on the WTG. We are able to extract a lot of benefits downstream. When we, let's say get into the gathering and processing and it's across all the commodities. It's not tied to any one commodity. So, we think that we still have a lot of opportunities there and we're going to continue to evaluate those opportunities.\nKeith Stanley: Thanks for that. Second question with HH moving to NGL service out of the Bakken has that impacted discussions on recontracting Dakota access at all? How are you thinking about recontracting on Dakota access in terms of the timing and terms you're looking for?\nMackie McCrea: Yeah, Keith, this Mackie. Not that hadn't released spurred any new thoughts around that. I guess, I\u2019d summarize where we're at. We are kind of the pipeline of choice out of their as we move more than 50% of the barrels out of the Bakken. We do have the ability to move significantly more if there's any growth and it's already done our appealing if there's going to be 60,000 to 80,000 barrels, that was leaving the basin now, we will be looking for another way out because we think we will continue to move the majority of the barrels out of that region. But we do think that we will end up and sooner than later, growing or extending some of the agreements that we have but we really don't have a lot of angst or concern of the reasons I just said. We offer more flexibility by going to the Mid-Continent refineries and of course all the way down to the Gulf Coast to the Beaumont, Houston area, as well as [Indiscernible] Bridge. So we just its unparalleled with the flexibility and the optionality that we're giving for producers. So we sit in very good position and we\u2019re very confident that we will keep Dakota access full at healthy spreads for many years.\nKeith Stanley: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays.\nTheresa Chen: Good afternoon. Going back. To the comments related to downstream synergies following the formation of the Permian JV with SUN. Can you talk about what timeframe the long haul pipeline commitments rollover from the legacy NuStar gathering system for the barrels that are not already on your long haul system?\nMackie McCrea: Yeah, Theresa, this is Mackie again. No most of the business that NuStar had now Sunoco in our JV is just gathering. So it's gathering that basin and it's delivered to pipelines like Energy Transfer or other competing pipelines in the area. So that JV is a large area of the AMI that encompasses Energy Transfer old gathering business in the Permian Basin. But does not include any of the downstream pipelines for example that go to Nederland or up to Cushing. So that\u2019s we're going to work very closely with NuStars I mean, sorry with Sunoco go as part of that JV but that just confined in the gathering part of that business\nTheresa Chen: Right, I meant to ask were the barrels that are not committed onto Permian Express, when can you roll them on to Permian Express over the next few years?\nMackie McCrea: I\u2019d answer it like this is that, we're probably gathering 1.5 million barrels and we can move less than that out of it. So we don't have any necessarily dedicated barrels from any particular area other than shippers that taken space on our pipeline systems. So, right now, really couldn't say what exact molecules will come from this JV may feed into our downstream business. We kind of take it as a whole. Also, there's different qualities of oil, whether it's WTL or WTI to come involve. So there is a lot more kind of thought process going into this, but yeah at the end of the day, certainly this JV the business of gathering will continue to feed our downstream business both to Nederland to our Houston terminal, as well as one day hopefully to our Blue Marlin project.\nTheresa Chen: Got it. And can you just provide us some incremental detail on the marketing strengths in the NGLs and Refined Products segment this quarter? What drove that and how much of that is repeatable?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes Theresa, hi this is this is Dylan[Ph]. So that that NGL marketing line items a lot of activities go into that. Various optimization in the Gulf Coast and the northeast. Over the last quarter, where we really saw the great performance is from the Gulf Coast NGL group. It had a really strong quarter. And it's really comparing back to the second quarter last year when we did have an LCM right down on hedged inventory. And additionally, that we also had some strong margins from both the butane and gasoline blending businesses in the northeast.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Spiro Dounis with Citi.\nSpiro Dounis: Thanks everyone. Afternoon team. First question actually wanted to ask you guys about your global growth ambitions. I know in the past you've talked about an NGL Panama pipeline. And recently your name is sort of mentioned alongside another South American oil and gas project. And so I respect the amount of able to talk about projects specifics, but just curious do you have ambitions to grow on a global level and is that\u2019s something that you do under the MLP structure?\nTom Long: Yes, this is Tom. That's the quick answer. We think it's the right thing to do for our partnership here. It makes a lot of sense with all that we've built out across all the commodities. So we continue to evaluate it \u2013 evaluate various opportunities when you look across the globe. I will tell you that we will always be very careful with any risk. As we look at these, we'll make sure they're good fits for us that we can bring a lot of value. But we're well aware of the risk - country risk et cetera that come along with each of these. And it's but we once again think that we've got the right team to be able to extract value when you look out globally. But we will \u2013 like I said it'll be credit risk, country risk, et cetera. And when you get involved with some of the - some of these various companies that are in these other countries, you can do a lot of stuff with them globally when you look at it. So we will continue at least to evaluate but be very thorough in our evaluation\nSpiro Dounis: Got it. Helpful, Tom. And maybe to switch gears back domestically. This power demand or powergen demand piece just kind of really snuck up on a lot of the market here and it sounds like you all have a few irons in the fire even on the datacenter side. So, just curious you get frame for us how you're thinking about the timing of when some of these projects starts to show up in earnings? And maybe as we think about the scope and size are we talking about Greenfield expansions here Brownfield? Just help us understand the opportunity in front of you.\nMackie McCrea: Yeah, this is Mackie and I'm actually not going to answer your question at first, because I do want to make a statement. I thought about this and we're preparing Bill Bergen's team did a great job of summarizing some of our competitors and their earnings call and how they did and I find it interesting think back about it. We\u2019ve got competitors talk about the whole business, which is the vast majority of what they do. And they talk about their NGL and oil business which is the vast majority, there they're all natural gas and what a blessing and how fortunate we are as a partnership with such great employees running this business. And the breadth of our pipeline system, our terminal our storage throughout the US. I mean, we're so well positioned to meet the demand growth across the board for natural gas and other commodities. So we feel very fortunate and we're going to take advantage of that. So in answering to your question we keep talking here about transition for years in the last four years transitioned well. I guess, everybody's kind of seeing the truth. The transition is, we're about to transition into untold demand for natural gas. And for that case also natural gas liquid did internationally. So, as I just mentioned, nobody is better positioned for us other than Eastern Seaboard. If you look at our pipeline Intrastate Interstate network you look at it what I just we have over 233 BCF of storage along all of our systems to really meet the demands. We're situated very well to meet all the uphand demand. You mentioned datacenters. Yes, we're in four five different states in discussions with multiple datacenters of different sizes. Some of them or many of them want to put generation on site and wanting as much as two or three hundred thousand CEP for each one. So it\u2019s an enormous opportunity for us. As I mentioned, we're very advantaged at many of the areas to capture a lot of this business, as well as for the power plant demand for natural gas. We see that going up astronomically we think we could increase the demand here for electricity over the next six to eight years, about 30,000 or 40,000 megawatts at least. Here just in Texas and that go to other states similar type needs. Once again, we are very well positioned and then you add on to that, I mean, we've got population growth in Florida, in Texas, Bahamas all these gas utilities that will be feeding. And we want our business you've got Blue Mont just what we're working with Long with a handful of folks. If it comes to fruition, the majority of that, we're looking at between one and two BCF of natural gas deliveries at our terminals close to our terminals for blue ammonia, and then you throw in crypto and on and on, So yeah, we're very bullish. I know that longwinded answer to your question, but we couldn't be more excited about transferred I mean natural gas demand growth and how we're going to be able to take advantage of that with our broad system.\nSpiro Dounis: That's great color, Mackie. I'll leave it there. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Blum of Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. I want to go back to Kinder Morgan's double H conversion announcement. Wondering if you could possibly participate in this project in any way either, offshoring or Downstream of double H, and if you could remind us on the contract terms of the NGL balance you have from the Crestwood acquisition?\nMackie McCrea: Yeah, that's a good. Question, Michael because that's really where we see a couple of benefits. But one of them is we are chasing a couple of pretty big deals and we've got available capacity that\u2019s already sitting and waiting for us, the processing capacity with the Crestwood asset we do intend to fill that and now there's competition. Now when you have a monopoly it's hard to get a good net back price for your producer for your business and that\u2019s changing. So we're excited and intrigued that that Kinder is doing this. It's kind of something more like we do. So we love that and like I said, it's not going to hurt our feelings at the maybe sixty to eighty thousand more barrels looking for a home on our Dakota access. Now, downstream, we certainly are in discussions and we love and feel like we probably will see some of those barrels at a minimum at our frac, but we're just in early discussions and certainly see that as a another potential upside for what Kinder is doing. But mainly we like what's going on up the Basin of what it will do for our own assets up there.\nMichael Blum: Okay. Perfect thanks for that. And then, just wanted to get your latest thoughts on what's happening in the Haynesville, North of Louisiana. Obviously has been the legal challenges some of that sort of now transpired. So just wanted to get your latest thoughts there.\nMackie McCrea: Okay, yeah, Marcellus, Utica and Haynesville, tough areas over the last quarter. A lot of lean gas, lot of drilling slowing down even some shut-ins so we've seen those two basins in Haynesville especially come off what 2 to 2.5 BCF just into the end of last year. We are seeing it start to recover as prices start to recover. The enormous reserves in North Louisiana we have multiple 42 inches pipes running through North Louisiana actually three. We got a Gulf run extension to the South. We have the ability to increase the capacity on that relatively easy. And we're - we've got a lot of potential to grow there and so does the industry when you're talking about the issues in Louisiana, I'll touch on those real quick. We are in a lawsuit with one company, but from a high level there were three companies that were looking for I think it was 150, 160 crossing of our pipelines and we deal with this every day. Whether it's other top-line companies or utility companies, or electric companies or whatever, it's a normal part of our business. But what happened was with two of these pipeline companies we needed technical data. We need to work with them on where they cross and how they are going to impact their or router way, our first router way, how they maybe going to adversely possibly affect our safety, our employees. So it's important to us to have answers to our questions like we always ask and get and two of the pipelines work with us. We have one pipeline that has rejected or refused to provide that technical data and all we're doing is protecting our rights and we\u2019ll continue to \u2013 as a partnership and we'll see kind of how all that plays out.\nMichael Blum: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes our question and answer session. I would like to return the floor to Tom Long for any closing comments.\nTom Long: All right, we definitely appreciate you all joining us. I do want to add one more comment here at the end. We do get a lot of inbound. I'm going to go back to the global question a little bit here. We have a lot of hard assets second to none across this country, but another significant asset we just \u2013 we mentioned occasionally, but can't ever mention - emphasize enough is the team and human resource side of the team. This, all the inbounds that we get globally is a huge, huge complement to the second to none team that we have. Operations team BD team. I think it's recognized globally and that's the reason a lot of inbounds do come to us. And we take it as, like I said, a massive complement that our name is used out there a lot. But, anyway one I wanted to make sure I got that in. But thank all of you \u2013 all for joining us and we look forward to talking with all of you with any follow-up questions Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Long",
            "content": "Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to the Energy Transfer's second quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon. As a reminder, our earnings release contains a thorough MD&A that goes through the segment results in detail and we encourage everyone to look at the release as well as the slides posted to our website to gain a full understanding of the quarter and our growth opportunities. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs, as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more details on our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which we expect to file tomorrow August the 8th. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You will find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'll start today by going over our financial results, for the second quarter of 2024, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.76 billion, compared to $3.1 million for the second quarter of 2023. This number includes over $80 million of transaction expense. Absent these transaction cost, adjusted EBITDA would have been over $3.8 billion. We had record volumes through our crude oil and NGL pipelines, as well as record NGL exports. We also saw strong performance from our NGL fractionators and our refined products pipelines and terminals. DCF a trivial to the partners of Energy Transfer as adjusted was $2 billion compared to $1.6 billion for the second quarter of 2023. And for the six months of 2024, we spent approximately $1 billion on organic growth capital, primarily in the midstream and NGL and Refined Products segments, excluding SUN and USA compression CapEx. Now turning to our results by segment for the second quarter and let's start with NGL and Refined Products. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.07 billion, compared to $837 million for the second quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to growth across our transportation, fractionation and terminal operations including records in both Mariner East and Permian Pipeline volumes, as well as NGL exports. In addition, we had higher gains from the optimization of hedged NGL inventory. For Midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $693 million, compared to $579 million for the second quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the addition of the Crestwood assets as well as higher volumes in the Permian Basin. For our Crude Oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $801 million compared to $674 million for the second quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to record crude oil transportation throughput. And increase in our total crude oil exports, which were up 11% as well as the acquisitions of the Lotus and Crestwood assets in May and November of 2023 respectively. Excluding these acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA and Crude Oil transportation volumes on our base business increased 4% and 8% respectively. In our Interstate segment, adjusted EBA was $392 million compared to $441 million the second quarter of 2023. During the quarter, we saw higher contracted volumes on Trunk Line, Pebble, Gulf Run & MRT. This was offset by lower operational gas sales, maintenance project cost of $12 million, as well as a $35 million reduction in revenue for shipper refunds related to our Pebble rate case. For the Intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $328 million, compared to $216 million in the second quarter of last year. The increase was primarily due to approximately $75 million of an increased gains related to pipeline optimization opportunities, as well as favorable storage optimization opportunities. In July 2024, Energy Transfer completed the acquisition of WTG, which provides Energy Transfer with increased access to growing supplies of natural gas and NGL volumes and enhances our Permian operations and downstream businesses. Integration of the combined assets is underway and we are really excited about great customer base and the growing gas supply behind this asset. Since closing the transaction, the $200 million cubic foot per day Red Lake 3 processing plant was placed into service. We expect volumes to ramp up quickly as more residue takeaway becomes available. Also in July 2024. Energy Transfer and Sunoco LP announced the formation of joint venture combining the respective crude oil and produced water gathering assets in the Permian Basin. This is another exciting opportunity that highlights the creativity and optionality our family of partnerships brings to the table when we work together to expand our market and service offerings for our customers. Now turning to our growth projects and starting with our Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals. Construction of the expansions to our NGL export capacity at Nederland continues to progress and we remain on schedule for anticipated in service in Mid-2025 for the initial phases of the project. And at our Marcus Hook terminal, construction continues to rest[Ph] on the first phase of an optimization project. Turning to Lone Star Express, our 90,000 barrels per day expansion project remains on schedule to be in service in 2026 bringing our total capacity of NGL transportation to over 1 million barrels per day out of the Permian Basin. We recently approved our ninth fractionator at Mont Belvieu, frac 9 will have a design capacity of 165,000 barrels per day and is expected to be in service in Q4 of 2026. This will bring our total fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu to more than 1.3 million barrels per day. In addition, we recently placed a previously unutilized 2 million barrels butane storage well back into service, bringing our current NGL storage capacity of Mont Belvieu to approximately 62 million barrels. Now taking a look at our Permian processing expansions. Construction continues on upgrades to our existing processing facilities, which will add approximately 200 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity in West Texas and in June we announced plans to construct the 200 million cubic feet per day Badger processing plant in the Permian Basin. This plant which is expected to be in service in Mid 2025 will utilize an idle plant that is to be relocated to the Delaware Basin, which will help save capital versus building a new plant. In North Louisiana, we placed trains one and two of our Ajax treating facility into service in July. These trains have a combined treating capacity of approximately 300 million cubic feet per day. Now for a brief update on our opportunities around Pap generation with forecast for electricity demand growth becoming increasingly bullish and the need for grid reliability becoming progressively more important, it is clear that natural gas will play a significant role in helping meet this demand. Given Energy Transfer's extensive Interstate and Intrastate natural gas pipeline footprint, we believe we are extremely well positioned to benefit from the anticipated rise in natural gas needs. We currently serve gas fired power plants in 15 States with approximately 185 plants served via direct or indirect connections throughout these states and we have recently signed deals across our systems to provide gas loads of over 500,000 MMBtus per day. In addition, as mentioned last quarter, we have approved the construction of eight 10 megawatt natural gas fired electric generation facilities to support the Partnership's operations in Texas. We continue to expect these facilities to go into service throughout 2025 and 2026. These facilities are expected to increase system reliability for Energy Transfer and for our customers. We also continue to make progress on the development of several other growth projects including our Warrior, Blue Marlin offshore project, Lake Charles LNG, a carbon capture and sequestration project with capture point and blue ammonia hubs at Lake Charles and Nederland. We look forward to providing more updates on these projects as customer discussions advance and we bring them closer to FID. Looking ahead at our 2024 organic growth capital guidance, we now expect 2024 growth capital expenditures to be approximately $3.1 billion, which will be spent primarily in the NGL and refined products and Midstream segments. The primary driver of the increases from our previous guidance of $2.9 billion is the addition of growth capital related to WTG and quicker returning projects in the Crude Oil segment related to the Crestwood acquisition. Now turning to our adjusted EBITDA guidance. We are raising our 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to be between $15.3 billion to $15.5 billion, compared to our prior guidance range of $15 billion to $15.3 billion. Our 2024 guidance has been updated to include our acquisition of WTG, which closed on July 15th and outperformance in the base business even with over $100 million transaction cost also included within our full year guidance. We continue to be excited about our business and the demand for our products and services both domestically and internationally. We're in a strong position to help meet this demand with strategic optimization and expansion projects that enhance our existing asset base and generate attractive returns. And we expect to maintain the flexibility to balance organic growth opportunities with further leverage reduction maintaining our targeted distribution growth rates and increasing equity returns to our unit holders. In addition, we are pleased to see that in June, Moody's upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating to be double A 2, which further demonstrates the strides that we have made to strengthen our balance sheet and financial position This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line up for our first question. Good afternoon, Jeremy. Yeah John, this is, Tom. I'll start and then Mackie can add more on. As we said in the prepared to march with feel very good about the base business and that's the reason why we've were able to bring it up in addition to the acquisitions, not just the WTG. So. When you really look at it, I think the optimization group, a lot of the stuff we've been able to do, we just continue to be able to see additional benefits as we look out over the year. But no, it was great to be able to continue to walk the guidance up for the year, even in this commodity environment because as you know we get a lot of extra pop, when natural gas prices are up - higher et cetera, but even with that we're able to continue to extract good value out of the optimization group, so. That's actually a very, very good question As you know, we just now closed on these some of these transactions and we are working through it right now. So, we'll - as usual we'll come out with our 2025 guidance whenever we get to the fourth quarter earnings release and at that time, we will have able to scrub kind of the normal runrate, but you absolutely nailed it. With our growth and our scale our size and with everything we're doing, let us scrub that a little bit more. So we won't just do give you the 2025 number. We will also kind of give you that ongoing runrate. But as of right now, we've always had that $2 billion to $3 billion. It if anything it'll be it'll be probably at that $3 billion. But let us let us do some more work on that before you give any official long-term runrate. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, and listen, I'll chime in here. This is Tom kind of the first part of your question just in general where we focus. First off, we still felt like consolidation is going to occur in the Midstream similar to what is happening in the Midstream and when you see how diversified we are across all the commodities and we go all the way from the wellhead to the water to our export facilities. We're looking really pretty much across the board. We wouldn't want to dial into any specific area, but the way you ask the question was actually very good, just like what Mackie said on the WTG. We are able to extract a lot of benefits downstream. When we, let's say get into the gathering and processing and it's across all the commodities. It's not tied to any one commodity. So, we think that we still have a lot of opportunities there and we're going to continue to evaluate those opportunities. Yes, this is Tom. That's the quick answer. We think it's the right thing to do for our partnership here. It makes a lot of sense with all that we've built out across all the commodities. So we continue to evaluate it \u2013 evaluate various opportunities when you look across the globe. I will tell you that we will always be very careful with any risk. As we look at these, we'll make sure they're good fits for us that we can bring a lot of value. But we're well aware of the risk - country risk et cetera that come along with each of these. And it's but we once again think that we've got the right team to be able to extract value when you look out globally. But we will \u2013 like I said it'll be credit risk, country risk, et cetera. And when you get involved with some of the - some of these various companies that are in these other countries, you can do a lot of stuff with them globally when you look at it. So we will continue at least to evaluate but be very thorough in our evaluation All right, we definitely appreciate you all joining us. I do want to add one more comment here at the end. We do get a lot of inbound. I'm going to go back to the global question a little bit here. We have a lot of hard assets second to none across this country, but another significant asset we just \u2013 we mentioned occasionally, but can't ever mention - emphasize enough is the team and human resource side of the team. This, all the inbounds that we get globally is a huge, huge complement to the second to none team that we have. Operations team BD team. I think it's recognized globally and that's the reason a lot of inbounds do come to us. And we take it as, like I said, a massive complement that our name is used out there a lot. But, anyway one I wanted to make sure I got that in. But thank all of you \u2013 all for joining us and we look forward to talking with all of you with any follow-up questions Thanks."

            "name": "Mackie McCrea",
            "content": "Hey Jeremy, this is Mackey. I'll start with the first one. We're very excited about WTG. Excuse me. As you just said, we're barely almost a month into it. We still have a lot of rocks to turnover but we couldn't be more excited not only just the asset itself and it's very credit worthy producers that are supporting that long-term large acreage dedications and all that discuss and support the cryos. But what's even more exciting to us that we don't even put in our numbers when we do acquisitions like this to had kind of really feed into our residue business, our downstream residue business as well as Lone Star NGL transport and fractionation business. So we're just getting our arms around it. We're very excited about, there's enormous growth in that part of the Midland Basin that we have had little exposure to on the gas side. So we're very excited and looking forward to a lot of good things coming out of that acquisition. With NuStar, we're excited about that too. Joe Kim has done an incredible job growing Sunoco. They've kind of been in different areas and they're evolving kind of entire areas. The pipeline side and we welcome we have a really good partnership with them right now and JC Nolan that's got really - what's gone really well moving diesel from the Gulf Coast to West Texas. We've got some deals with them up in the Northeast on transporting our refined products and a lot of stuff going on. With the great partners we look very much forward to what we're going to do with them and that JV. Once again, new news, we're getting our arms around that. But the bottom-line is that's going to be a lot better for both our partnerships than just one-on-one it's going to be a lot add up to a lot more than three or four on what we're already seeing provide a lot of benefits to the producers out there as we team up, but also a lot of downstream value for both our partnerships. So we're excited about to both of them. Okay, I'll tell you about \u2013 I'll start with the Crude Oil. We don't see a lot with Crude Oil. We do see there need to be quite a bit more growth to fill up what's there? We're probably a year or two away from any concerns around that at least from our business standpoint, but we'll certainly keep an eye on that. But on Warrior, yeah, we've had some questions both internally but mainly externally about what does the announcement going to [Indiscernible] do at Warrior. I'll just summarize that as zero. The vast majority of the customers that we've already signed up and that we're pressing the sign of over the next 60 to 90 days have no desire for either the their gas to be in South Texas or the markets that are supporting this project. So by no means is that slowing us down. We're very and I know we've talked about this quarter after quarter, but it has picked up steam. There is a tremendous market east not south but east heading through Texas and other parts of the country really. And so we're very excited about where we sit on Warrior and I'll just say that I'll be disappointed certainly am implying that we're almost FID but I'll be disappointed if we're not announcing FID by our next earnings call. We are working hard and we'll see if we can get there. If we do announce that it will be fully sold out. We are not going to take any risk on overbuilding out of that basin but there is still a lot of gas and oil growth for many years to come out of that basin in our opinion. And then a last one, we mentioned all three, but NGLs we never worry about what others are doing around NGLs. We will build the necessary pipelines to move NGLs out of that area to meet the contracts we have with our customers. Okay. Yeah, I will start with the end of that question, yeah right now the way that is structured the JV in the Midland basin is not to go out and acquire it. That's not to say that if there is some gathering assets or other assets in that area that fall kind of within that AMI that we wouldn't approach that together and that's certainly in our agreement with them. But right now, the main focus is really developing out those systems together and achieve as much of the upside that we can't downstream of that partnership with our other businesses and further downstream revenues. Yeah, Keith, this Mackie. Not that hadn't released spurred any new thoughts around that. I guess, I'd summarize where we're at. We are kind of the pipeline of choice out of their as we move more than 50% of the barrels out of the Bakken. We do have the ability to move significantly more if there's any growth and it's already done our appealing if there's going to be 60,000 to 80,000 barrels, that was leaving the basin now, we will be looking for another way out because we think we will continue to move the majority of the barrels out of that region. But we do think that we will end up and sooner than later, growing or extending some of the agreements that we have but we really don't have a lot of angst or concern of the reasons I just said. We offer more flexibility by going to the Mid-Continent refineries and of course all the way down to the Gulf Coast to the Beaumont, Houston area, as well as [Indiscernible] Bridge. So we just its unparalleled with the flexibility and the optionality that we're giving for producers. So we sit in very good position and we're very confident that we will keep Dakota access full at healthy spreads for many years. Yeah, Theresa, this is Mackie again. No most of the business that NuStar had now Sunoco in our JV is just gathering. So it's gathering that basin and it's delivered to pipelines like Energy Transfer or other competing pipelines in the area. So that JV is a large area of the AMI that encompasses Energy Transfer old gathering business in the Permian Basin. But does not include any of the downstream pipelines for example that go to Nederland or up to Cushing. So that's we're going to work very closely with NuStars I mean, sorry with Sunoco go as part of that JV but that just confined in the gathering part of that business I'd answer it like this is that, we're probably gathering 1.5 million barrels and we can move less than that out of it. So we don't have any necessarily dedicated barrels from any particular area other than shippers that taken space on our pipeline systems. So, right now, really couldn't say what exact molecules will come from this JV may feed into our downstream business. We kind of take it as a whole. Also, there's different qualities of oil, whether it's WTL or WTI to come involve. So there is a lot more kind of thought process going into this, but yeah at the end of the day, certainly this JV the business of gathering will continue to feed our downstream business both to Nederland to our Houston terminal, as well as one day hopefully to our Blue Marlin project. Yeah, this is Mackie and I'm actually not going to answer your question at first, because I do want to make a statement. I thought about this and we're preparing Bill Bergen's team did a great job of summarizing some of our competitors and their earnings call and how they did and I find it interesting think back about it. We've got competitors talk about the whole business, which is the vast majority of what they do. And they talk about their NGL and oil business which is the vast majority, there they're all natural gas and what a blessing and how fortunate we are as a partnership with such great employees running this business. And the breadth of our pipeline system, our terminal our storage throughout the US. I mean, we're so well positioned to meet the demand growth across the board for natural gas and other commodities. So we feel very fortunate and we're going to take advantage of that. So in answering to your question we keep talking here about transition for years in the last four years transitioned well. I guess, everybody's kind of seeing the truth. The transition is, we're about to transition into untold demand for natural gas. And for that case also natural gas liquid did internationally. So, as I just mentioned, nobody is better positioned for us other than Eastern Seaboard. If you look at our pipeline Intrastate Interstate network you look at it what I just we have over 233 BCF of storage along all of our systems to really meet the demands. We're situated very well to meet all the uphand demand. You mentioned datacenters. Yes, we're in four five different states in discussions with multiple datacenters of different sizes. Some of them or many of them want to put generation on site and wanting as much as two or three hundred thousand CEP for each one. So it's an enormous opportunity for us. As I mentioned, we're very advantaged at many of the areas to capture a lot of this business, as well as for the power plant demand for natural gas. We see that going up astronomically we think we could increase the demand here for electricity over the next six to eight years, about 30,000 or 40,000 megawatts at least. Here just in Texas and that go to other states similar type needs. Once again, we are very well positioned and then you add on to that, I mean, we've got population growth in Florida, in Texas, Bahamas all these gas utilities that will be feeding. And we want our business you've got Blue Mont just what we're working with Long with a handful of folks. If it comes to fruition, the majority of that, we're looking at between one and two BCF of natural gas deliveries at our terminals close to our terminals for blue ammonia, and then you throw in crypto and on and on, So yeah, we're very bullish. I know that longwinded answer to your question, but we couldn't be more excited about transferred I mean natural gas demand growth and how we're going to be able to take advantage of that with our broad system. Yeah, that's a good. Question, Michael because that's really where we see a couple of benefits. But one of them is we are chasing a couple of pretty big deals and we've got available capacity that's already sitting and waiting for us, the processing capacity with the Crestwood asset we do intend to fill that and now there's competition. Now when you have a monopoly it's hard to get a good net back price for your producer for your business and that's changing. So we're excited and intrigued that that Kinder is doing this. It's kind of something more like we do. So we love that and like I said, it's not going to hurt our feelings at the maybe sixty to eighty thousand more barrels looking for a home on our Dakota access. Now, downstream, we certainly are in discussions and we love and feel like we probably will see some of those barrels at a minimum at our frac, but we're just in early discussions and certainly see that as a another potential upside for what Kinder is doing. But mainly we like what's going on up the Basin of what it will do for our own assets up there. Okay, yeah, Marcellus, Utica and Haynesville, tough areas over the last quarter. A lot of lean gas, lot of drilling slowing down even some shut-ins so we've seen those two basins in Haynesville especially come off what 2 to 2.5 BCF just into the end of last year. We are seeing it start to recover as prices start to recover. The enormous reserves in North Louisiana we have multiple 42 inches pipes running through North Louisiana actually three. We got a Gulf run extension to the South. We have the ability to increase the capacity on that relatively easy. And we're - we've got a lot of potential to grow there and so does the industry when you're talking about the issues in Louisiana, I'll touch on those real quick. We are in a lawsuit with one company, but from a high level there were three companies that were looking for I think it was 150, 160 crossing of our pipelines and we deal with this every day. Whether it's other top-line companies or utility companies, or electric companies or whatever, it's a normal part of our business. But what happened was with two of these pipeline companies we needed technical data. We need to work with them on where they cross and how they are going to impact their or router way, our first router way, how they maybe going to adversely possibly affect our safety, our employees. So it's important to us to have answers to our questions like we always ask and get and two of the pipelines work with us. We have one pipeline that has rejected or refused to provide that technical data and all we're doing is protecting our rights and we'll continue to \u2013 as a partnership and we'll see kind of how all that plays out."

Should you need assistance,\u00c2\u00a0[Operator instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.\u00c2\u00a0[Operator instructions].\u00c2\u00a0We ask that you limit to asking one question and one follow-up question. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Long, CEO of Energy Transfer. Please go ahead. \nThomas Long: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, which we expect to file tomorrow, May 9. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation for non-GAAP measures on our website.\u00c2\u00a0  I'll start today by going over our financial results. For the first quarter of 2024, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.9 billion compared to $3.4 billion for the first quarter of 2023. We had record volumes through our crude pipelines and also saw strong performances across the rest of our operations. DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, was $2.4 billion compared to $2 billion for the first quarter of last year. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $1.3 billion. On April 24, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.3175 per common unit or $1.27 on an annualized basis. This distribution represents an increase of 3.3% and from the $0.3075 paid in the first quarter of 2023. In February, Fitch upgraded Energy Transfer's senior unsecured credit rating to BBB with a stable outlook, which followed an upgrade by S&P to BBB in 2023. At the end of the first quarter, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Following the redemption of all of our outstanding Series C and Series D preferred units in February of 2024, in March, we issued a notice to redeem all of Energy Transfer's outstanding Series E preferred units on May 15, 2024.\u00c2\u00a0In April of 2024, we redeemed $1.7 billion of senior notes using cash on hand and proceeds from our revolving credit facility. And for the first quarter of 2024, we spent approximately $460 million on organic growth capital, primarily in the Midstream and NGL and refined products segments, excluding Sun and USA Compression CapEx.\u00c2\u00a0  Now turning to our results by segment for the first quarter, and we'll start with NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was $989 million compared to $939 million for the first quarter of 2023. This was primarily due to growth across our transportation, fractionation and terminal operations, which was partially offset by lower gains from hedged NGL inventory. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2023 included gains that were carried over from the prior year. NGL transportation volumes increased 5% to 2.1 million barrels per day. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes from the Permian region on the Mariner East pipeline system and on the Gulf Coast export pipelines. NGL fractionation volumes increased 11% to 1.1 million barrels per day. Total NGL export volumes grew 6% over the first quarter of 2023. We continue to see strong international demand for natural gas liquids and saw record LPG exports out of our Nederland terminal for the month of March. During the first quarter of 2024, we loaded approximately 14 million barrels of ethane out of Nederland and nearly 7 million barrels of ethane out of Marcus Hook. During the first quarter, we continued to export approximately 20% of worldwide NGL exports.\u00c2\u00a0  For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $696 million compared to $641 million for the first quarter of 2023. This was primarily due to the addition of the Crestwood assets as well as higher volumes in the Permian Basin. As a reminder, results in the first quarter of 2023 included a onetime positive adjustment of approximately $40 million. Gathered gas volumes increased to 19.9 million MMBtus per day compared to 19.8 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year. Now for our crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $848 million compared to $526 million for the first quarter of 2023. This was primarily due to significantly stronger pipeline volumes, increased terminal throughput as well as favorable timing on gains associated with hedged inventory. We also benefited from the acquisition of the Lotus and Crestwood assets in May and November of 2023, respectively. Results for the first quarter of 2024 included a $40 million benefit related to favorable timing on gains associated with hedged inventory, a portion of which we expect to reverse in the second quarter. And as a reminder, the first quarter of 2023 did include onetime negative adjustments of approximately $35 million. Crude oil transportation volumes increased 44% to a record 6.1 million barrels per day compared to 4.2 million barrels per day for the same period last year. Excluding the additions of Crestwood and LOTUS, adjusted EBITDA and crude oil transportation volumes on our base business increased 47% and 14%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2023.\u00c2\u00a0  In our Interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $483 million compared to $536 million for the first quarter of 2023. During the quarter, we saw margin growth related to higher contracted volumes at increased rates on several of our pipelines. This growth was more than offset by lower operational sales resulting from lower prices and unplanned maintenance projects. In addition, the first quarter of 2023 included a onetime benefit from the realization of certain amounts related to a shipper bankruptcy. Total system volumes increased 5% over the same period last year due to increased demand and higher utilization on the Transwestern Tiger Trunkline and Gulf Run pipeline systems. We continue to fully utilize Zone 1 capacity on Gulf Run, and with the completion of the Trunkline backhaul project, we are fully utilizing deliveries into our trunk line pipeline from Zone 2. Our team continues to work on the next phase of a potential capacity expansion to facilitate the transportation of natural gas from Northern Louisiana to the Gulf Coast based upon customer demand. And for our intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $438 million compared to $409 million for the first quarter of last year. During the first quarter of 2024, we recorded gains of approximately $250 million related to pipeline optimization opportunities that were not expected to repeat throughout the remainder of the year. In addition, we saw volume ramp-ups and new contracts on several of our Texas pipelines. All of this was partially offset by lower storage optimization opportunities.\u00c2\u00a0  Turning to our growth projects, and we'll start with Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals. Our NGL terminals continue to benefit from increased demand, both in the United States as well as from international customers. Construction of the expansion to our NGL export capacity at Nederland continues to progress. This expansion is expected to give us the flexibility to load various products based upon customer demand. We have completed the installation of all pilings for the facility and the construction remains on schedule for an anticipated in-service in mid-2025 for the initial phases of the project. And as mentioned on our last call, we are also building new refrigerated storage at Nederland, which is expected to increase our butane storage capacity by 33% and double our propane storage capacity. This will further increase our ability to keep customer ships loaded on time and give us the ability to more than fully optimize our export capabilities. We expect the total combined cost of these 2 projects to be approximately $1.5 billion.\u00c2\u00a0  At our Marcus Hook terminal, construction continues on the first phase of an optimization project that would add incremental ethane refrigeration and storage capacity. On our Lone Star NGL pipelines we recently [FID-ed] 2 projects that will debottleneck our West Texas Gateway and Lone Star Express pipelines. On the gateway pipeline, a debottlenecking project is underway that will allow us to fully utilize our interest on the Epic pipeline and optimize our deliveries from the Delaware Basin into the gateway pipeline for deliveries into Mont Belvieu. These upgrades are expected to be completed in 2025. As a reminder, this undivided interest was acquired as part of the Crestwood acquisition, and it's just one of the several synergy projects we are working on. And on the Lone Star Express, we are completing upgrades that are expected to provide more than 90,000 barrels per day of incremental Permian NGL takeaway capacity upon its anticipated in-service in 2026. The combined project costs are expected to be approximately $125 million. Upon completion of these 2 projects, our total deliverability in the Mont Belvieu is expected to increase to more than 1.3 million barrels per day.\u00c2\u00a0  As we mentioned on our last call in early 2024, we closed on the acquisition of 2 pipelines. Sabina 1 Pipeline from Mont Belvieu to the Houston Ship Channel and the Sabina 2 Pipeline from Mont Belvieu to our Nederland terminal. We recently commenced the conversion of the Sabina 2 pipeline to provide additional natural gasoline service between our Mont Belvieu NGL complex and our Nederland storage and export terminal. This project, which we anticipate will be in service in 2025, is expected to increase the capacity from 25,000 barrels per day to approximately 70,000 barrels per day. In addition, discussions are ongoing to provide transportation for potentially multiple products on the Sabina 1 Pipeline that extends from Mont Belvieu to the Houston Ship Channel. As a reminder, in addition to the incremental processing capacity acquired through the Crestwood acquisition, we are expanding our processing capacity at several of our existing processing plants. In total, we are moving forward with upgrades to add approximately 200 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity in West Texas. In addition, we recently completed upgrades in South Texas that added approximately 60 million cubic feet per day. These upgrades can be completed at more favorable capital cost when compared to building a new processing plant.\u00c2\u00a0  Also, we continue to increase optionality and improve reliability along our pipeline systems. At the end of 2023, we completed a backhaul project on our trunk line pipeline. The project added an incremental 400,000 Mcf per day of Southern flow capacity on the pipeline system at very efficient capital cost. Looking at our crude oil assets, we are adding a direct connection from Midland to our pipeline that flows from the Permian Basin to Cushing. The construction of this approximately 30-mile pipeline continues. And upon its anticipated completion in the fourth quarter of this year, it is expected to be able to transport approximately 100,000 barrels per day of crude from our terminals in Midland, Texas to our terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma.\u00c2\u00a0  We also continue to develop our proposed Blue Marlin offshore project, and we are hoping to receive the draft EIS this quarter. As a reminder, in November of 2023, we announced a heads of agreement or HOA with Total Energy's for crude offtake. And additional customers remain very engaged and interested in our project, recognizing the value of fully loading VLCCs and the reduced execution risk that comes with repurposing existing underutilized assets. Now for an update on Lake Charles LNG project. As we discussed on our last earnings call in January of this year, the Biden administration imposed a moratorium on the approval of LNG exports, while the Department of Energy conduct studies to determine whether LNG exports are in the public interest. The Biden administration stated that these studies would focus on the cumulative impact of LNG exports on climate change, U.S. natural gas prices and the impact of LNG facilities on local communities. We remain optimistic that the DOE studies will continue to support DOE export authorizations, particularly for LNG projects that have lower Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions profiles like Lake Charles. And so we continue to believe that Lake Charles LNG will receive a DOE export authorization in due course. As such, Lake Charles LNG continues to pursue the development of the project. In this regard, Lake Charles LNG is in discussions with LNG offtake customers for the remaining unsold offtake volumes necessary to take FID. Lake Charles LNG remains extremely thankful for the continued support of its existing LNG customers.\u00c2\u00a0  And for a brief update on other projects. Energy Transfer has approved 8-10 megawatt natural gas-fired electric generation facilities to support the partnership's operations in Texas. We expect these facilities to go into service throughout 2025 and 2026. On the blue ammonia front, we continue to develop an ammonia hub concept at Lake Charles, Louisiana and Nederland, Texas, where we have deep water access at our existing facilities. This hub concept would allow us to provide critical infrastructure services to several blue ammonia facilities, including natural gas supply, CO2 transportation to third-party sequestration sites, ammonia storage and deep water marine loading facilities. This hub concept is expected to promote economies of scale and efficiencies as compared to individual stand-alone blue ammonia projects and the market response to this approach has been favorable. Yesterday, we entered into an agreement with Capture Point that commits CO2 from our treating facilities in Northern Louisiana to the capture and sequestration project being jointly developed by Capture Point and Energy Transfer.\u00c2\u00a0  Now looking ahead at our 2024 organic growth capital guidance. With the addition of several new growth projects, we now expect 2024 growth capital expenditures to be approximately $2.9 billion, which will be spent primarily in the NGL and refined products and midstream segments. This has been revised from our previous guidance for approximately $2.5 billion to include newly approved debottlenecking projects on our Lone Star Express and Gateway NGL pipelines, the Sabina 2 pipe conversion, optimization work at Mont Belvieu, backhaul, looping and compression projects on FGT, new power generation facilities as well as additional processing plant optimization in the Permian and gathering system build-outs and compression projects in the midstream segment. We continue to expect our long-term annual growth capital run rate to be approximately $2 billion to $3 billion.\u00c2\u00a0  Now turning to our adjusted EBITDA guidance. We are raising our 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to be between $15 billion to $15.3 billion compared to our prior guidance range of $14.5 billion to $14.8 billion. Our 2024 guidance has been updated to include earnings related to Sunoco's acquisition of the NuStar assets, which closed May 3. As we look at our first quarter performance and bring the NuStar assets into the family, we continue to be excited about 2024 and are comfortable that we can deliver on our plan despite various market headwinds like lower gas prices and production curtailments that have impacted midstream volumes. Overall, worldwide demand for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and refined products remained strong. as does demand for our products and services. We will continue to position ourselves to meet this demand by strategically targeting optimization and expansion projects that enhance our existing asset base and generate attractive returns. We also continue to pursue synergy opportunities around recently acquired assets with several projects underway, including the optimization of processing capacity in West Texas and NGL pipeline takeaway capacity from the Delaware Basin. Our financial position continues to be stronger than any time in\u00c2\u00a0Energy Transfer's history, which we believe will provide us with the continued flexibility to balance pursuing new growth opportunities, further leverage reduction, maintaining our targeted distribution growth rate and increasing equity returns to our unitholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line up for the first question. \nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]. As a reminder, please limit to asking only one question and one follow-up question. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. \nJeremy Tonet: Good afternoon. Jeremy. Just wanted to start off with regards to Crestwood, now that the acquisition has been under your belt full a little bit here. I wonder if you could update us a little bit more. You talked about the synergy capture a bit before, but just what you see now as far as the impact and what you see, I guess, for potential synergies across commercial cost savings, what have you. Just curious for latest thoughts there. \nThomas Long: Yes. I mean, I'll go ahead and start. We still feel very good about the $80 million on the cost synergy side that we said we would be able to achieve, and that's going well. And then I'm looking over at Mackie will comment on the commercial side of it. \nMarshall McCrea: Yes.\u00c2\u00a0Jeremy, as every time that we go and acquire somebody, we always have anticipated synergies and then we just dig stuff up and find things, and once again, we're doing that with Crestwood. Some that we can talk about, for example, in the Permian Basin, they've got some idle capacity that we'll be able to utilize sooner than later will delay any kind of expansions we may need out there. There's also some things going on up in the Bakken that we can't really elaborate on, but very significant opportunities up there to help not only fill up some of their available higher now available processing capacity, but also bringing fairly significant more barrels in Dakota Access. And there's others we can go out of every other areas. But we're very excited about what we've seen early and look forward to really benefiting from some of these synergies we've already recognized. \nJeremy Tonet: Great. And I appreciate the guidance update reflects the Sun acquisition of NuStar there. But if I just want to kind of parse through that a little bit more and see how the base business for ET is proceeding versus guidance provided before, how would you describe, I guess, the outlook at this point versus before, if it's similar or if anything has changed? \nMarshall McCrea: Similar is going to be the short answer. We had the $14.5, $14.8 billion. We're including an incremental $500 million just for that portion of the year for Sunoco. So that's what you're seeing at this time with where we are in the process. Sunoco team has done a great job, and we'll -- they'll be probably updating that number a little bit more as we go forward. But right now, $500 million is the number that we're using. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Just the last one, if I could. I think you talked about the potential for increasing equity returns. And just wondering if you could comment a bit more on what you meant there. \nThomas Long: There's obviously 2 -- as far as just the overall equity Jeremy, if I understand you correctly, equity returns, meaning that we continue to bump the distributions, but I don't ever want to say that we're not focused on unit buybacks when we get to the right place from a leverage standpoint. And what I mean is when we're kind of looking out at the forecast, we'll be opportunistic there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis with Citi. \nSpiro Dounis: Thanks, operator. Maybe start with some of the new projects and the CapEx update. Mackie, your team has clearly been busy over the last quarter with all those additions. Curious now just given you're sort of higher end of the range of $3 billion at this point in the year, anything that could sort of tip us over that, that's in the hopper? Are you contemplating that in that new range, thinking about projects like Blue Marlin or your goal front expansion? Anything to kind of point you that you can get us over that? \nMarshall McCrea: Yes. Spiro, this is Mackie. Everything that we have in right now is what we're going to do. Next 30, 60, 90 days, we may make significant progress and some of the things we're working for. But the things that we announced recently, the additional $400 million or things that we have approved recently that we've kicked off, several of those will actually come online later this year. All of them come online kind of within 2 years or earlier. So yes, we're adding more capital, but we're also going to see revenues much quicker than, of course, a lot of our projects. \nSpiro Dounis: Got it. It's helpful. And just want to go to the slides, one sort of point to new opportunities you're evaluating on the power plant side to connect into new and existing power plants. Curious if you could expand on that and what that could mean in terms of scope. Is that sort of interstate pipeline expansions? And then are we also talking about brownfield or even greenfield storage expansions? \nMarshall McCrea: Yes. I'll tell you this is kind of the first small step for us. But as everybody is aware, certainly in Texas and throughout many states, the grids are in jeopardy, very cold or hot weather. So we're doing what we can to help support that. But really, the driver behind what we're doing on adding these 10 megawatts at a time facilities is, -- number one, reliability is to make sure that when we have glitches of the grid, especially out West Texas were those not uncommon that we can keep our facilities running. In addition to that, it also will help grid security, for example, we'll be able to -- in the kind of urea-type or cold weather-type circumstances when ERCOT asks us to get off the grid, we'll be able to get off the grid, keep our plants running reliably and allow that excess energy that we're not going off to go to benefit producers, for example, upstream that might have issues with loose electricity. So we think what we're doing are kind of small steps that we'll grow into to help make our system, our assets much more liable, the grid more stable, in addition to that, I won't go into this in great detail, but there's also a lot of revenue benefits from LAR and ancillary services that we'll be able to provide with this added generation. So we're pretty excited about it. It's kind of small stuff right now, but it makes a lot of sense for our partnership. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. \nKeith Stanley: Wanted to go back to the interstate gas sales and the strong results there. Is there any more detail you can give on the optimization opportunities you saw that drove the $250 million gain? And then relatedly, just any updates on how much capacity you have available for -- to benefit from Permian differentials this year? And anything on the Warrior project as well. \nMarshall McCrea: Okay. Let me start with the end of that. So on Warrior, we continue -- our team continues to work. One thing we are doing, we're going to be very disciplined and prudent. We're not going to run out and announce the project unless we feel good about all of our capacity, [sold] long term. So we're not going to run out in an FID Warrior when we have some capacity on our existing system that we're still terming up. So we're working hard, the pause in LNG has impacted a little bit with some of the bigger customers that we're working with. However, there remains, as everybody [Indiscernible] probably knows a strong interest in another pipeline, probably by mid to late 2026. We are very optimistic that we will build the next pipeline to come out of West Texas, and we'll continue to work hard to get that finish line when it makes sense.\u00c2\u00a0  As far as the spread across Texas, it kind of varies month-to-month, but it's certainly north of $300,000 a day of [Indiscernible] a day that we have available that are benefiting from these widespread -- we sure hate to see prices do what they're doing at Waha, but that's what happens when you have capacity constraints, which we have right now out of the Permian. And so there is a pipeline coming on later in the year than alleviate a lot of that but certainly, the way we're positioned is very well to take advantage of that type of spread for our customers' benefit as well as for our own benefits. As far as the intrastate revenue, it's just -- it's what we've built. We feel extremely fortunate with the assets we have throughout the U.S., but especially in Texas and the team we have that's operating those assets where really cold weather times are really volatile times, even really hot weather, we have the ability to create a lot of revenue by peak hourly sales or putting some storage positions on moving gas from west to east, even backhaul. There's just a lot of things we can do with our massive intrastate pipeline network in Texas. And so -- we see this every year, we see it in most winters, many times in summer where we're able to capture kind of some unexpected revenue that will always be there at very volatile times at some level. \nKeith Stanley: I appreciate the detailed answer. Second question on -- just on M&A and how you're thinking about things. And so -- and thinking about it from the lens of\u00c2\u00a0Energy Transfer\u00c2\u00a0and then obviously, you have Sun as well, which I know is an independent company, but there's a fair amount of overlap now in some of the assets and business mix between ET and Sun. So how do you think about M&A going forward? And kind of what types of acquisitions or assets make more sense at the ET level versus the Sun level and any differentiation there? \nThomas Long: Yes. That's -- listen, that's obviously a very, very good question. We spent a lot of time within Energy Transfer strategizing here. I will -- I think I will start off saying that we still feel like consolidation makes sense in the midstream space. So just at the 50,000-foot answer to your question, we still fully intend on evaluating various opportunities as we look out. So we're not going to slow down on that front. Now as far as what we look at is going to be always trying to look at those things that feed all the way downstream. We always like to talk about how we go from wellhead to the water, and we do it across all the commodities. So you can see our strategy as we look at this stuff and what assets we look at as to how it feeds all the way through the value chain when we make these acquisitions. And it gives us great opportunities for commercial synergies when we do that as well as the cost synergies.\u00c2\u00a0  Now as to the -- I guess, as to the last part of your question about the\u00c2\u00a0Energy Transfer\u00c2\u00a0versus Sunoco, clearly, the Sunoco team has done a fantastic job on this new star. I couldn't be more excited about that asset base coming into the family here. So what you'll see is, you'll see that they're in kind of the wholesale fuel distribution terminal business, et cetera. And you're right, there's going to be some overlap and in those instances, we'll look at ways on a combined basis of what we can do. But Sunoco's can continue to make those kind of acquisitions. This is really their first big public company transaction. They've made a lot of other asset acquisitions, but it's clearly something that's very, very accretive to them, and it's very good for the family from that standpoint. And I'm going to look across the table to Mackie and give him a chance to add in a little bit more even on the latest NuStar acquisition and some of the optimizations we might be looking at here. \nMarshall McCrea: You bet. Yes. And I want to elaborate much more on what Sun said or anybody that follows them, they kind of explained it. We're excited for them. They are kind of stepping up and kind of growing up a little bit in one regard as far as different type of assets. And there are some assets that overlap, we think there's a real benefit and potentially partnering up with them. So we are in discussions of possibly doing that. And if opportunities arise that are very beneficial and accretive to both of our partnerships as we do with other JVs, we look forward to capturing those opportunities as time moves forward. \nThomas Long: Did that answer all your question there? \nKeith Stanley: Sure did. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS. \nManav Gupta: A quick question as it relates to your Slide 6. When we look at 2024, CapEx, 80% of that is between NGL, refined products and midstream. And I know it's still early, but with your crystal ball, if you look at 2025, do you believe this mix could change significantly in the next year where other segments could get more CapEx? Like any view over there would be very helpful. \nMarshall McCrea: Yes, I can start with that. I guess, looking at it right now, nothing jumps out that would change it significantly. However, you walk through some hypothetical, let's just think say, everything the pause gets lifted, for example, on LNG, we intend to own maybe 20%, 25% of that. That could start earlier. That's probably not likely. But it just kind of depends on Warrior, does it pick up later in the years, sooner or later? So there's a lot of different variables and negotiations going on and even permitting issues with the government. So I think the high-level answer to that kind of the spin rate run right now, at least through '25. That's pretty consistent, but we've got a number of projects that I just alluded to in different segments that might begin quicker than others, and that would, of course, queue it one way or the other. \nManav Gupta: A quick follow-up. At Marcus Hook, I think on the last quarter call, you spoke about construction of the first sale of optimization project that could add ethane refrigeration and storage capacity. Is there any update on that one? \nMarshall McCrea: No update. We're excited that phase, and we're diligently moving through that phase. We will be adding ethane storage and we are excited about the future of our export facilities and capabilities and revenues out of the markets for many years to come. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. \nMichael Blum: I wanted to ask -- go back to the 8, 10 megawatt gas-fired power plants you announced for Texas. Just to clarify, are these basically [peaker] plants? Are you going to supply them with your own gas? And how do we think about return on invested capital for an investment like this? \nMarshall McCrea: Michael, this is Mackie. Yes, we will provide the natural gas for these with our own facilities. As I mentioned, the 2 main drivers here are reliability, number one, for our assets, keep our plants running, keep the gas flowing and number two, to benefit the grid. In our economics, we don't expect necessarily run these a lot. There's almost 9,000 hours in a year, we have run the economics we run about 1,300, which we think will be significantly lower than what they will run, and that meets our rate of return [hurdles]. That has no anomalies in it in regards to like a\u00c2\u00a0urea-type\u00c2\u00a0situation or any kind of cold weather, or any kind of huge run-up in power prices or any benefits from ancillary services or LAR and things like that. So like I said, it's not -- we're not putting these in to try to create significant returns, but it very likely could create a lot better returns than what we're projecting, but we're really building these for reliability of our assets in the grid. \nMichael Blum: Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up on the Warrior potential project. Just to clarify, if you want to have this in service by 2026, when do you need to get FID on that? \nMarshall McCrea: Pretty quick. No, probably about -- we typically -- I'll say, typically, a lot of changes over the last 3 or 4 years. But if we're able to get FID hypothetically, for example, by late third quarter, early fourth quarter, we believe we'll have it in by the end '26 at the latest. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. \nTheresa Chen: A follow-up question related to the M&A topic. Related to your comment about wanting that wellhead-to-water strategy, so pro forma the NuStar assets in the family, you now have an expansive crude oil system, Permian to Cushing, Permian to Nederland and a sizable Corpus Christi export facility. So the long-haul movement between Permian and Corpus Christi, is that a natural area where you might want to fill your portfolio? \nMarshall McCrea: Sure. I mean anywhere we can connect the dots from where producers want to go to the best markets, we want to be in that market. We certainly, over the years, have been focused on bringing as many barrels as possible from Bakken, from Midland, from Cushing to our new and used assets to benefit those as well as our downstream pipes with Bayou Bridge, our VLCC project. But certainly, if the 30 assets are for sale, that can move more crude, for example, from Midland down to Corpus, we'll always look at those. But remember, those are NuStar assets and so they're the ones that will be chasing those opportunities wherever we might fit in, where it might make sense and they want to talk to us about, we're certainly open to that. But that's probably a better NuStar question related to Corpus. \nTheresa Chen: Got it. And looking at the Dakota Access recontracting outlook and all the way through Bayou Bridge, just taking into account TMX now being online shipping not just WCS, West but also Syncrude, which seemingly has indirectly compressed Bakken dips given the connection to mainline. What is your outlook for [Indiscernible] would be contracting coming up in a couple of years and balanced with the incremental barrels that you're getting from Crestwood? \nMarshall McCrea: Yes. We love Bakken. We love what we've done out of there, proud of the role we play to get barrels out of such a great basin, the refineries in the Midwest and the Gulf Coast. So it's been a great asset for us. It's funny through the years, there's times when we have recontracting concerns on different assets, and that's just not one off. We think long term, there's blips from time to time. We think long term, it is the premier optimum outlet for producers. The best way to get your production to, as I mentioned, Patoka and into many of the Mid-Continent refineries as well as refineries around Port Arthur and Houston and then, of course, into Bayou Bridge all the way over into Lake Charles and the St. James refineries and then you add on our VLCC project. So it's just -- it's an asset that we're not really concerned if there's companies that aren't willing to roll over for a long period of time or a period of time it makes sense to us. We make no yearly at the time. We just -- we don't have a lot of concern. We think that basin is going to be very stable for the next 5 to 10 years. We don't see massive growth. But as long as oil prices remain fairly strong, we do see, like I mentioned, stable kind of consistent flows out there. We do believe we're the best option for producers and so we'll engage with anybody that wants to roll over, of course, already talking to some of them, but it's certainly not something we will sleep on. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. \nJohn Mackay: Maybe just to take one more at the power plant side. I guess, curious, are you guys operating any small plants now or have you in the past? And then if I think about this potential capacity you're adding, it's, I guess, relatively small versus what ET probably consumes overall. So do you think there's room for you guys to expand this number over time? And should we think of this as maybe kind of a first look on a kind of set of projects from here? \nMarshall McCrea: Yes, John, in fact, I thought I said it earlier, I probably didn't make it clear enough. Yes. These are first steps. There's grid problems all over the country in Texas is no exception. A lot of people are moving in Texas, a lot of data centers, a lot of AI data centers or crypto miners are still coming in industrial growth. I mean it's just we're so optimistic on -- for natural gas-fired generation. So it's something that we will continue to look at, and we will -- it will be highly unlikely that we don't announce more of these as each quarter goes on. But we are -- we will be the operator of these as I mentioned earlier, these aren't peaking units. They are units that are very good heat rates. So they're very efficient and very -- provide very well-priced megawatt of cost when we run them. And so this is just kind of the first step, and we're excited about where this may take us, especially in some areas, for example, maybe at Mont Belvieu, where we think there's a real opportunity there and then some other of our bigger cryo-complexes around the state. So it's an area that we will continue to growing. \nJohn Mackay: I appreciate that detail. Maybe just zooming out or moving over a little bit. Can you spend a minute, maybe just talking about the blue ammonia hub, maybe kind of what your role in that could look like, what kind of pieces of that value chain you'd want to own versus maybe having a partner come in and kind of run it with you? \nMarshall McCrea: Yes. We keep talking about how excited we are -- all of our fossil fuel business, especially natural gas, incremental in so many things and certainly with ammonia production. So right now, probably a little bit higher priority, a little bit more focus is in the Lake Charles area. We've got a lot of momentum with some very significant players that really know what they're doing. We're approaching this very similar to our LNG project and our potential [Pet Chem] and that we don't want to be big owners of ammonia. Do we want to operate? Yes, we'll retain ownership of some level, very likely or possible. But what really drives us is to give you an example, one of these among your plants will deliver approximately 120,000 to 130,000 Mcf a day. In Lake Charles, we're looking at anywhere from maybe 5 to 7 over a certain period of time. So it's not insignificant natural gas transportation revenue. In addition to that, we'll have storage revenue, we'll have term loan revenue, we'll be able to load it there.\u00c2\u00a0  At Lake Charles, we see enormous growth for ammonia. Everybody probably knows that the fertilizers to feed the people in the world is going to do nothing but grow depending on the experts 2% to 4% over the next 10 or 15 years. And now you've got this power side of it and fuel side of it, where ships are being built to burn ammonia as their fuel. You've got a bunkering for ammonia and then you've got South Korea and Japan and other places where ammonia is going to be blended with coal for fuel. So there's a big -- it's another big plus for NuStar in the ammonia offline they bought. We see a big future of ammonia, and it's interesting standpoint, what I just said, it really helps facilitate our natural gas transportation business as well. So we're very excited about where that's headed, and we'll do the same thing we hope as well at [Natera]. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Elvira Scotto with RBC Capital Markets. \nElvira Scotto: Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing, producer activity in the Haynesville? Looks like there was some decline on your system. Also, what you're seeing relative to what's embedded in your original expectations or your guidance? And then how you see that activity trending the rest of the year? \nMarshall McCrea: Yes. This is Mackie again. Certainly, lean plays throughout the U.S., Marcellus, Utica in the Northeast, parts of Oklahoma, Panhandle Texas and East Texas and certainly Haynesville. We've seen a slowdown. There's no [Indiscernible] when prices fall to about $50 above $60 at Henry Hub, it puts a lot of pressure on producers. So yes, we've seen it fall off fairly significantly in the Northern Haynesville for our interstate group, though, I got to get a shout out in that -- our volumes grow. And so yes, we've got to be more aggressive, our margins tightened, but we did a good job on our intrastate in North Louisiana. But yes, as far as our G&P business, we have seen it fall off. However, if you look at kind of what's happening, we saw a peak about 6 months ago with LNG exports of almost 15 Bcf. That's now down around 12 Bcf. There's another LNG facility coming on I believe in June or July. So we see growth, we start seeing demand like we believe we will overseas in Europe and elsewhere and the heat picks up this summer, we can see -- [Indiscernible] we can see demand jump up on 5 or 6 Bcf overnight. And so you see these declines in Haynesville or other areas, you're not going to be able to ramp up those that quickly. So we see pricing out the rest of this year, I think, getting as high as $350 or $360 by the end of the year, we think that possibly could be moved up that we could see higher prices mid or latter part of the summer with a hot summer, and if the LNG demand really picks up like we think it will. But yes, no doubt about it. It has been a tougher quarter on some of the main areas and Haynesville is one of those. \nElvira Scotto: Okay. Great. That's super helpful. And then just going back to your Slide 8 and the comments that you made about the 8, 10 megawatt gas-fired electric generation facilities. You also then talked about kind of data centers. So I'm curious, are you having any conversations with some of these data centers or maybe some of the utilities regarding incremental capacity or potential expansion opportunities? Or how do you think about that part of the equation longer term? \nMarshall McCrea: Yes, we are. We are all the above. We're in conversations with anybody that wants to gas up our systems, a quick little story here. So 2 or 3 years ago, we started a strategy and agenda to anything within 10 miles of any of our intra-interstate pipelines, we need to go connect. And a lot of that was focused on power plants. So we've been doing that for a while, our team -- we got [Indiscernible] and her team have done an excellent job of connecting 2 plants, of extending agreements we have to power plants, but that also rolls over into a lot of other opportunities. And so we're looking at playing a pipeline to a large chip manufacturer in Texas and as well as that we will -- we're believers like everybody else, there is the data centers and especially around AI, it's going to happen. Whether that means over the next 5 or 8 years, it's going to go drive by 3 Bcf demand of gas-generated electricity or 8 Bcf. We don't know. We just know it's going up. So in combination with population growth, as I mentioned earlier, industry growth, ammonia growth, all the AI data centers, et cetera, power plant growth. We're talking to probably separate different power plants at least on fairly significant natural gas-fired generation expansions in Texas, a handful of Oklahoma as well. So it's just that common theme that Tom and I keep talking about in this call is that the demand for natural gas is going to do nothing but go up for many years to come, and we're excited that we have the assets that we believe will benefit the most from those opportunities. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Zack Van\u00c2\u00a0Everen\u00c2\u00a0with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. \nZackery Van Everen: Maybe just circling back on that last one on the data center side. I know you guys have probably one of the larger interest footprints between the Permian and call it, Dallas. We've seen a lot of development and talks of development for the data centers in that area. Just curious on what is your ability to expand some of those intrastate pipes to maybe see more of that power demand, whether it's in Dallas or Houston or other states? \nMarshall McCrea: Well, that kind of coincides a little bit what I just said. We really have made it our job to go to connect to every possible gas generating power plant in every state that we operate in. And we certainly have done that and have tremendous capability of doing more of that in Texas. We're already connected to approximately 55% to 60% of the power plants in Texas, either directly or indirectly, we have very strategically located storage facilities, both in North Texas and near Dallas and also in the [Indiscernible] because a lot of these AI unlike the crypto miners through a lot of times, you're making a lot of money off selling the electricity and not running their computers, \"Hey, I can't do that\". I think everybody knows it's got to have reliable, so it can't rely on renewables. So yes, if we need to add additional power plants to provide that electricity to help meet all the demand in the Dallas forward area, including AI expansion, we will certainly be a part of that. Look at our assets. I mean there's nobody as you just mentioned that's even close to be able to provide the services we can, especially for those type of markets. \nZackery Van Everen: Perfect. That makes sense. And then maybe switching to Blue Marlin. If you guys were able to get the favorable EIS study as well as the permit, do you have a time frame for when that would be commercially in operation? \nMarshall McCrea: I guess I would say it like this, is that we believe that once we receive the draft EIS that we are hopefully confident that within a year, we'll get our permit and our license. We're making certain assumptions of things that might happen in November. But certainly, we are -- the great thing about our project is unlike our competitors, it's a brownfield project. I mean we have a pipe party, a lot of it already in the ground or in the sea. And so we have a huge advantage there. We have a pretty good deal for costs of some of our competitors. We think we're significantly less than that. We have the kind of unique ability to move barrels from different basins that some of our competitors can't to feed that project. So we're very optimistic. But any way to finish the answer your question, just -- just say hypothetically by second, third quarter of next year, we're ready to go. I believe we're looking at it 2.5, 3 years? Yes, about 2.5 to 3 years before it would actually own such. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Long for any closing remarks. \nThomas Long: Once again, we appreciate all of you joining us today. Thank you for your support, and we really look forward to any follow-up questions that you all have in addressing those. Thank you all. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Marshall McCrea",
            "content": "Yes.A\u0302 Jeremy, as every time that we go and acquire somebody, we always have anticipated synergies and then we just dig stuff up and find things, and once again, we're doing that with Crestwood. Some that we can talk about, for example, in the Permian Basin, they've got some idle capacity that we'll be able to utilize sooner than later will delay any kind of expansions we may need out there. There's also some things going on up in the Bakken that we can't really elaborate on, but very significant opportunities up there to help not only fill up some of their available higher now available processing capacity, but also bringing fairly significant more barrels in Dakota Access. And there's others we can go out of every other areas. But we're very excited about what we've seen early and look forward to really benefiting from some of these synergies we've already recognized. Similar is going to be the short answer. We had the $14.5, $14.8 billion. We're including an incremental $500 million just for that portion of the year for Sunoco. So that's what you're seeing at this time with where we are in the process. Sunoco team has done a great job, and we'll -- they'll be probably updating that number a little bit more as we go forward. But right now, $500 million is the number that we're using. Yes. Spiro, this is Mackie. Everything that we have in right now is what we're going to do. Next 30, 60, 90 days, we may make significant progress and some of the things we're working for. But the things that we announced recently, the additional $400 million or things that we have approved recently that we've kicked off, several of those will actually come online later this year. All of them come online kind of within 2 years or earlier. So yes, we're adding more capital, but we're also going to see revenues much quicker than, of course, a lot of our projects. Yes. I'll tell you this is kind of the first small step for us. But as everybody is aware, certainly in Texas and throughout many states, the grids are in jeopardy, very cold or hot weather. So we're doing what we can to help support that. But really, the driver behind what we're doing on adding these 10 megawatts at a time facilities is, -- number one, reliability is to make sure that when we have glitches of the grid, especially out West Texas were those not uncommon that we can keep our facilities running. In addition to that, it also will help grid security, for example, we'll be able to -- in the kind of urea-type or cold weather-type circumstances when ERCOT asks us to get off the grid, we'll be able to get off the grid, keep our plants running reliably and allow that excess energy that we're not going off to go to benefit producers, for example, upstream that might have issues with loose electricity. So we think what we're doing are kind of small steps that we'll grow into to help make our system, our assets much more liable, the grid more stable, in addition to that, I won't go into this in great detail, but there's also a lot of revenue benefits from LAR and ancillary services that we'll be able to provide with this added generation. So we're pretty excited about it. It's kind of small stuff right now, but it makes a lot of sense for our partnership. Okay. Let me start with the end of that. So on Warrior, we continue -- our team continues to work. One thing we are doing, we're going to be very disciplined and prudent. We're not going to run out and announce the project unless we feel good about all of our capacity, [sold] long term. So we're not going to run out in an FID Warrior when we have some capacity on our existing system that we're still terming up. So we're working hard, the pause in LNG has impacted a little bit with some of the bigger customers that we're working with. However, there remains, as everybody [Indiscernible] probably knows a strong interest in another pipeline, probably by mid to late 2026. We are very optimistic that we will build the next pipeline to come out of West Texas, and we'll continue to work hard to get that finish line when it makes sense.A\u0302   As far as the spread across Texas, it kind of varies month-to-month, but it's certainly north of $300,000 a day of [Indiscernible] a day that we have available that are benefiting from these widespread -- we sure hate to see prices do what they're doing at Waha, but that's what happens when you have capacity constraints, which we have right now out of the Permian. And so there is a pipeline coming on later in the year than alleviate a lot of that but certainly, the way we're positioned is very well to take advantage of that type of spread for our customers' benefit as well as for our own benefits. As far as the intrastate revenue, it's just -- it's what we've built. We feel extremely fortunate with the assets we have throughout the U.S., but especially in Texas and the team we have that's operating those assets where really cold weather times are really volatile times, even really hot weather, we have the ability to create a lot of revenue by peak hourly sales or putting some storage positions on moving gas from west to east, even backhaul. There's just a lot of things we can do with our massive intrastate pipeline network in Texas. And so -- we see this every year, we see it in most winters, many times in summer where we're able to capture kind of some unexpected revenue that will always be there at very volatile times at some level. You bet. Yes. And I want to elaborate much more on what Sun said or anybody that follows them, they kind of explained it. We're excited for them. They are kind of stepping up and kind of growing up a little bit in one regard as far as different type of assets. And there are some assets that overlap, we think there's a real benefit and potentially partnering up with them. So we are in discussions of possibly doing that. And if opportunities arise that are very beneficial and accretive to both of our partnerships as we do with other JVs, we look forward to capturing those opportunities as time moves forward. Yes, I can start with that. I guess, looking at it right now, nothing jumps out that would change it significantly. However, you walk through some hypothetical, let's just think say, everything the pause gets lifted, for example, on LNG, we intend to own maybe 20%, 25% of that. That could start earlier. That's probably not likely. But it just kind of depends on Warrior, does it pick up later in the years, sooner or later? So there's a lot of different variables and negotiations going on and even permitting issues with the government. So I think the high-level answer to that kind of the spin rate run right now, at least through '25. That's pretty consistent, but we've got a number of projects that I just alluded to in different segments that might begin quicker than others, and that would, of course, queue it one way or the other. No update. We're excited that phase, and we're diligently moving through that phase. We will be adding ethane storage and we are excited about the future of our export facilities and capabilities and revenues out of the markets for many years to come. Michael, this is Mackie. Yes, we will provide the natural gas for these with our own facilities. As I mentioned, the 2 main drivers here are reliability, number one, for our assets, keep our plants running, keep the gas flowing and number two, to benefit the grid. In our economics, we don't expect necessarily run these a lot. There's almost 9,000 hours in a year, we have run the economics we run about 1,300, which we think will be significantly lower than what they will run, and that meets our rate of return [hurdles]. That has no anomalies in it in regards to like aA\u0302 urea-typeA\u0302 situation or any kind of cold weather, or any kind of huge run-up in power prices or any benefits from ancillary services or LAR and things like that. So like I said, it's not -- we're not putting these in to try to create significant returns, but it very likely could create a lot better returns than what we're projecting, but we're really building these for reliability of our assets in the grid. Pretty quick. No, probably about -- we typically -- I'll say, typically, a lot of changes over the last 3 or 4 years. But if we're able to get FID hypothetically, for example, by late third quarter, early fourth quarter, we believe we'll have it in by the end '26 at the latest. Sure. I mean anywhere we can connect the dots from where producers want to go to the best markets, we want to be in that market. We certainly, over the years, have been focused on bringing as many barrels as possible from Bakken, from Midland, from Cushing to our new and used assets to benefit those as well as our downstream pipes with Bayou Bridge, our VLCC project. But certainly, if the 30 assets are for sale, that can move more crude, for example, from Midland down to Corpus, we'll always look at those. But remember, those are NuStar assets and so they're the ones that will be chasing those opportunities wherever we might fit in, where it might make sense and they want to talk to us about, we're certainly open to that. But that's probably a better NuStar question related to Corpus. Yes. We love Bakken. We love what we've done out of there, proud of the role we play to get barrels out of such a great basin, the refineries in the Midwest and the Gulf Coast. So it's been a great asset for us. It's funny through the years, there's times when we have recontracting concerns on different assets, and that's just not one off. We think long term, there's blips from time to time. We think long term, it is the premier optimum outlet for producers. The best way to get your production to, as I mentioned, Patoka and into many of the Mid-Continent refineries as well as refineries around Port Arthur and Houston and then, of course, into Bayou Bridge all the way over into Lake Charles and the St. James refineries and then you add on our VLCC project. So it's just -- it's an asset that we're not really concerned if there's companies that aren't willing to roll over for a long period of time or a period of time it makes sense to us. We make no yearly at the time. We just -- we don't have a lot of concern. We think that basin is going to be very stable for the next 5 to 10 years. We don't see massive growth. But as long as oil prices remain fairly strong, we do see, like I mentioned, stable kind of consistent flows out there. We do believe we're the best option for producers and so we'll engage with anybody that wants to roll over, of course, already talking to some of them, but it's certainly not something we will sleep on. Yes, John, in fact, I thought I said it earlier, I probably didn't make it clear enough. Yes. These are first steps. There's grid problems all over the country in Texas is no exception. A lot of people are moving in Texas, a lot of data centers, a lot of AI data centers or crypto miners are still coming in industrial growth. I mean it's just we're so optimistic on -- for natural gas-fired generation. So it's something that we will continue to look at, and we will -- it will be highly unlikely that we don't announce more of these as each quarter goes on. But we are -- we will be the operator of these as I mentioned earlier, these aren't peaking units. They are units that are very good heat rates. So they're very efficient and very -- provide very well-priced megawatt of cost when we run them. And so this is just kind of the first step, and we're excited about where this may take us, especially in some areas, for example, maybe at Mont Belvieu, where we think there's a real opportunity there and then some other of our bigger cryo-complexes around the state. So it's an area that we will continue to growing. Yes. We keep talking about how excited we are -- all of our fossil fuel business, especially natural gas, incremental in so many things and certainly with ammonia production. So right now, probably a little bit higher priority, a little bit more focus is in the Lake Charles area. We've got a lot of momentum with some very significant players that really know what they're doing. We're approaching this very similar to our LNG project and our potential [Pet Chem] and that we don't want to be big owners of ammonia. Do we want to operate? Yes, we'll retain ownership of some level, very likely or possible. But what really drives us is to give you an example, one of these among your plants will deliver approximately 120,000 to 130,000 Mcf a day. In Lake Charles, we're looking at anywhere from maybe 5 to 7 over a certain period of time. So it's not insignificant natural gas transportation revenue. In addition to that, we'll have storage revenue, we'll have term loan revenue, we'll be able to load it there.A\u0302   At Lake Charles, we see enormous growth for ammonia. Everybody probably knows that the fertilizers to feed the people in the world is going to do nothing but grow depending on the experts 2% to 4% over the next 10 or 15 years. And now you've got this power side of it and fuel side of it, where ships are being built to burn ammonia as their fuel. You've got a bunkering for ammonia and then you've got South Korea and Japan and other places where ammonia is going to be blended with coal for fuel. So there's a big -- it's another big plus for NuStar in the ammonia offline they bought. We see a big future of ammonia, and it's interesting standpoint, what I just said, it really helps facilitate our natural gas transportation business as well. So we're very excited about where that's headed, and we'll do the same thing we hope as well at [Natera]. Yes. This is Mackie again. Certainly, lean plays throughout the U.S., Marcellus, Utica in the Northeast, parts of Oklahoma, Panhandle Texas and East Texas and certainly Haynesville. We've seen a slowdown. There's no [Indiscernible] when prices fall to about $50 above $60 at Henry Hub, it puts a lot of pressure on producers. So yes, we've seen it fall off fairly significantly in the Northern Haynesville for our interstate group, though, I got to get a shout out in that -- our volumes grow. And so yes, we've got to be more aggressive, our margins tightened, but we did a good job on our intrastate in North Louisiana. But yes, as far as our G&P business, we have seen it fall off. However, if you look at kind of what's happening, we saw a peak about 6 months ago with LNG exports of almost 15 Bcf. That's now down around 12 Bcf. There's another LNG facility coming on I believe in June or July. So we see growth, we start seeing demand like we believe we will overseas in Europe and elsewhere and the heat picks up this summer, we can see -- [Indiscernible] we can see demand jump up on 5 or 6 Bcf overnight. And so you see these declines in Haynesville or other areas, you're not going to be able to ramp up those that quickly. So we see pricing out the rest of this year, I think, getting as high as $350 or $360 by the end of the year, we think that possibly could be moved up that we could see higher prices mid or latter part of the summer with a hot summer, and if the LNG demand really picks up like we think it will. But yes, no doubt about it. It has been a tougher quarter on some of the main areas and Haynesville is one of those. Yes, we are. We are all the above. We're in conversations with anybody that wants to gas up our systems, a quick little story here. So 2 or 3 years ago, we started a strategy and agenda to anything within 10 miles of any of our intra-interstate pipelines, we need to go connect. And a lot of that was focused on power plants. So we've been doing that for a while, our team -- we got [Indiscernible] and her team have done an excellent job of connecting 2 plants, of extending agreements we have to power plants, but that also rolls over into a lot of other opportunities. And so we're looking at playing a pipeline to a large chip manufacturer in Texas and as well as that we will -- we're believers like everybody else, there is the data centers and especially around AI, it's going to happen. Whether that means over the next 5 or 8 years, it's going to go drive by 3 Bcf demand of gas-generated electricity or 8 Bcf. We don't know. We just know it's going up. So in combination with population growth, as I mentioned earlier, industry growth, ammonia growth, all the AI data centers, et cetera, power plant growth. We're talking to probably separate different power plants at least on fairly significant natural gas-fired generation expansions in Texas, a handful of Oklahoma as well. So it's just that common theme that Tom and I keep talking about in this call is that the demand for natural gas is going to do nothing but go up for many years to come, and we're excited that we have the assets that we believe will benefit the most from those opportunities. Well, that kind of coincides a little bit what I just said. We really have made it our job to go to connect to every possible gas generating power plant in every state that we operate in. And we certainly have done that and have tremendous capability of doing more of that in Texas. We're already connected to approximately 55% to 60% of the power plants in Texas, either directly or indirectly, we have very strategically located storage facilities, both in North Texas and near Dallas and also in the [Indiscernible] because a lot of these AI unlike the crypto miners through a lot of times, you're making a lot of money off selling the electricity and not running their computers, \"Hey, I can't do that\". I think everybody knows it's got to have reliable, so it can't rely on renewables. So yes, if we need to add additional power plants to provide that electricity to help meet all the demand in the Dallas forward area, including AI expansion, we will certainly be a part of that. Look at our assets. I mean there's nobody as you just mentioned that's even close to be able to provide the services we can, especially for those type of markets. I guess I would say it like this, is that we believe that once we receive the draft EIS that we are hopefully confident that within a year, we'll get our permit and our license.

We think we're significantly less than that. We have the kind of unique ability to move barrels from different basins that some of our competitors can't to feed that project. So we're very optimistic. But any way to finish the answer your question, just -- just say hypothetically by second, third quarter of next year, we're ready to go. I believe we're looking at it 2.5, 3 years? Yes, about 2.5 to 3 years before it would actually own such."

            "name": "Thomas Long",
            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, which we expect to file tomorrow, May 9. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation for non-GAAP measures on our website.A\u0302   I'll start today by going over our financial results. For the first quarter of 2024, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.9 billion compared to $3.4 billion for the first quarter of 2023. We had record volumes through our crude pipelines and also saw strong performances across the rest of our operations. DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, was $2.4 billion compared to $2 billion for the first quarter of last year. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $1.3 billion. On April 24, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.3175 per common unit or $1.27 on an annualized basis. This distribution represents an increase of 3.3% and from the $0.3075 paid in the first quarter of 2023. In February, Fitch upgraded Energy Transfer's senior unsecured credit rating to BBB with a stable outlook, which followed an upgrade by S&P to BBB in 2023. At the end of the first quarter, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Following the redemption of all of our outstanding Series C and Series D preferred units in February of 2024, in March, we issued a notice to redeem all of Energy Transfer's outstanding Series E preferred units on May 15, 2024.A\u0302 In April of 2024, we redeemed $1.7 billion of senior notes using cash on hand and proceeds from our revolving credit facility. And for the first quarter of 2024, we spent approximately $460 million on organic growth capital, primarily in the Midstream and NGL and refined products segments, excluding Sun and USA Compression CapEx.A\u0302   Now turning to our results by segment for the first quarter, and we'll start with NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was $989 million compared to $939 million for the first quarter of 2023. This was primarily due to growth across our transportation, fractionation and terminal operations, which was partially offset by lower gains from hedged NGL inventory. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2023 included gains that were carried over from the prior year. NGL transportation volumes increased 5% to 2.1 million barrels per day. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes from the Permian region on the Mariner East pipeline system and on the Gulf Coast export pipelines. NGL fractionation volumes increased 11% to 1.1 million barrels per day. Total NGL export volumes grew 6% over the first quarter of 2023. We continue to see strong international demand for natural gas liquids and saw record LPG exports out of our Nederland terminal for the month of March. During the first quarter of 2024, we loaded approximately 14 million barrels of ethane out of Nederland and nearly 7 million barrels of ethane out of Marcus Hook. During the first quarter, we continued to export approximately 20% of worldwide NGL exports.A\u0302   For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $696 million compared to $641 million for the first quarter of 2023. This was primarily due to the addition of the Crestwood assets as well as higher volumes in the Permian Basin. As a reminder, results in the first quarter of 2023 included a onetime positive adjustment of approximately $40 million. Gathered gas volumes increased to 19.9 million MMBtus per day compared to 19.8 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year. Now for our crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $848 million compared to $526 million for the first quarter of 2023. This was primarily due to significantly stronger pipeline volumes, increased terminal throughput as well as favorable timing on gains associated with hedged inventory. We also benefited from the acquisition of the Lotus and Crestwood assets in May and November of 2023, respectively. Results for the first quarter of 2024 included a $40 million benefit related to favorable timing on gains associated with hedged inventory, a portion of which we expect to reverse in the second quarter. And as a reminder, the first quarter of 2023 did include onetime negative adjustments of approximately $35 million. Crude oil transportation volumes increased 44% to a record 6.1 million barrels per day compared to 4.2 million barrels per day for the same period last year. Excluding the additions of Crestwood and LOTUS, adjusted EBITDA and crude oil transportation volumes on our base business increased 47% and 14%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2023.A\u0302   In our Interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $483 million compared to $536 million for the first quarter of 2023. During the quarter, we saw margin growth related to higher contracted volumes at increased rates on several of our pipelines. This growth was more than offset by lower operational sales resulting from lower prices and unplanned maintenance projects. In addition, the first quarter of 2023 included a onetime benefit from the realization of certain amounts related to a shipper bankruptcy. Total system volumes increased 5% over the same period last year due to increased demand and higher utilization on the Transwestern Tiger Trunkline and Gulf Run pipeline systems. We continue to fully utilize Zone 1 capacity on Gulf Run, and with the completion of the Trunkline backhaul project, we are fully utilizing deliveries into our trunk line pipeline from Zone 2. Our team continues to work on the next phase of a potential capacity expansion to facilitate the transportation of natural gas from Northern Louisiana to the Gulf Coast based upon customer demand. And for our intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $438 million compared to $409 million for the first quarter of last year. During the first quarter of 2024, we recorded gains of approximately $250 million related to pipeline optimization opportunities that were not expected to repeat throughout the remainder of the year. In addition, we saw volume ramp-ups and new contracts on several of our Texas pipelines. All of this was partially offset by lower storage optimization opportunities.A\u0302   Turning to our growth projects, and we'll start with Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals. Our NGL terminals continue to benefit from increased demand, both in the United States as well as from international customers. Construction of the expansion to our NGL export capacity at Nederland continues to progress. This expansion is expected to give us the flexibility to load various products based upon customer demand. We have completed the installation of all pilings for the facility and the construction remains on schedule for an anticipated in-service in mid-2025 for the initial phases of the project. And as mentioned on our last call, we are also building new refrigerated storage at Nederland, which is expected to increase our butane storage capacity by 33% and double our propane storage capacity. This will further increase our ability to keep customer ships loaded on time and give us the ability to more than fully optimize our export capabilities. We expect the total combined cost of these 2 projects to be approximately $1.5 billion.A\u0302   At our Marcus Hook terminal, construction continues on the first phase of an optimization project that would add incremental ethane refrigeration and storage capacity. On our Lone Star NGL pipelines we recently [FID-ed] 2 projects that will debottleneck our West Texas Gateway and Lone Star Express pipelines. On the gateway pipeline, a debottlenecking project is underway that will allow us to fully utilize our interest on the Epic pipeline and optimize our deliveries from the Delaware Basin into the gateway pipeline for deliveries into Mont Belvieu. These upgrades are expected to be completed in 2025. As a reminder, this undivided interest was acquired as part of the Crestwood acquisition, and it's just one of the several synergy projects we are working on. And on the Lone Star Express, we are completing upgrades that are expected to provide more than 90,000 barrels per day of incremental Permian NGL takeaway capacity upon its anticipated in-service in 2026. The combined project costs are expected to be approximately $125 million. Upon completion of these 2 projects, our total deliverability in the Mont Belvieu is expected to increase to more than 1.3 million barrels per day.A\u0302   As we mentioned on our last call in early 2024, we closed on the acquisition of 2 pipelines. Sabina 1 Pipeline from Mont Belvieu to the Houston Ship Channel and the Sabina 2 Pipeline from Mont Belvieu to our Nederland terminal. We recently commenced the conversion of the Sabina 2 pipeline to provide additional natural gasoline service between our Mont Belvieu NGL complex and our Nederland storage and export terminal. This project, which we anticipate will be in service in 2025, is expected to increase the capacity from 25,000 barrels per day to approximately 70,000 barrels per day. In addition, discussions are ongoing to provide transportation for potentially multiple products on the Sabina 1 Pipeline that extends from Mont Belvieu to the Houston Ship Channel. As a reminder, in addition to the incremental processing capacity acquired through the Crestwood acquisition, we are expanding our processing capacity at several of our existing processing plants. In total, we are moving forward with upgrades to add approximately 200 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity in West Texas. In addition, we recently completed upgrades in South Texas that added approximately 60 million cubic feet per day. These upgrades can be completed at more favorable capital cost when compared to building a new processing plant.A\u0302   Also, we continue to increase optionality and improve reliability along our pipeline systems. At the end of 2023, we completed a backhaul project on our trunk line pipeline. The project added an incremental 400,000 Mcf per day of Southern flow capacity on the pipeline system at very efficient capital cost. Looking at our crude oil assets, we are adding a direct connection from Midland to our pipeline that flows from the Permian Basin to Cushing. The construction of this approximately 30-mile pipeline continues. And upon its anticipated completion in the fourth quarter of this year, it is expected to be able to transport approximately 100,000 barrels per day of crude from our terminals in Midland, Texas to our terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma.A\u0302   We also continue to develop our proposed Blue Marlin offshore project, and we are hoping to receive the draft EIS this quarter. As a reminder, in November of 2023, we announced a heads of agreement or HOA with Total Energy's for crude offtake. And additional customers remain very engaged and interested in our project, recognizing the value of fully loading VLCCs and the reduced execution risk that comes with repurposing existing underutilized assets. Now for an update on Lake Charles LNG project. As we discussed on our last earnings call in January of this year, the Biden administration imposed a moratorium on the approval of LNG exports, while the Department of Energy conduct studies to determine whether LNG exports are in the public interest. The Biden administration stated that these studies would focus on the cumulative impact of LNG exports on climate change, U.S. natural gas prices and the impact of LNG facilities on local communities. We remain optimistic that the DOE studies will continue to support DOE export authorizations, particularly for LNG projects that have lower Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions profiles like Lake Charles. And so we continue to believe that Lake Charles LNG will receive a DOE export authorization in due course. As such, Lake Charles LNG continues to pursue the development of the project. In this regard, Lake Charles LNG is in discussions with LNG offtake customers for the remaining unsold offtake volumes necessary to take FID. Lake Charles LNG remains extremely thankful for the continued support of its existing LNG customers.A\u0302   And for a brief update on other projects. Energy Transfer has approved 8-10 megawatt natural gas-fired electric generation facilities to support the partnership's operations in Texas. We expect these facilities to go into service throughout 2025 and 2026. On the blue ammonia front, we continue to develop an ammonia hub concept at Lake Charles, Louisiana and Nederland, Texas, where we have deep water access at our existing facilities. This hub concept would allow us to provide critical infrastructure services to several blue ammonia facilities, including natural gas supply, CO2 transportation to third-party sequestration sites, ammonia storage and deep water marine loading facilities. This hub concept is expected to promote economies of scale and efficiencies as compared to individual stand-alone blue ammonia projects and the market response to this approach has been favorable. Yesterday, we entered into an agreement with Capture Point that commits CO2 from our treating facilities in Northern Louisiana to the capture and sequestration project being jointly developed by Capture Point and Energy Transfer.A\u0302   Now looking ahead at our 2024 organic growth capital guidance. With the addition of several new growth projects, we now expect 2024 growth capital expenditures to be approximately $2.9 billion, which will be spent primarily in the NGL and refined products and midstream segments. This has been revised from our previous guidance for approximately $2.5 billion to include newly approved debottlenecking projects on our Lone Star Express and Gateway NGL pipelines, the Sabina 2 pipe conversion, optimization work at Mont Belvieu, backhaul, looping and compression projects on FGT, new power generation facilities as well as additional processing plant optimization in the Permian and gathering system build-outs and compression projects in the midstream segment. We continue to expect our long-term annual growth capital run rate to be approximately $2 billion to $3 billion.A\u0302   Now turning to our adjusted EBITDA guidance. We are raising our 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to be between $15 billion to $15.3 billion compared to our prior guidance range of $14.5 billion to $14.8 billion. Our 2024 guidance has been updated to include earnings related to Sunoco's acquisition of the NuStar assets, which closed May 3. As we look at our first quarter performance and bring the NuStar assets into the family, we continue to be excited about 2024 and are comfortable that we can deliver on our plan despite various market headwinds like lower gas prices and production curtailments that have impacted midstream volumes. Overall, worldwide demand for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and refined products remained strong. as does demand for our products and services. We will continue to position ourselves to meet this demand by strategically targeting optimization and expansion projects that enhance our existing asset base and generate attractive returns. We also continue to pursue synergy opportunities around recently acquired assets with several projects underway, including the optimization of processing capacity in West Texas and NGL pipeline takeaway capacity from the Delaware Basin. Our financial position continues to be stronger than any time inA\u0302 Energy Transfer's history, which we believe will provide us with the continued flexibility to balance pursuing new growth opportunities, further leverage reduction, maintaining our targeted distribution growth rate and increasing equity returns to our unitholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line up for the first question. Yes. I mean, I'll go ahead and start. We still feel very good about the $80 million on the cost synergy side that we said we would be able to achieve, and that's going well. And then I'm looking over at Mackie will comment on the commercial side of it. There's obviously 2 -- as far as just the overall equity Jeremy, if I understand you correctly, equity returns, meaning that we continue to bump the distributions, but I don't ever want to say that we're not focused on unit buybacks when we get to the right place from a leverage standpoint. And what I mean is when we're kind of looking out at the forecast, we'll be opportunistic there. Yes. That's -- listen, that's obviously a very, very good question. We spent a lot of time within Energy Transfer strategizing here. I will -- I think I will start off saying that we still feel like consolidation makes sense in the midstream space. So just at the 50,000-foot answer to your question, we still fully intend on evaluating various opportunities as we look out. So we're not going to slow down on that front. Now as far as what we look at is going to be always trying to look at those things that feed all the way downstream. We always like to talk about how we go from wellhead to the water, and we do it across all the commodities. So you can see our strategy as we look at this stuff and what assets we look at as to how it feeds all the way through the value chain when we make these acquisitions. And it gives us great opportunities for commercial synergies when we do that as well as the cost synergies.A\u0302   Now as to the -- I guess, as to the last part of your question about theA\u0302 Energy TransferA\u0302 versus Sunoco, clearly, the Sunoco team has done a fantastic job on this new star. I couldn't be more excited about that asset base coming into the family here. So what you'll see is, you'll see that they're in kind of the wholesale fuel distribution terminal business, et cetera. And you're right, there's going to be some overlap and in those instances, we'll look at ways on a combined basis of what we can do. But Sunoco's can continue to make those kind of acquisitions. This is really their first big public company transaction. They've made a lot of other asset acquisitions, but it's clearly something that's very, very accretive to them, and it's very good for the family from that standpoint. And I'm going to look across the table to Mackie and give him a chance to add in a little bit more even on the latest NuStar acquisition and some of the optimizations we might be looking at here. Did that answer all your question there? Once again, we appreciate all of you joining us today. Thank you for your support, and we really look forward to any follow-up questions that you all have in addressing those. Thank you all."
