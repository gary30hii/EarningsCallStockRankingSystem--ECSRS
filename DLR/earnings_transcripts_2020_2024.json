During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and callers will be limited to one question plus a follow-up. Due to time constraints, we will conclude promptly at the bottom of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. John, please go ahead.\nJohn Stewart: Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and EVP of Sales and Marketing, Corey Dyer, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our fourth quarter results. We delivered high-quality quarterly bookings in terms of total volume as well as the product mix, geographic split and the number of new logos landing on PlatformDIGITAL. We extended our global platform entering Greece with the acquisition of the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Southeastern Europe and securing customer growth in existing markets around the world with key land purchases and new builds. We delivered solid financial results with core FFO per share $0.08 ahead of consensus, driven by operational outperformance. Finally, we further strengthened the balance sheet, lowering our weighted average cost of debt with the redemption of high-coupon debt and preferred equity, while extending our weighted average duration with the issuance of attractively priced long-term capital. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Stein: Thanks, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. The fourth quarter capped off a transformational year for Digital Realty. We acquired several highly connected assets, including the Westin Building in North America and Interxion in EMEA, along with the leading colocation and interconnection providers in Southeastern Europe, significantly expanding our platform in EMEA, while trimming non-core assets in North America. We delivered record bookings for the full-year, an extraordinary performance under any set of circumstances, but particularly amid the headwinds of a global pandemic. Our business is increasingly global. In 2020, we nearly doubled the number of countries where Digital Realty has a presence and EMEA accounted for more than half our fourth quarter bookings. The first time ever a majority of our bookings has been outside the Americas. We more than doubled our Cross Connect count in 2020, reflecting the growing concentration of network-dense highly connected assets on PlatformDIGITAL. We landed a record number of new logos in 2020, more than twice as many as our previous record, in fact, driving consistent growth in our enterprise colocation and interconnection business. The vibrant communities on our campus environments are attracting a growing set of new customers, diversifying and solidifying our revenue streams. Service providers and enterprises alike are strengthening their partnership with a select number of trusted global data center partners to help meet their growing needs around the world, and Digital Realty is uniquely well-positioned to serve as their partner of choice. Let's turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on Page 3. In October, we formally committed to reducing direct and indirect emissions by 68% and indirect emissions in our value chain by area by 24% by 2030 in line with a 1.5 degree climate change scenario. We set our target with science-based targets initiative, along with over 1,000 organizations that have committed to reduce emissions. And we also signed the UN Global Compact business ambition for 1.5 degree C, joining leading companies who have committed to ambitious carbon reduction targets. In early December, we announced that our operations in France were on target to achieve a carbon-neutral footprint by the end of the year, and are expected to remain carbon-neutral through 2030 for both existing facilities and future expansion based on Scope 1 and 2 emissions. In mid-December, we were honored to receive NAREIT\u2019s Leader in the Light Award for data center sustainability for the fourth consecutive year. In early January, we issued our fifth green bond, extending our lead as the largest U.S. REIT issuer bonds committed to sustainable investments. Our green bond framework is aligned with leading global best practices, including GRESB\u2019s green bond principles, as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals. And Sustainalytics has provided an independent second-party opinion, including that our green bond program is considered robust, credible and transparent. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and the broader society. In terms of our social efforts, we recently selected diversity, equity and inclusion as one of four company-wide philanthropic areas of focus in addition to sustainability, disaster relief and STEM education. As you may be aware, NAREIT recently instituted a dividends through diversity and inclusion program, which I am honored to be co-chairing, along with Tom Baltimore of Park Hotels and Debbie Cafaro of Ventas. Dividends through diversity will promote the recruitment, inclusion and advancement of women, minorities and other under-represented groups and REITs in the broader commercial real estate industry. We have also joined leaders across 85 industries in signing the CEO Pledge on CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, an initiative that aims to rally the business community, to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace and to cultivate a trusting environment where employees feel empowered to have discussions on these topics.  Participating in these programs and others like them is critical to our industries future because it is the right thing to do and because we serve a broad, diverse community. And we believe that to help our customers prepare for the future, we need industry professionals whose insights and perspectives reflect the communities we serve. We are doing our best to play a constructive, proactive role in advancing our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities we serve around the world. Let's turn now to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to expand our global platform with the acquisition of the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Southeastern Europe, groundbreakings and existing markets across EMEA and strategic land purchase on the continent and in Asia Pacific. In early November, we acquired Lamda Hellix, the largest carrier-neutral colocation and interconnection provider in Greece, led by an accomplished management team who will continue to manage the business. As leading service providers continue to expand their footprint, we expect Greece and other parts of Southeastern Europe will be major beneficiaries. We are well positioned to capture the key cloud and connectivity deployments that will accelerate the regions digital transformation. In Denmark, we began construction on our third data center adjacent to the two existing facilities on our Copenhagen campus and offering direct access to leading global cloud providers, numerous networks, Internet exchanges and a transatlantic subsea cable system. We also broke ground on a new data center in Z\u00fcrich, where we have seen robust demand from leading global service providers. The expansion of our Z\u00fcrich campus will provide runway for customer growth at the leading cloud and interconnection hub in Switzerland. We also acquired a land parcel within one kilometer of our highly interconnected campuses in Vienna and halfway around the globe in Sydney, we are under contract to acquire two parcels that will support the development of up to 250 megawatts. These strategic land holdings will provide additional capacity, enabling local and global service providers to seamlessly expand adjacent to their existing deployments. Let's turn to Page 5 for an update on the Interxion integration. The successful integration of Interxion was our top priority for 2020, and we made excellent progress despite the pandemic. We build a solid foundation for the assimilation of our businesses and we are well on our way to achieving the objectives and synergies we outlined when we first announced the transaction. I am proud of what we've accomplished today and excited about our prospects as we move into the implementation phase in 2021. When we announced the transaction, we stated that the combined company would have enhanced capabilities to address and so the public and hybrid cloud architecture requirements of our global customer base that would allow us to build upon each company's current relationships with leading global customers, while also enabling us to effectively compete in the broader target markets. The early results are very promising. We've enjoyed excellent success with global platform providers and early cross-selling wins have surpassed expectations with numerous referrals between the sales teams. The significant embedded growth potential was another key element of the Interxion and investment thesis. We believe the combined organization has already created significant long-term value by executing on the existing development pipeline, acquiring the freehold to the land under key positions in Frankfurt and Paris and securing land in key markets to support future growth. Let's turn to demand drivers on Page 6. We continue to be fortunate to be operating in a business leverages secular demand drivers. As the leading global data center provider, we have a unique vantage point that enables us to detect secular trends as they emerge. We recently introduced the Data Gravity Index, which measures, quantifies and forecast the growing intensity of the enterprise data-creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. This groundbreaking index is a by-product of our market intelligence analysis as well as our obsessive focus on understanding customers\u2019 deployments and supporting their evolving infrastructure needs. Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of Data Gravity. According to the market intelligence firm IDC, 80% of the world's data will reside within enterprises by the year 2025. A 451 Research global IT leader survey recently found that 87% of IT leaders will need to maintain local copies of critical data and global points of presence to meet regulatory requirements.  We continue to see these indicators as enterprises expand their private data infrastructure deployments and integrate data exchange with adjacent business and service provider partners across our global platform.  Digital Realty recently received Frost & Sullivan's APAC Data Center Strategy Innovator award, recognizing PlatformDIGITAL for providing an innovative global platform enabling enterprises to scale digital transformation in a consistent modular fashion and addressing the unique infrastructure requirements for integrating private data flows across multiple public platforms. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market-leading innovation to meeting the needs of our global data center customer base. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.\nAndrew Power: Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 8. We signed total bookings of $130 million in the fourth quarter, including a $12 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise-oriented deals of one megawatt or less totaled $31 million, building upon the consistent momentum throughout the year and demonstrating the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand. The weighted average lease term was over eight years. We secured 120 new logos during the quarter with more than half of those new logos landing in EMEA, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. EMEA accounted for more than half of our fourth quarter bookings while Asia Pacific contributed over 15%. As Bill mentioned, this was the first time the majority of our bookings were outside the Americas. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a rapidly growing cloud-based cybersecurity provider selected PlatformDIGITAL for multiple environments in London and Boston to facilitate modernization and embrace high performance compute technology while maintaining an exceptional user experience. In New York, the Digital Realty\u2019s teams\u2019 deep understanding of a global retailers growth strategy enabled us to tailor a solution for their Americas markets on PlatformDIGITAL. We also overcame lockdowns and international travel restrictions to demonstrate to a digital telecom provider as they can leverage PlatformDIGITAL to meet their current and future growth requirements in existing and targeted markets at their required pace. A rapidly growing gaming platform experienced their hedge to rewire their network and optimized data exchange with third-party clouds, the growth of their existing footprint with us in Northern Virginia and a new deployment in Chicago. Likewise in Chicago, a global exchange operator leveraged PlatformDIGITAL to extend their access into our highly interconnected community. In Singapore, two leading global financial services firms expanded with Digital Realty due to our platform offering and long history of operational excellence, while a software developer selected PlatformDIGITAL to expand their proprietary cloud offering into the region. Turning to our backlog on Page 10. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced reached an all-time high of $269 million. The step up from $229 million last quarter, reflect $78 million of commencements during the fourth quarter offset by roughly $118 million of combined space and power leases signed. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at 8.5 months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 11. We signed $156 million of renewals during the fourth quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average term loan renewals signed during the fourth quarter was a little over three years, reflecting a roughly even split in the mix between deals above and below one megawatt. Cash re-leasing spreads on renewals were plus 1% and cash rents were positive on renewals above and below one megawatt, an encouraging sign for pricing. We retained 79% of expiring leases in line with our long-term historical average. In terms of fourth quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy improved 40 basis points, driven primarily by leases commencing on recent deliveries in Ashburn and the sale of a vacant building in Amsterdam. Same capital occupancy was down 40 basis points from the third quarter due to no move-outs, partially offset by positive absorption in Silicon Valley and Chicago. Same capital cash NOI growth has continued to improve since bottoming in 2019 and ticked up slightly to negative 1.6% in the fourth quarter. For the full-year, same capital cash NOI growth was negative 1.9% or a little over 100 basis points better than initially expected. As a reminder, the Westin Building, Interxion, Lamda Hellix and Altus IT are not yet included in the same store pool, but we expect each of these acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 12. The U.S. dollar softened in the second half of the year, providing a bit of an FX tailwind in the fourth quarter, relative to the prior year average. Overall, FX represented roughly a 50 basis point tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In terms of vertical concentration, as you can see from the pie chart on the upper right, we are fortunate to be primarily serving customers whose businesses are thriving in the current environment with limited exposure to the sectors most negatively impacted. Rent collections remained in line with our historical average, and requests for rent relief have largely subsided. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy and matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term, fixed-rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have roughly a 50 basis point impact on our full-year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed, and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, the fourth quarter core FFO per share was down 0.6% year-over-year, but $0.08 ahead of consensus driven primarily by operational outperformance. For the full-year, core FFO per share came in $0.22 or nearly 4% ahead of our initial guidance. As previewed on our third quarter call, we expect to deliver double-digit revenue growth driven by a full-year contribution from Interxion and the record colocation in interconnection and overall bookings in 2020. We expect that EBITDA margin will remain in line with the fourth quarter throughout 2021. As Bill mentioned, we remain on track to achieve the synergies we underwrote on the Interxion transaction. Although the rationale for the deal has always been accelerating revenue growth rather than realizing expense synergies. We've already made great strides on our financing plans for the year with a highly successful 1 billion green euro bond offering in early January at five eights in addition to solid progress on the capital recycling front. As always, we expect to remain nimble for the rest of the year and we may look to capitalize on favorable market conditions to lock in long-term fixed rate financing at attractive coupons across the currencies that support our assets to proactively manage future liabilities. In terms of FFO per share guidance, our forecast is largely unchanged from the preliminary outlook we previewed on the third quarter call, although the year-over-year bar has been raised in the interim given the outperformance in the fourth quarter. At the midpoint, our 2021 guidance represents growth of approximately 4%, which includes near-term dilution from capital recycling. In terms of the quarterly run rate, we expect the split between the first half of the year and the second half of the year to be approximately 49/51. In other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page 13, we expect to dip down by about a nickel in the first quarter, then to ramp up fairly steadily over the rest of the year. In terms of the quarterly dividend, the distribution policy is ultimately a Board level decision. Given the continued growth in our cash flows and taxable income, we would expect to see continued growth in the per share dividend just as we have each and every year since our IPO in 2004. Last, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 14. During the fourth quarter, we continued to execute on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options or minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. Fixed charge coverage reached 5.1x, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was slightly elevated to 6.1x as of year-end, but is expected to come back down in line with our long-term range over the course of the year through the combination of proceeds from asset sales and growth in cash flows as leases commenced from the record leasing activity in 2020. In mid-October, we redeemed \u00a3300 million or 4.75% sterling bonds due in 2023. We also redeemed $250 million of high-coupon series G preferred at [5.78%]. In early January, we raised a 1 billion of 10.5-year green euro bonds at an all time low-coupon for Digital Realty of 0.625%. We also retired $350 million of 2.75% bonds due in 2023. And we paid all $530 million outstanding on the term loan due in 2023. This successful execution against our financial strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides the access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 14, we've extended our weighted average debt maturity out nearly seven years or ratcheting our weighted average coupon down to 2.3%, and little over half our debt is euro denominated reflecting the growth of our global platform post-Interxion and acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 98% of our debt is unsecured providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 14, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities, and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now we would be pleased to take your questions. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session?\nOperator: We will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Atkin: Thank you. So the first question regards - is regarding leasing and you talked about logo capture, but I wondered of your largest kind of multi-megawatt deals, any kind of highlights by geography or type of company? And then the second question kind of gets to M&A and divestitures and new market entry and kind of any \u2013 any kind of a highlights to call out in terms of your appetite for any of those types of projects heading into 2021?\nAndrew Power: Hey. Thanks, Jon. I can probably kick it off on the question on the multi-megawatt side, and then I'll probably hand it over to Greg to speak to M&A. So I'm very pleased with the results overall in terms of 4Q. I think the diversity of the platform really shine through in both categories, not only the less than a megawatt in interconnection, but also on the scale or hyperscale plus. If you do a quick kind of run through the regions, EMEA, first time more than 50% of the signings, it was very diverse. There were six different markets across the EMEA that did a north of a megawatt deal each. So it was London, Paris, Marseille and two others that escaped my mind. And then over in the Americas, we had both in Ashburn and also in Hillsborough, and the cast of characters for all these are the combination of the major CSPs, SaaS providers and, call it, B2C hyperscalers as well. And then last but not least, I'm pleased with the results in both Brazil and we signed our second customer in Santiago, Chile, in the hyperscale arena, another top CSP. And then last but not least, had a project with a top three CSP down in Sydney. So really diverse contribution from numerous major metros. And I'll turn it over to Greg to pick up on the M&A piece.\nJonathan Atkin: Actually just continuing on that, as you look at the pipeline into 2021, whether you, Andy or Corey would want to comment, but is there any kind of change in procurement activity or just dialogue with your customers that gives you particular confidence around repeating some of this recent momentum?\nAndrew Power: I\u2019ll toss that to Corey.\nCorey Dyer: Hey, Jonathan, this is Corey. I appreciate it. Just broadly on the sales funnel, I'll just tell you that we're happy with the momentum and the success we had in 2020. We see that continuing. I think Andy mentioned to you the regional variances that we've had, meaning first time that EMEA is our largest region for sales and for bookings there. So that was really good and positive. So we feel good about it. And then regarding the industries, I think you might ask about those that are work that are taking advantage of the current work from home are doing more and more quickly with us. And so we're happy about that and how we're supporting them. And then also we're seeing strength from those industries that were strong prior to the pandemic, cloud, digital media, et cetera. And then those that are being kind of suffering a little bit from it, we're seeing them maintain their IT services and they still got to continue to have our support to go after their mission-critical needs. So we're happy about it. And as we mentioned earlier, year-on-year record growth from new logos, standalone, really good success from digital and Interxion as we combine the two groups. So real happy with the funnel. Hand it back to you \u2013 over to Greg, sorry. Go ahead, Greg.\nGreg Wright: Why don't I take it? Okay. Thanks, Corey. Hey Jon. Hope you're well. Let me \u2013 I guess in the order, let's go to M&A first, then we can talk about the divestures, which are somewhat related. Like I think with respect to M&A, as we've said before, like we remain focused on integrating Interxion, while doing a few tuck-in acquisitions as we would call them like Altus IT in Croatia and Lamda Hellix in Greece. Look, we think the M&A is likely to be more episodic than annual. I think we've already said that. And look, as we look at the M&A environment right now, we would say it's probably gotten more competitive over the past year as additional capital is coming to the space. But we also think this could serve to benefit us as we seek to dispose of assets in our capital recycling program. I think, look, with respect to our divestitures or capital recycling, our criteria for asset sales remains consistent with our prior commentary. We're seeking to sell non-core assets and select non-core markets. Today, we follow these criteria and dispose of various PBB assets and other quality standalone assets. That really just are not part of our Connected Campus strategy. We're about $1.5 billion through the multi-year guidance we gave, which was to sell a few billion of assets over a few years. The good news for us is we don't need to sell these assets. So we have the ability to be strategic and only offer these assets when it\u2019s likely that we are going to receive a fair market value for the assets. And we do expect that these assets sales that will recycle their capital will provide some of the capital needed for our development program this year and going forward. Again, that's really the state of play. Again, tuck-in acquisitions are going to be more focused deals that are strategic, as both Croatia and Greece where there are highly connected assets in the regions. The assets, combined with the management teams, provide a strong launching pad for further activity in the region. And that's really the way we look at it and we'll continue to try to find similar deals like these two to the extent we can.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Funk of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Funk: Yes. Thank you all for the questions. A few, if I could. First, I noticed the GAAP base rent per square foot step down across the regions quarter-over-quarter. Can you comment on that?\nAndrew Power: Hey, Michael. So I think there's a few - two items to note in there in particular. And I think you're mostly talking about the greater than megawatt because I thought we had pretty strong pricing power on a less than a megawatt category, more enterprise network workloads landing in those sites. On the greater than a megawatt piece, it's a little bit of apples and oranges in comparing each market quarter-over-quarter. You\u2019re probably better off going back to the second quarter in terms of more of an apples-to-apples comparison volume. And then in the fourth quarter, we had a particular deal structure that make that skew that stat lower in terms of reported results. You may recall a year or two ago in the Ashburn market, we did a almost build-to-suite type project, where we built a rather large 36 megawatts Shell for a customer that was paying us for that Shell on a long-term lease. And then we dropped down and built out suites in six megawatt or still increments over time. So as those \u2013 as the takedowns of those suites happen, you're only getting a fraction of the entire economic cost for that customer flowing through our leasing stats because we already recognized the signing and already realizing the return on the Shell. And that phenomenon happened actually in North America and also in Asia Pacific, this particular market. Strategically, I mean, it's great tool in our toolkit that I would say not all competitors can really have, really given a customer the runway that they desire and the timing flexibility and digital with it scale and breadth of portfolio and as well as our land banks are able to kind of structure those types of transactions that I think is a strategic advantage for those types of customers.\nMichael Funk: And then Andy, on the FFO growth bridge you provided, maybe how it actually quantify the impact from the potential sales, the $600 million to $1 billion. Can you quantify that for us?\nAndrew Power: Yes. So we reiterated really the same quantity of capital cycle for this year as last year. We feel good near-term on the lower end of that range. It's a contributor to the, call it, 4Q to 1Q, bridging the quarterly rhythm of core FFO. Just kind of rough math. If we kind of just hit the low end of that range, $600 million, use the same type of cap rate we are using for the last outright sale. We did call it a mid to low-six cap. You call it about $40 million of NOI and our share count could be as high as 2%. Now that's assuming you sold the entirety of those assets the first day of the year, and you didn't have any redeployment of proceeds. So when you kind of use the appropriate calendarization based on our expectations and also redeploy those proceeds, either paying down debt near-term or in lieu of really equity, I would call it a ballpark in 50 to 100-ish type basis point headwind to our year-over-year growth that is.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Niknam: Hey guys. Thank you. [Technical Difficulties] but has not happened yet. I just want to clarify. And then secondly, more related to hyperscale in the U.S., if someone could just give an update on the pricing competitive backdrop you're seeing within hyperscale and whether deals are getting any more or less competitive than they've been in the past? Thanks.\nAndrew Power: Sure. So two elements. First on your base. We definitely had some outperformance in the fourth quarter that we highlighted in the prepared remarks. Some of that was, call it, operational-related just commencing revenue faster, but some of it was out of our control and FX was a tailwind. As you saw the U.S. dollar kind of plummet and then retrench into 2021. So that makes a little bit of an apples to oranges comparison between 4Q and the run rate for 2021. The answer to your question on the dispositions, other than a small one-off asset for, I think, $6 million, we have not executed on any of the next leg of capital recycling yet that we framed as a \u2013 at a low range of $600 million to high range of $1 billion, and we expect the low end of that range to be executed upon in the pretty near-term future here. Hence, when you sell that quantity of assets even at a 6, 6.5 cap rate, you have immediate loss of that income. Just to remind you Matt and then the broader audience, the dilution or near-term, we think, a) is offset by longer-term accretion. We're selling non-core slower growing parts of our portfolio and using that capital often in lieu of equity to fund our growth. And two, that dilution is baked within the approximate 4% year-over-year growth. So we're arriving at that year-over-year growth comparison off outperformance at the last and back half of this year and absorbing that dilution. So it's not incremental to the guidance that we've already laid out.\nMatthew Niknam: Got it. And on the hyperscale?\nAndrew Power: Thank you for reminding me the first question. Matt, your question was about hyperscale pricing and the like.\nMatthew Niknam: Yes. Pricing and competitive nature because we've heard maybe some anecdote thing, it was maybe on the margin. Things were beginning to get a little bit better. But I'm just curious to get your take in terms of what you've seen.\nAndrew Power: Yes. I think the \u2013 a couple of data points that I would say point to our continued confidence in the opportunity set and really differentiated offering that I think allows us to outshine our competitors, especially any fledging, we're newer competitors. One, you've seen now a string of quarters in a row where we have a global platform offering for the hyperscalers and to address their pain points, future-proof their growth and deliver operational excellence across now, 49 metros, six continents, 24 countries. So the trend has been our friend in terms of success there. I think if you look to our development pipeline that stepped up about 13% quarter-over-quarter, now 220 megawatts or so under development, still about 55-ish percent pre-leased. You've got to imagine there's a lot of hyperscale business in that. I think the returns have been pretty steady in that category, if not stepped up in certain regions. I'm not saying or blushing off that there is \u2013 some of this business is competitive. I think our most competitive market is certainly the U.S. In that market, I think our value proposition has allowed us to \u2013 even in a challenged market like Ashburn do particularly well with all of our customers, but hyperscalers in particular. And I think if you then look where the pipeline is going and where the growth for our business is going, we're seeing more and more opportunities to generate higher returns from both our colocation and interconnection offering, but also serving those hyperscalers in places where we have a really differentiated value proposition. Certainly tighter markets like Santa Clara in the U.S., but international markets like Frankfort, Marseille, Brazil and Singapore as well. So listen, not saying that hyperscale became an easy business overnight, but feel very good about what we're delivering to those customers.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you. Good afternoon. Andy could you just elaborate on the downtime on vacancy a little bit that sort of baked into the sequential nickel decline you're pointing to on Page 13. I'm not sure if that factored into the 1.3% churn you saw in the fourth quarter, or if that's sort of hitting elsewhere?\nAndrew Power: Yes. I would say that the fourth quarter actually \u2013 and then I'll get to the first part of your question, Jordan. The fourth quarter actually was pretty pleased with the customer retention and pricing dynamic in both categories in terms of pricing, in both categories in terms of retention and potentially called in the 80s and positive mark-to-markets for both above and less than a megawatt. The impact that we see hitting 2021, but certainly the first quarter of 2021 really goes back to what I mentioned in our call a quarter ago. We ended the year with our largest amount of non-retained capacity in any given market, just under 17 megawatts coming back to us. It literally came back to us the first of the year. The customer had both physical and economic occupancy of the suite until the year changed. It's across multiple suites, across numerous campuses in Ashburn. We're going to \u2013 we're refurbing that capacity and getting it back out to the market. Of that 17 megawatts, I can tell you, we've already released to a new customer. They haven't commenced yet, but they've signed for it, 2.3 megawatts, we're likely to take another 2.3 megawatts suite and convert that to productized colocation given the success of our offering in the market. And then we've got a pretty strong pipeline for those other opportunities of vacancy. And it is a bit serendipitous in our favor that we've had such success in Ashburn. Despite the broader market challenges is that we're being able to focus all our efforts in re-leasing that capacity because our newest building doesn't come online until roughly the July 1. So really it's that downtime until we get the new customers and new shapes and forms, certainly taking a temporal hit to 2021 in the first quarter.\nJordan Sadler: And what's the biggest chunk of the 17-meg. You mentioned 2.3 is already been re-leased. They're not contiguous, but biggest contiguous chunk. And then just back to the $0.05. Is that \u2013 the bulk of that coming from this departure? And how will this hit 1Q, maybe you talk about 1Q and 2021 churn guidance overall?\nAndrew Power: So let me try to unpack a few there. So the biggest hall is the 2.3 megawatts, but there's numerous contiguous halls. So if we wanted to \u2013 if a customer wanted to have numerous contiguous halls, which certain customers value that. I think we can string six or so of those together. I'm sorry that can't be right. I'm looking at the wrong schedule here. We're going to \u2013 we can string, I think, three of those together of contiguous data halls, but each POD is roughly a 2.3 POD. That is the largest driver to the $0.05, in terms of quarter-over-quarter step down. And then Jordan could you just remind me the second part or the third part of your question there.\nJordan Sadler: Just churn. So what do you think if churn was 1.3 in 4Q, what would it be in 1Q and then just maybe full-year expectation while we're at it?\nAndrew Power: So that's a greater than a megawatt capacity churn, or less than a megawatt capacity churn looks like it's going to be basically in line. And I don't have the implied first quarter churn. I think the 80s steps down on a full-year basis to call it like 69% for the full portfolio in the greater than a megawatt territory. But you can use 17 megawatts as a proxy, and you can see our quantities of expirations. I don't have all the ingredients to give you the exact math on the first quarter measurement right here.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Petersen: Great, thanks. Just a couple from me. So the recurring CapEx and the fourth quarter looks a little elevated. I wonder if there's just anything that we should be thinking about there and how it will trend in the next year on a quarterly basis.\nAndrew Power: Yes. Not just for recurring CapEx, but I would say some of the OpEx as well. You're seeing some of the COVID fluctuations. If you look at the \u2013 I think it's scheduled $28 million recurring CapEx step down to \u2013 as low as $34 million in the first quarter of 2020, $38 million in the second quarter of 2020, then $53 million and $83 million. So we did have a little bit of a catch-up period in terms of call it timing. As you can see, Jon, our guidance for the current CapEx for all of 2020 is roughly the same numbers as prior year. So $220 million, I believe, or $230-ish million. So we have a little bit of fourth quarter catch-up in there. Just the only major items we had \u2013 we had some refresh capital and some second generation space and I think we\u2019re converting to colocation, when a [PEB or TKM] customer had exited. So that kind of hits \u2013 that's not first-generation so it hits through the recurring CapEx. I think that's a product of, call it, maturation of our portfolio and customer to new types of customers in different shapes and forms. But I wouldn't \u2013 you can't just analyze that as next year. You've got look to our guidance table for more appropriate view for the full-year 2021.\nJonathan Petersen: Okay. All right. And then I kind of ask about market rents. I mean, do you guys have a sense maybe if we just think about your greater than one megawatt tenant. Do you have a sense of where the mark-to-market is on in place rents versus market rents? And then, I know you talked about your leasing spreads being relatively flat this year. But I mean, based off the market dynamics that you're seeing, what are your expectations for rent growth over this year and over the next few years? Are we to a point where we can start to see rents start to grow again?\nAndrew Power: I think, there's a couple relevant data points to look at that. Obviously the activity we are seeing coming through our renewal activity both in the fourth quarter as a trajectory throughout the year. And we had consistent progress to the point where we had positive plus one megawatt cash renewal spreads in 4Q. Some of the stronger markets were renewed and shining through there. Santa Clara was a standout in that renewal. We have not \u2013 our guidance includes a slightly negative outlook for the cash mark-to-markets, but, I know we used the language there instead of exact numbers. I think our language is less conservative than it was last year. So I think we're moving into better territory. If you look at just the lease expiration schedule in 2021, I think we're getting into a better place both in volume mix and mark-to-market relative to leasing history. You called out particularly the greater the megawatt category, which is called 7.5-ish percent of our expirations down from a high, call it over 10% at one point. It's pretty diverse with no market other than Ashburn being even greater than 1%. And the mix and geographically, you're seeing a sizeable part component from not only Santa Clara, our titers U.S. market, but also our international markets in the coming contracts. And then last but not least just looking at the new signings because more of a forward indicator of what to come, by and large in the greater than megawatt category I saw \u2013 we saw pretty good firmness in the pricing. And I would \u2013 as I say strengths in Americas were, call it New York, Chicago, excuse me, I\u2019m looking at the wrong schedule. In the greater than a megawatt, you had pretty much stability in both Northern Virginia and Portland. Again, it goes back to that structure I mentioned previously where the customers taking down shells at pre-committed rates at their discretion. So really not room for negotiation there and a desire for them to grow with adjacency. And then EMEA, we saw strength in the greater than megawatt plus category for Zurich, and Marseille were particular standout markets. And then last but not least, Singapore, that market has been a star. And I think you're going to see that continue into 2021. And that is certainly a market where we're doing a sizeable amount of megawatt plus activity as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks, and good afternoon. Curious, probably two things if I could. The first is if we turn to Page 25 of the supplemental, you provide the development yield by region that you're expecting. And just curious for your take on the movement over the last few quarters where it seems like North America has moved up a little bit. EMEA is down a little bit. Asia-Pac near the level on this page. And where do you see that going over the next couple of years based on the activity and the demand in the pipeline? And just separately, curious to go back to one of the comments, I think Bill made it at the beginning of the call, describing that some of the larger customers are choosing a select number of global data center partners. And curious just on that theme, are you seeing a greater percentage of your large customers embraced multiple providers? Or are you seeing more of a winner-take-all evolution where one data center provider could take the disproportionate share of business from some of these customers? Thanks.\nAndrew Power: I\u2019m going to give Bill the honors to answer the second part of the question first, and then I'll come back and do the numbers questions on development cycle on Page 26.\nWilliam Stein: Yes. Thanks for the question. We're definitely seeing a shrinking of the number of participants in the business. I think that clearly plays to our strengths, but I think that COVID in particular has demonstrated the importance of having a very credible counterparty on the other end of these partnerships and we\u2019ve received excellent feedback from our partners, particularly among the hyperscalers about our procedures around not just COVID, but some of the other social unrest that has occurred in the last several quarters.\nAndrew Power: And then Michael on your second question, I mean, I think there's a few observations and some of this is repetitive. The development pipeline, one, you're missing it from here because it's a unconsolidated self-managed joint venture is not on the schedule. But we've seen tremendous activity in Latin America, including a continued growth in Brazil. Not only our first, but second customer in San Diego, Chile and probably expect us to experience the same in terms of our second customers landing into New Mexico City. On this schedule, the volume has stepped up about 13% to 221.5 megawatts. The pre-leasing has remained roughly intact at 55%. If you go market-by-market, I think you're accurate in seeing this trend of a larger and larger share of our new capacity capital going outside the United States. The Americas region is a little muted because we delivered capacity. That was 100% pre-leased in Ashburn and the shell which will show up with megawatts on the schedule. I think in a quarter or so, just hasn't popped in here, but I still think the thesis is constant. And you're seeing also a year-over-year improvement on the yields in the Americas. And I think another relevant data point is the non-U.S. markets are also becoming more diverse. In EMEA, as I rattle off at the very beginning of the call, rather ineloquently was across six different EMEA markets with north of a megawatt signings. You can see on the schedule from Amsterdam to Zurich, numerous markets with capacity coming online. And I think the same phenomenon is going to happen. Ours continue to happen in the APAC region as well.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nSami Badri: Hi, thank you. The first question is on interconnection. You reported the interconnection and the backlog. But can you just give us some color in terms of how that backlog is mapping the respective region? That's the first one. And then the second one is, may Bill, Andy, anyone can really address this. Has digital adopted maybe a different philosophy on speculative construction versus only building with pre-leases in hand? Has kind of the playbook changed a little bit just given the very rapid and high volume leasing that tends to come pretty big cycles that we've seen as the strategy kind of changed a little bit? And I'll leave it at that.\nAndrew Power: Bill, do you want to \u2013 again, we'll try to do the same format. You take the second question first on strategy and then I can go back to the interconnection details.\nWilliam Stein: Sure. So I would say that the strategy today is we don't really go into any of these new markets without a pre-lease in hand, without an anchor. So that's what we've done in Chile. That's what we've done in Mexico. Now we did buy existing businesses, obviously in Croatia and Greece, so that's different. But in general, I think we're looking for one of our good customers that it may \u2013 and probably more than one to tell, so they really want us to, to go into that market, and then [indiscernible] an anchor lease with us. As far as existing markets are concerned, those are used. Those are almost always expansions with existing customers. And that business to be quite Candace is a fast and furious. In some instances I would say the challenge is just keeping up with the demand in existing markets with particularly the hyperscalers.\nAndrew Power: And then Sami on your question on interconnection. So quite pleased with the interconnection signing contribution. Yes, it's stepped down quarter-over-quarter, but it was up 4% from the prior quarter and 3Q was quite outsized winter in terms of interconnection signings. The cast of characters are similar in terms of the type of verticals industry-wise that we experienced in the past. Regionally some of the start, I would say the EMEA region, it was definitely a standout in this category not just in the fourth quarter, but on the full-year basis. I believe their interconnection revenue was called up into the double-digits type growth trajectory. I also \u2013 I know you quite asked this question, I also really look at these things part and parcel with the less than a megawatt signings because they also often go hand-in-hand in terms of our most interconnection rich type customers, day one and certainly post-landing with digital. I would say we put up the third quarter or fourth quarter in a row of consecutive growth in that category of a really strong 3Q. We put a record [indiscernible] the interconnection and less than a megawatt or colocation type signings category. Those are also led by EMEA, but APAC played a great role. We've launched now our colocation offering in Osaka and Singapore and Hong Kong and our first carrier-neutral offering in Seoul, South Korea are right around the corner. So great early days in that category as well regionally. So we're definitely expanding the breadth of the product offering across more and more markets and pleased with the success we're seeing in both the interconnection and the, call it, enterprise and network-oriented less than a megawatt category.\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Bill and Andy. And actually just one quick follow-up and this is pertaining mainly to Europe. And since you guys have now kind of integrated Interxion and you've looked at some of the pricing in each of the respective market. Do you expect the cadence or at least the stabilization of pricing or I mean, maybe that's the wrong way to phrase it? The right way to phrase it is marking it up slightly, right, to reflect pricing that looks more comparable to U.S. market. You guys see \u2013 the rate at which you guys are increasing, is that starting to moderate or is pricing relatively flat and consistent and not really changing or evolving much in Europe? I just want to understand kind of like what's going on from a local type of pricing perspective. And I think I'm mainly referring to the zero to one megawatt type leases specifically.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Sami. That was a very elegant way of asking, if you're going to increase cross-sell prices in Europe, I think. But I'm going to pass this over to Chris in a second. But I think we're very focused on delivering as much value to our customers in terms of increased performance, increased security, increased efficiency, and do that in a global platform offering here in PlatformDIGITAL. So it's not a episodic one market, has to match another market. We're very attuned to the customer needs and also supply demand nature in each market. But maybe Chris, do you want to talk to \u2013 touch a little bit about our product roadmap and how pricing relates to that?\nChristopher Sharp: Absolutely. I appreciate it, Sami. Definitely we look at driving value to our customers through our global interconnected platform, which Bill stated in his prepared remarks, but double our Cross Connect count in 2020 is pretty impressive. And particularly to EMEA, we\u2019re constantly watching exactly how our communities of interest have really grown there with network dense highly connected assets as a part of PlatformDIGITAL, but we absolutely align our Cross Connect pricing based on the market dynamics within EMEA. And we'll continually evolve our platform to ensure that pricing is aligned with the value that we see these communities of interest continually getting out of the platform. But one of the things that we're very happy about is we continually see the attach rate within each of these markets continually increasing and it's core to our platform going forward, that we removed complexity from the customers so they can get access to that value in a more simplistic fashion. So you'll see that play out over the coming year and exactly how we achieved that. But it's something that we're constantly watching and making sure that the customers are getting the true value that they need in a very simplistic fashion.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein for his closing remarks. Bill, please go ahead.\nWilliam Stein: Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the fourth quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we've further strengthened our connections with our customers, meeting more of their needs beyond the U.S. and reaching a much broader set of enterprise customers with our enhanced colocation and interconnection product offerings. We delivered extremely solid current period financial results, delivering full-year FFO per share that was nearly 4% above our initial guidance. We extended our global platform, providing customers with a gateway into Southeastern Europe and runway for growth around the world with strategic land purchases and new development starts. And last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, extending our average duration while further ratcheting down our average cost of debt by locking in attractive pricing on long-term capital and retiring high-coupon debt and preferred equity. I'd like to conclude today's call by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family, but particularly our frontline team members in critical data center facility rules who have kept the digital world turning in the midst of this global pandemic. I hope all of you stay safe and healthy, and we hope to see many of you in person again later this year. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded.

We see that continuing. I think Andy mentioned to you the regional variances that we've had, meaning first time that EMEA is our largest region for sales and for bookings there. So that was really good and positive. So we feel good about it. And then regarding the industries, I think you might ask about those that are work that are taking advantage of the current work from home are doing more and more quickly with us. And so we're happy about that and how we're supporting them. And then also we're seeing strength from those industries that were strong prior to the pandemic, cloud, digital media, et cetera. And then those that are being kind of suffering a little bit from it, we're seeing them maintain their IT services and they still got to continue to have our support to go after their mission-critical needs. So we're happy about it. And as we mentioned earlier, year-on-year record growth from new logos, standalone, really good success from digital and Interxion as we combine the two groups. So real happy with the funnel. Hand it back to you \u2013 over to Greg, sorry. Go ahead, Greg."

            "name": "William Stein",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. The fourth quarter capped off a transformational year for Digital Realty. We acquired several highly connected assets, including the Westin Building in North America and Interxion in EMEA, along with the leading colocation and interconnection providers in Southeastern Europe, significantly expanding our platform in EMEA, while trimming non-core assets in North America. We delivered record bookings for the full-year, an extraordinary performance under any set of circumstances, but particularly amid the headwinds of a global pandemic. Our business is increasingly global. In 2020, we nearly doubled the number of countries where Digital Realty has a presence and EMEA accounted for more than half our fourth quarter bookings. The first time ever a majority of our bookings has been outside the Americas. We more than doubled our Cross Connect count in 2020, reflecting the growing concentration of network-dense highly connected assets on PlatformDIGITAL. We landed a record number of new logos in 2020, more than twice as many as our previous record, in fact, driving consistent growth in our enterprise colocation and interconnection business. The vibrant communities on our campus environments are attracting a growing set of new customers, diversifying and solidifying our revenue streams. Service providers and enterprises alike are strengthening their partnership with a select number of trusted global data center partners to help meet their growing needs around the world, and Digital Realty is uniquely well-positioned to serve as their partner of choice. Let's turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on Page 3. In October, we formally committed to reducing direct and indirect emissions by 68% and indirect emissions in our value chain by area by 24% by 2030 in line with a 1.5 degree climate change scenario. We set our target with science-based targets initiative, along with over 1,000 organizations that have committed to reduce emissions. And we also signed the UN Global Compact business ambition for 1.5 degree C, joining leading companies who have committed to ambitious carbon reduction targets. In early December, we announced that our operations in France were on target to achieve a carbon-neutral footprint by the end of the year, and are expected to remain carbon-neutral through 2030 for both existing facilities and future expansion based on Scope 1 and 2 emissions. In mid-December, we were honored to receive NAREIT's Leader in the Light Award for data center sustainability for the fourth consecutive year. In early January, we issued our fifth green bond, extending our lead as the largest U.S. REIT issuer bonds committed to sustainable investments. Our green bond framework is aligned with leading global best practices, including GRESB's green bond principles, as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals. And Sustainalytics has provided an independent second-party opinion, including that our green bond program is considered robust, credible and transparent. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and the broader society. In terms of our social efforts, we recently selected diversity, equity and inclusion as one of four company-wide philanthropic areas of focus in addition to sustainability, disaster relief and STEM education. As you may be aware, NAREIT recently instituted a dividends through diversity and inclusion program, which I am honored to be co-chairing, along with Tom Baltimore of Park Hotels and Debbie Cafaro of Ventas. Dividends through diversity will promote the recruitment, inclusion and advancement of women, minorities and other under-represented groups and REITs in the broader commercial real estate industry. We have also joined leaders across 85 industries in signing the CEO Pledge on CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, an initiative that aims to rally the business community, to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace and to cultivate a trusting environment where employees feel empowered to have discussions on these topics.  Participating in these programs and others like them is critical to our industries future because it is the right thing to do and because we serve a broad, diverse community. And we believe that to help our customers prepare for the future, we need industry professionals whose insights and perspectives reflect the communities we serve. We are doing our best to play a constructive, proactive role in advancing our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities we serve around the world. Let's turn now to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to expand our global platform with the acquisition of the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Southeastern Europe, groundbreakings and existing markets across EMEA and strategic land purchase on the continent and in Asia Pacific. In early November, we acquired Lamda Hellix, the largest carrier-neutral colocation and interconnection provider in Greece, led by an accomplished management team who will continue to manage the business. As leading service providers continue to expand their footprint, we expect Greece and other parts of Southeastern Europe will be major beneficiaries. We are well positioned to capture the key cloud and connectivity deployments that will accelerate the regions digital transformation. In Denmark, we began construction on our third data center adjacent to the two existing facilities on our Copenhagen campus and offering direct access to leading global cloud providers, numerous networks, Internet exchanges and a transatlantic subsea cable system. We also broke ground on a new data center in Zu\u0308rich, where we have seen robust demand from leading global service providers. The expansion of our Zu\u0308rich campus will provide runway for customer growth at the leading cloud and interconnection hub in Switzerland. We also acquired a land parcel within one kilometer of our highly interconnected campuses in Vienna and halfway around the globe in Sydney, we are under contract to acquire two parcels that will support the development of up to 250 megawatts. These strategic land holdings will provide additional capacity, enabling local and global service providers to seamlessly expand adjacent to their existing deployments. Let's turn to Page 5 for an update on the Interxion integration. The successful integration of Interxion was our top priority for 2020, and we made excellent progress despite the pandemic. We build a solid foundation for the assimilation of our businesses and we are well on our way to achieving the objectives and synergies we outlined when we first announced the transaction. I am proud of what we've accomplished today and excited about our prospects as we move into the implementation phase in 2021. When we announced the transaction, we stated that the combined company would have enhanced capabilities to address and so the public and hybrid cloud architecture requirements of our global customer base that would allow us to build upon each company's current relationships with leading global customers, while also enabling us to effectively compete in the broader target markets. The early results are very promising. We've enjoyed excellent success with global platform providers and early cross-selling wins have surpassed expectations with numerous referrals between the sales teams. The significant embedded growth potential was another key element of the Interxion and investment thesis. We believe the combined organization has already created significant long-term value by executing on the existing development pipeline, acquiring the freehold to the land under key positions in Frankfurt and Paris and securing land in key markets to support future growth. Let's turn to demand drivers on Page 6. We continue to be fortunate to be operating in a business leverages secular demand drivers. As the leading global data center provider, we have a unique vantage point that enables us to detect secular trends as they emerge. We recently introduced the Data Gravity Index, which measures, quantifies and forecast the growing intensity of the enterprise data-creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. This groundbreaking index is a by-product of our market intelligence analysis as well as our obsessive focus on understanding customers' deployments and supporting their evolving infrastructure needs. Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of Data Gravity. According to the market intelligence firm IDC, 80% of the world's data will reside within enterprises by the year 2025. A 451 Research global IT leader survey recently found that 87% of IT leaders will need to maintain local copies of critical data and global points of presence to meet regulatory requirements.  We continue to see these indicators as enterprises expand their private data infrastructure deployments and integrate data exchange with adjacent business and service provider partners across our global platform.  Digital Realty recently received Frost & Sullivan's APAC Data Center Strategy Innovator award, recognizing PlatformDIGITAL for providing an innovative global platform enabling enterprises to scale digital transformation in a consistent modular fashion and addressing the unique infrastructure requirements for integrating private data flows across multiple public platforms. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market-leading innovation to meeting the needs of our global data center customer base. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Yes. Thanks for the question. We're definitely seeing a shrinking of the number of participants in the business. I think that clearly plays to our strengths, but I think that COVID in particular has demonstrated the importance of having a very credible counterparty on the other end of these partnerships and we've received excellent feedback from our partners, particularly among the hyperscalers about our procedures around not just COVID, but some of the other social unrest that has occurred in the last several quarters. Sure. So I would say that the strategy today is we don't really go into any of these new markets without a pre-lease in hand, without an anchor. So that's what we've done in Chile. That's what we've done in Mexico. Now we did buy existing businesses, obviously in Croatia and Greece, so that's different. But in general, I think we're looking for one of our good customers that it may \u2013 and probably more than one to tell, so they really want us to, to go into that market, and then [indiscernible] an anchor lease with us. As far as existing markets are concerned, those are used. Those are almost always expansions with existing customers. And that business to be quite Candace is a fast and furious. In some instances I would say the challenge is just keeping up with the demand in existing markets with particularly the hyperscalers. Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the fourth quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation.

Let me \u2013 I guess in the order, let's go to M&A first, then we can talk about the divestures, which are somewhat related. Like I think with respect to M&A, as we've said before, like we remain focused on integrating Interxion, while doing a few tuck-in acquisitions as we would call them like Altus IT in Croatia and Lamda Hellix in Greece. Look, we think the M&A is likely to be more episodic than annual. I think we've already said that. And look, as we look at the M&A environment right now, we would say it's probably gotten more competitive over the past year as additional capital is coming to the space. But we also think this could serve to benefit us as we seek to dispose of assets in our capital recycling program. I think, look, with respect to our divestitures or capital recycling, our criteria for asset sales remains consistent with our prior commentary. We're seeking to sell non-core assets and select non-core markets. Today, we follow these criteria and dispose of various PBB assets and other quality standalone assets. That really just are not part of our Connected Campus strategy. We're about $1.5 billion through the multi-year guidance we gave, which was to sell a few billion of assets over a few years. The good news for us is we don't need to sell these assets. So we have the ability to be strategic and only offer these assets when it's likely that we are going to receive a fair market value for the assets. And we do expect that these assets sales that will recycle their capital will provide some of the capital needed for our development program this year and going forward. Again, that's really the state of play. Again, tuck-in acquisitions are going to be more focused deals that are strategic, as both Croatia and Greece where there are highly connected assets in the regions. The assets, combined with the management teams, provide a strong launching pad for further activity in the region. And that's really the way we look at it and we'll continue to try to find similar deals like these two to the extent we can."

            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 8. We signed total bookings of $130 million in the fourth quarter, including a $12 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise-oriented deals of one megawatt or less totaled $31 million, building upon the consistent momentum throughout the year and demonstrating the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand. The weighted average lease term was over eight years. We secured 120 new logos during the quarter with more than half of those new logos landing in EMEA, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. EMEA accounted for more than half of our fourth quarter bookings while Asia Pacific contributed over 15%. As Bill mentioned, this was the first time the majority of our bookings were outside the Americas. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a rapidly growing cloud-based cybersecurity provider selected PlatformDIGITAL for multiple environments in London and Boston to facilitate modernization and embrace high performance compute technology while maintaining an exceptional user experience. In New York, the Digital Realty's teams' deep understanding of a global retailers growth strategy enabled us to tailor a solution for their Americas markets on PlatformDIGITAL. We also overcame lockdowns and international travel restrictions to demonstrate to a digital telecom provider as they can leverage PlatformDIGITAL to meet their current and future growth requirements in existing and targeted markets at their required pace. A rapidly growing gaming platform experienced their hedge to rewire their network and optimized data exchange with third-party clouds, the growth of their existing footprint with us in Northern Virginia and a new deployment in Chicago. Likewise in Chicago, a global exchange operator leveraged PlatformDIGITAL to extend their access into our highly interconnected community. In Singapore, two leading global financial services firms expanded with Digital Realty due to our platform offering and long history of operational excellence, while a software developer selected PlatformDIGITAL to expand their proprietary cloud offering into the region. Turning to our backlog on Page 10. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced reached an all-time high of $269 million. The step up from $229 million last quarter, reflect $78 million of commencements during the fourth quarter offset by roughly $118 million of combined space and power leases signed. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at 8.5 months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 11. We signed $156 million of renewals during the fourth quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average term loan renewals signed during the fourth quarter was a little over three years, reflecting a roughly even split in the mix between deals above and below one megawatt. Cash re-leasing spreads on renewals were plus 1% and cash rents were positive on renewals above and below one megawatt, an encouraging sign for pricing. We retained 79% of expiring leases in line with our long-term historical average. In terms of fourth quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy improved 40 basis points, driven primarily by leases commencing on recent deliveries in Ashburn and the sale of a vacant building in Amsterdam. Same capital occupancy was down 40 basis points from the third quarter due to no move-outs, partially offset by positive absorption in Silicon Valley and Chicago. Same capital cash NOI growth has continued to improve since bottoming in 2019 and ticked up slightly to negative 1.6% in the fourth quarter. For the full-year, same capital cash NOI growth was negative 1.9% or a little over 100 basis points better than initially expected. As a reminder, the Westin Building, Interxion, Lamda Hellix and Altus IT are not yet included in the same store pool, but we expect each of these acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 12. The U.S. dollar softened in the second half of the year, providing a bit of an FX tailwind in the fourth quarter, relative to the prior year average. Overall, FX represented roughly a 50 basis point tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In terms of vertical concentration, as you can see from the pie chart on the upper right, we are fortunate to be primarily serving customers whose businesses are thriving in the current environment with limited exposure to the sectors most negatively impacted. Rent collections remained in line with our historical average, and requests for rent relief have largely subsided. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy and matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term, fixed-rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have roughly a 50 basis point impact on our full-year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed, and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, the fourth quarter core FFO per share was down 0.6% year-over-year, but $0.08 ahead of consensus driven primarily by operational outperformance. For the full-year, core FFO per share came in $0.22 or nearly 4% ahead of our initial guidance. As previewed on our third quarter call, we expect to deliver double-digit revenue growth driven by a full-year contribution from Interxion and the record colocation in interconnection and overall bookings in 2020. We expect that EBITDA margin will remain in line with the fourth quarter throughout 2021. As Bill mentioned, we remain on track to achieve the synergies we underwrote on the Interxion transaction. Although the rationale for the deal has always been accelerating revenue growth rather than realizing expense synergies. We've already made great strides on our financing plans for the year with a highly successful 1 billion green euro bond offering in early January at five eights in addition to solid progress on the capital recycling front. As always, we expect to remain nimble for the rest of the year and we may look to capitalize on favorable market conditions to lock in long-term fixed rate financing at attractive coupons across the currencies that support our assets to proactively manage future liabilities. In terms of FFO per share guidance, our forecast is largely unchanged from the preliminary outlook we previewed on the third quarter call, although the year-over-year bar has been raised in the interim given the outperformance in the fourth quarter. At the midpoint, our 2021 guidance represents growth of approximately 4%, which includes near-term dilution from capital recycling. In terms of the quarterly run rate, we expect the split between the first half of the year and the second half of the year to be approximately 49/51. In other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page 13, we expect to dip down by about a nickel in the first quarter, then to ramp up fairly steadily over the rest of the year. In terms of the quarterly dividend, the distribution policy is ultimately a Board level decision. Given the continued growth in our cash flows and taxable income, we would expect to see continued growth in the per share dividend just as we have each and every year since our IPO in 2004. Last, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 14. During the fourth quarter, we continued to execute on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options or minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. Fixed charge coverage reached 5.1x, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was slightly elevated to 6.1x as of year-end, but is expected to come back down in line with our long-term range over the course of the year through the combination of proceeds from asset sales and growth in cash flows as leases commenced from the record leasing activity in 2020. In mid-October, we redeemed \u00a3300 million or 4.75% sterling bonds due in 2023. We also redeemed $250 million of high-coupon series G preferred at [5.78%]. In early January, we raised a 1 billion of 10.5-year green euro bonds at an all time low-coupon for Digital Realty of 0.625%. We also retired $350 million of 2.75% bonds due in 2023. And we paid all $530 million outstanding on the term loan due in 2023. This successful execution against our financial strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides the access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 14, we've extended our weighted average debt maturity out nearly seven years or ratcheting our weighted average coupon down to 2.3%, and little over half our debt is euro denominated reflecting the growth of our global platform post-Interxion and acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 98% of our debt is unsecured providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 14, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities, and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now we would be pleased to take your questions. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session? Hey. Thanks, Jon. I can probably kick it off on the question on the multi-megawatt side, and then I'll probably hand it over to Greg to speak to M&A. So I'm very pleased with the results overall in terms of 4Q. I think the diversity of the platform really shine through in both categories, not only the less than a megawatt in interconnection, but also on the scale or hyperscale plus. If you do a quick kind of run through the regions, EMEA, first time more than 50% of the signings, it was very diverse. There were six different markets across the EMEA that did a north of a megawatt deal each. So it was London, Paris, Marseille and two others that escaped my mind. And then over in the Americas, we had both in Ashburn and also in Hillsborough, and the cast of characters for all these are the combination of the major CSPs, SaaS providers and, call it, B2C hyperscalers as well. And then last but not least, I'm pleased with the results in both Brazil and we signed our second customer in Santiago, Chile, in the hyperscale arena, another top CSP. And then last but not least, had a project with a top three CSP down in Sydney. So really diverse contribution from numerous major metros. And I'll turn it over to Greg to pick up on the M&A piece. I'll toss that to Corey. Hey, Michael. So I think there's a few - two items to note in there in particular. And I think you're mostly talking about the greater than megawatt because I thought we had pretty strong pricing power on a less than a megawatt category, more enterprise network workloads landing in those sites. On the greater than a megawatt piece, it's a little bit of apples and oranges in comparing each market quarter-over-quarter. You're probably better off going back to the second quarter in terms of more of an apples-to-apples comparison volume. And then in the fourth quarter, we had a particular deal structure that make that skew that stat lower in terms of reported results. You may recall a year or two ago in the Ashburn market, we did a almost build-to-suite type project, where we built a rather large 36 megawatts Shell for a customer that was paying us for that Shell on a long-term lease. And then we dropped down and built out suites in six megawatt or still increments over time. So as those \u2013 as the takedowns of those suites happen, you're only getting a fraction of the entire economic cost for that customer flowing through our leasing stats because we already recognized the signing and already realizing the return on the Shell. And that phenomenon happened actually in North America and also in Asia Pacific, this particular market. Strategically, I mean, it's great tool in our toolkit that I would say not all competitors can really have, really given a customer the runway that they desire and the timing flexibility and digital with it scale and breadth of portfolio and as well as our land banks are able to kind of structure those types of transactions that I think is a strategic advantage for those types of customers. Yes. So we reiterated really the same quantity of capital cycle for this year as last year. We feel good near-term on the lower end of that range. It's a contributor to the, call it, 4Q to 1Q, bridging the quarterly rhythm of core FFO. Just kind of rough math. If we kind of just hit the low end of that range, $600 million, use the same type of cap rate we are using for the last outright sale. We did call it a mid to low-six cap. You call it about $40 million of NOI and our share count could be as high as 2%. Now that's assuming you sold the entirety of those assets the first day of the year, and you didn't have any redeployment of proceeds. So when you kind of use the appropriate calendarization based on our expectations and also redeploy those proceeds, either paying down debt near-term or in lieu of really equity, I would call it a ballpark in 50 to 100-ish type basis point headwind to our year-over-year growth that is. Sure. So two elements. First on your base. We definitely had some outperformance in the fourth quarter that we highlighted in the prepared remarks. Some of that was, call it, operational-related just commencing revenue faster, but some of it was out of our control and FX was a tailwind. As you saw the U.S. dollar kind of plummet and then retrench into 2021. So that makes a little bit of an apples to oranges comparison between 4Q and the run rate for 2021. The answer to your question on the dispositions, other than a small one-off asset for, I think, $6 million, we have not executed on any of the next leg of capital recycling yet that we framed as a \u2013 at a low range of $600 million to high range of $1 billion, and we expect the low end of that range to be executed upon in the pretty near-term future here. Hence, when you sell that quantity of assets even at a 6, 6.5 cap rate, you have immediate loss of that income. Just to remind you Matt and then the broader audience, the dilution or near-term, we think, a) is offset by longer-term accretion. We're selling non-core slower growing parts of our portfolio and using that capital often in lieu of equity to fund our growth. And two, that dilution is baked within the approximate 4% year-over-year growth. So we're arriving at that year-over-year growth comparison off outperformance at the last and back half of this year and absorbing that dilution. So it's not incremental to the guidance that we've already laid out. Thank you for reminding me the first question. Matt, your question was about hyperscale pricing and the like. Yes. I think the \u2013 a couple of data points that I would say point to our continued confidence in the opportunity set and really differentiated offering that I think allows us to outshine our competitors, especially any fledging, we're newer competitors. One, you've seen now a string of quarters in a row where we have a global platform offering for the hyperscalers and to address their pain points, future-proof their growth and deliver operational excellence across now, 49 metros, six continents, 24 countries. So the trend has been our friend in terms of success there. I think if you look to our development pipeline that stepped up about 13% quarter-over-quarter, now 220 megawatts or so under development, still about 55-ish percent pre-leased. You've got to imagine there's a lot of hyperscale business in that. I think the returns have been pretty steady in that category, if not stepped up in certain regions. I'm not saying or blushing off that there is \u2013 some of this business is competitive. I think our most competitive market is certainly the U.S. In that market, I think our value proposition has allowed us to \u2013 even in a challenged market like Ashburn do particularly well with all of our customers, but hyperscalers in particular. And I think if you then look where the pipeline is going and where the growth for our business is going, we're seeing more and more opportunities to generate higher returns from both our colocation and interconnection offering, but also serving those hyperscalers in places where we have a really differentiated value proposition. Certainly tighter markets like Santa Clara in the U.S., but international markets like Frankfort, Marseille, Brazil and Singapore as well. So listen, not saying that hyperscale became an easy business overnight, but feel very good about what we're delivering to those customers. Yes. I would say that the fourth quarter actually \u2013 and then I'll get to the first part of your question, Jordan. The fourth quarter actually was pretty pleased with the customer retention and pricing dynamic in both categories in terms of pricing, in both categories in terms of retention and potentially called in the 80s and positive mark-to-markets for both above and less than a megawatt. The impact that we see hitting 2021, but certainly the first quarter of 2021 really goes back to what I mentioned in our call a quarter ago. We ended the year with our largest amount of non-retained capacity in any given market, just under 17 megawatts coming back to us. It literally came back to us the first of the year. The customer had both physical and economic occupancy of the suite until the year changed. It's across multiple suites, across numerous campuses in Ashburn. We're going to \u2013 we're refurbing that capacity and getting it back out to the market. Of that 17 megawatts, I can tell you, we've already released to a new customer. They haven't commenced yet, but they've signed for it, 2.3 megawatts, we're likely to take another 2.3 megawatts suite and convert that to productized colocation given the success of our offering in the market. And then we've got a pretty strong pipeline for those other opportunities of vacancy. And it is a bit serendipitous in our favor that we've had such success in Ashburn. Despite the broader market challenges is that we're being able to focus all our efforts in re-leasing that capacity because our newest building doesn't come online until roughly the July 1. So really it's that downtime until we get the new customers and new shapes and forms, certainly taking a temporal hit to 2021 in the first quarter. So let me try to unpack a few there. So the biggest hall is the 2.3 megawatts, but there's numerous contiguous halls. So if we wanted to \u2013 if a customer wanted to have numerous contiguous halls, which certain customers value that. I think we can string six or so of those together. I'm sorry that can't be right. I'm looking at the wrong schedule here. We're going to \u2013 we can string, I think, three of those together of contiguous data halls, but each POD is roughly a 2.3 POD. That is the largest driver to the $0.05, in terms of quarter-over-quarter step down. And then Jordan could you just remind me the second part or the third part of your question there. So that's a greater than a megawatt capacity churn, or less than a megawatt capacity churn looks like it's going to be basically in line. And I don't have the implied first quarter churn. I think the 80s steps down on a full-year basis to call it like 69% for the full portfolio in the greater than a megawatt territory. But you can use 17 megawatts as a proxy, and you can see our quantities of expirations. I don't have all the ingredients to give you the exact math on the first quarter measurement right here. Yes. Not just for recurring CapEx, but I would say some of the OpEx as well. You're seeing some of the COVID fluctuations. If you look at the \u2013 I think it's scheduled $28 million recurring CapEx step down to \u2013 as low as $34 million in the first quarter of 2020, $38 million in the second quarter of 2020, then $53 million and $83 million. So we did have a little bit of a catch-up period in terms of call it timing. As you can see, Jon, our guidance for the current CapEx for all of 2020 is roughly the same numbers as prior year. So $220 million, I believe, or $230-ish million. So we have a little bit of fourth quarter catch-up in there. Just the only major items we had \u2013 we had some refresh capital and some second generation space and I think we're converting to colocation, when a [PEB or TKM] customer had exited. So that kind of hits \u2013 that's not first-generation so it hits through the recurring CapEx. I think that's a product of, call it, maturation of our portfolio and customer to new types of customers in different shapes and forms. But I wouldn't \u2013 you can't just analyze that as next year. You've got look to our guidance table for more appropriate view for the full-year 2021. I think, there's a couple relevant data points to look at that. Obviously the activity we are seeing coming through our renewal activity both in the fourth quarter as a trajectory throughout the year. And we had consistent progress to the point where we had positive plus one megawatt cash renewal spreads in 4Q. Some of the stronger markets were renewed and shining through there. Santa Clara was a standout in that renewal. We have not \u2013 our guidance includes a slightly negative outlook for the cash mark-to-markets, but, I know we used the language there instead of exact numbers. I think our language is less conservative than it was last year. So I think we're moving into better territory. If you look at just the lease expiration schedule in 2021, I think we're getting into a better place both in volume mix and mark-to-market relative to leasing history. You called out particularly the greater the megawatt category, which is called 7.5-ish percent of our expirations down from a high, call it over 10% at one point. It's pretty diverse with no market other than Ashburn being even greater than 1%. And the mix and geographically, you're seeing a sizeable part component from not only Santa Clara, our titers U.S. market, but also our international markets in the coming contracts. And then last but not least just looking at the new signings because more of a forward indicator of what to come, by and large in the greater than megawatt category I saw \u2013 we saw pretty good firmness in the pricing. And I would \u2013 as I say strengths in Americas were, call it New York, Chicago, excuse me, I'm looking at the wrong schedule. In the greater than a megawatt, you had pretty much stability in both Northern Virginia and Portland. Again, it goes back to that structure I mentioned previously where the customers taking down shells at pre-committed rates at their discretion. So really not room for negotiation there and a desire for them to grow with adjacency. And then EMEA, we saw strength in the greater than megawatt plus category for Zurich, and Marseille were particular standout markets. And then last but not least, Singapore, that market has been a star. And I think you're going to see that continue into 2021. And that is certainly a market where we're doing a sizeable amount of megawatt plus activity as well. I'm going to give Bill the honors to answer the second part of the question first, and then I'll come back and do the numbers questions on development cycle on Page 26. And then Michael on your second question, I mean, I think there's a few observations and some of this is repetitive. The development pipeline, one, you're missing it from here because it's a unconsolidated self-managed joint venture is not on the schedule. But we've seen tremendous activity in Latin America, including a continued growth in Brazil. Not only our first, but second customer in San Diego, Chile and probably expect us to experience the same in terms of our second customers landing into New Mexico City. On this schedule, the volume has stepped up about 13% to 221.5 megawatts. The pre-leasing has remained roughly intact at 55%. If you go market-by-market, I think you're accurate in seeing this trend of a larger and larger share of our new capacity capital going outside the United States. The Americas region is a little muted because we delivered capacity. That was 100% pre-leased in Ashburn and the shell which will show up with megawatts on the schedule. I think in a quarter or so, just hasn't popped in here, but I still think the thesis is constant. And you're seeing also a year-over-year improvement on the yields in the Americas. And I think another relevant data point is the non-U.S. markets are also becoming more diverse. In EMEA, as I rattle off at the very beginning of the call, rather ineloquently was across six different EMEA markets with north of a megawatt signings. You can see on the schedule from Amsterdam to Zurich, numerous markets with capacity coming online. And I think the same phenomenon is going to happen. Ours continue to happen in the APAC region as well. Bill, do you want to \u2013 again, we'll try to do the same format. You take the second question first on strategy and then I can go back to the interconnection details. And then Sami on your question on interconnection. So quite pleased with the interconnection signing contribution. Yes, it's stepped down quarter-over-quarter, but it was up 4% from the prior quarter and 3Q was quite outsized winter in terms of interconnection signings. The cast of characters are similar in terms of the type of verticals industry-wise that we experienced in the past. Regionally some of the start, I would say the EMEA region, it was definitely a standout in this category not just in the fourth quarter, but on the full-year basis. I believe their interconnection revenue was called up into the double-digits type growth trajectory. I also \u2013 I know you quite asked this question, I also really look at these things part and parcel with the less than a megawatt signings because they also often go hand-in-hand in terms of our most interconnection rich type customers, day one and certainly post-landing with digital. I would say we put up the third quarter or fourth quarter in a row of consecutive growth in that category of a really strong 3Q. We put a record [indiscernible] the interconnection and less than a megawatt or colocation type signings category. Those are also led by EMEA, but APAC played a great role. We've launched now our colocation offering in Osaka and Singapore and Hong Kong and our first carrier-neutral offering in Seoul, South Korea are right around the corner. So great early days in that category as well regionally. So we're definitely expanding the breadth of the product offering across more and more markets and pleased with the success we're seeing in both the interconnection and the, call it, enterprise and network-oriented less than a megawatt category. Thanks, Sami. That was a very elegant way of asking, if you're going to increase cross-sell prices in Europe, I think. But I'm going to pass this over to Chris in a second. But I think we're very focused on delivering as much value to our customers in terms of increased performance, increased security, increased efficiency, and do that in a global platform offering here in PlatformDIGITAL. So it's not a episodic one market, has to match another market. We're very attuned to the customer needs and also supply demand nature in each market. But maybe Chris, do you want to talk to \u2013 touch a little bit about our product roadmap and how pricing relates to that?"

During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and callers will be limited to one question plus a follow-up. Due to time constraints, we will conclude promptly at the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. John, please go ahead.\nJohn Stewart: Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today\u2019s call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and EVP of Sales and Marketing, Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I would like to hit the tops of the waves on our third quarter results. We built upon the recent momentum in our business, landing a record number of new logos across broad and robust bookings that were well diversified by customer type and geographic region. We delivered solid financial results with core FFO per share $0.05 ahead of consensus and we raised our outlook for revenue, EBITDA and core FFO per share for the second time this year. We extended our global platform, entering Croatia with the acquisition of Altus IT and securing customer growth in existing markets across EMEA, with key land purchases and new builds. Last but not least, we further strengthened the balance sheet, raising over $2 billion of long-term capital and retiring nearly $2 billion of high coupon debt and preferred equity. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Stein: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global connected sustainable framework. And despite the pandemic, our third quarter results demonstrate the strength of this framework. Our business is increasingly global, with nearly 60% of third quarter bookings outside North America and we landed a record 130 new logos from around the world. Bookings were also well diversified by customer type, with enterprise co-location and interconnection accounting for nearly half the total. This robust and diverse business mix demonstrates the power of our global platform and further validates our strategic vision of being the only global provider dedicated to the full customer spectrum. Let\u2019s turn to our health and safety measures on Page 3. We remain focused on keeping our employees, customers and partners safe during this pandemic. We remained fully operational across our 284 data centers and we continue to support our customers\u2019 growth by bringing additional capacity online, while expanding our global platform. We have implemented enhanced safety protocols, such as requiring mass, social distancing, engaging specialty cleaning services, and maintaining rotational 24/7 staff coverage by leaning on local personnel. As the pandemic continues, we are seeing signs of permanent adjustments that are likely to be long-term tailwinds for our business. More enterprises are embracing a distributed workforce with our growing work-from-home component, while our recent Gartner survey of nearly 2,000 CIOs around the world found that accelerating digital innovation and leveraging emerging technologies are key priorities during the pandemic. Of course, I would be remiss if I did not again extend our gratitude to our employees in critical data center roles who continue to come into work everyday at our facilities around the world. They make possible the service and support we provide our customers. Thank you to the terrific onsite Digital Realty team. Let\u2019s turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on Page 4. In April, we reached a wind energy agreement to supply approximately 30% of our power needs in the Dallas, Texas area with renewable energy. In late August, we further expanded our renewable energy capacity in Texas by sourcing approximately 65 megawatts of solar power. Once the solar project is fully operational by mid-2021, our entire Dallas portfolio will be powered by 70% renewable energy. We completed our first wind power transaction in 2016. And we have since gone on to contract 240 megawatts of wind and solar energy in Texas. We remain committed to manage our environmental impact, optimizing our use of energy and natural resources, serving a social purpose and delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders. Let\u2019s turn to our investment activity on Page 5. We continued to expand our global platform with a small, but highly strategic acquisition in Southeastern Europe, along with land purchases and groundbreakings in existing markets across the continent. In early September, we announced that we had acquired Altus IT, the leading carrier-neutral data center provider in Croatia, expanding our connectivity footprint into the Balkans and Eastern Europe and establishing a gateway to Southeastern Europe, through access to one of the most interconnected data centers in the region. This transaction was also a prime example of how seamlessly the classic Interxion and classic Digital Realty teams are working together. In Zurich, we are breaking ground on a new data center, two of our five biggest deals during the third quarter landed in Zurich and the expansion of our campus will provide runway for customer growth as the leading cloud and interconnection hub in Switzerland. We also recently acquired land parcels within 1 kilometer of our highly interconnected campuses in Vienna as well as Madrid. These strategic land holdings will provide additional capacity, enabling local and global service providers to seamlessly expand adjacent to their existing deployments. In early July, we announced the opening of the first phase of MRS3, our data center in Marseille. Interxion\u2019s Marseille campus is one of the world\u2019s leading digital hubs for intercontinental data traffic with over 150 network service providers. The new facility will offer customers expanded access to the vibrant community in Marseille, including numerous connectivity providers, digital media and cloud segments, along with local as well as global enterprises. Finally, in mid-July, we announced that we acquired the freehold to the land under Interxion\u2019s 10-hour Landstra\u00dfe campus in Frankfurt. In addition, we are also under contract to acquire the Neckermann site a separate parcel within a kilometer of Interxion\u2019s existing campus that will support the development of up to 180 megawatts of IT capacity. We believe that we are creating significant value by combining the leasehold and freehold positions on one of the most highly connected campuses in Europe, while the adjacent expansion capacity provides runway to support customer growth in a key European metro for years to come. Let\u2019s turn to Page 6 for an update on the Interxion integration. As you have heard me say before, integration is our top priority for 2020 and we continue to make solid progress despite the pandemic. Both teams have risen to the occasion and have come together to continue to serve our customers\u2019 needs throughout this crisis. It is great to see this collaboration. Andy will cover our customer wins in more detail, but both sales engines are working well together and we have begun to realize some of the cross-selling opportunities we envisioned when contemplating this transaction. We remain on track to meet our synergy targets and underwriting budgets. Title retention is also running ahead of plan at over 95% with no loss of key personnel. Along those lines, as we announced when we first broke the news of our combination with Interxion 1 year ago today. Early next year, David Ruberg will be transitioning within Digital Realty from his day-to-day responsibilities as Chief Executive EMEA and will be moving into a global strategic advisor role. In this capacity, David will be responsible for the development and oversight of our corporate strategy, including the company\u2019s effort to organize and execute a program to identify and develop High Value Communities ventures across our global platform. David plans to remain on the Board of Directors of our Dutch holding company and he will continue to play a leadership role on certain of our key global customer accounts, bringing to bear his longstanding relationships and thought leadership in addition to supporting our team on new market and product development, as recently demonstrated in Eastern Europe. Upon David\u2019s transition, legacy Digital MD, EMEA, Jeff Tapley and legacy Interxion MD, [indiscernible], will continue to oversee the company\u2019s EMEA business. I would like to thank David for his tremendous contributions and his successful efforts to integrate our businesses. We look forward to benefiting from his strategic insights for years to come. Let\u2019s turn to demand drivers on Page 7. We are fortunate to be operating in a business leverages secular demand drivers. As a leading global data center provider, we have a unique vantage point that enables us to detect secular trends as they emerge. Our customers are solving some of the most complex infrastructure connectivity and workload use cases across network peering hyperscale, low latency, high-performance computing, big data and artificial intelligence. Over the past several years, we have seen a growing trend of leading multinational enterprises deploying and connecting large private data infrastructure footprints across multiple global sites. We have conducted research, build a global database and devise a method to measure, quantify and forecast the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation lifecycle and its gravitational impact on IT infrastructure. We have recently published our findings as the Data Gravity Index, a report designed to assist both enterprise and service provider customers as they shift their infrastructure strategies to address challenges presented by Data Gravity. Our global data center platform is uniquely positioned to help customers address the Data Gravity challenges. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.\nAndy Power: Thank you, Bill. Let\u2019s pick up here on Page 9. As Bill mentioned in his comments, the Interxion integration is coming along on schedule and we are seeing the power of the combined organization with more than 280 data centers in 48 metros across 23 countries on six continents. The power of the global platform is on full display for our installed base of 4,000 global customers and growing. Let\u2019s turn to our leasing activity on Page 10. We signed total bookings of $89 million, including a $14 million contribution from interconnection, which along with the $29 million of network and enterprise-oriented deals of a megawatt or less accounted for a record contribution of nearly half our total bookings. The weighted average lease term was over 6 years. We landed a record 130 new logos during the third quarter, including 40 sourced by Interxion, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. Activity was well balanced across all three regions, with the Americas and EMEA each contributing about 40% of total bookings, while Asia-Pacific accounted for nearly 20%. Singapore was the star in Asia-Pacific, while Zurich, Frankfurt and Marseille were staying out today in EMEA. In the Americas, we again experienced strength in the New York metro area as well as Chicago and Toronto. In Northern Virginia, where we have leased more than 90 megawatts of the previous 9 months, we signed just over 2 million GAAP during the third quarter. As our active development pipeline remains 100% pre-leased while our in-service portfolio remains the only 94% leased. We do expect to get back to 17 megawatts of state-of-the-art capacity in Ashburn at the end of this year. And together with the existing vacancy within our in-service portfolio, this will give us a total of 40 megawatts of available inventory to meet demand and support customer growth for the next several quarters until we are able to bring additional capacity online around the middle of next year. Although we aren\u2019t entirely out of the competitive woods just yet, we remain very well-positioned to continue to hit above our weight given the strength of our global platform and sales force, the large and growing installed customer base seeking growth with adjacency on our connected Ashburn campuses, and finally, our ability to future proof our customers\u2019 growth with our strategic land holdings, providing the longest runway to support their future growth. In terms of specific lengths during the quarter and around the world, in Marseille, we won a significant connectivity deal with PCCW to land the PC subsea cable at our MRS2 data center. This is a higher strategic deal as it enables our customers to directly access this 12,000 kilometer high capacity cable that will provide the shortest and most direct subsea data route from North Asia to Europe. In Hong Kong, we are excited to support a Fortune 500 multinational professional services firm, with the implementation of a data hub deployment on Platform Digital. In London, the classic Digital Realty and classic Interxion teams work closely together to add Canonical, a leading UK based software and IP service provider and the publisher of Ubuntu, a leading Linux distribution. Boosteroid, a cloud gaming platform expanded their platform across Western Europe in the third quarter with a deal that involved 4 metros, Paris, Marseille, Madrid and London. G-Core, a gaming CDN expanded their use of Platform Digital in four locations across North America and Europe for their growing infrastructure demands and new AI platform. Staying with the gaming theme in the Bay Area, we have the Blade Group a cloud-based gaming company enabled daily intensive gaming. While in Ashburn, Capital Online selected Platform Digital to support their cloud development platform for gaming, e-commerce, education and big data. Finally, in Brussels, we are helping Ahold Delhaize, a leading global grocery retailer migrate from their legacy on-prem facility to Platform Digital for multi-cloud access and flexibility for future expansion. Turning to our backlog on Page 12, the current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $229 million. The step down from the $251 million last quarter will fetch record commencers in nearly $100 million during the third quarter offset by the $75 million of combined space and power leases signed. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at roughly 6.5 months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 13, we signed $160 million of renewals during the third quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the third quarter, was a little less than 2 years, reflecting a mix of activities skewed heavily towards the deployments, smaller than 1 megawatts. Cash rents on renewals were essentially flat, down just 20 basis points across all categories and cash rents on renewals above and below 1 megawatt were both essentially unchanged, an encouraging sign for pricing. We retained 78% of expiring leases, essentially in line with our long-term trend, but dragged down a bit by network customer who churned out of powered Shell capacity at our downtown Los Angeles interconnection hub. Similar to our strategy we have successfully executed with recaptured self space in Chicago, we expect to redevelop this scarce inventory within a highly desirable interconnection hub into significantly higher yielding co-location capacity. In terms of third quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy improved 20 basis points driven by fully leased development projects placed in service, primarily in Chicago and Hillsborough. Same capital occupancy was unchanged for the second quarter and same capital cash NOI growth was in line with expectations at negative 1.9%. As a reminder, Interxion and the Westin Building are not included in the 2020 same-store pool, but we expect both acquisitions will be accretive to organic growth going forward. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 14, the U.S. dollar softened over the summer before steadying at those lower levels, providing a bit of an FX tailwind in the third quarter relative to prior year average. Overall, FX represented roughly 100 basis point tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In terms of vertical concentration, as you can see from the pie chart on the upper right, we are fortunate to be primarily serving customers whose businesses are thriving in the current environment, with limited exposure to sectors most negatively impacted. Rent collections remained in line with our historical average and requests for rent relief have largely subsided. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy and matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have roughly a 50 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was down 8% year-over-year, but $0.05 ahead of consensus, driven by a beat on the top line as well as lower property taxes and a lower share count due to the late September settlement of the $1 billion forward equity offering offset by higher than expected corporate taxes due to the higher statutory rates in the UK. As you may have seen from the press release, we are raising guidance for revenue, EBITDA and core FFO per share again this quarter, reflecting the third quarter outperformance. We now expect to be at or above the high end of our original ranges for all three measures. In terms of the quarterly run-rate, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page 15, we expect to be flat to down $0.01 in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the higher weighted average share count, as the additional shares from the forward equity offering will be outstanding for the entire fourth quarter compared to just 6 days in the third quarter. As you update your earnings models and begin to roll forward to next year, please keep in mind our 2021 results will entail a couple of partial periods complications. For starters, we all of course report a full year contribution from Interxion next year compared to just three quarters this year, which we expect will help drive double-digit revenue growth. On the other hand, the sooner we return to a more normalized operating environment next year, the tougher the comps as current period results are benefiting from the deferral of some overhead and OpEx as well as maintenance CapEx. Finally, the additional shares from settlement of the forward equity offering and mid-year ATM issuance will be outstanding for the full year in 2021 compared to a partial period in 2020. As a result, although we expect to rollout the formal guidance early next year, we are currently targeting mid single-digit growth in both earnings and cash flow per share. Last, but certainly not least, let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet on Page 16. As expected, the third quarter activity on the ATM and settlement of the forward equity offering brought leverage back down in line with our target range. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA stepped down to 5.6x, while fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 4.4x. We also capitalized on favorable conditions in the debt capital markets and executed several proactive liability management trades during the third quarter. In mid-September, we raised $750 million of long 11-year green Euro bonds at 1% and $300 million of 2-year floating rate notes at an initial coupon of 0%, achieving all-time low coupons for Digital Realty. We also retired $1.2 billion of bonds due in 2022 and 2023 and a blended coupon of 4.1% as well as $500 million of preferred equity, and a blended coupon of 6.1%. We had $970 million of cash on the balance sheet at September 30 although one of the preferred redemptions and one of the bottom redemptions straddled quarter end and approximately $650 million of that cash was used to fund those redemptions in mid-October. This successful execution against our financial strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 16, we have extended our weighted average debt maturity out to 6.5 years and ratcheted our weighted average coupon down to 2.5%, a little over 70% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated acting as a natural FX hedge for our investment outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 98% of our debt is unsecured providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 16, we have a clear runway with virtually no near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out-years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we will be pleased to take your questions. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Good afternoon and thanks for the opportunity to ask a question. Just curious if you could talk a little bit more about pro forma revenue growth in a couple of contexts. First, if you are to look at the third quarter, what would be the year-over-year constant currency growth by region, whether you are looking at Europe, U.S., Asia, just to get a sense of where each of these businesses are growing, as if you owned all of these assets a year ago in terms of what you acquired or what you have divested? And then secondly, as you look at the guidance or the indications or the aspirations you just described for 2021, can you further unpack with that double-digit revenue growth, what would be the organic part of that versus the benefit of the acquisition and maybe walk through a little bit more detail of the pluses and minuses that are affecting the core FFO per share? Thanks.\nAndy Power: Hey, thanks Michael. So, this is Andy. Let me maybe try to take that in reverse order. And I will see if I can get all the details by region. So, I think the second part of your question was speaking to what next year\u2019s growth looks like and we shared a little bit of preview although obviously our guidance will come out till early next year. Really there is no we were speaking to the bottom line or core FFO per share growth so there is no apples and oranges, benefits, because the cost of our Interxion acquisition is kind of baked in, the share count, and obviously, the debt. So it\u2019s not like there is inorganic growth, supplementing those numbers. If you kind of deconstruct it, from the top line, I mean, I think you can look at our, our signings volume, probably the last two quarters is the best trend given those are two quarters, where we reported Digital plus Interxion together for 100% of the quarters. In terms of P&L contribution and signings this quarter is obviously a strong $89 million, the prior quarter was the record $144 million the two of them kind of averaged out to low 100 to 115 or so. And coincidentally our revenue in the in the quarter is now ready to billion dollars. So that makes the math easy for what kind of revenue growth would be kind of going forward called in the low teens, obviously have to net our any churn. But I still think you arrive at a high single digits revenue number at the top line for the aggregate business. And that obviously nets down to that mid single digit square foot per share growth model. I think that headwind or to obviously think about is we are having the less spend this year, well, obvious things less T&E, delay in maintenance of OpEx, right that was going kind of just critical staffing. And assuming we are all fortunate to be in a better place versus this virus next year, we would assume a lot of those costs involve them in some capacity return. Breaking that going back to your first part of the question and looking at the revenue contributions was I don\u2019t I apologize, I don\u2019t have a segment by segment P&L in front of me. But I think I can get to the crux of it, we just look at our development schedule, which is just under 200 megawatts of capacity under constructions 56% pre leased, was returns, it creped up a little bit in our favor, this quarter relative to last quarter. And you can see, relative to our existing mix of business, a disproportionate share of our new capacity coming online is outside the U.S. relative to our installed base. And was not on that schedule given unconsolidated joint ventures Latin America further amplify that math based on the activity we are doing with Ascenty. So, obviously, our growth relative to the install base is much larger in India, in Latin America, and Asia Pacific, given the amount of new capacity that we signed, or bringing online in those markets relative to those bases. Relative and makes sense. Obviously the North American market is by far the most mature and is our largest portion of the pie.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks, Andy.\nAndy Power: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Atkins of RBC. Please go ahead.\nJon Atkins: Thanks. I wanted to ask kind of a big picture question about energy and sustainability and then a question about lease expirations. So wondered if you could maybe dive down a little bit into future initiatives around sustainability In any kind of future milestones that you are working towards, and then the in the supplemental looks like the lease expirations next year, you know, increase and a lot of that is in kind of the sub 1 megawatt range, although it does tend to there is a bump up in expirations in the annual rent across all categories. And I wondered as we think about 2021, how do we kind of frame that from the standpoint of lease roll downs or increases in rent or churn or whatnot? Thank you.\nAndy Power: Bill, do you want to take the first part and I can take the second part on expirations?\nBill Stein: Yes, sure. Hey, thanks, Jon. Okay, here at Digital we are committed to going well above and beyond minimum renewable standards. We think that the consistent renewable sourcing efforts allow us to decouple the growth of our portfolio from the growth in our carbon footprint. Our approach prioritizes cost competitive net new renewable energy sourced within the same grid regions where our data centers are located. We work with electric utilities to support them in bringing new renewables on the grid and our customers strongly prefer local net new renewables and our approach reflects that. We do not use unbundled commodity renewable energy credits. These are called RECs to meet our long-term objectives. We price what\u2019s called additionality in our approach. That\u2019s a concept where more renewables are brought online because of our actions. And also when we sign on to a project early on in its development cycle, it\u2019s important to recognize that as an investment grade counterparty, this enables that project to both be financed and built. Andy, you want to handle the renewals question?\nAndy Power: Yes. Thanks, Bill. So, John, obviously, we are still in 2021 budget season, but I don\u2019t \u2013 I do look at kind of what\u2019s ahead in 2021 in terms of expirations as being very favorable in terms of volume mix, mark-to-market relative to our history, which I have shared for some time in some of our investment polls you have obviously hosted. If you kind of go to our expiration table and our supp, I look at them really two discreet buckets, the first one being call it that 01 megawatt category, with about 17% of our expirations in 2021, which is concentrated in our most highly connected, highest pricing power sticky albeit shorter term co-location contract bucket, pro forma for our combination about half of that, contracts coming due in that from legacy Interxion in the Western portfolio. So, we do expect to continue to see very strong pricing power there and the other half is really from our legacy North America co-lo portfolio. Overall, the markets are call it major metros, the London and New York cities, Frankfurt, San Francisco, Paris\u2019 in terms of the top markets coming due in that bucket. If you do look at what I think maybe was the emphasis of your question was kind of looking at the greater than a megawatt bucket that category is a little bit less than 8% as you can see on the supp and it has stepped down about 300 basis points from I think the peak was the third quarter of 18%, about over \u2013 just over 11%. Other than Ashburn in that category of expirations north of megawatt, no market other than Ashburn is greater than 1%. So, it\u2019s pretty diverse. And when you \u2013 I mean, I know it\u2019s a little bit of tough comparison, because we broaden our definition or change our definition slightly when we changed our disclosures a couple of quarters ago, but if you look at the rates per kilowatts, we look at our rates on expiring contracts having come down call it $15 or so per kilowatt in that time period from that prior peak, so setting us up for more favorable comparison. And then last but not least, as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, really the most concentrated expiration is just under 17 megawatts. Fortunately, it is in the Ashburn market, obviously our largest market and probably going to come at a better time given how well our team has done in leasing that market, 90 megawatts of the last 9 months really [indiscernible] organization on that. So I know I am certainly aware of customers right now that are anxiously, awaiting for that adjacent hall in their buildings and one of our connected campuses to become available. So, I think we will be able to weather our way through that. After that concentration, the next largest call it chunk would be less than 4.5 megawatts from any single customer and half of that expiration in Santa Clara, which is a really tight market for us. So, hopefully, I will provide a little bit more color and a little bit more about the [indiscernible] index as what we see ahead in the expirations.\nJon Atkins: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJordan Sadler: Good afternoon. So, I wanted to start with sort of capital, it would be hard not to notice the move in the stock year-to-date in the extraordinarily low cost of debt, which you guys have availed yourself of Digital has historically been pretty active on the M&A and investment front. So maybe you could tell us what you are seeing in the market today and the opportunity set for inorganic growth as you see it?\nBill Stein: Maybe I will hand it off to Greg to speak to cover the broader M&A landscape. I think you are on mute Greg?\nGreg Wright: Sorry can you hear me now? Sorry about that, Jordan, okay sorry about that. Look I think the current market we are seeing today, which I don\u2019t think will surprise you seeing demand for the data center assets is really strong. This was previously really a niche asset class that I would say is going mainstream, or has gone mainstream, we are seeing more core like capital come into the sector, given the strong supply and demand fundamentals, and how well, the sector has performed during the pandemic. And both of those things, I think, combined with the credit worthiness of the customer base, all of those underlying elements drive for more core like capital. So look, we think you are going to continue to see a focus on data center and asset class this capital is capital that was previously invested in areas like offices or strip malls, and they started to migrate towards our space, I would say the environment is increasingly strong right now. So I mean, again, I think we will continue to see strong demand for the sector for quite some time, Jordan, on the M&A front. I think we have seen, we have seen some of these private portfolios trade, and they continue to trade at, decent levels, for example, I mean, you saw the asset that we sold last quarter in the Netherlands, we sold that and it was a non core asset. And we sold it for roughly a 6.7 cap rate. So, look, I think when you look at the overall environment right now, I would say there is a lot of interest and a lot of demand, which should bode well for the sector.\nJordan Sadler: And just maybe as a follow-up along the same lines in terms of let us say, the net dollar of investment, where would you be focused in from an M&A front? Is it increased market share in a mature market like North America or is it adding new markets?\nGreg Wright: Look I think there is yes, when you look at our global strategy, I think it\u2019s different for each market. Jordan, I think, look clearly in Asia right now, the way we have been growing is organic growth in our existing markets through land acquisition and development of near term in our existing land bank, right. I mean, we have rolled out products across seven of the APAC markets for example, we created the first network mutual data center in South Korea, we build out a campus of 100 plus Meg\u2019s in Tokyo. I think it was 5 or 10. Meg\u2019s in Osaka, we powered on a 50 megawatt building in Singapore, which is our third asset there. And that you also saw us announce our second site in Hong Kong. So clearly, when we look at, we look at Asia right now. it\u2019s a harder market to grow in, right because it\u2019s much more fragmented. But we like it. I think in terms of Europe and EMEA, I think you got to look at first thing you have look at is really our under construction pipeline, which we had in legacy Digital as well as the legacy Interxion but you look at markets like Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Zurich, Marseille Stockholm, we have assets in each of those markets under construction and really being driven by customer demand, as well as in those in that same European markets, organic growth, again, in existing markets through the land acquisition, or development of our existing land pipeline things places like Madrid, Frankfurt, Vienna in Paris, clearly in that market to, as you saw in this press release, we will have select dispositions in capital recycling. and you will see some redevelopment, right on our head, our campus that Bill mentioned, one of the beauties of that transaction is we get a, we are going to have redevelopment opportunity for several buildings that we did not previously own. I think when you keep going back then across the globe, and you look at South America, Andy mentioned in organics really been organic growth through land acquisitions and development in South America. Again, like all markets, that\u2019s really a customer driven approach. So you talk about incremental dollars, a lot of times where we go is dictated on where our customers want to be right. And I was \u2013 there are no two places that are better examples of that in both Chile and Mexico. Obviously, Brazil was the same. And then when you come back to the U.S., which is a more developed market, again, you will see development in select markets. But I think you will see continue to see acquisition of highly connected assets with what we would call established communities and interest in buildings such as the Westin. And again, there just like in Europe, you will see select capital recycling. So, when I say when you talk about incremental dollars, there is just a quick snapshot of how we are thinking about things across the globe.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt Niknam: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, my questions are on the hyperscale. So one of your peers this morning was talking about getting more aggressive lowering the yields they are targeting for hyperscale deals down to the 8% to 10% range. So I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about the pricing and competitive backdrop you are seeing in the hyperscale arena and whether things are getting more competitive relative to what they have been like in the past? And then just a quick follow-up on enterprise, you talks about record new logo growth and heightened deal velocity at a time when a lot of your peers are actually talking about more growth coming from the embedded base. So, I am just wondering what\u2019s enabling you to win you share, where are these new customers coming from? Thanks.\nAndy Power: Hey, thanks, Matt. Maybe I will start off on hyperscale and I will toss it to Corey to speak to what I really thought was a really fantastic quarter when it came to enterprise, in particular. The \u2013 I mean, I think the hyperscale arena is something that we have excelled it for several quarters on and year. And I think I got a hunch, the competitor that you were referring to and I think I know it\u2019s a new leadership regime, but I would say that\u2019s, they have been a pretty fierce competitor for some time and aggressive, I have not seen a change in the posture from our day-to-day activities. I think it goes back to Digital, our platform has been able to win more than its fair share by coming to table with many ways to support these global hyperscalers whether it is being across numerous countries and markets, where they want us to grow or they are entering new markets, as Greg mentioned, side by side with them, where there is no truly established player to deliver to our capabilities, whether it is owning the adjacent land holdings that really allows us to future proof that growth and other things like making sure we are delivering the health and safety standards they require and making sure we are operating these facilities to the level that they require as if it was their own building and they have high expectations, I think Digital strives to exceed across the board. And I think you see that paying dividends in our results this last quarter, as I mentioned a second ago, our returns on our development, which are obviously weighted very much to our success within the hyperscale arena, actually went up across a couple of markets. And I think our success in the Ashburn market over the last few quarters, which is a hotly contested market, we have been able to be 100% pre-leased and rather full speaks to our success within that category for sure. So, I think that\u2019s kind of capsulated, I don\u2019t think there is no real dynamic shift in the competitive landscape. I would even say, the customers continue to mature and want to fin down their buying groups with more global partners, trusted infrastructure partners, like the Digital. But Corey maybe you could pick it up and really speak to what you \u2013 what we have been doing on the enterprise front.\nCorey Dyer: Yes, thanks, Matt, for the question and Andy for transitioning to me. On the enterprise front, Matt, I think you asked a little bit about where the new logos are coming from and just where the enterprise wins are coming from and I would tell you, Andy referenced earlier record number of new logos. And then we are just excited about the quality of the new logos and what the growth and the future that they can drive as you think through it. Some of the notable wins we talked about were global markets company, there was one of the largest financial derivative exchanges we have signed and convinced during the quarter. We also had a mobile marketing platform that fuels many of the popular mobile gaming that are with [indiscernible] marketing technology and a major participant in the investment industry. So, we just had a really broad base of wins in the enterprise lately. As you think through it, we also kind of keep track of service exchange support. So that went up for us. And then interesting this quarter, more than 50% of our new bookings this quarter, as Andy mentioned, were from deals less than 1 megawatt, which is generally assigned to the enterprises coming to you. And then if you think longer term Matt about where we are going, there is a lot of studies out there that show 80%, 85% of the enterprise, we are thinking about going hybrid cloud strategy. And so as you think about that migrating to hybrid clouds implies that they are going to put some of them in the public cloud, but a majority of it is in their kind of co-location facilities like us. So we don\u2019t see that we see that as an another advantage and something is going to continue to drive more enterprise growth for us. And then there is probably a little bit of COVID, of expediting kind of a transition to a distributed architecture for the enterprises, which again, we are really well positioned to take advantage of. So above and beyond that we are doing a lot with our go to market that we are changing that we did in the last couple of years, that had huge success for us. And then the channel that we have built here in the last couple years has been amazing for us to already normal than 20% of business out of the channel. So feel like we are really just kind of hitting on all cylinders when it comes to the enterprise right now. And I feel really, really happy with what we are doing and where we are progressing the business. Hope that helps, Matt.\nMatt Niknam: Yes that\u2019s great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJon Petersen: Okay, thanks. So on Europe, I am wondering if you could break out the how much of the leasing was legacy Interxion versus legacy Digital, so we can get an idea of like apples-to-apples versus prior years, if that is possible. I know it gets more difficult every quarter we get away from that merger? And then also, I didn\u2019t go back to look at all your supplements. I think this is only the second time that wholesale leasing in Europe was greater than North America Just curious how long you think this trend of kind of strong wholesale/hyperscale demand in Europe will last and when we start to see, if we start to see a shift back to Americas in the coming quarters?\nBill Stein: Hey, thanks, Jon. So to answer both of those questions, the lion\u2019s share of the activity landed within legacy Interxion sites within EMEA. We did have a very strong contribution from the legacy Digital co-lo sites, but overall GAAP wise, it was call it less than 10% of the EMEA contribution. So, as and which should be expected, obviously, the legacy footprints are weighted, their legacy footprint in the EMEA was a fair bit larger than our legacy footprint in EMEA. And then on your question in North America versus EMEA, I mean, I think this kind of goes back to the first question Michael Rollins today asked about, we are certainly seeing outsized growth relative to our installed base in these non-U.S. markets, although I do at the same time, you have to put it in the context. We are coming off a quarter in North America where we absorbed a tremendous amount of capacity in North America, including Ashburn. So, I am not sure I had pointed in the direction that EMEA overall was going to be larger, especially in the plus megawatt category for some extended duration. But we are definitely pleased with the success of our combined EMEA platform. And I think for what I am seeing, we are not done for the year in that category yet as well. I know, another way we are differentiating ourselves with some of these hyperscalars is kind of continue to support them in more and more EMEA markets, not just the traditional flat markets, so some growth leading the flaps has been a great place to where we have had success in EMEA as well.\nJon Petersen: Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nSami Badri: Hi, thank you for the question. I just wanted to touch up a little bit on Slide #13 regarding the releasing spreads and this clearly shows a material improvement versus the last couple of quarters. And I just wanted to round out to see if this is essentially, your cleared runway, out of all the releasing spreads at least the majority of the vintages that you guys are trying to process through last couple quarters from prior acquisitions is it safe to say now that this is kind of the new range in this, plus 1%, plus or minus 1% range on releasing spreads for rental changes on a cash basis?\nBill Stein: Thanks, Sami. So, congratulations as yours are in order and some of the IR rankings, so good work there and we are glad to see that recognized. But to answer your question obviously, that those data points are pointing in our favor a bit in terms of our cash mark-to-markets. You saw that in the quarter basically flat to low 20 basis points negative in the less than megawatt category, but basically flat across both and flat overall and what we have put up in terms of renewals in the third quarter. We also improved our characterization of our mark-to-market in our guidance from a beginning we are down low single-digits in terms of our expectations for our cash mark-to-markets. And now we have, in the words of John Stewart, are slightly negative. So, moving in the right direction for sure there, I would put an asterisk or caveat just to be more transparent that you can see in the document here, the readings this particular quarter were overall much more in the call it most highly connected, network oriented megawatt or less type category. So that obviously blends in our favor. Those are locations, both legacy Digital and legacy Interxion with some of our strongest pricing power. And the overall sample set in the greater than megawatt category was certainly on the smaller side. So, I don\u2019t think we are ready to put the victory flag up behind us on this topic, but I do \u2013 I am taking some conviction that we are moving in a better direction here, which is the product in some regards of not only the market fundamentals, but also the REIT characterization or complexion of our portfolio that is much more diversified across both the U.S. and non-U.S. markets, more connected and highly connected and now we are going into destinations. So, I do think those things, in addition to the market fundamentals, are helping us on the cash mark-to-markets.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you and thanks for the note. Just one other follow-up regarding channel that came up earlier, I think if someone said at 20% of bookings are coming from the channel, and I just wanted to check on one additional detail there. Has this percentage of contribution from the channel gone up with Interxion or was it always essentially in the 20% range every quarter and with Interxion under the hood? Does that mean that this mix could potentially increase over time?\nBill Stein: Corey, you want to pick on that \u2013 pick up on that and I can fill on with some details as well.\nCorey Dyer: Yes, so, Sam thanks for the question. What I would tell you is that our percentage of our sales from a legacy Digital perspective has continued to grow are well over 20%. With the Interxion that might moderate it a little bit, but I think it gives to your point, a huge opportunity for us as we build out the channel globally and we continue to take the same learnings we have had across North America throughout the globe. So, I think there is a huge opportunity for us. I think that was your question. Sorry, if I didn\u2019t answer it.\nSami Badri: Thank you.\nBill Stein: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brendan Lynch of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrendan Lynch: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I have seen a number of press releases recently, where you are referencing your Data Gravity Index. I am wondering how this has changed your communication with clients, does it lead to them or is it something that they already understand and does it lead to any different type of deployments than the clients otherwise would have?\nBill Stein: Chris, why don\u2019t you share a little bit about what we are doing around Data Gravity and what that means for customers and also Corey, please chime in as well.\nChris Sharp: Absolutely. Thanks, Brendan for the question. No, it\u2019s a very unique formula that\u2019s been evolving over 10 years. And what it really does is it identifies key challenges facing enterprises today around the power requirements and the growth of data, so that we can design solutions to alleviate it. And so I think it\u2019s something that\u2019s unique to \u2013 Digital has unique assets to really solve for this kind of ever evolving problem that\u2019s being generated around the massive amounts of data being created. And so what\u2019s unique in the fact that Digital can allow customers to be in proximity to these data ocean that already exists within Digital Realty. And so they have the efficiencies of proximity to those data oceans and then we also provide, most recently, we just did a press release with path AI, where they can now be placed in a space where they can do analytics against that. And so the artificial intelligence trend that\u2019s happening in the industry is another underpinning element of what the Data Gravity Index represents is how customers can get in proximity to existing data, and then also do analytics through AI, with our unique asset class and product portfolio. And so, it\u2019s, a bit of a educational basis, that we really just want customers to be aware of the buyers dynamic and helps them solve for the burgeoning underpinning of data and the amount of data that\u2019s being grown. And I think, there is some great statistics out there where enterprises are going to be creating more and more of their own data in a very distributed manner. And so that is where, you see us being able to solve for not only in our traditional types of offering for these data, gravity problems and the burgeoning sets of data, but also some of the emerging edge workloads as well. And being able to tie all that together in our comprehensive set of product offerings and interconnection capabilities that is really what is underpinning that data, gravity kind of formulas, and just educating our customers of that, and I don\u2019t know Corey if you had anything else you wanted to touch upon?\nCorey Dyer: No, Chris, you did a great job on framing up what it is, what I would also add to that maybe is, it really helps us have a point of view, and, some perspective for customers, as they think through the changing architecture what they are going to need is to go through COVID and get going into much more distributed world. And so you are going to have to start thinking about how you handle data, not just interconnection, alright, and the data that is going to matter to all of us. It\u2019s what really drives all of our businesses. So if you have got some customers that are curious about it we have got a whole bunch of people and team members here that are more than happy to get engaged with to talk about how you can make take advantage of it.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for the color.\nCorey Dyer: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nColby Synesael: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Just wanted to get an update on the European assets sales that you guys have talked about from a timing and size perspective I have seen some reports where that might be moving forward? And then secondly I appreciate the color you gave on 2021 core assets per share growth of mid single digits I was wondering if you can give us a little more color in terms of what is assumed in there as relates acuity needs leverage CapEx those types of things that obviously have a pretty big impact as well? Thank you.\nBill Stein: Greg, why don\u2019t you start with the overall dispositions of philosophy there and then I will pick up on the second question?\nGreg Wright: Hey Colby. How are you?\nColby Synesael: I am doing good, Greg.\nGreg Wright: Good. Well, I am not sure we have ever talked about a specific when we have we know we sold our one asset here in Europe here as we mentioned in the quarter in the Netherlands and we thought it was attractive capital for the asset so look I think when you think about our philosophy or approach when it comes to portfolio optimization I mean look we have talked and we remained focused on capital recycling and portfolio optimization, as I mentioned earlier we think it\u2019s a strong market right now to sell assets and once we sell those assets out of what for us again there are still good assets, these are just not core to Digital, our ability to then turn around and recycle those proceeds and deploy capital and other assets that further align with our strategy. Again, we want to do smart deals that maximize shareholder value. And that is where we are focused. So look, I think, over time, the guidance we gave, I guess it\u2019s been, it was an official guidance. But when we talked in the market, I guess it\u2019s been close to two years ago we said a few billion over a few years. We are about halfway through that now. And, but we have been pleased with the results so far. But again, the good news is, we do that we don\u2019t have to do this, we only do this when we think we are going to get fair pricing, and it makes strategic sense for us. Luckily, Andy and John in the team have the balance sheet with a change so that we are never forced to have to do asset sales, but we do them again, when it\u2019s a fair price and make strategic sense to Digital.\nColby Synesael: Thanks. I have just one quick follow-up to that, which is your own valuation has gone up since the last asset sale you did with Maple \u2013 with the Mapletree. And I am just wondering if that factors into your decision-making when you think about the accretion dilution aspect to these potential sales in the cap rates you can get?\nGreg Wright: It does 100%. I mean, we look at \u2013 we look and see what we are trading, a lot of times for these assets will run marketed processes. So, we get a true market check, but yes, it definitely factors into our thinking, where our stock is trading and what our redeployment strategy will be. Yes, you can be best believed it factors into our thought and approach.\nBill Stein: And then Colby, just real quick on your second question, obviously, we are not pulling forward on call with our guidance for next year, call it 180 days or whatever it is. But I think the point \u2013 that point most relevant to the heart of your question was funding sources and thoughts. Greg touched it little bit, but I think I would kind of capsulate in the following snapshot, obviously, where it stand today at our targeted leverage levels and that\u2019s with a substantial backlog of non-income producing assets that are going to be coming online and producing the EBITDA here shortly to kind of grow our EBITDA without much capital requirements to finish those projects. Two, as you saw, we have got about little more about \u2013 little over $300 million of cash sitting on the balance sheet, which is just the net of the capital raise relative to the data preferred redeemed. So, there is kind of cash sitting there, not earning anything as we speak, but obviously we will go towards our funding sources for the next 12 plus months. We have redeemed about $500 million of professional preferred in the last 2 months. So, we do have professional referred capacity and those coupons we have been quoted are close to 4%. Greg touched on potential dispositions in the call it \u2013 if we get to the high end of our guidance, let\u2019s call it another $500ish million of size. So also those are un-levered, also contributing equity sources. And then longer term, I think we are going back to that question you just had raised of always continuing to expand our capital partners with sources of private capital where we can put in fully valued, maximized, fully leased long-term assets and retained management control. And we have also not been shy of prudently using the ATM on the margins here. So I think we have got a lot of arrows in our quiver here in terms of capital sources to fund some pretty attractive opportunities we see in the front view mirror here. Thanks, Colby.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to CEO, Bill Stein for his closing remarks. Bill, please go ahead.\nBill Stein: Thank you, Andrew. I would like to wrap our call today by recapping our highlights for the third quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we further strengthened our connections with our customers, landing a record number of new logos in the quarter with a book of new business remarkably well balanced across customer type and geographic region. We also delivered solid current period financial results, feeding consensus and raising guidance for the second time this year. We further extended our global platform, providing customers a gateway into Southeastern Europe and our runway for growth across the continent, with strategic land acquisitions and new development starts. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, with exceptional execution on $2.5 billion of long-term capital raises and we use the proceeds to retire $2 billion of high coupon debt and preferred equity. I would like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family and particularly our frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world turning in the midst of a global pandemic. I hope all of you stay safe and healthy and we hope to see many of you in person again soon. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bill Stein",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global connected sustainable framework. And despite the pandemic, our third quarter results demonstrate the strength of this framework. Our business is increasingly global, with nearly 60% of third quarter bookings outside North America and we landed a record 130 new logos from around the world. Bookings were also well diversified by customer type, with enterprise co-location and interconnection accounting for nearly half the total. This robust and diverse business mix demonstrates the power of our global platform and further validates our strategic vision of being the only global provider dedicated to the full customer spectrum. Let's turn to our health and safety measures on Page 3. We remain focused on keeping our employees, customers and partners safe during this pandemic. We remained fully operational across our 284 data centers and we continue to support our customers' growth by bringing additional capacity online, while expanding our global platform. We have implemented enhanced safety protocols, such as requiring mass, social distancing, engaging specialty cleaning services, and maintaining rotational 24/7 staff coverage by leaning on local personnel. As the pandemic continues, we are seeing signs of permanent adjustments that are likely to be long-term tailwinds for our business. More enterprises are embracing a distributed workforce with our growing work-from-home component, while our recent Gartner survey of nearly 2,000 CIOs around the world found that accelerating digital innovation and leveraging emerging technologies are key priorities during the pandemic. Of course, I would be remiss if I did not again extend our gratitude to our employees in critical data center roles who continue to come into work everyday at our facilities around the world. They make possible the service and support we provide our customers. Thank you to the terrific onsite Digital Realty team. Let's turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on Page 4. In April, we reached a wind energy agreement to supply approximately 30% of our power needs in the Dallas, Texas area with renewable energy. In late August, we further expanded our renewable energy capacity in Texas by sourcing approximately 65 megawatts of solar power. Once the solar project is fully operational by mid-2021, our entire Dallas portfolio will be powered by 70% renewable energy. We completed our first wind power transaction in 2016. And we have since gone on to contract 240 megawatts of wind and solar energy in Texas. We remain committed to manage our environmental impact, optimizing our use of energy and natural resources, serving a social purpose and delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders. Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 5. We continued to expand our global platform with a small, but highly strategic acquisition in Southeastern Europe, along with land purchases and groundbreakings in existing markets across the continent. In early September, we announced that we had acquired Altus IT, the leading carrier-neutral data center provider in Croatia, expanding our connectivity footprint into the Balkans and Eastern Europe and establishing a gateway to Southeastern Europe, through access to one of the most interconnected data centers in the region. This transaction was also a prime example of how seamlessly the classic Interxion and classic Digital Realty teams are working together. In Zurich, we are breaking ground on a new data center, two of our five biggest deals during the third quarter landed in Zurich and the expansion of our campus will provide runway for customer growth as the leading cloud and interconnection hub in Switzerland. We also recently acquired land parcels within 1 kilometer of our highly interconnected campuses in Vienna as well as Madrid. These strategic land holdings will provide additional capacity, enabling local and global service providers to seamlessly expand adjacent to their existing deployments. In early July, we announced the opening of the first phase of MRS3, our data center in Marseille. Interxion's Marseille campus is one of the world's leading digital hubs for intercontinental data traffic with over 150 network service providers. The new facility will offer customers expanded access to the vibrant community in Marseille, including numerous connectivity providers, digital media and cloud segments, along with local as well as global enterprises. Finally, in mid-July, we announced that we acquired the freehold to the land under Interxion's 10-hour Landstra\u00dfe campus in Frankfurt. In addition, we are also under contract to acquire the Neckermann site a separate parcel within a kilometer of Interxion's existing campus that will support the development of up to 180 megawatts of IT capacity. We believe that we are creating significant value by combining the leasehold and freehold positions on one of the most highly connected campuses in Europe, while the adjacent expansion capacity provides runway to support customer growth in a key European metro for years to come. Let's turn to Page 6 for an update on the Interxion integration. As you have heard me say before, integration is our top priority for 2020 and we continue to make solid progress despite the pandemic. Both teams have risen to the occasion and have come together to continue to serve our customers' needs throughout this crisis. It is great to see this collaboration. Andy will cover our customer wins in more detail, but both sales engines are working well together and we have begun to realize some of the cross-selling opportunities we envisioned when contemplating this transaction. We remain on track to meet our synergy targets and underwriting budgets. Title retention is also running ahead of plan at over 95% with no loss of key personnel. Along those lines, as we announced when we first broke the news of our combination with Interxion 1 year ago today. Early next year, David Ruberg will be transitioning within Digital Realty from his day-to-day responsibilities as Chief Executive EMEA and will be moving into a global strategic advisor role. In this capacity, David will be responsible for the development and oversight of our corporate strategy, including the company's effort to organize and execute a program to identify and develop High Value Communities ventures across our global platform. David plans to remain on the Board of Directors of our Dutch holding company and he will continue to play a leadership role on certain of our key global customer accounts, bringing to bear his longstanding relationships and thought leadership in addition to supporting our team on new market and product development, as recently demonstrated in Eastern Europe. Upon David's transition, legacy Digital MD, EMEA, Jeff Tapley and legacy Interxion MD, [indiscernible], will continue to oversee the company's EMEA business. I would like to thank David for his tremendous contributions and his successful efforts to integrate our businesses. We look forward to benefiting from his strategic insights for years to come. Let's turn to demand drivers on Page 7. We are fortunate to be operating in a business leverages secular demand drivers. As a leading global data center provider, we have a unique vantage point that enables us to detect secular trends as they emerge. Our customers are solving some of the most complex infrastructure connectivity and workload use cases across network peering hyperscale, low latency, high-performance computing, big data and artificial intelligence. Over the past several years, we have seen a growing trend of leading multinational enterprises deploying and connecting large private data infrastructure footprints across multiple global sites. We have conducted research, build a global database and devise a method to measure, quantify and forecast the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation lifecycle and its gravitational impact on IT infrastructure. We have recently published our findings as the Data Gravity Index, a report designed to assist both enterprise and service provider customers as they shift their infrastructure strategies to address challenges presented by Data Gravity. Our global data center platform is uniquely positioned to help customers address the Data Gravity challenges. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Yes, sure. Hey, thanks, Jon. Okay, here at Digital we are committed to going well above and beyond minimum renewable standards. We think that the consistent renewable sourcing efforts allow us to decouple the growth of our portfolio from the growth in our carbon footprint. Our approach prioritizes cost competitive net new renewable energy sourced within the same grid regions where our data centers are located. We work with electric utilities to support them in bringing new renewables on the grid and our customers strongly prefer local net new renewables and our approach reflects that. We do not use unbundled commodity renewable energy credits. These are called RECs to meet our long-term objectives. We price what's called additionality in our approach. That's a concept where more renewables are brought online because of our actions. And also when we sign on to a project early on in its development cycle, it's important to recognize that as an investment grade counterparty, this enables that project to both be financed and built. Andy, you want to handle the renewals question? Maybe I will hand it off to Greg to speak to cover the broader M&A landscape. I think you are on mute Greg? Hey, thanks, Jon. So to answer both of those questions, the lion's share of the activity landed within legacy Interxion sites within EMEA. We did have a very strong contribution from the legacy Digital co-lo sites, but overall GAAP wise, it was call it less than 10% of the EMEA contribution. So, as and which should be expected, obviously, the legacy footprints are weighted, their legacy footprint in the EMEA was a fair bit larger than our legacy footprint in EMEA. And then on your question in North America versus EMEA, I mean, I think this kind of goes back to the first question Michael Rollins today asked about, we are certainly seeing outsized growth relative to our installed base in these non-U.S. markets, although I do at the same time, you have to put it in the context. We are coming off a quarter in North America where we absorbed a tremendous amount of capacity in North America, including Ashburn. So, I am not sure I had pointed in the direction that EMEA overall was going to be larger, especially in the plus megawatt category for some extended duration. But we are definitely pleased with the success of our combined EMEA platform. And I think for what I am seeing, we are not done for the year in that category yet as well. I know, another way we are differentiating ourselves with some of these hyperscalars is kind of continue to support them in more and more EMEA markets, not just the traditional flat markets, so some growth leading the flaps has been a great place to where we have had success in EMEA as well. Thanks, Sami. So, congratulations as yours are in order and some of the IR rankings, so good work there and we are glad to see that recognized. But to answer your question obviously, that those data points are pointing in our favor a bit in terms of our cash mark-to-markets. You saw that in the quarter basically flat to low 20 basis points negative in the less than megawatt category, but basically flat across both and flat overall and what we have put up in terms of renewals in the third quarter. We also improved our characterization of our mark-to-market in our guidance from a beginning we are down low single-digits in terms of our expectations for our cash mark-to-markets. And now we have, in the words of John Stewart, are slightly negative. So, moving in the right direction for sure there, I would put an asterisk or caveat just to be more transparent that you can see in the document here, the readings this particular quarter were overall much more in the call it most highly connected, network oriented megawatt or less type category. So that obviously blends in our favor. Those are locations, both legacy Digital and legacy Interxion with some of our strongest pricing power. And the overall sample set in the greater than megawatt category was certainly on the smaller side. So, I don't think we are ready to put the victory flag up behind us on this topic, but I do \u2013 I am taking some conviction that we are moving in a better direction here, which is the product in some regards of not only the market fundamentals, but also the REIT characterization or complexion of our portfolio that is much more diversified across both the U.S. and non-U.S. markets, more connected and highly connected and now we are going into destinations. So, I do think those things, in addition to the market fundamentals, are helping us on the cash mark-to-markets. Corey, you want to pick on that \u2013 pick up on that and I can fill on with some details as well. Okay. Chris, why don't you share a little bit about what we are doing around Data Gravity and what that means for customers and also Corey, please chime in as well. Greg, why don't you start with the overall dispositions of philosophy there and then I will pick up on the second question? And then Colby, just real quick on your second question, obviously, we are not pulling forward on call with our guidance for next year, call it 180 days or whatever it is. But I think the point \u2013 that point most relevant to the heart of your question was funding sources and thoughts. Greg touched it little bit, but I think I would kind of capsulate in the following snapshot, obviously, where it stand today at our targeted leverage levels and that's with a substantial backlog of non-income producing assets that are going to be coming online and producing the EBITDA here shortly to kind of grow our EBITDA without much capital requirements to finish those projects. Two, as you saw, we have got about little more about \u2013 little over $300 million of cash sitting on the balance sheet, which is just the net of the capital raise relative to the data preferred redeemed. So, there is kind of cash sitting there, not earning anything as we speak, but obviously we will go towards our funding sources for the next 12 plus months. We have redeemed about $500 million of professional preferred in the last 2 months. So, we do have professional referred capacity and those coupons we have been quoted are close to 4%. Greg touched on potential dispositions in the call it \u2013 if we get to the high end of our guidance, let's call it another $500ish million of size. So also those are un-levered, also contributing equity sources. And then longer term, I think we are going back to that question you just had raised of always continuing to expand our capital partners with sources of private capital where we can put in fully valued, maximized, fully leased long-term assets and retained management control. And we have also not been shy of prudently using the ATM on the margins here. So I think we have got a lot of arrows in our quiver here in terms of capital sources to fund some pretty attractive opportunities we see in the front view mirror here. Thanks, Colby. Thank you, Andrew. I would like to wrap our call today by recapping our highlights for the third quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we further strengthened our connections with our customers, landing a record number of new logos in the quarter with a book of new business remarkably well balanced across customer type and geographic region. We also delivered solid current period financial results, feeding consensus and raising guidance for the second time this year. We further extended our global platform, providing customers a gateway into Southeastern Europe and our runway for growth across the continent, with strategic land acquisitions and new development starts. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, with exceptional execution on $2.5 billion of long-term capital raises and we use the proceeds to retire $2 billion of high coupon debt and preferred equity. I would like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family and particularly our frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world turning in the midst of a global pandemic. I hope all of you stay safe and healthy and we hope to see many of you in person again soon. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Let's pick up here on Page 9. As Bill mentioned in his comments, the Interxion integration is coming along on schedule and we are seeing the power of the combined organization with more than 280 data centers in 48 metros across 23 countries on six continents. The power of the global platform is on full display for our installed base of 4,000 global customers and growing. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 10. We signed total bookings of $89 million, including a $14 million contribution from interconnection, which along with the $29 million of network and enterprise-oriented deals of a megawatt or less accounted for a record contribution of nearly half our total bookings. The weighted average lease term was over 6 years. We landed a record 130 new logos during the third quarter, including 40 sourced by Interxion, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. Activity was well balanced across all three regions, with the Americas and EMEA each contributing about 40% of total bookings, while Asia-Pacific accounted for nearly 20%. Singapore was the star in Asia-Pacific, while Zurich, Frankfurt and Marseille were staying out today in EMEA. In the Americas, we again experienced strength in the New York metro area as well as Chicago and Toronto. In Northern Virginia, where we have leased more than 90 megawatts of the previous 9 months, we signed just over 2 million GAAP during the third quarter. As our active development pipeline remains 100% pre-leased while our in-service portfolio remains the only 94% leased. We do expect to get back to 17 megawatts of state-of-the-art capacity in Ashburn at the end of this year. And together with the existing vacancy within our in-service portfolio, this will give us a total of 40 megawatts of available inventory to meet demand and support customer growth for the next several quarters until we are able to bring additional capacity online around the middle of next year. Although we aren't entirely out of the competitive woods just yet, we remain very well-positioned to continue to hit above our weight given the strength of our global platform and sales force, the large and growing installed customer base seeking growth with adjacency on our connected Ashburn campuses, and finally, our ability to future proof our customers' growth with our strategic land holdings, providing the longest runway to support their future growth. In terms of specific lengths during the quarter and around the world, in Marseille, we won a significant connectivity deal with PCCW to land the PC subsea cable at our MRS2 data center. This is a higher strategic deal as it enables our customers to directly access this 12,000 kilometer high capacity cable that will provide the shortest and most direct subsea data route from North Asia to Europe. In Hong Kong, we are excited to support a Fortune 500 multinational professional services firm, with the implementation of a data hub deployment on Platform Digital. In London, the classic Digital Realty and classic Interxion teams work closely together to add Canonical, a leading UK based software and IP service provider and the publisher of Ubuntu, a leading Linux distribution. Boosteroid, a cloud gaming platform expanded their platform across Western Europe in the third quarter with a deal that involved 4 metros, Paris, Marseille, Madrid and London. G-Core, a gaming CDN expanded their use of Platform Digital in four locations across North America and Europe for their growing infrastructure demands and new AI platform. Staying with the gaming theme in the Bay Area, we have the Blade Group a cloud-based gaming company enabled daily intensive gaming. While in Ashburn, Capital Online selected Platform Digital to support their cloud development platform for gaming, e-commerce, education and big data. Finally, in Brussels, we are helping Ahold Delhaize, a leading global grocery retailer migrate from their legacy on-prem facility to Platform Digital for multi-cloud access and flexibility for future expansion. Turning to our backlog on Page 12, the current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $229 million. The step down from the $251 million last quarter will fetch record commencers in nearly $100 million during the third quarter offset by the $75 million of combined space and power leases signed. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at roughly 6.5 months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 13, we signed $160 million of renewals during the third quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the third quarter, was a little less than 2 years, reflecting a mix of activities skewed heavily towards the deployments, smaller than 1 megawatts. Cash rents on renewals were essentially flat, down just 20 basis points across all categories and cash rents on renewals above and below 1 megawatt were both essentially unchanged, an encouraging sign for pricing. We retained 78% of expiring leases, essentially in line with our long-term trend, but dragged down a bit by network customer who churned out of powered Shell capacity at our downtown Los Angeles interconnection hub. Similar to our strategy we have successfully executed with recaptured self space in Chicago, we expect to redevelop this scarce inventory within a highly desirable interconnection hub into significantly higher yielding co-location capacity. In terms of third quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy improved 20 basis points driven by fully leased development projects placed in service, primarily in Chicago and Hillsborough. Same capital occupancy was unchanged for the second quarter and same capital cash NOI growth was in line with expectations at negative 1.9%. As a reminder, Interxion and the Westin Building are not included in the 2020 same-store pool, but we expect both acquisitions will be accretive to organic growth going forward. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 14, the U.S. dollar softened over the summer before steadying at those lower levels, providing a bit of an FX tailwind in the third quarter relative to prior year average. Overall, FX represented roughly 100 basis point tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In terms of vertical concentration, as you can see from the pie chart on the upper right, we are fortunate to be primarily serving customers whose businesses are thriving in the current environment, with limited exposure to sectors most negatively impacted. Rent collections remained in line with our historical average and requests for rent relief have largely subsided. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy and matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have roughly a 50 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was down 8% year-over-year, but $0.05 ahead of consensus, driven by a beat on the top line as well as lower property taxes and a lower share count due to the late September settlement of the $1 billion forward equity offering offset by higher than expected corporate taxes due to the higher statutory rates in the UK. As you may have seen from the press release, we are raising guidance for revenue, EBITDA and core FFO per share again this quarter, reflecting the third quarter outperformance. We now expect to be at or above the high end of our original ranges for all three measures. In terms of the quarterly run-rate, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page 15, we expect to be flat to down $0.01 in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the higher weighted average share count, as the additional shares from the forward equity offering will be outstanding for the entire fourth quarter compared to just 6 days in the third quarter. As you update your earnings models and begin to roll forward to next year, please keep in mind our 2021 results will entail a couple of partial periods complications. For starters, we all of course report a full year contribution from Interxion next year compared to just three quarters this year, which we expect will help drive double-digit revenue growth. On the other hand, the sooner we return to a more normalized operating environment next year, the tougher the comps as current period results are benefiting from the deferral of some overhead and OpEx as well as maintenance CapEx. Finally, the additional shares from settlement of the forward equity offering and mid-year ATM issuance will be outstanding for the full year in 2021 compared to a partial period in 2020. As a result, although we expect to rollout the formal guidance early next year, we are currently targeting mid single-digit growth in both earnings and cash flow per share. Last, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 16. As expected, the third quarter activity on the ATM and settlement of the forward equity offering brought leverage back down in line with our target range. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA stepped down to 5.6x, while fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 4.4x. We also capitalized on favorable conditions in the debt capital markets and executed several proactive liability management trades during the third quarter. In mid-September, we raised $750 million of long 11-year green Euro bonds at 1% and $300 million of 2-year floating rate notes at an initial coupon of 0%, achieving all-time low coupons for Digital Realty. We also retired $1.2 billion of bonds due in 2022 and 2023 and a blended coupon of 4.1% as well as $500 million of preferred equity, and a blended coupon of 6.1%. We had $970 million of cash on the balance sheet at September 30 although one of the preferred redemptions and one of the bottom redemptions straddled quarter end and approximately $650 million of that cash was used to fund those redemptions in mid-October. This successful execution against our financial strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 16, we have extended our weighted average debt maturity out to 6.5 years and ratcheted our weighted average coupon down to 2.5%, a little over 70% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated acting as a natural FX hedge for our investment outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 98% of our debt is unsecured providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 16, we have a clear runway with virtually no near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out-years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we will be pleased to take your questions. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session? Hey, thanks Michael. So, this is Andy. Let me maybe try to take that in reverse order. And I will see if I can get all the details by region. So, I think the second part of your question was speaking to what next year's growth looks like and we shared a little bit of preview although obviously our guidance will come out till early next year. Really there is no we were speaking to the bottom line or core FFO per share growth so there is no apples and oranges, benefits, because the cost of our Interxion acquisition is kind of baked in, the share count, and obviously, the debt. So it's not like there is inorganic growth, supplementing those numbers. If you kind of deconstruct it, from the top line, I mean, I think you can look at our, our signings volume, probably the last two quarters is the best trend given those are two quarters, where we reported Digital plus Interxion together for 100% of the quarters. In terms of P&L contribution and signings this quarter is obviously a strong $89 million, the prior quarter was the record $144 million the two of them kind of averaged out to low 100 to 115 or so. And coincidentally our revenue in the in the quarter is now ready to billion dollars. So that makes the math easy for what kind of revenue growth would be kind of going forward called in the low teens, obviously have to net our any churn. But I still think you arrive at a high single digits revenue number at the top line for the aggregate business. And that obviously nets down to that mid single digit square foot per share growth model. I think that headwind or to obviously think about is we are having the less spend this year, well, obvious things less T&E, delay in maintenance of OpEx, right that was going kind of just critical staffing. And assuming we are all fortunate to be in a better place versus this virus next year, we would assume a lot of those costs involve them in some capacity return. Breaking that going back to your first part of the question and looking at the revenue contributions was I don't I apologize, I don't have a segment by segment P&L in front of me. But I think I can get to the crux of it, we just look at our development schedule, which is just under 200 megawatts of capacity under constructions 56% pre leased, was returns, it creped up a little bit in our favor, this quarter relative to last quarter. And you can see, relative to our existing mix of business, a disproportionate share of our new capacity coming online is outside the U.S. relative to our installed base. And was not on that schedule given unconsolidated joint ventures Latin America further amplify that math based on the activity we are doing with Ascenty. So, obviously, our growth relative to the install base is much larger in India, in Latin America, and Asia Pacific, given the amount of new capacity that we signed, or bringing online in those markets relative to those bases. Relative and makes sense. Obviously the North American market is by far the most mature and is our largest portion of the pie. Thank you. Bill, do you want to take the first part and I can take the second part on expirations? Yes. Thanks, Bill. So, John, obviously, we are still in 2021 budget season, but I don't \u2013 I do look at kind of what's ahead in 2021 in terms of expirations as being very favorable in terms of volume mix, mark-to-market relative to our history, which I have shared for some time in some of our investment polls you have obviously hosted. If you kind of go to our expiration table and our supp, I look at them really two discreet buckets, the first one being call it that 01 megawatt category, with about 17% of our expirations in 2021, which is concentrated in our most highly connected, highest pricing power sticky albeit shorter term co-location contract bucket, pro forma for our combination about half of that, contracts coming due in that from legacy Interxion in the Western portfolio. So, we do expect to continue to see very strong pricing power there and the other half is really from our legacy North America co-lo portfolio. Overall, the markets are call it major metros, the London and New York cities, Frankfurt, San Francisco, Paris' in terms of the top markets coming due in that bucket. If you do look at what I think maybe was the emphasis of your question was kind of looking at the greater than a megawatt bucket that category is a little bit less than 8% as you can see on the supp and it has stepped down about 300 basis points from I think the peak was the third quarter of 18%, about over \u2013 just over 11%. Other than Ashburn in that category of expirations north of megawatt, no market other than Ashburn is greater than 1%. So, it's pretty diverse. And when you \u2013 I mean, I know it's a little bit of tough comparison, because we broaden our definition or change our definition slightly when we changed our disclosures a couple of quarters ago, but if you look at the rates per kilowatts, we look at our rates on expiring contracts having come down call it $15 or so per kilowatt in that time period from that prior peak, so setting us up for more favorable comparison. And then last but not least, as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, really the most concentrated expiration is just under 17 megawatts. Fortunately, it is in the Ashburn market, obviously our largest market and probably going to come at a better time given how well our team has done in leasing that market, 90 megawatts of the last 9 months really [indiscernible] organization on that. So I know I am certainly aware of customers right now that are anxiously, awaiting for that adjacent hall in their buildings and one of our connected campuses to become available. So, I think we will be able to weather our way through that. After that concentration, the next largest call it chunk would be less than 4.5 megawatts from any single customer and half of that expiration in Santa Clara, which is a really tight market for us. So, hopefully, I will provide a little bit more color and a little bit more about the [indiscernible] index as what we see ahead in the expirations. Hey, thanks, Matt. Maybe I will start off on hyperscale and I will toss it to Corey to speak to what I really thought was a really fantastic quarter when it came to enterprise, in particular. The \u2013 I mean, I think the hyperscale arena is something that we have excelled it for several quarters on and year. And I think I got a hunch, the competitor that you were referring to and I think I know it's a new leadership regime, but I would say that's, they have been a pretty fierce competitor for some time and aggressive, I have not seen a change in the posture from our day-to-day activities. I think it goes back to Digital, our platform has been able to win more than its fair share by coming to table with many ways to support these global hyperscalers whether it is being across numerous countries and markets, where they want us to grow or they are entering new markets, as Greg mentioned, side by side with them, where there is no truly established player to deliver to our capabilities, whether it is owning the adjacent land holdings that really allows us to future proof that growth and other things like making sure we are delivering the health and safety standards they require and making sure we are operating these facilities to the level that they require as if it was their own building and they have high expectations, I think Digital strives to exceed across the board. And I think you see that paying dividends in our results this last quarter, as I mentioned a second ago, our returns on our development, which are obviously weighted very much to our success within the hyperscale arena, actually went up across a couple of markets. And I think our success in the Ashburn market over the last few quarters, which is a hotly contested market, we have been able to be 100% pre-leased and rather full speaks to our success within that category for sure. So, I think that's kind of capsulated, I don't think there is no real dynamic shift in the competitive landscape. I would even say, the customers continue to mature and want to fin down their buying groups with more global partners, trusted infrastructure partners, like the Digital. But Corey maybe you could pick it up and really speak to what you \u2013 what we have been doing on the enterprise front."

            "content": "Absolutely. Thanks, Brendan for the question. No, it's a very unique formula that's been evolving over 10 years. And what it really does is it identifies key challenges facing enterprises today around the power requirements and the growth of data, so that we can design solutions to alleviate it. And so I think it's something that's unique to \u2013 Digital has unique assets to really solve for this kind of ever evolving problem that's being generated around the massive amounts of data being created. And so what's unique in the fact that Digital can allow customers to be in proximity to these data ocean that already exists within Digital Realty. And so they have the efficiencies of proximity to those data oceans and then we also provide, most recently, we just did a press release with path AI, where they can now be placed in a space where they can do analytics against that. And so the artificial intelligence trend that's happening in the industry is another underpinning element of what the Data Gravity Index represents is how customers can get in proximity to existing data, and then also do analytics through AI, with our unique asset class and product portfolio. And so, it's, a bit of a educational basis, that we really just want customers to be aware of the buyers dynamic and helps them solve for the burgeoning underpinning of data and the amount of data that's being grown. And I think, there is some great statistics out there where enterprises are going to be creating more and more of their own data in a very distributed manner. And so that is where, you see us being able to solve for not only in our traditional types of offering for these data, gravity problems and the burgeoning sets of data, but also some of the emerging edge workloads as well. And being able to tie all that together in our comprehensive set of product offerings and interconnection capabilities that is really what is underpinning that data, gravity kind of formulas, and just educating our customers of that, and I don't know Corey if you had anything else you wanted to touch upon?"

            "name": "Greg Wright",
            "content": "Sorry can you hear me now? Sorry about that, Jordan, okay sorry about that. Look I think the current market we are seeing today, which I don't think will surprise you seeing demand for the data center assets is really strong. This was previously really a niche asset class that I would say is going mainstream, or has gone mainstream, we are seeing more core like capital come into the sector, given the strong supply and demand fundamentals, and how well, the sector has performed during the pandemic. And both of those things, I think, combined with the credit worthiness of the customer base, all of those underlying elements drive for more core like capital. So look, we think you are going to continue to see a focus on data center and asset class this capital is capital that was previously invested in areas like offices or strip malls, and they started to migrate towards our space, I would say the environment is increasingly strong right now. So I mean, again, I think we will continue to see strong demand for the sector for quite some time, Jordan, on the M&A front. I think we have seen, we have seen some of these private portfolios trade, and they continue to trade at, decent levels, for example, I mean, you saw the asset that we sold last quarter in the Netherlands, we sold that and it was a non core asset. And we sold it for roughly a 6.7 cap rate. So, look, I think when you look at the overall environment right now, I would say there is a lot of interest and a lot of demand, which should bode well for the sector. Look I think there is yes, when you look at our global strategy, I think it's different for each market. Jordan, I think, look clearly in Asia right now, the way we have been growing is organic growth in our existing markets through land acquisition and development of near term in our existing land bank, right. I mean, we have rolled out products across seven of the APAC markets for example, we created the first network mutual data center in South Korea, we build out a campus of 100 plus Meg's in Tokyo. I think it was 5 or 10. Meg's in Osaka, we powered on a 50 megawatt building in Singapore, which is our third asset there. And that you also saw us announce our second site in Hong Kong. So clearly, when we look at, we look at Asia right now. it's a harder market to grow in, right because it's much more fragmented. But we like it. I think in terms of Europe and EMEA, I think you got to look at first thing you have look at is really our under construction pipeline, which we had in legacy Digital as well as the legacy Interxion but you look at markets like Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Zurich, Marseille Stockholm, we have assets in each of those markets under construction and really being driven by customer demand, as well as in those in that same European markets, organic growth, again, in existing markets through the land acquisition, or development of our existing land pipeline things places like Madrid, Frankfurt, Vienna in Paris, clearly in that market to, as you saw in this press release, we will have select dispositions in capital recycling. and you will see some redevelopment, right on our head, our campus that Bill mentioned, one of the beauties of that transaction is we get a, we are going to have redevelopment opportunity for several buildings that we did not previously own. I think when you keep going back then across the globe, and you look at South America, Andy mentioned in organics really been organic growth through land acquisitions and development in South America. Again, like all markets, that's really a customer driven approach. So you talk about incremental dollars, a lot of times where we go is dictated on where our customers want to be right. And I was \u2013 there are no two places that are better examples of that in both Chile and Mexico. Obviously, Brazil was the same. And then when you come back to the U.S., which is a more developed market, again, you will see development in select markets. But I think you will see continue to see acquisition of highly connected assets with what we would call established communities and interest in buildings such as the Westin. And again, there just like in Europe, you will see select capital recycling. So, when I say when you talk about incremental dollars, there is just a quick snapshot of how we are thinking about things across the globe. Hey Colby. How are you? Good. Well, I am not sure we have ever talked about a specific when we have we know we sold our one asset here in Europe here as we mentioned in the quarter in the Netherlands and we thought it was attractive capital for the asset so look I think when you think about our philosophy or approach when it comes to portfolio optimization I mean look we have talked and we remained focused on capital recycling and portfolio optimization, as I mentioned earlier we think it's a strong market right now to sell assets and once we sell those assets out of what for us again there are still good assets, these are just not core to Digital, our ability to then turn around and recycle those proceeds and deploy capital and other assets that further align with our strategy. Again, we want to do smart deals that maximize shareholder value. And that is where we are focused. So look, I think, over time, the guidance we gave, I guess it's been, it was an official guidance. But when we talked in the market, I guess it's been close to two years ago we said a few billion over a few years. We are about halfway through that now. And, but we have been pleased with the results so far. But again, the good news is, we do that we don't have to do this, we only do this when we think we are going to get fair pricing, and it makes strategic sense for us. Luckily, Andy and John in the team have the balance sheet with a change so that we are never forced to have to do asset sales, but we do them again, when it's a fair price and make strategic sense to Digital. It does 100%. I mean, we look at \u2013 we look and see what we are trading, a lot of times for these assets will run marketed processes. So, we get a true market check, but yes, it definitely factors into our thinking, where our stock is trading and what our redeployment strategy will be. Yes, you can be best believed it factors into our thought and approach."

Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our second quarter results. We delivered record bookings, more than 50% higher than our previous all-time high. We beat consensus by $0.07 driven by operational outperformance and the beat flowed through to upward revisions to guidance for revenue, EBITDA and core FFO per share. Third, we extended our sustainability leadership with the publication of our second annual ESG report and official recognition as the first Data center ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year. Last but not least, we further strengthened the balance sheet with the issuance of $645 million of common equity and \u20ac500 million of 10.5 year bonds at 1.25%. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. \nBill Stein: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global connected sustainable framework. Even though we haven't been physically sitting together for the past several months, we've made significant progress, strengthening each of these pillars. As John just mentioned, our second quarter bookings were more than 50% better than our previous all-time high but we're also more than double our previous trailing four-quarter average. We've now seen improvement for six consecutive quarters so we've clearly seen an acceleration in leasing velocity. We are admittedly a bigger organization today and the bar should be higher, following our combination with Interxion and as well Ascenty. But our second quarter results would have been a record for stand-alone digital realty as well. A world of remote everything has accelerated digital transformation initiatives and data center demand has benefited. But I believe these results also reflect the past several years of hard work, putting together a highly, attractive diversified global platform stability and capable leadership within our broader organization, coupled with solid execution. In particular, I would like to congratulate Corey Dyer and his entire sales team on their exceptional performance. We do expect the second quarter may be the high watermark for the full year and we don't necessarily expect to maintain this velocity every quarter but 2020 is clearly shaping up to be a banner year and we continue to capitalize on the acceleration of digital transformation strategies to build business resilience, which should continue to drive strong demand going forward. Our confidence in the forward outlook is reflected in the upward revisions to guidance for revenue, EBITDA and core FFO per share. Let's turn to the current environment on Page 3. The COVID-19 global pandemic has changed all our lives. Our hearts go out to the global communities we serve especially those that have been most impacted. We stand in solidarity with them. And our focus remains unchanged, keeping our employees, customers and partners safe. We are fortunate to have been as well prepared as we possibly could have been for this pandemic. Our 280 data centers in 45 metropolitan areas across 21 countries on six continents remain fully operational. We are grateful to be in a position where we can help industries communities and families around the globe continue to conduct business and stay in contact with each other during these uncertain times. We also want to again extend our gratitude to our employees in critical data center roles, who continue to come into work every day at our data centers around the world. They make possible the service and support that we provide our customers. Stepping back, our approach to managing and leading through the COVID-19 pandemic is guided by our ESG strategy depicted on page 4. We strive to lead the global data center industry in sustainable environmental performance. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment, while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and the broader society. We take this work seriously because it matters to our customers and because, we think it's the right thing to do. Environmental stewardship is incorporated into almost every aspect of our business. Sustainability is a top priority for us year round. The industry, governmental, organizations and the press are all taking note. In early April, we were honored to be the first data center provider to receive an EPA Energy Star Partner of the Year Award for Energy Management. In late April, we announced a wind energy agreement to supply approximately 30% of our power needs in the Dallas, Texas area with renewable energy. In early June, Interxion announced that it reduced its cooling system energy consumption by 20%, during the first year of an ongoing project with EkkoSense a data center optimization specialists. In mid-June, we were recognized as a green lease leader by the U.S. Department of Energy's better Buildings Alliance. We also published our second annual ESG report in mid-June, providing transparency on our ESG performance for 2019, as well as a comprehensive overview of our clean energy commitment, resource conservation, community engagement and philanthropic commitments, diversity and inclusion efforts and other sustainable business practices. In terms of our social efforts, since April, we have committed more than $1 million to partnering with charitable organizations globally combating the COVID-19 pandemic as well as efforts to fight racial injustice. We've also begun a doubling down on our employee matching gift program raising an additional $100,000 on top of our corporate efforts. We are doing our best to play a constructive, proactive role in advancing our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities that we serve around the world. Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 5. We continue to expand our global platform with groundbreaking announcements in multiple metros across APAC, the Americas and EMEA. In early July, we announced that we would be building our second data center in Hong Kong, allowing us to cater to diverse multi-site workloads. The facilities is expected to be built out and ready for global and regional customers by mid-2021. In mid-June, we broke ground on the first carrier-neutral facility in Korea with the Sangam Digital Media City in Northwest Seoul. We've seen significant pent-up customer demand for carrier-neutral offering in South Korea and we expect to be open for business in the fourth quarter of 2021. In early June, we announced that Ascenty our Latin American platform and joint venture with Brookfield infrastructure was entering Mexico with two diverse locations, anchored by long-term U.S. dollar-denominated multi megawatt agreements to support the growth of a leading global cloud provider. In April, Interxion broke ground on Interxion Paris Digital Park, a market expansion project in Paris with up to 85 megawatts of capacity. The first of four new data centers on this site will be Interxion's eighth in Paris and the first phase is scheduled to open in late 2021. In early July, Interxion announced the opening of the first phase of MRS3, its third data center in Marseille. Interxion's Marseille campus is one of the world's leading digital hubs for intercontinental data traffic with over 150 network service providers. The new facility will offer customers expanded access to the vibrant community in Marseille including numerous connectivity providers, digital media and cloud segments along with local as well as global enterprises. Last but not least, in mid-July, we announced that we had acquired the freehold to the land under Hanauer Landstra\u00dfe campus in Frankfurt. In addition, we are also under contract to acquire the Neckermann site a separate parcel within a kilometer of our existing campus that will support the development of up to 180 megawatts of IT capacity. We believe that we are creating significant value by combining the leasehold and freehold positions on one of the most highly connected campuses in Europe, while the adjacent expansion capacity provides runway to support customer growth in a key European metro for years to come. We also made two significant announcements advancing our collaboration with NVIDIA. In early May we announced the platform digital data Hub featuring NVIDIA DGX A100, POD infrastructure, a joint engineered solution that brings the world's first five Petaflops AI compute system to the enterprise to tackle high-performance computing challenges. Most recently in late July, we announced the joint development of an AI platform as a service offering on platform digital combining core scientific plexus AI workflow orchestrator with the NVIDIA data hub solution to address enterprise data lake performance constraints. These announcements validate our strategy of building a portfolio of engineered partner solutions to help enterprises accelerate digital transformation and remove data gravity barriers. Let's turn to Interxion on page 6. Integration is our top priority for 2020. And despite having to do the hard work of integration virtually during the pandemic, both teams have risen to the occasion. Andy will cover our customer wins in more detail, but we are already seeing the benefits of the significant cross-selling opportunities. We said last quarter, that we believe our combination with Interxion has the potential to change the global data center landscape. And in the interim we've received meaningful third-party validation of our view. In mid-July Cloudscene gave us the top billing in EMEA on their H1, 2020 data center ecosystem leader board, which ranks data center operators based on the composition of their facilities, service providers, network fabrics and cloud on ramps. The combined organization is well placed to meet the growing demand from cloud and content platforms, IT service providers and enterprises seeking co-location, hybrid cloud and hyperscale data center solutions. These are global long-term opportunities that we are ideally positioned to address. We've made steady progress on our corporate integration efforts. And by putting customers first, we've been able to seamlessly come together as one company. There will be more work to do over the next several quarters, but we are pleased with our progress to-date. Let's turn to the macro environment. As we are all aware the pandemic has pumped the brakes on the global economy. As you've heard me say many times before, data center demand is not directly correlated to job growth. And we are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers, both growing faster than global GDP growth and somewhat insulated from economic volatility. The current environment is accelerating enterprise's digital transformation strategies and data gravity is shaping the way enterprises will deploy, host and connect their infrastructure globally. According to IDC by 2025, enterprises will need to manage the integration of 175 zettabytes of data between their private infrastructure and public clouds. 451 Research conducted a global IT leader survey finding 87% of IT leaders need to maintain local copies of critical data at global points of presence to meet regulatory requirements. We see indicators of enterprises solving data gravity globally across our platform in the volume of new logos as well as expansion bookings within our enterprise vertical. Digital Realty was recently named the global leader in GigaOm's market radar for edge co-location, ranking our strategy as the only outperformer in the platform strategy sub segment a strong validation of our vision. The roadmap for platform digital is positioned to capture the enterprise opportunity. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our portfolio to meeting these needs, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, stakeholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.\nAndy Power: Thank you, Bill. Let's pick up here on page 9. As you may have seen from our supplemental reporting package, we have included Interxion's portfolio statistics in the supplemental this quarter. The highlights here on page 9 of the deck, give you a sense for the power of the combined platform. We also implemented the changes to our disclosure package we've telegraphed for the past several quarters. As we've said, we see the lines blurring between product types. And we believe the traditional distinctions have become less meaningful. The changes we've made to attempt to more closely align our disclosure with our customers' buying behavior. And the way we manage the business. We hope these disclosure enhancements are helpful. We aim to continuously improve the utility and transparency of our financial disclosures. And as always, we welcome additional input from analysts and investors. Let's turn to our leasing activity on page 10. We signed total bookings of $144 million, including an $18 million contribution from Interxion. The second quarter also included a $12 million contribution from Interxion. And along with the $22 million of network and enterprise oriented deals of a megawatt or less, accounted for nearly 25% of total bookings. The weighted average lease term was nearly 11 years. We landed a total of 124 new logos during the second quarter, including 38 sourced by Interxion again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. In terms of regions, demand was particularly robust in Northern Virginia, the New York Metro area, the Pacific Northwest and Mexico City in the Americas, as well as Frankfurt, Paris, London and Marseille, in EMEA. We leased 48 megawatts in Ashburn during the second the quarter, bringing our trailing four-quarter total to north of 100 megawatts. This activity has driven lease-up of active development, as well as existing inventory. We generated another 70 basis points of positive net absorption within our Northern Virginia in-service portfolio during the second quarter, up from 90% occupied at year-end to 93.8% as of June 30. And our Northern Virginia active development pipeline is now 100% pre-leased. Despite a somewhat crowded playing field in this market, we believe we certainly hit above our weight due to the strength of our global platform and sales force, the large and growing installed customer base seeking growth with adjacency on our connected campuses. And finally, our ability to future-proof our customers' growth with our strategic land holdings, providing the longest runway to support their future growth. While we have not yet begun to see meaningful improvement in Northern Virginia market rents, the available inventory has been rapidly absorbed and the pendulum is starting to swing back towards tighter availability and healthy competitive tension. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, the New York metro area was a standout not only is the top destination for network and enterprise oriented deployments during the second quarter, but also with the groundbreaking of our newest connected campus in Northern New Jersey where we will be developing a highly strategic, purpose-built, new infrastructure solution to help a leading data analytics provider optimize data exchange for their employees, customers and partners. In Phoenix, a leading top 12 [ph] university is leveraging our network-dense interconnection hub to optimize their hybrid IT controls. As we announced in mid-May, the Shadowserver Foundation, a nonprofit security organization working to make the internet secure for everyone is streamlining its data center network with Digital Realty in the Bay Area. Our Paris team persuaded EcoTel [ph], a French global IT service provider to migrate its infrastructure onto our platform by offering flexible commercials and demonstrating their value as a trusted partner. In London, we added Elite, a local fiber and managed service provider to our carrier community, which will attract other enterprises particularly in digital media who will use Elite for their services. In the Netherlands, DigiTen [ph] a fast-growing software company targeting the online gaming community chose our Skiple Right [ph] campus in Amsterdam at its worldwide hub due to low latency connections to the rest of Europe and beyond. A leading U.S. semiconductor manufacturing company deployed across multiple metros is demonstrating the diverse product solutions available on platform digital, leveraging fit-for-purpose interconnection and infrastructure capabilities across three unique sites on our Dallas-connected campus as well as the Amsterdam Business Park. Finally, Hash Power, a leading global content delivery company headquartered in Portugal harness the power of our combination with Interxion to rewire their network in Madrid and San Francisco. Turning to our backlog on page 12. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at a record high $251 million. The step-up from $122 million last quarter, reflects the $44 million backlog inherited from Interxion, as well as the $132 million of combined space and power leases signed offset by $47 million of combined commencements. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our historical average at a little less than seven months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 13. We signed $169 million of renewals during the second quarter in addition to new leases signed. We retained 88% of expiring leases above our long-term trend. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the second quarter was as a little less than six years, while cash rental renewals rolled down 2.8% in line with expectations. Aside from a few select supplies constrained regions in metro areas we have yet to see broad-based rental rate growth across most markets. However, we are continuing to make significant progress cycling through peak vintage renewals. The lion's share of our portfolio has recently been leased at current market rents and we are beginning to see tightening fundamentals and barriers to entry emerging in a growing number of markets around the world. As a result, we expect to see continued, gradual improvement on cash releasing spreads into 2020 and beyond. In terms of second quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy was down 150 basis points to 85.7% entirely due to consolidation of the embedded upside within the Interxion portfolio in our reported statistics for the first time. Same capital occupancy ticked up 20 basis points for the second quarter and same capital cash NOI growth was better-than-expected at negative 1.2% including a 60 basis point FX headwind.  As we indicated last quarter barring any unforeseen shocks, we are cautiously optimistic that we put the same-store low watermark for the cycle behind us. As a reminder Interxion and the Westin Building are not included in the 2020 same-store pool. But we expect both acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward.  Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on page 14. The U.S. dollar began to weaken in late May, but remained elevated relative to prior year average exchange rates for the full quarter. And FX represented roughly an 80 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line.  We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In terms of vertical concentration as you can see from the pie chart on the upper right, we have limited exposure to the businesses most directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Rent collections remain in line with our historical average and the sum total of customers who have reached out to request rent relief represent approximately 3% of total revenue.  In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have a roughly 30 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded.  In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was down 6% year-over-year, but $0.07 ahead of consensus as well as our internal forecast driven by a beat on the top line as well as operating expense savings primarily due to lower property level spending in the COVID-19 environment. A portion of the OpEx savings is likely timing related and represents more of a deferral rather than permanent savings. But the operational outperformance is obviously encouraging.  In terms of the quarterly run rate, as you can see from the bridge chart on page 15, we still expect to dip back down by $0.05 to $0.10 in the third quarter before rebounding in the fourth quarter and beyond.  In early July, we announced that we intend to redeem $800 million of senior notes due in 2022. We expect to fund the redemption by settling the $1 billion forward equity offering in the third quarter and the higher share count along with the expected catch up and deferred OpEx are primarily responsible for the step back down in the third quarter.  As you may have seen from the press release, we are raising the low end of the range for revenue EBITDA and core FFO per share guidance reflecting the second quarter outperformance as well as the strength of our bookings and backlog. We don't typically provide explicit AFFO per share guidance, but given the magnitude of the beat we wanted to offer some additional context.  As you may have seen from the earnings release, we are maintaining our full year guidance for non-cash rent adjustments of $20 million to $30 million as well as our recurring CapEx guidance of $220 million to $230 million, although we are admittedly trending towards the low end of the range. The implication here is that we do expect straight-line rental revenue will continue to moderate over the course of the year narrowing the delta between cash and GAAP and enhancing the quality of earnings. But we still expect to spend nearly the same recurring CapEx budget for the full year despite the lower spend year-to-date.  The bottom line on the AFFO per share outlook is similar to core FFO per share. The second quarter beat does flow through the full year forecast, but similar to the OpEx running through the P&L a portion of the recurring CapEx savings is likely timing related and represents more of a deferral rather than permanent savings. And we expect the quarterly run rate to dip back down in the second half. Last, but certainly not least. Let's turn to the balance sheet on page 16. The fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 4.6 times while net debt to adjusted EBITDA stood at 5.7 times as of the end of the second quarter. Pro forma for the settlement of the $1 billion forward equity offering net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA remains in line with our targeted range at just over 5 times while fixed charge coverage is just under 5 times. As a result of our proactive balance sheet management prior to the redemption of our bonds due in 2022, we have over $4 billion of liquidity to fund our capital spending including over $500 million of cash on the balance sheet as of June 30th, another $1 billion of equity coming in upon settlement of the forward equity offering and $2.5 billion of availability on our global revolving credit facilities.  The successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth.  As you can see from the chart, our weighted average debt maturity is over six years and our weighted average coupon is 3%. A little over 60% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. Over 95% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 98% of our debt is unsecured, provide the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 17, we have a clear runway with virtually no near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Andrea would you please begin the Q&A session?\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jon Atkins of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJon Atkin: Yes, good afternoon. My first question is on kind of leasing. I wondered given the strong performance if there's any kind of credence to the notion that this is sort of a pull forward and kind of your views on that topic and what we might kind of think about in terms of timing first half versus second half on demand. And related to that you did indicate Bill a little bit about pricing but I wondered are you within kind of the midpoint, low point, high point of your targeted yield range on the larger deals that you signed in Northern Virginia and other markets? And then I've got a follow-up. \nAndy Power: Hey thanks Jon, this is Andy. Maybe I'll start this one off and then hand it over to Corey to talk about 2Q and also kind of more forward-looking in the back half of the year. I can tell you we're always trying to pull forward deals as fast as possible at the end of every month and every quarter. So, I don't think there's anything particularly unusual about this quarter's results which we're certainly quite pleased with. I'd characterize it broadly back to something Bill kind of mentioned in the prepared remarks really we worked pretty hard for several years now putting together a highly attractive, highly connected diverse and truly global portfolio and platform. And that along with consistent, stable, and productive broad organizational talents and leadership and just solid execution is really kind of what contributed to numerous wins across the board whether it's the vault leasing signings, volume and well -- as well as mix. But I'll let Corey speak to a little bit more of what he saw in the quarter and then we can come back and talk about returns on the larger deals.\nCorey Dyer: Yes. Thanks Andy. And yes, I would say that it really was not a pull forward on COVID. I would tell you that we really had a great quarter that we've been building it Andy you mentioned it five or six consecutive quarters of growth. A lot of work that the team has been doing to build our platform, position us the correct way and really build trust with all of our customers. So, I wouldn't view this as a pull forward even though we pull deals forward all the time. This is really just the fruits of our labor playing out for us. But when you think about the segments that we actually had a ton of success with. So really good success across the hyperscalers. Again they value our global platform the geography all of the work that we've done for them with our trusted set of hands and our ops team that continues to provide support for them. And then really just a heritage of success and relationships that we've got going with them. From an enterprise and a network perspective, investing in the team, our sales team, our go-to-market, our global capabilities and then we improved our messaging and our positioning around the value. When we launched PlatformDIGITAL back in November, I think you're starting to see the fruits of that; customers media analysts really just a broad base of people that picked up on that. And then we've had a lot more success with our reps quarter-over-quarter. So, a lot more contribution from the reps. And then finally, I would just say that as we look ahead we think that we're going to really focus on the makeup of our quarter. How do we continue to grow new logos, enterprise wins, or communities of interest interconnection, colocation. And then finally, I think you're also going to see that some of the messaging we brought out has been really picked up and some of the trends that we're driving are starting to drive the industry and how they're thinking and the thinking in the industry around the importance of centers of data and around the importance of data gravity which requires some architecture reconsiderations. So, we expect to see more and more of the industry following our lead in these areas as well. I think I hit most of it Andy but go ahead if there's something else. \nAndy Power: Jon anything else or should we hit?\nJon Atkin: Yes. Yes, that's good. And then maybe the follow-up on Interxion and maybe the two of you again on the -- kind of on the integration side whether it's systems or IT integration, Andy, if there's any kind of future milestones to call out? And then for Corey as you have worked for global organizations in the past and picking up a very valuable kind of European operation anything you see going forward in ways that you can maybe optimize one obvious example is cross-connect pricing, which has seen some nice lift over the last couple of years on the part of one of your major peers?\nAndy Power: Maybe, Bill can start off on the integration front.\nBill Stein: Yeah, sure. Happy to take the -- take part of that, and I'll hand off to Andy. First of all, as you know, we closed the transaction on March 12. So just about the end of the last quarter, and I've said it on several occasions, but the integration of Interxion is our top priority for 2020. And I will tell you that, we are absolutely pleased with the progress made to date. Particularly given the impediments created by the pandemic. And I think we've done a good job of identifying synergies, expense synergies, and we're seeing potential revenue synergies as well, which is what we'd hoped, but didn't underwrite. As I mentioned last quarter, I'm very, very happy with the collaboration that's occurred within the two firms. David Ruberg and I speak several times a week. I had the utmost respect for what he brings to the data center business. And I do believe that, providing essential services during a global health crisis has had a unifying effect on the -- on both teams. Andy, I'll turn it over to you.\nAndy Power: Just to add a little bit more and then make sure we get to the heart -- the last part of your question about cross connects. Obviously, we're continuing to progress it despite the technology or not being able to do it in person hit some key milestones in the last several months of organizational announcements, and certainly, tiebacks to our global organization now working on some specific work streams, such as our technology and, how we bring together our IT systems and business processes, and in addition to kind of just the people front. So a lot of great wins there in terms of customer referrals. Cross-selling, multisite bidding and great progress, I think the piece you mentioned on the cross-connect Jon, obviously the commercial model for cross-connect has been different in Europe overall. Interxion over the last several years moved to a model where there is better commercialization of the cross-connect opportunity. That being said, I look at the combined global portfolio and call it roughly half of our cross-connects sit in EMEA yet, probably only closer to 20% of our interconnection revenue originates from that part of the world, which I think speaks to opportunity to really make sure our customers are getting value from our services overall, and there's an equitable commercial relationship for that value we deliver. Corey, I'll hand it over to you to wrap-up Jon's point, if you have anything else to add? \nCorey Dyer: No, I think you guys covered it well across the board unless there's something that Jonathan that you'd like.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJordan Sadler: Thanks and good afternoon. So first, I just wanted to speak to pricing a little bit. It seems this volume pretty significant. I noticed sequentially domestically or at least in the Americas pricing seems somewhat stable maybe even better despite the increased volume. But in Europe, it looks like pricing came down quite a bit. I know, maybe not a perfect comp, but I'm curious to what degree the success achieved in the quarter, a function of maybe more aggressive pricing, and maybe in that context, can you talk about what you're doing in terms of thinking in terms of returns and underwriting fee base?\nBill Stein: Sure, Jordan. So by and large, I would say we did not see much of a change in the pricing dynamic during the second quarter. And I think, what's evident of that is you can look at our returns on our development table, which I think barely moved in North America. I think a little -- it's a little bit tough quarter-to-quarter comparisons overall region-by-region, because the mix within a region can certainly sway that outcome. But when we stack it up internally and go market by market, deal size by deal size, we did not see a degradation in pricing. I think further evidence of that dynamic that, you may have seen in Ashburn, we're essentially added another 70 bps of net absorption after close to 300 prior quarter. And our development pipeline is 100% pre-leased for north of 50 megawatts in Ashburn. So when you have a dynamic when you're literally selling the last kilowatt or megawatt, or a project underway, you're certainly not trading price and you're certainly not doing it in a quarter that had this robustness of overall volume. In Europe, I think really just a mix. The prior quarter that we reported signings was just legacy digital. It didn't have a of larger scale deals this quarter. We had the contribution of Interxion, which had two good components. It had consistent more enterprise or network oriented smaller deals call it $10-plus million of that. And then it had some of the cloud computing nodes in a few markets, which are obviously multiple megawatt deals that if you compare EMEA quarter-over-quarter, you would just see a mix shift that would have changed the pricing. So, net-net still see pretty good stability in the pricing for what we saw in 2Q.\nJordan Sadler: Okay. And then sticking with pricing, the releasing spreads, I think in your prepared remarks you mentioned that you could see some gradual improvements in cash releasing spreads in the second half of 2020 and that dynamic seems to be tightening, but no change in the guidance. And along the same lines, you had a lot of success on the leasing front this quarter. And I would think that that might translate into increased capital spend or development spend and that also kind of remained the same. Any sort of commentary on those pieces?\nAndy Power: Sure. So, a few things. Maybe I'll take these in reverse order. The capital spend, just to remind everyone, we put out our guidance with the first quarter call. So that number really wasn't stale all the way back to the beginning of the year or the end of last year. So, I'd say our progress was somewhat anticipated, and quite frankly, it's the range of that number is in the hundreds of million dollars type of range. So, it's relatively bigger dollars. With regard to releasing, I would say in a broader sense, as a reminder, four of the past five prior years, we've had positive cash releasing spreads. This year, we guided to slightly negative. And we saw that in the second quarter. I would say the preponderance of the actual releasing was in the positive territory. But there was always an exception or two. The two exceptions here, which had good customer and commercial reasoning. One, we did a multi-site multi-geo network node for one of our large global account platform customers are very strategic to being part of our community type customer at an advantageous rate, given the attractiveness of that customer that you see kind of muting what typically is, call it, 2-plus percent increase on those zero to one megawatt-type deployments. And then on a little bit larger, I think just over a megawatt, we had an enterprise customer who did a simultaneous new signing with us in Europe in addition to a renewal with us in our Southeast region. So, when you parse those stats, you obviously see the negative on one piece, but it contributes to the positive elsewhere. We still think it's a strategic advantage to come to the table with that relationship and those incremental arrows in our quiver. But those were some things that contributed to it. And I don't think -- we didn't change the guidance on that quite, frankly, because it's probably one of the toughest to predict, because it depends when the customer wants to in the renewal of its contract, which can be early or can be very much down to the wire. So, it's -- you're handicapping not only the outcome or what period actually happens.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt Niknam: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Just one and one follow-up. First on enterprise, if you could share any sort of updates on your discussions with enterprises how demand is trending? And I guess the ability of PlatformDIGITAL to sustain this type of new logo growth? I think it's been about 120-plus new logos in the last two quarters. And then secondly follow-up, maybe for Andy. I think you've got about $3.07 a share in core FFO, first half of the year. I think the midpoint is about $6.05. And so, I'm just wondering can you talk about the puts and takes around incremental headwinds embedded in the outlook? And I guess more specifically the COVID-19 deferred OpEx that's driving about half of that drop you expect in 3Q? Thanks.\nBill Stein: Hey, Corey, maybe you could hit the first question, and then turn it back over to Andy.\nCorey Dyer: Yeah, sure. I'll take the first question on enterprise demand and what we're seeing and really what's driving it. And I would tell you that, -- Matt, thanks for the question. There's really been no silver bullet to it. We've had a great team supporting customers selling the platform and really building out our platform for us. And so, I would tell you it's a confluence of all these things coming together. We also had a great message that we -- I mentioned earlier, with platform digital and how that's being taken up by the industry and by customers. Our enhanced go-to-market approach has helped us. So, it's a lot of things we did, but we're also encouraged by our rep tenure. We've got better relationships. We've got customers having better relationships with our employees at longer. We've increased the number of reps making quota. We've got a ton more sites that are happening multi-site deals, multi-national deals, average deal size is up. So, from a demand perspective on enterprises, I really believe that the work we've been doing for the last five years and longer as well as the improved messaging and go to market puts us in a position where we're sustained for it. And then you add on to that the Interxion adjustment for us and what we've got from an interconnection and a networking capability and platform, that really puts us in a really, really well positioned spot to go and help enterprises as they navigate hybrid IT and then navigate through COVID and really feel like the breadth of customers, the breadth of our geography. There's going to be some customers in the enterprise world right now that are going to maybe slow down and I've heard that other places. I think because of how many we're helping and the solutions we're bringing to them to help them take advantage of hybrid IT or manage through COVID has really helped us kind of be a little bit insulated from that. Hope that helps Andy if you've got something else to add.\nAndy Power: No I think you nailed it on, but going to your second question Matt and welcome back. It's great to have you back cover digital. The question on the 307, why can't you just time that by 2, I don't know if you're colluding with our CEO, because he asked me that same question as well. I did have to remind him two things one of which you highlighted. One we are -- we have been doing some strategic capital management matching our sources and uses. And we are redeeming some notes, but all along to fund our capital spend we were planning to draw down on that $1 billion equity forward. So those shares from the equity forward are not in our share count for the first half of the year, they're going to come into the second half of the year, as we close out that in the third quarter. The other piece COVID-19, maybe I'll take a quick second to really give another tremendous thank you to our operations team globally, who have just gone above and beyond. We obviously with this crisis stayed fully operational, but we did scale down our staffing to make sure we put the safety of our customers, employees and partners first and foremost. So we delayed any type of maintenance spend or repairs and maintenance that could be delayed. And that spend we don't think it's going to be delayed forever. We're working in a safe manner to continue to maintain the equipment. And we expect some of that spend that was thought to be planned and happening in the first half of the year to resume in the second half of the year. \nMatt Niknam: Got it. Thanks Andy. And it\u2019s good to be back.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nSami Badri: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. My question is mainly to do with the re-leasing spreads on page 13 of your slide deck. And I know you've touched on elements of this already over the call. But I was just looking at the releasing spreads for leases size between zero and one megawatts. And I saw that the re-leasing spread is a little bit negative. And just given the dynamics we're seeing with such a big surge in demand coming specifically from enterprises and really the whole spectrum of constituents within the data center ecosystem as far as customers. I guess the perception would be that that would be a little bit more positive than it would be negative. And is the reason why it's negative potentially, because it may be a very large customer that's distributed into multiple locations? And in aggregate they got a discount for releasing. Or maybe you could just give us the puts and takes for customers in that specific size band what exactly is the case?\nAndy Power: Sure. Thanks Sami. You are correct. I mean, if you look historically that category would be closer to two-plus percent positive and if you look through what's happening in there there's numerous renewals happening in there on a very granular basis. The reponderence of those renewals are in the positive territory and you hit the nail on the head with -- there was a specific customer that renewed across three or four sites globally with network deployments so small deployments that add up to a larger sizable deployment. And that customer is not only incredibly important to our platform based on its size and scale, but also the value it brings to the other community participants and customers here at digital. So we wanted to make sure that we found the most fair potential outcome for that renewal to secure their future here with digital. It was a little bit on the longer side for that size of deployment in terms of renewal, it's always the rates a little bit longer -- lower rates or longer, but really more of a strategic renewal within that category that brought that into the slightly negative cash mark-to-market.\nSami Badri: Great. Thank you for that color. My other question has to do with the interconnection commentary that you gave earlier with EMEA representing about 50% of the portfolio's cross-connects, but only making up about 20% of revenues, I was hoping if you could give us maybe like a time frame or a trajectory some kind of like time-lapse on when you think you would be able to get that 20% of revenue mix maybe even closer to the 50% of revenues reflecting 50% of cross-connects in Europe just so we can understand like the pace or the cadence of transition you're having with your customers in EMEA?\nBill Stein: Sami, I'm going to hand this over to Chris to give you a little bit more color on the history and the trajectory of what we're doing. I'm not going to -- unfortunately, I won't sign up for a raising of the cross-connect prices time line on this call. I don't think David Ruberg would be too pleased with me if I did that. But I can tell you we're all about bringing value to our global customers now that total 4,000 customers, and making sure that we are commercially treated in a fair actable way for that value. But Chris maybe you can chime in a little bit about on the cross tech pricing and trajectory. \nChris Sharp: Absolutely, happy to do it Andy, thank you. And thanks for the question Sami. So you're absolutely correct. And I'll echo the sentiments throughout the call is that, we're very happy with the addition of Interxion into our broader portfolio. And I think what that represents to our customer base is, these are major epicenters of value for kind of current and future customers. And so really what's represented within that is, these communities of interest and the amount of interconnection that's been generated over the years that exists and that continues to grow. And I think one of the things that's very important to us and it's just shared vision within the Interxion team as well is that, there has to be a very balanced approach where we want to ensure that we don't cycle our customers' ability to grow and to continue to derive unique value out of this overall platform digital. And so I do think that you'll see a lot of our other existing customer base coming into Europe. So that platform effect will start to build that up. So I think over a period of time you'll definitely see that grow. But we're really conscientious of taking a balanced approach and having a very open platform so that we can allow customers to grow and continually expand. And I think a critical element of a lot of this is, not only the interconnection element but the multi-market and the unique advantage of our fit-for-purpose product where you can do both smaller colo and larger scale deployments. So the value of all of that coming together is the unique position that PlatformDIGITAL equips our customers with. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nErik Rasmussen: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to get some high level thoughts. We've obviously had a very strong first half of the year. We saw data before the quarter results started to come out for yourself and peers that Northern Virginia was -- and some of the U.S. markets had a pretty good absorption number so far. We're now seeing it with you guys as well, but what are your thoughts about -- what sort of could be creeping in, in that digestion and maybe us having sort of a repeat performance of what we saw in 2018 and maybe what's different this time around based on what you see today?\nAndy Power: Thanks Eric. So maybe I'll start off and hand it to Corey to kind of take more forward looking here. So I think a few things to your question. I think we had a really strong quarter in Ashburn, but I think we also had a really strong quarter in North America as well. Just a quick highlights New York City, metro area, top enterprise, network oriented smaller footprint deployments and connectivity, as well as a very strategic build-to-suit project on our Jersey connected campus. Out in the Pacific Northwest continued support of a hyperscaler on a highly strategic project in the Hillsboro market. Continued great wins in Chicago both on the connectivity side within the financial services vertical, as well as a different hyperscaler growing on one of our campuses in the Chicago area. So -- and I think that theme speaks to a little bit about your question. If you do rewind the clock back for a second with the digestion of the last go around I think our business did quite well which I think goes back to serving our customers across six continents, 20-plus countries, 44-plus metropolitan areas and having that globally diverse 4000-plus customer base, has allowed us to not be wed to a specific market or the ups and downs of one specific customer. And last I would say, I don't think each of these customers are on the exact same pacing. They're all at different places in their race or different points of their build-outs of their infrastructure which allows us to kind of help them when one customer is maybe taking a pause or looking to grow in different markets. But Corey please share your thoughts as well. \nCorey Dyer: Yes. I'll add to it Andy from an enterprise demand perspective. And I feel like you touched on a good bit of it. If you think about the power of our comprehensive global platform and where we're across a 4,000 global customers, 20 countries, 33 markets, 44 metros. And then you think through the new ideas and solutions we're bringing to our customers, at the same time with this combined Interxion and digital merger that we've done here. It puts us in a really good place to be able to address customers that need and want to continue buying those services. And it really moderates us from any kind of an exposure on an individual or an industry or a geo that's a little bit different. So we're pretty excited about where we are. I also feel like we've got the right kind of funnel and demand going. So we're going to be fine with growing to the cloud and continue to drive the demand that we're seeing and making investments in the data centers right? And so I think that it might be possible that some people see some new logo, sites or maybe a little slowdown there because you're trying to get into new sites that you're not familiar with. But like I said I think we've got enough customers. We've got enough breadth of our platform and our geography that I think we're insulated from it a good bit. And then when I just look at our pipeline going forward, it definitely supports the numbers that Andy has put forward to everybody. So I think we're into place. Hope that helps?\nBill Stein: Since 2018 we've added the Ascenty platform in Latin America. We've expanded materially in Europe with the acquisition of Interxion. We've added new markets in Asia specifically new development sites in Tokyo and so. And I would expect that in the second half of the year you're going to see additional contributions out of LatAm EMEA and Asia Pac. \nCorey Dyer: Yes, really good point. Thanks, Bill. \nErik Rasmussen: Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just my follow-up. You'd mentioned in I think in the press release there was some marginal construction delays. What sort of, impacts it has had on the business? And maybe can you comment on which regions that might stand out for that? And how are you going to resolve those? Thank you. \nAndy Power: Sure, Erik. So also another big thank you in kudos to our global construction team working day and night and weekends for sure in really crazy times. We -- well, I can't say we're able to make up time we've had from some delays from specific jurisdictions like a Toronto or Hillsboro from pulling labor off sites. I can say globally, we are in a really great spot going forward in terms of getting our teams back to work and delivering on our delivery times. The one -- the exception, I'd say -- not exceptional potential spot that we're keeping an eye on and we're not at full staffing in Singapore. Given the labor situation in that country we are not at 100% capacity, but we are continuing to make progress. That being said. So I think we're in a much better place today than we were when we reported on that topic a few months ago. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nEric Luebchow: Thanks very much for squeezing me in. So I know Bill you kind of said that any meaningful M&A is likely kind of off the table for the remainder of the year. But I just wanted to confirm kind of the plan is obviously integrating Interxion and kind of no near-term plans for any additional acquisitions. And to that degree if any opportunities did arise? Are there any kind of geographic reasons -- that would get into? \nAndy Power: Yes, Eric. No, I'll reiterate and reaffirm that Interxion remains our highest priority -- the integration of Interxion. We certainly are acquiring land parcels around the world for development. There may be very, very small tuck-in acquisitions but that's really for the purposes of new market expansion and/or maybe product enhancement or growing markets. Greg you might want to add to that? \nGreg Wright: No, Bill look I think, you've covered it. As Bill said we're going to -- we understand that integration is our top priority and we really have become more risk-averse in this environment. But as Bill said, we're procuring land where our customers need to be. And with facilities that really adhere to our PlatformDIGITAL and community of interest strategy. And as Bill said, we're selectively monitoring opportunities in the market where if an asset is strategic it will be smaller and we can create value and get the right return we'd probably do it. I think a lot of people are speculating in terms of acquisitions in this environment where we are with respect to distressed opportunities. And quite frankly, we haven't seen any distressed opportunities in this market yet, but we're actively monitoring things. Now longer term we may see some distressed opportunities for smaller more thinly capitalized companies that may have debt coming due. But a couple of things. Look we originally thought that as assets outside of the data spend and center space got hit harder than data centers and became relatively less expensive that we'd see private capital migrate towards those opportunities and decrease competition for data centers. However, what we're starting to see is that the private investment community have come to appreciate really the strong underlying secular trends in our space as well as the creditworthiness of our customers and the growth potential of the sector and they're becoming more educated and looking to invest. So look as Bill said, we have we're going to continue with that strategy and that's where we're focused right now. \nEric Luebchow: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Please go ahead. \nColby Synesael: Great. Thanks for getting me in. Two questions if I may. Maybe Greg just to stick with you. I was wondering if you could give us an update on potential asset sales if that's something that has been put more on the back burner because of COVID-19, if you're still moving forward and if there's still a possibility we could see something maybe this year? And then secondly with the U.S. government threatening to close down specific Chinese social media applications and websites, I believe that they've been a big purchaser of data center services over the last few quarters. I'm just curious how you guys get comfortable underwriting the risk of taking on a customer like that in light of all the geopolitical uncertainty that could be impacting them? Thank you. \nBill Stein: Greg, do you want to hit the first one and I can hit the second. \nGreg Wright: Yes, sure. Hi, Colby. How are you? \nColby Synesael: Good. Thank you. \nGreg Wright: Look I think with respect to asset sales, I think, it's fair to say that the level of chatter and activity has picked up quite a bit. But what the exact impact will be on pricing for larger deals is still hard to say. It's important to again note everything we were saying about investors, how they're viewing the sector in terms of the secular trends, the credit worthiness in the growth potential which clearly I think you're starting to see the data center space migrate to more of a core asset class that investors particularly through this pandemic are starting to appreciate. As you know we just sold the asset in the middle of the pandemic in Europe and we got the pricing we expected. We continue to believe that our multiyear guidance of a few billion dollars over the few years of noncore assets or noncore markets. We still think that's the right guidance. We've already done about $1.4 billion of that. It's important to note that we're fully funded and we'll continue to recycle capital opportunistically, when it makes sense and the price is right. But it's always good to be in a position where you have no sense of urgency, if you can't get fair value. And I think you probably also noted we gave guidance of $600 million to $1 billion earlier in the year. And with the Mapletree transaction itself, we've already achieved the bottom end of that range. Again, so why we're not expecting -- we weren't expecting COVID-19, but we are comfortable and confident where we are with respect to our capital recycling activity. So -- but look it's going to continue to change daily and we'll continue to monitor it, but we feel like we're in a good position. \nBill Stein: And then Colby on your second one, obviously, doesn't have to be specific to a headline in the news, we obviously look at various risks and that's part of our job and our business evaluating risk and return. When it comes to Asia Pacific in general, I mean, I think when we go back to is one we're a global company across 20-plus countries, six continents in numerous markets. And we have a global customer base 4,000-plus customers and rapidly expanding that 124 outages this quarter. I think the diversity of our offering and the diversity of our revenue streams give us a lot of comfort in evaluating risk. If you look at our top customer list, our top 20 customers totaled just under 48% of our annualized recurring revenue. And if you go down that list you got to go past number 19 to find a non-U.S. company just given the size and scale of some of the top cloud service providers and hyperscalers that we're doing business with. Or the number of locations we're doing business with some of the network providers. So you kind of get to like the 1% or less territory when you might run into a customer. So that's a long-winded way of saying we want to welcome all the right customers into our fold. And I think we do the right things in evaluating the right risk, but I think the diversity is what insulates us or protects us to any type of exogenous shots.\nColby Synesael: Great. Thank you, and congrats on the strong result.\nBill Stein: Thank you.\nAndy Power: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein for his closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nBill Stein: Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the second quarter, as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we further strengthened our connections with our customers prioritizing health and safety while maintaining service levels and reaching record highs in our bookings and backlog. Two, we delivered solid current period financial results beating consensus, beating our internal forecast and raising guidance. Third, we also underscored our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders with the publication of our second annual ESG report and our official recognition as the first Data center ENERGY STAR partner of the year. And last, but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet with excellent execution on the raising of $1.2 billion of long-term capital. I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family and particularly our frontline team members in critical data center facility roles who have kept the digital world turning in the midst of a global pandemic. I hope all of you stay safe and healthy. We hope to see many of you in person again soon. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for joining today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Corey Dyer",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks Andy. And yes, I would say that it really was not a pull forward on COVID. I would tell you that we really had a great quarter that we've been building it Andy you mentioned it five or six consecutive quarters of growth. A lot of work that the team has been doing to build our platform, position us the correct way and really build trust with all of our customers. So, I wouldn't view this as a pull forward even though we pull deals forward all the time. This is really just the fruits of our labor playing out for us. But when you think about the segments that we actually had a ton of success with. So really good success across the hyperscalers. Again they value our global platform the geography all of the work that we've done for them with our trusted set of hands and our ops team that continues to provide support for them. And then really just a heritage of success and relationships that we've got going with them. From an enterprise and a network perspective, investing in the team, our sales team, our go-to-market, our global capabilities and then we improved our messaging and our positioning around the value. When we launched PlatformDIGITAL back in November, I think you're starting to see the fruits of that; customers media analysts really just a broad base of people that picked up on that. And then we've had a lot more success with our reps quarter-over-quarter. So, a lot more contribution from the reps. And then finally, I would just say that as we look ahead we think that we're going to really focus on the makeup of our quarter. How do we continue to grow new logos, enterprise wins, or communities of interest interconnection, colocation. And then finally, I think you're also going to see that some of the messaging we brought out has been really picked up and some of the trends that we're driving are starting to drive the industry and how they're thinking and the thinking in the industry around the importance of centers of data and around the importance of data gravity which requires some architecture reconsiderations. So, we expect to see more and more of the industry following our lead in these areas as well. I think I hit most of it Andy but go ahead if there's something else. No, I think you guys covered it well across the board unless there's something that Jonathan that you'd like. Yeah, sure. I'll take the first question on enterprise demand and what we're seeing and really what's driving it. And I would tell you that, -- Matt, thanks for the question. There's really been no silver bullet to it. We've had a great team supporting customers selling the platform and really building out our platform for us.

            "content": "Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global connected sustainable framework. Even though we haven't been physically sitting together for the past several months, we've made significant progress, strengthening each of these pillars. As John just mentioned, our second quarter bookings were more than 50% better than our previous all-time high but we're also more than double our previous trailing four-quarter average. We've now seen improvement for six consecutive quarters so we've clearly seen an acceleration in leasing velocity. We are admittedly a bigger organization today and the bar should be higher, following our combination with Interxion and as well Ascenty. But our second quarter results would have been a record for stand-alone digital realty as well. A world of remote everything has accelerated digital transformation initiatives and data center demand has benefited. But I believe these results also reflect the past several years of hard work, putting together a highly, attractive diversified global platform stability and capable leadership within our broader organization, coupled with solid execution. In particular, I would like to congratulate Corey Dyer and his entire sales team on their exceptional performance. We do expect the second quarter may be the high watermark for the full year and we don't necessarily expect to maintain this velocity every quarter but 2020 is clearly shaping up to be a banner year and we continue to capitalize on the acceleration of digital transformation strategies to build business resilience, which should continue to drive strong demand going forward. Our confidence in the forward outlook is reflected in the upward revisions to guidance for revenue, EBITDA and core FFO per share. Let's turn to the current environment on Page 3. The COVID-19 global pandemic has changed all our lives. Our hearts go out to the global communities we serve especially those that have been most impacted. We stand in solidarity with them. And our focus remains unchanged, keeping our employees, customers and partners safe. We are fortunate to have been as well prepared as we possibly could have been for this pandemic. Our 280 data centers in 45 metropolitan areas across 21 countries on six continents remain fully operational. We are grateful to be in a position where we can help industries communities and families around the globe continue to conduct business and stay in contact with each other during these uncertain times. We also want to again extend our gratitude to our employees in critical data center roles, who continue to come into work every day at our data centers around the world. They make possible the service and support that we provide our customers. Stepping back, our approach to managing and leading through the COVID-19 pandemic is guided by our ESG strategy depicted on page 4. We strive to lead the global data center industry in sustainable environmental performance. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment, while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and the broader society. We take this work seriously because it matters to our customers and because, we think it's the right thing to do. Environmental stewardship is incorporated into almost every aspect of our business. Sustainability is a top priority for us year round. The industry, governmental, organizations and the press are all taking note. In early April, we were honored to be the first data center provider to receive an EPA Energy Star Partner of the Year Award for Energy Management. In late April, we announced a wind energy agreement to supply approximately 30% of our power needs in the Dallas, Texas area with renewable energy. In early June, Interxion announced that it reduced its cooling system energy consumption by 20%, during the first year of an ongoing project with EkkoSense a data center optimization specialists. In mid-June, we were recognized as a green lease leader by the U.S. Department of Energy's better Buildings Alliance. We also published our second annual ESG report in mid-June, providing transparency on our ESG performance for 2019, as well as a comprehensive overview of our clean energy commitment, resource conservation, community engagement and philanthropic commitments, diversity and inclusion efforts and other sustainable business practices. In terms of our social efforts, since April, we have committed more than $1 million to partnering with charitable organizations globally combating the COVID-19 pandemic as well as efforts to fight racial injustice. We've also begun a doubling down on our employee matching gift program raising an additional $100,000 on top of our corporate efforts. We are doing our best to play a constructive, proactive role in advancing our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities that we serve around the world. Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 5. We continue to expand our global platform with groundbreaking announcements in multiple metros across APAC, the Americas and EMEA. In early July, we announced that we would be building our second data center in Hong Kong, allowing us to cater to diverse multi-site workloads. The facilities is expected to be built out and ready for global and regional customers by mid-2021. In mid-June, we broke ground on the first carrier-neutral facility in Korea with the Sangam Digital Media City in Northwest Seoul. We've seen significant pent-up customer demand for carrier-neutral offering in South Korea and we expect to be open for business in the fourth quarter of 2021. In early June, we announced that Ascenty our Latin American platform and joint venture with Brookfield infrastructure was entering Mexico with two diverse locations, anchored by long-term U.S. dollar-denominated multi megawatt agreements to support the growth of a leading global cloud provider. In April, Interxion broke ground on Interxion Paris Digital Park, a market expansion project in Paris with up to 85 megawatts of capacity. The first of four new data centers on this site will be Interxion's eighth in Paris and the first phase is scheduled to open in late 2021. In early July, Interxion announced the opening of the first phase of MRS3, its third data center in Marseille. Interxion's Marseille campus is one of the world's leading digital hubs for intercontinental data traffic with over 150 network service providers. The new facility will offer customers expanded access to the vibrant community in Marseille including numerous connectivity providers, digital media and cloud segments along with local as well as global enterprises. Last but not least, in mid-July, we announced that we had acquired the freehold to the land under Hanauer Landstra\u00dfe campus in Frankfurt. In addition, we are also under contract to acquire the Neckermann site a separate parcel within a kilometer of our existing campus that will support the development of up to 180 megawatts of IT capacity. We believe that we are creating significant value by combining the leasehold and freehold positions on one of the most highly connected campuses in Europe, while the adjacent expansion capacity provides runway to support customer growth in a key European metro for years to come. We also made two significant announcements advancing our collaboration with NVIDIA. In early May we announced the platform digital data Hub featuring NVIDIA DGX A100, POD infrastructure, a joint engineered solution that brings the world's first five Petaflops AI compute system to the enterprise to tackle high-performance computing challenges. Most recently in late July, we announced the joint development of an AI platform as a service offering on platform digital combining core scientific plexus AI workflow orchestrator with the NVIDIA data hub solution to address enterprise data lake performance constraints. These announcements validate our strategy of building a portfolio of engineered partner solutions to help enterprises accelerate digital transformation and remove data gravity barriers. Let's turn to Interxion on page 6. Integration is our top priority for 2020. And despite having to do the hard work of integration virtually during the pandemic, both teams have risen to the occasion. Andy will cover our customer wins in more detail, but we are already seeing the benefits of the significant cross-selling opportunities. We said last quarter, that we believe our combination with Interxion has the potential to change the global data center landscape. And in the interim we've received meaningful third-party validation of our view. In mid-July Cloudscene gave us the top billing in EMEA on their H1, 2020 data center ecosystem leader board, which ranks data center operators based on the composition of their facilities, service providers, network fabrics and cloud on ramps. The combined organization is well placed to meet the growing demand from cloud and content platforms, IT service providers and enterprises seeking co-location, hybrid cloud and hyperscale data center solutions. These are global long-term opportunities that we are ideally positioned to address. We've made steady progress on our corporate integration efforts. And by putting customers first, we've been able to seamlessly come together as one company. There will be more work to do over the next several quarters, but we are pleased with our progress to-date. Let's turn to the macro environment. As we are all aware the pandemic has pumped the brakes on the global economy. As you've heard me say many times before, data center demand is not directly correlated to job growth. And we are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers, both growing faster than global GDP growth and somewhat insulated from economic volatility. The current environment is accelerating enterprise's digital transformation strategies and data gravity is shaping the way enterprises will deploy, host and connect their infrastructure globally. According to IDC by 2025, enterprises will need to manage the integration of 175 zettabytes of data between their private infrastructure and public clouds. 451 Research conducted a global IT leader survey finding 87% of IT leaders need to maintain local copies of critical data at global points of presence to meet regulatory requirements. We see indicators of enterprises solving data gravity globally across our platform in the volume of new logos as well as expansion bookings within our enterprise vertical. Digital Realty was recently named the global leader in GigaOm's market radar for edge co-location, ranking our strategy as the only outperformer in the platform strategy sub segment a strong validation of our vision. The roadmap for platform digital is positioned to capture the enterprise opportunity. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our portfolio to meeting these needs, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, stakeholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Yeah, sure. Happy to take the -- take part of that, and I'll hand off to Andy. First of all, as you know, we closed the transaction on March 12. So just about the end of the last quarter, and I've said it on several occasions, but the integration of Interxion is our top priority for 2020. And I will tell you that, we are absolutely pleased with the progress made to date. Particularly given the impediments created by the pandemic. And I think we've done a good job of identifying synergies, expense synergies, and we're seeing potential revenue synergies as well, which is what we'd hoped, but didn't underwrite. As I mentioned last quarter, I'm very, very happy with the collaboration that's occurred within the two firms. David Ruberg and I speak several times a week. I had the utmost respect for what he brings to the data center business. And I do believe that, providing essential services during a global health crisis has had a unifying effect on the -- on both teams. Andy, I'll turn it over to you. Sure, Jordan. So by and large, I would say we did not see much of a change in the pricing dynamic during the second quarter. And I think, what's evident of that is you can look at our returns on our development table, which I think barely moved in North America. I think a little -- it's a little bit tough quarter-to-quarter comparisons overall region-by-region, because the mix within a region can certainly sway that outcome. But when we stack it up internally and go market by market, deal size by deal size, we did not see a degradation in pricing. I think further evidence of that dynamic that, you may have seen in Ashburn, we're essentially added another 70 bps of net absorption after close to 300 prior quarter. And our development pipeline is 100% pre-leased for north of 50 megawatts in Ashburn. So when you have a dynamic when you're literally selling the last kilowatt or megawatt, or a project underway, you're certainly not trading price and you're certainly not doing it in a quarter that had this robustness of overall volume. In Europe, I think really just a mix. The prior quarter that we reported signings was just legacy digital. It didn't have a of larger scale deals this quarter. We had the contribution of Interxion, which had two good components. It had consistent more enterprise or network oriented smaller deals call it $10-plus million of that. And then it had some of the cloud computing nodes in a few markets, which are obviously multiple megawatt deals that if you compare EMEA quarter-over-quarter, you would just see a mix shift that would have changed the pricing. So, net-net still see pretty good stability in the pricing for what we saw in 2Q. Hey, Corey, maybe you could hit the first question, and then turn it back over to Andy. Sami, I'm going to hand this over to Chris to give you a little bit more color on the history and the trajectory of what we're doing. I'm not going to -- unfortunately, I won't sign up for a raising of the cross-connect prices time line on this call. I don't think David Ruberg would be too pleased with me if I did that. But I can tell you we're all about bringing value to our global customers now that total 4,000 customers, and making sure that we are commercially treated in a fair actable way for that value. But Chris maybe you can chime in a little bit about on the cross tech pricing and trajectory. Since 2018 we've added the Ascenty platform in Latin America. We've expanded materially in Europe with the acquisition of Interxion. We've added new markets in Asia specifically new development sites in Tokyo and so. And I would expect that in the second half of the year you're going to see additional contributions out of LatAm EMEA and Asia Pac. Greg, do you want to hit the first one and I can hit the second. And then Colby on your second one, obviously, doesn't have to be specific to a headline in the news, we obviously look at various risks and that's part of our job and our business evaluating risk and return. When it comes to Asia Pacific in general, I mean, I think when we go back to is one we're a global company across 20-plus countries, six continents in numerous markets. And we have a global customer base 4,000-plus customers and rapidly expanding that 124 outages this quarter. I think the diversity of our offering and the diversity of our revenue streams give us a lot of comfort in evaluating risk. If you look at our top customer list, our top 20 customers totaled just under 48% of our annualized recurring revenue. And if you go down that list you got to go past number 19 to find a non-U.S. company just given the size and scale of some of the top cloud service providers and hyperscalers that we're doing business with. Or the number of locations we're doing business with some of the network providers. So you kind of get to like the 1% or less territory when you might run into a customer. So that's a long-winded way of saying we want to welcome all the right customers into our fold. And I think we do the right things in evaluating the right risk, but I think the diversity is what insulates us or protects us to any type of exogenous shots. Thank you. Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the second quarter, as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we further strengthened our connections with our customers prioritizing health and safety while maintaining service levels and reaching record highs in our bookings and backlog. Two, we delivered solid current period financial results beating consensus, beating our internal forecast and raising guidance. Third, we also underscored our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders with the publication of our second annual ESG report and our official recognition as the first Data center ENERGY STAR partner of the year. And last, but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet with excellent execution on the raising of $1.2 billion of long-term capital. I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family and particularly our frontline team members in critical data center facility roles who have kept the digital world turning in the midst of a global pandemic. I hope all of you stay safe and healthy. We hope to see many of you in person again soon. Thank you."

            "name": "Andy Power",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Let's pick up here on page 9. As you may have seen from our supplemental reporting package, we have included Interxion's portfolio statistics in the supplemental this quarter. The highlights here on page 9 of the deck, give you a sense for the power of the combined platform. We also implemented the changes to our disclosure package we've telegraphed for the past several quarters. As we've said, we see the lines blurring between product types. And we believe the traditional distinctions have become less meaningful. The changes we've made to attempt to more closely align our disclosure with our customers' buying behavior. And the way we manage the business. We hope these disclosure enhancements are helpful. We aim to continuously improve the utility and transparency of our financial disclosures. And as always, we welcome additional input from analysts and investors. Let's turn to our leasing activity on page 10. We signed total bookings of $144 million, including an $18 million contribution from Interxion. The second quarter also included a $12 million contribution from Interxion. And along with the $22 million of network and enterprise oriented deals of a megawatt or less, accounted for nearly 25% of total bookings. The weighted average lease term was nearly 11 years. We landed a total of 124 new logos during the second quarter, including 38 sourced by Interxion again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. In terms of regions, demand was particularly robust in Northern Virginia, the New York Metro area, the Pacific Northwest and Mexico City in the Americas, as well as Frankfurt, Paris, London and Marseille, in EMEA. We leased 48 megawatts in Ashburn during the second the quarter, bringing our trailing four-quarter total to north of 100 megawatts. This activity has driven lease-up of active development, as well as existing inventory. We generated another 70 basis points of positive net absorption within our Northern Virginia in-service portfolio during the second quarter, up from 90% occupied at year-end to 93.8% as of June 30. And our Northern Virginia active development pipeline is now 100% pre-leased. Despite a somewhat crowded playing field in this market, we believe we certainly hit above our weight due to the strength of our global platform and sales force, the large and growing installed customer base seeking growth with adjacency on our connected campuses. And finally, our ability to future-proof our customers' growth with our strategic land holdings, providing the longest runway to support their future growth. While we have not yet begun to see meaningful improvement in Northern Virginia market rents, the available inventory has been rapidly absorbed and the pendulum is starting to swing back towards tighter availability and healthy competitive tension. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, the New York metro area was a standout not only is the top destination for network and enterprise oriented deployments during the second quarter, but also with the groundbreaking of our newest connected campus in Northern New Jersey where we will be developing a highly strategic, purpose-built, new infrastructure solution to help a leading data analytics provider optimize data exchange for their employees, customers and partners. In Phoenix, a leading top 12 [ph] university is leveraging our network-dense interconnection hub to optimize their hybrid IT controls. As we announced in mid-May, the Shadowserver Foundation, a nonprofit security organization working to make the internet secure for everyone is streamlining its data center network with Digital Realty in the Bay Area. Our Paris team persuaded EcoTel [ph], a French global IT service provider to migrate its infrastructure onto our platform by offering flexible commercials and demonstrating their value as a trusted partner. In London, we added Elite, a local fiber and managed service provider to our carrier community, which will attract other enterprises particularly in digital media who will use Elite for their services. In the Netherlands, DigiTen [ph] a fast-growing software company targeting the online gaming community chose our Skiple Right [ph] campus in Amsterdam at its worldwide hub due to low latency connections to the rest of Europe and beyond. A leading U.S. semiconductor manufacturing company deployed across multiple metros is demonstrating the diverse product solutions available on platform digital, leveraging fit-for-purpose interconnection and infrastructure capabilities across three unique sites on our Dallas-connected campus as well as the Amsterdam Business Park. Finally, Hash Power, a leading global content delivery company headquartered in Portugal harness the power of our combination with Interxion to rewire their network in Madrid and San Francisco. Turning to our backlog on page 12. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at a record high $251 million. The step-up from $122 million last quarter, reflects the $44 million backlog inherited from Interxion, as well as the $132 million of combined space and power leases signed offset by $47 million of combined commencements. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our historical average at a little less than seven months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 13. We signed $169 million of renewals during the second quarter in addition to new leases signed. We retained 88% of expiring leases above our long-term trend. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the second quarter was as a little less than six years, while cash rental renewals rolled down 2.8% in line with expectations. Aside from a few select supplies constrained regions in metro areas we have yet to see broad-based rental rate growth across most markets. However, we are continuing to make significant progress cycling through peak vintage renewals. The lion's share of our portfolio has recently been leased at current market rents and we are beginning to see tightening fundamentals and barriers to entry emerging in a growing number of markets around the world. As a result, we expect to see continued, gradual improvement on cash releasing spreads into 2020 and beyond. In terms of second quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy was down 150 basis points to 85.7% entirely due to consolidation of the embedded upside within the Interxion portfolio in our reported statistics for the first time. Same capital occupancy ticked up 20 basis points for the second quarter and same capital cash NOI growth was better-than-expected at negative 1.2% including a 60 basis point FX headwind.  As we indicated last quarter barring any unforeseen shocks, we are cautiously optimistic that we put the same-store low watermark for the cycle behind us. As a reminder Interxion and the Westin Building are not included in the 2020 same-store pool. But we expect both acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward.  Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on page 14. The U.S. dollar began to weaken in late May, but remained elevated relative to prior year average exchange rates for the full quarter. And FX represented roughly an 80 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line.  We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In terms of vertical concentration as you can see from the pie chart on the upper right, we have limited exposure to the businesses most directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Rent collections remain in line with our historical average and the sum total of customers who have reached out to request rent relief represent approximately 3% of total revenue.  In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have a roughly 30 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded.  In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was down 6% year-over-year, but $0.07 ahead of consensus as well as our internal forecast driven by a beat on the top line as well as operating expense savings primarily due to lower property level spending in the COVID-19 environment. A portion of the OpEx savings is likely timing related and represents more of a deferral rather than permanent savings. But the operational outperformance is obviously encouraging.  In terms of the quarterly run rate, as you can see from the bridge chart on page 15, we still expect to dip back down by $0.05 to $0.10 in the third quarter before rebounding in the fourth quarter and beyond.  In early July, we announced that we intend to redeem $800 million of senior notes due in 2022. We expect to fund the redemption by settling the $1 billion forward equity offering in the third quarter and the higher share count along with the expected catch up and deferred OpEx are primarily responsible for the step back down in the third quarter.  As you may have seen from the press release, we are raising the low end of the range for revenue EBITDA and core FFO per share guidance reflecting the second quarter outperformance as well as the strength of our bookings and backlog. We don't typically provide explicit AFFO per share guidance, but given the magnitude of the beat we wanted to offer some additional context.  As you may have seen from the earnings release, we are maintaining our full year guidance for non-cash rent adjustments of $20 million to $30 million as well as our recurring CapEx guidance of $220 million to $230 million, although we are admittedly trending towards the low end of the range. The implication here is that we do expect straight-line rental revenue will continue to moderate over the course of the year narrowing the delta between cash and GAAP and enhancing the quality of earnings. But we still expect to spend nearly the same recurring CapEx budget for the full year despite the lower spend year-to-date.  The bottom line on the AFFO per share outlook is similar to core FFO per share. The second quarter beat does flow through the full year forecast, but similar to the OpEx running through the P&L a portion of the recurring CapEx savings is likely timing related and represents more of a deferral rather than permanent savings. And we expect the quarterly run rate to dip back down in the second half. Last, but certainly not least. Let's turn to the balance sheet on page 16. The fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 4.6 times while net debt to adjusted EBITDA stood at 5.7 times as of the end of the second quarter. Pro forma for the settlement of the $1 billion forward equity offering net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA remains in line with our targeted range at just over 5 times while fixed charge coverage is just under 5 times. As a result of our proactive balance sheet management prior to the redemption of our bonds due in 2022, we have over $4 billion of liquidity to fund our capital spending including over $500 million of cash on the balance sheet as of June 30th, another $1 billion of equity coming in upon settlement of the forward equity offering and $2.5 billion of availability on our global revolving credit facilities.  The successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth.  As you can see from the chart, our weighted average debt maturity is over six years and our weighted average coupon is 3%. A little over 60% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. Over 95% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 98% of our debt is unsecured, provide the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 17, we have a clear runway with virtually no near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Andrea would you please begin the Q&A session? Hey thanks Jon, this is Andy. Maybe I'll start this one off and then hand it over to Corey to talk about 2Q and also kind of more forward-looking in the back half of the year. I can tell you we're always trying to pull forward deals as fast as possible at the end of every month and every quarter. So, I don't think there's anything particularly unusual about this quarter's results which we're certainly quite pleased with. I'd characterize it broadly back to something Bill kind of mentioned in the prepared remarks really we worked pretty hard for several years now putting together a highly attractive, highly connected diverse and truly global portfolio and platform. And that along with consistent, stable, and productive broad organizational talents and leadership and just solid execution is really kind of what contributed to numerous wins across the board whether it's the vault leasing signings, volume and well -- as well as mix. But I'll let Corey speak to a little bit more of what he saw in the quarter and then we can come back and talk about returns on the larger deals. Jon anything else or should we hit? Maybe, Bill can start off on the integration front. Just to add a little bit more and then make sure we get to the heart -- the last part of your question about cross connects. Obviously, we're continuing to progress it despite the technology or not being able to do it in person hit some key milestones in the last several months of organizational announcements, and certainly, tiebacks to our global organization now working on some specific work streams, such as our technology and, how we bring together our IT systems and business processes, and in addition to kind of just the people front. So a lot of great wins there in terms of customer referrals. Cross-selling, multisite bidding and great progress, I think the piece you mentioned on the cross-connect Jon, obviously the commercial model for cross-connect has been different in Europe overall. Interxion over the last several years moved to a model where there is better commercialization of the cross-connect opportunity. That being said, I look at the combined global portfolio and call it roughly half of our cross-connects sit in EMEA yet, probably only closer to 20% of our interconnection revenue originates from that part of the world, which I think speaks to opportunity to really make sure our customers are getting value from our services overall, and there's an equitable commercial relationship for that value we deliver. Corey, I'll hand it over to you to wrap-up Jon's point, if you have anything else to add? Sure. So, a few things. Maybe I'll take these in reverse order. The capital spend, just to remind everyone, we put out our guidance with the first quarter call. So that number really wasn't stale all the way back to the beginning of the year or the end of last year. So, I'd say our progress was somewhat anticipated, and quite frankly, it's the range of that number is in the hundreds of million dollars type of range. So, it's relatively bigger dollars. With regard to releasing, I would say in a broader sense, as a reminder, four of the past five prior years, we've had positive cash releasing spreads. This year, we guided to slightly negative. And we saw that in the second quarter. I would say the preponderance of the actual releasing was in the positive territory. But there was always an exception or two. The two exceptions here, which had good customer and commercial reasoning. One, we did a multi-site multi-geo network node for one of our large global account platform customers are very strategic to being part of our community type customer at an advantageous rate, given the attractiveness of that customer that you see kind of muting what typically is, call it, 2-plus percent increase on those zero to one megawatt-type deployments. And then on a little bit larger, I think just over a megawatt, we had an enterprise customer who did a simultaneous new signing with us in Europe in addition to a renewal with us in our Southeast region. So, when you parse those stats, you obviously see the negative on one piece, but it contributes to the positive elsewhere. We still think it's a strategic advantage to come to the table with that relationship and those incremental arrows in our quiver. But those were some things that contributed to it. And I don't think -- we didn't change the guidance on that quite, frankly, because it's probably one of the toughest to predict, because it depends when the customer wants to in the renewal of its contract, which can be early or can be very much down to the wire. So, it's -- you're handicapping not only the outcome or what period actually happens. No I think you nailed it on, but going to your second question Matt and welcome back. It's great to have you back cover digital. The question on the 307, why can't you just time that by 2, I don't know if you're colluding with our CEO, because he asked me that same question as well. I did have to remind him two things one of which you highlighted. One we are -- we have been doing some strategic capital management matching our sources and uses. And we are redeeming some notes, but all along to fund our capital spend we were planning to draw down on that $1 billion equity forward. So those shares from the equity forward are not in our share count for the first half of the year, they're going to come into the second half of the year, as we close out that in the third quarter. The other piece COVID-19, maybe I'll take a quick second to really give another tremendous thank you to our operations team globally, who have just gone above and beyond. We obviously with this crisis stayed fully operational, but we did scale down our staffing to make sure we put the safety of our customers, employees and partners first and foremost. So we delayed any type of maintenance spend or repairs and maintenance that could be delayed. And that spend we don't think it's going to be delayed forever. We're working in a safe manner to continue to maintain the equipment. And we expect some of that spend that was thought to be planned and happening in the first half of the year to resume in the second half of the year. Sure. Thanks Sami. You are correct. I mean, if you look historically that category would be closer to two-plus percent positive and if you look through what's happening in there there's numerous renewals happening in there on a very granular basis. The reponderence of those renewals are in the positive territory and you hit the nail on the head with -- there was a specific customer that renewed across three or four sites globally with network deployments so small deployments that add up to a larger sizable deployment. And that customer is not only incredibly important to our platform based on its size and scale, but also the value it brings to the other community participants and customers here at digital. So we wanted to make sure that we found the most fair potential outcome for that renewal to secure their future here with digital. It was a little bit on the longer side for that size of deployment in terms of renewal, it's always the rates a little bit longer -- lower rates or longer, but really more of a strategic renewal within that category that brought that into the slightly negative cash mark-to-market. Thanks Eric. So maybe I'll start off and hand it to Corey to kind of take more forward looking here. So I think a few things to your question. I think we had a really strong quarter in Ashburn, but I think we also had a really strong quarter in North America as well. Just a quick highlights New York City, metro area, top enterprise, network oriented smaller footprint deployments and connectivity, as well as a very strategic build-to-suit project on our Jersey connected campus. Out in the Pacific Northwest continued support of a hyperscaler on a highly strategic project in the Hillsboro market. Continued great wins in Chicago both on the connectivity side within the financial services vertical, as well as a different hyperscaler growing on one of our campuses in the Chicago area. So -- and I think that theme speaks to a little bit about your question. If you do rewind the clock back for a second with the digestion of the last go around I think our business did quite well which I think goes back to serving our customers across six continents, 20-plus countries, 44-plus metropolitan areas and having that globally diverse 4000-plus customer base, has allowed us to not be wed to a specific market or the ups and downs of one specific customer. And last I would say, I don't think each of these customers are on the exact same pacing. They're all at different places in their race or different points of their build-outs of their infrastructure which allows us to kind of help them when one customer is maybe taking a pause or looking to grow in different markets. But Corey please share your thoughts as well. Sure, Erik. So also another big thank you in kudos to our global construction team working day and night and weekends for sure in really crazy times. We -- well, I can't say we're able to make up time we've had from some delays from specific jurisdictions like a Toronto or Hillsboro from pulling labor off sites. I can say globally, we are in a really great spot going forward in terms of getting our teams back to work and delivering on our delivery times. The one -- the exception, I'd say -- not exceptional potential spot that we're keeping an eye on and we're not at full staffing in Singapore. Given the labor situation in that country we are not at 100% capacity, but we are continuing to make progress. That being said. So I think we're in a much better place today than we were when we reported on that topic a few months ago. Yes, Eric. No, I'll reiterate and reaffirm that Interxion remains our highest priority -- the integration of Interxion. We certainly are acquiring land parcels around the world for development. There may be very, very small tuck-in acquisitions but that's really for the purposes of new market expansion and/or maybe product enhancement or growing markets. Greg you might want to add to that? Thank you."

            "name": "Chris Sharp",
            "content": "Absolutely, happy to do it Andy, thank you. And thanks for the question Sami. So you're absolutely correct. And I'll echo the sentiments throughout the call is that, we're very happy with the addition of Interxion into our broader portfolio. And I think what that represents to our customer base is, these are major epicenters of value for kind of current and future customers. And so really what's represented within that is, these communities of interest and the amount of interconnection that's been generated over the years that exists and that continues to grow. And I think one of the things that's very important to us and it's just shared vision within the Interxion team as well is that, there has to be a very balanced approach where we want to ensure that we don't cycle our customers' ability to grow and to continue to derive unique value out of this overall platform digital. And so I do think that you'll see a lot of our other existing customer base coming into Europe. So that platform effect will start to build that up. So I think over a period of time you'll definitely see that grow. But we're really conscientious of taking a balanced approach and having a very open platform so that we can allow customers to grow and continually expand. And I think a critical element of a lot of this is, not only the interconnection element but the multi-market and the unique advantage of our fit-for-purpose product where you can do both smaller colo and larger scale deployments. So the value of all of that coming together is the unique position that PlatformDIGITAL equips our customers with."

            "content": "No, Bill look I think, you've covered it. As Bill said we're going to -- we understand that integration is our top priority and we really have become more risk-averse in this environment. But as Bill said, we're procuring land where our customers need to be. And with facilities that really adhere to our PlatformDIGITAL and community of interest strategy. And as Bill said, we're selectively monitoring opportunities in the market where if an asset is strategic it will be smaller and we can create value and get the right return we'd probably do it. I think a lot of people are speculating in terms of acquisitions in this environment where we are with respect to distressed opportunities. And quite frankly, we haven't seen any distressed opportunities in this market yet, but we're actively monitoring things. Now longer term we may see some distressed opportunities for smaller more thinly capitalized companies that may have debt coming due. But a couple of things. Look we originally thought that as assets outside of the data spend and center space got hit harder than data centers and became relatively less expensive that we'd see private capital migrate towards those opportunities and decrease competition for data centers. However, what we're starting to see is that the private investment community have come to appreciate really the strong underlying secular trends in our space as well as the creditworthiness of our customers and the growth potential of the sector and they're becoming more educated and looking to invest. So look as Bill said, we have we're going to continue with that strategy and that's where we're focused right now. Yes, sure. Hi, Colby. How are you? Look I think with respect to asset sales, I think, it's fair to say that the level of chatter and activity has picked up quite a bit. But what the exact impact will be on pricing for larger deals is still hard to say. It's important to again note everything we were saying about investors, how they're viewing the sector in terms of the secular trends, the credit worthiness in the growth potential which clearly I think you're starting to see the data center space migrate to more of a core asset class that investors particularly through this pandemic are starting to appreciate. As you know we just sold the asset in the middle of the pandemic in Europe and we got the pricing we expected. We continue to believe that our multiyear guidance of a few billion dollars over the few years of noncore assets or noncore markets. We still think that's the right guidance. We've already done about $1.4 billion of that. It's important to note that we're fully funded and we'll continue to recycle capital opportunistically, when it makes sense and the price is right. But it's always good to be in a position where you have no sense of urgency, if you can't get fair value. And I think you probably also noted we gave guidance of $600 million to $1 billion earlier in the year. And with the Mapletree transaction itself, we've already achieved the bottom end of that range. Again, so why we're not expecting -- we weren't expecting COVID-19, but we are comfortable and confident where we are with respect to our capital recycling activity. So -- but look it's going to continue to change daily and we'll continue to monitor it, but we feel like we're in a good position."

During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and callers will be limited to one question plus a follow-up. Due to time constraints, we will conclude promptly at the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. John, please go ahead.\nJohn Stewart: Thank you, Shawn. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and EVP of Sales and Marketing, Corey Dyer, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Stein: Thank you, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. The last 90 days have been unlike anything that we've experienced in our lifetime, and our hearts go out to all those who have been directly impacted by COVID-19 especially those who've lost loved ones. No one has been immune to this crisis, but the data center industry has been fortunate to remain open for business while huge portions of the global economy have been put on hold. As you probably know, data centers have been classified as critical infrastructure and essential businesses by government agencies around the world. Our top priority is, of course, the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners. The entire data center industry has delivered a strong track record of operational excellence and uptime throughout this crisis. Digital Realty has made 100% uptime. And while we have deferred preventative maintenance and have asked customers to limit site visits to critical activities, our doors have remained open and our data centers continue to provide the trusted foundation for the digital economy. Business continuity is our core competency. We have a full-fledged pandemic playbook to ensure that we maintain service levels while prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners. We have received very high marks from our customers for our professional protocol and proactive communications throughout the crisis. For this, we owe a debt of gratitude to our operations team and particularly our frontline employees in critical data center roles. Despite the challenging environment, they have continued coming to work so that industries, governments and families can continue to connect, keep in touch and keep commerce and information flowing. We are deeply appreciative of their efforts. Let's turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on page four. In early January, we issued \u20ac1.4 billion of green euro bonds. This was our third green bond issuance, and we are now the largest U.S. REIT green bond issuer. Our green bond framework is aligned with the ICMA green bond principles with a second-party opinion provided by Sustainalytics. In mid-January, we announced that we had achieved EPA ENERGY STAR Certification for an industry-leading 29 data centers last year. In early April, we were honored to be the first data center provider to receive an EPA ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award for Energy Management. Finally, in late April, we announced a wind energy agreement to supply approximately 30% of our power needs in the Dallas, Texas area with renewable energy. On the social front, we are fortunate to be in a position to give back in the midst of this crisis. We have undertaken a comprehensive, philanthropic initiative consisting of corporate contributions, employee-matching gifts and community outreach initiatives to help support organizations combating COVID-19 around the world. We are also waiving fees for expanded service exchange connectivity for the next six months to help customers in the government, medical, emergency services and educational verticals keep critical services running. On the governance front, Jean Mandeville has joined the Board of Directors, bolstering the additions of Alexis B. Bjorlin and Dash Jamieson in January. Jean was previously Chairman of the Board at Interxion. And he has extensive experience in the technology and telecom sectors, having previously served as the CFO of Global Crossing and Singapore Technologies Telemedia as well as President of APAC for British Telecom. We are pleased to welcome Jean to the Board, and we look forward to benefiting from his leadership and expertise. On a more bittersweet note, we also have a departure to announce. Former Chairman, Dennis Singleton, has reached mandatory retirement age and will not be standing for reelection at our annual meeting. Dennis had a distinguished career prior to joining our Board, most notably as a founding partner of Spieker Properties. He has served as a Digital Realty director since our IPO in 2004, and he served as Chairman of the Board from 2012 to 2017. The company has grown nearly 50-fold since Dennis joined the Board, and he has provided sound counsel and steady leadership through the most critical junctures in the company's history, including the strategic investments that have built the business as well as leadership changes at the Board and the C-suite. He is a true gentleman and his sage counsel and collegial bearing will be sorely missed. On behalf of the entire Board of Directors, I would like to thank Dennis for his more than 15 years of service to Digital Realty, and we wish him the very, very best. Let's turn to page five, our first quarter investment activity showcased the breadth of our global platform and crystallized the transformation of our business. The highlight of the quarter was, of course, our combination with Interxion in a highly strategic and complementary transaction, creating a leading global provider of cloud and carrier-neutral data center solutions. We also closed the acquisition of a 49% interest in the Westin Building Exchange in Seattle. The Westin Building is one of the most densely interconnected facilities in North America and is home to leading global cloud, content and interconnection providers with over 150 carriers and more than 10,000 cross connects. We closed on the sale of a portfolio of 10 North American data centers to Mapletree in January, generating approximately $550 million of proceeds. We also launched our colocation product offering in Osaka, building upon the success of our hyperscale business in Japan. We opened a new data center in Dublin, the new Clonshaugh facility supports the growth of Dublin's technology sector, which is projected to boom over the next decade. We acquired a small land parcel in Frankfurt, adjacent to our existing Sossenheim campus to accelerate time to market and supply-constrained metro. Separately, Interxion has line of sight on a sizable land parcel expected to represent a strategic extension of its existing Frankfurt campus that would support the development of up to 180 megawatts of IT capacity, providing runway to support customer growth in key European metro for years to come. We announced that we turned the power on at SIN12, a 50-megawatt new development in Singapore, partially pre-leased to a major Singaporean bank and a leading global cloud provider. Finally, in April, Interxion announced it has broken ground on Interxion Paris Digital Park, a major expansion project in Paris with up to 85 megawatts of capacity. The first of four new data centers on this site will be Interxion's 8th in Paris. And the first phase is scheduled to open in late 2021. Let's turn to integration on page six. We believe our combination with Interxion has the potential to change the global data center landscape. The combined organization is well placed to meet the growing demand from cloud and content platforms, IT service providers and enterprises seeking colocation, hybrid cloud and hyperscale data center solutions. These are global, long-term opportunities that we are ideally positioned to address. Integration is our top priority for 2020. The combined company offers a comprehensive global platform for our customers and gives us a runway for significant growth. We have obviously had to adapt to the current environment. The transaction closed on March 13, and we began sheltering in place the following week. Many of the initial meetings between teams that would have taken place in person have been virtual instead, and that has obviously created some challenges. But both teams have risen to the challenge. During that first week, we had to implement policies, procedures and customer communications for operating in the midst of a global pandemic. As I mentioned earlier, I'm deeply grateful for the way both teams have come together to continue to serve our customers' needs throughout this crisis. Based on our work prior to closing and within just the past few weeks, we've made progress on our corporate integration efforts, including finalizing our integration governance and combined EMEA leadership structure, which we will be rolling out in the coming weeks. There will be more to come over the next several quarters, but we are pleased with our progress to date. Let's turn to the macro environment on page seven. As we are all aware, the global economy has ground to a halt. As you've heard me say many times before, data center demand is not directly correlated to job growth, and we are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers, both growing faster than global GDP growth and somewhat insulated from economic volatility. To put a finer point on the secular demand drivers underpinning our business, I'd like to draw your attention to page eight. McKinsey recently conducted a global survey of 3,600 B2B decision-makers on their business outlook and priorities. The surveyed executives stated they value digital interactions with customers as two to three times more important than traditional interactions, reflecting continued need for digital infrastructure and capacity demand for data centers. According to the market intelligence firm Intricately, on average, enterprises utilize 27 cloud products, deployed and consumed across eight points of presence globally. We are seeing indicators of this demand globally across our platform in the volume of new logos led by our enterprise vertical, as these firms shift their strategy to enable digital interactions for their customers. Digital Realty was recently named a worldwide leader in the IDC MarketScape Colocation and Interconnection Services Provider Assessment report, noting PlatformDIGITAL provides a global scale platform to enable digital transformation in a consistent, modular fashion. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our unique positioning to capture the global data center demand opportunity. Given the resiliency of demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our portfolio to meet these needs, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.\nAndrew Power: Thank you, Bill. Let's pick up here on page 10. As you may have seen from our supplemental reporting package, given the compressed time frame post-closing and the complexity of reconciling different reporting practices with both teams working remotely, we've included the partial period contribution from Interxion in our financial statements, but we have not included Interxion's portfolio statistics in the supplemental until next quarter. We've also tabled most of the changes to our disclosure package we discussed last quarter. We continue to see the lines blurring between product types, and we believe the distinction is becoming less meaningful. As a result, we still expect to evolve our disclosure in the coming quarters to more closely align with our customers' buying behavior and the way we manage the business. We also expect to fully reflect the Interxion portfolio statistics within our disclosure next quarter as well. Nonetheless, we provided a few pro forma data points in summary form here on page 10 to help frame the power of the combined business. I would like to point out that we slightly tweaked our definition of adjusted EBITDA this quarter to include our pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture taxes and interest expense. We use net debt to adjusted EBITDA as our primary leverage governor, and we calculate leverage on a look-through basis. In other words, we include our pro rata share of unconsolidated JV debt in the numerator. And we believe that including our pro rata share of unconsolidated JV, joint venture, EBITDA in the denominator is the intellectually honest approach. Our pro rata share of joint venture interest expense and taxes has historically been negligible, but it's becoming more meaningful as we expand our strategic private capital initiative through ventures like Ascenty in Latin America and MC Digital Realty in Japan. Let's turn to our leasing activity on page 11. We delivered solid leasing volume with balanced performance across sectors, products and geographies. We signed total bookings of $75 million, our second highest quarter on record. This does not include any contribution from Interxion, which separately signed another $10 million during the first quarter. Interxion's first quarter bookings were entirely colocation and connectivity business, with no single deal larger than 180 kilowatts. Standalone Digital Realty's first quarter bookings included a $9 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $66 million, with a weighted average lease term of nearly seven years, including a $7.5 million colocation contribution. Standalone Digital Realty added 54 new logos during the first quarter on a consolidated basis. In addition, Ascenty landed 20 new logos and Interxion added another 45 for a grand total of 119, underscoring the power of our global platform. In terms of regions, standalone Digital Realty's results showed particular strength in the Americas as well as APAC, notably in Northern Virginia here in the U.S. as well as Singapore in APAC. We leased 25 megawatts in Ashburn during the first quarter, bringing our total over the past three quarters to 57 megawatts. This activity has driven lease-up of active development as well as existing inventory, and we generated nearly 300 basis points of positive net absorption within our Northern Virginia in-service portfolio during the first quarter, from 90% occupied at year-end to 93% as of March 31. We have not yet begun to see meaningful improvement in Northern Virginia market rents, but the available inventory is being rapidly absorbed, and the pendulum appears to be swinging back towards tighter availability and healthy competitive tension. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, we've landed a leading global video streaming platform for their launch across much of Europe, which was a resounding success. Interxion, a Digital Realty company, supports this on-demand, ad-free streaming service by providing their data center infrastructure across five locations in Europe. With the growing demands for OTT video services, this is a sector that relies on highly connected data centers to deliver a superior customer experience, and we are honored to have partnered with its leading provider to help them bring their world-class content to European consumers. We helped a leading European digital service provider stand up a bare-metal cloud offering adjacent to cloud on-ramps in S\u00e3o Paulo to support a major cloud provider's hybrid services in South America on our Ascenty platform. A global financial services firm using NVIDIA GPUs in their high-density compute cabinets chose Digital Realty because we met their high-performance computing requirements, including proximity to their legacy compute environment to ensure ultra-low latency and security. PlatformDIGITAL has been gaining significant momentum since its launch late last year. And customer-spanning industries, geographies and business objectives are making the migration. SEMrush, a SaaS provider offering online visibility and marketing analytics software subscriptions, had a requirement for a data hub with proximity to multiple leading global cloud providers and a global expansion under an aggressive timeline. We were able to solve their needs with a new deployment in Ashburn, including connectivity via our service exchange. Similarly, BIGO, a Singapore-based technology company specializing in AI-enabled video platforms needed a critical infrastructure provider to help them expand into EMEA. BIGO landed on legacy Digital Realty's Frankfurt campus. Interxion's capabilities across the region further solidifies the selection of their ideal partner. We were also able to support the 5G aspirations of a global Fortune 100 service provider by meeting their financial growth and power density requirements. We are continuing to build on our global momentum in the second quarter, and we look forward to helping customers achieve their goals during these uncertain times. Turning to our backlog on page 13. Standalone Digital Realty's curve backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stepped up from $116 million at year-end to $122 million at the end of the first quarter. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit better than our long-term historical average at four and a half months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 14, which again excludes Interxion, we signed $92 million of renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed. Activity was heavily skewed to our colocation business, and the weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the first quarter was a little over three years. While the positive mark-to-market on colocation renewals largely offset turnkey and PBB roll downs for an average cash re-leasing spread across the product types of negative 1.5%. As you may have seen, our guidance calls for cash re-leasing spreads to be down low single digits. Please keep in mind that our 2020 guidance does include Interxion, whereas we have not reflected Interxion results in our first quarter leasing statistics. Aside from a few select supplies constrained regions and metro areas, we have yet to see broad-based rental rate growth across most markets. However, we are continuing to make significant progress cycling through peak vintage renewals, the lion's share of our portfolio has recently been leased at current market rents and we are beginning to see barriers to entry emerge in a growing number of markets around the world. As a result, we expect to see continued gradual improvement on cash re-leasing spreads into 2020 and beyond. In terms of first quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy improved 40 basis points to 87.2%, largely due to positive absorption in Northern Virginia and Dallas. Same capital cash NOI was down 3.7% due to downtime related to record expirations in 2019 and reflecting a 40 basis point FX headwind. Our full year guidance implies improvement going forward. And barring any unforeseen shocks, we are cautiously optimistic that we put the low watermark for the cycle behind us. As a reminder, Interxion and the Westin Building are not included in the 2020 same-store pool, but we expect both acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward. Turning to economic risk mitigation strategies on page 15. The U.S. dollar continued to decline relative to prior year exchange rates, and FX represented roughly a 50 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results, from the top to the bottom-line. We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In terms of vertical concentration, as you can see from the pie chart on the upper right, we have limited exposure to the businesses that have been most directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our April rent collections are in line with our historical average and the sum total of customers who have reached out to request rent relief represent approximately 2% of total revenue. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have less than a 50 basis point impact to full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed, and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was down 11.6% year-over-year. As you may recall, there were several onetime items in 1Q 2019 affecting the year-over-year comparison, including a $0.065 U.K. tax benefit, another $0.065 of interest income on the Brookfield bridge loan and a full quarter contribution from consolidating Ascenty prior to closing the joint venture with Brookfield on the last day of the year ago quarter, whereas we had nearly a full quarter of dilution from the Mapletree asset sales in 1Q 2020. Excluding these non-comparable items, the year-over-year growth would have been up 1.2%. Core FFO per share missed consensus by $0.03 but was $0.03 ahead of our internal forecast, driven by strong leasing performance and operating expense savings. By our estimation, the first quarter miss relative to consensus was entirely due to the share count. Its actual results were 5% to 6% ahead of consensus on the top line and EBITDA. And most street models did not reflect the 54 million additional shares outstanding for 18 days upon closing of the Interxion combination in mid-March. As you may have seen from the press release, we opportunistically issued a little over $650 million of equity on our ATM in late March and early April. In addition, we now expect to draw down our forward equity offering sooner rather than later this year. Our 2020 guidance includes just over $0.25, or 4% headwind comprised of three items; the opportunistic equity issuance and accelerated drawdown of our equity forward; FX and COVID-19 impact, including modest drag from development delivery delays in select markets; and finally, the earlier-than-expected closing of our combination with Interxion, along with additional investments in the Interxion business to fund future growth. As you can see from the bridge chart on page 16, we expect the quarterly run rate to dip down by $0.06 in the second and third quarters before rebounding in the fourth quarter and beyond. Our recent investment activity, including Ascenty in Latin America and Interxion in EMEA, along with our capital recycling initiative and balance sheet management, have lowered the per share bar in 2020. But we believe each of these initiatives will create long-term value and set us up for accelerating growth and a greater share of global customer wallet going forward, while still providing for a well-covered dividend, which the Board raised for the 15th consecutive year in February. Last, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 17. Fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 3.8 times, while net debt to adjusted EBITDA stood at 6.6 times as of the end of the first quarter, primarily due to showing 100% of Interxion's debt on our balance sheet as of March 31, whereas it contributed just 18 days of EBITDA in the first quarter. Pro forma for a full quarter contribution from Interxion and the Westin Building, the equity issuance activity on the ATM after quarter end and settlement of the $1.1 billion forward equity offering, net debt to adjusted EBITDA remains in line with our targeted range at just over five times, while fixed charge coverage is just under five times. As a result of our proactive balance sheet management, we have ample liquidity to fund our capital spending with nearly $250 million of cash on the balance sheet as of March 31, another $1.7 billion of equity coming in post quarter end and $2 billion of availability on our global revolving credit facilities. The successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on page 18, our weighted average debt maturity is over six years and our weighted average coupon is 3%. 60% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment, and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 18, we have a clear runway with virtually no near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Shawn, would you please begin the Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks for taking the question. This is Bora Lee [ph] on for Jon. I guess first of all, given the widespread pause in place in Singapore for new permitting and moratorium on permitting in place in Amsterdam, are there any other markets where this is happening? And do you have any update on when these restrictions might be lifted? \nAndrew Power: Thanks for the question. This is Andy speaking. I think given the Digital team on the call is in different locations right now to social distancing, Bill asked that I quarterback handing off the questions. I think I actually can start the first one and let that team chime in. So, Singapore, obviously, is a country that was early out of the woods and now kind of back in lockdown, so -- and having some impact to our delivery time there. And Amsterdam, a different story, not really COVID-related. It's more of the government's restrictions on certain locations. I would say, in Amsterdam, we've done a very nice job about being ahead of the game there with planning for an existing now multiple campuses with our combination with Interxion, in addition to tying up some lands that are outside the restricted area. I don't -- I'm not aware of restrictions that are akin to the Amsterdam scenario really elsewhere in the portfolio. There's obviously markets where we're running up to supply constraints. I think that Amsterdam scenario is -- lends itself to the incumbent players, like Digital, and keep some of the new entrants out for sure. We are seeing more COVID-related impacts that have government intertwined. Toronto is a market where we have our campus is under construction, building out future capacity, and that the government kind of leaned in and put a halt for some time before reopening, in particular, Hillsboro, Oregon, where we're building out a campus that's significantly pre-leased. That less government restrictions, I'd say, some -- we saw a significant amount of absenteeism that caused some delay in the labor side. But again, this is just a handful of select markets where we saw some potential disruptions to our deliveries that will impact our 2020, which we try to lay out in the script. I wouldn't say it's a widespread phenomenon within our portfolio at Digital.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And for my follow-up question, a few days ago, you announced the launch of Digital Realty Data Hub featuring NVIDIA for the rapid deployment of AI and machine learning workloads. Could you provide further color on this announcement? Are there similar ones yet to come? And what are some illustrative customer use cases that DLR is seeing or expects to see?\nAndrew Power: Thank you. I'll toss that to Bill, start there.\nBill Stein: Thanks, Andy. So, we're absolutely delighted to partner with NVIDIA to extend machine and deep learning to data center to accelerate artificial intelligence. Digital is an early stage partner with NVIDIA. And together, we've pre-certified 24 locations around the world. Our Data Hub solution featuring NVIDIA DGX PODs provides buyers with a validated reference architecture and solution starter kit for rapid AI deployments on PlatformDIGITAL around the world. The combination of NVIDIA DGX and PlatformDIGITAL enables a secure and performance data center architecture for enterprises at any scale. We do have a pipeline of similar ones. In addition to NVIDIA, we've released solution offers with Cisco, IBM and Vapor IO. This is part of the PlatformDIGITAL road map that we published last November when we launched the platform. We're seeing multiple customer use cases across many industries. We've captured multiple customer wins across financial services, transportation and logistics and IT service industries. All of these customers are looking to unbound data processing and exchange limitations to enable intelligent insights for their business. Initial use cases include complex trade analytics and risk, AI-based cybersecurity and route optimization for connected vehicles. \nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you and good afternoon. I hope everybody is doing well. First question, I guess I'm interested in what you've seen in terms of demand, the pipeline and the funnel as a result directly or amidst COVID, first and foremost. So, I know the first quarter, there wasn't much going on in terms of time, which we had coronavirus, although globally, certainly, there might have been. It happened a little bit earlier in the quarter. But I'm speaking more specifically to what's gone on in -- took place in March, the end of March and then into April and sort of the velocity you've seen and maybe you could parse that across your customer base a little bit. Thank you.\nBill Stein: Hey thanks, Jordan. I hope you and your family are healthy and safe as well. I'm going to toss it over to Corey to talk pipeline in response to your question there.\nCorey Dyer: Hey Jordan, thanks a lot and I appreciate the sentiment on -- for everybody and how COVID is affecting everyone across the globe. I'll probably answer kind of in two parts, a little bit about just what our pipeline looks like and then separately, I'll try to give you a sense of what the COVID impact of that was, if that makes sense for you, Jordan. But I would tell you that from a demand perspective overall, it's really been a strong demand. It's really picked up and continued through when we did our launch of PlatformDIGITAL in Q4. Q1 has kind of continued on that momentum. It was really well received by customers, partners in the industry. You guys -- we just mentioned the NVIDIA sign off, which is just another example of customers and partners adhering to our platform and some of the unique values that we have. Bill, in his opening remarks, mentioned that IDC MarketScape ranked us as a leader in the data center space. And then we saw the same follow-through on our enterprise new logos. So, the new logos, we had -- 75% of them were enterprise. Still staying on kind of that demand aspect and looking forward to Q2, really strong pipeline that we have, continuing that momentum around PlatformDIGITAL that we just started on. And so when we look at it kind of late-stage pipeline, quarter-on-quarter, it's up over 50%, 100% year-on-year. We go and look at new logo pipeline, it's similar kind of robust metrics. And then looked at the enterprise to see if we had anything there thinking who would maybe be the most impacted, Jordan. And a really strong pipeline on our enterprise side. So, happy with it across the board. The concern we have is just as you would expect. We've got some enterprises that are being impacted by it. And those that you would expect where we saw some slowdowns there. But on a net, it was taken up by new enterprise opportunities, CSPs, content network and really interconnection growth across the board. So, I would tell you that the industry, you would expect to get affected work. But on net for us, we still have plenty of demand and a strong pipeline going forward. Jordan, I hope that helps.\nJordan Sadler: That's helpful. And then maybe one for you, Andy, on the guide. I think pretty disappointing relative to where The Street is and where expectations were. And I know you had to layer in quite a bit between Interxion and COVID, and I appreciate the $0.25 headwinds. But even relative to the $1.57 you printed in 1Q, just annualizing the $0.25 of headwinds, it seems to point to very limited growth from new business and I know we're already in the year. But I guess it just seems a bit light. And I guess the other sort of comment would be around the re-leasing spreads. The Digital portfolio is a much larger portfolio than Interxion's. I know we've previously talked about maybe being shrewd the most difficult times, and I feel like fundamentals are only have only gotten better, increased demand, less ability to supply. What sort of -- what am I missing?\nAndrew Power: So, thanks, Jordan. Let me try and tackle this. So -- and one quick clarification. The first quarter came in above our internal expectations at $1.53. I think you might have said $1.57. So close enough for what -- where you're getting at here. So -- and we certainly had a complicated quarter for our friends on -- in the research community to follow us. I think when we're tracking the 23 or so analysts that cover us, I think we -- we only got to around seven that we're able to get all the moving parts, including interaction closing orderly into the numbers. So where we saw consensus, if you did the math, including the interaction in the share count and the like, was closer to 630-ish. And relative to beginning of the year and today, I think the things that changed that we try to highlight in our prepared remarks are -- roughly total a little over $0.25 of impact. Three buckets, the first two buckets being the major components. First one is we took this time in the context of certainly uncertain times, probably more so outside of our industry, but broader capital markets disruption and the like to do some balance sheet management. We opportunistically issued $650 million under our ATM, and we plan to bring our equity forward down sooner. That, I would say is, call it, $0.08 or so of the $0.25, and that was intentional. And that was intentional in the broader backdrop that was intentional because we also see investment opportunities to fund future growth. Hence, we've kind of took a more conservative balance sheet posture. The second major component, what I'd call on the FX and COVID impact maybe, call it, $0.13 or so in total. And I'd say it's roughly 50/50 between those two buckets. COVID has some smaller items like some -- a more conservative posture on our estimations of bad debt expense. But the major COVID item, I would say, is really going back to my response to the first question, was we are seeing certain jurisdictions in select markets putting restrictions on our ability to bring labor to the sites. So, a fantastic -- it's fantastic to have our global platform across 20 countries in 44 markets. But when you have a country like Singapore that was originally out of woods in terms of its exposure and then kind of goes back into lockdown, our 50-megawatt shell or, call it, 11 or 12-megawatt pre-leasing already, is going to certainly get delayed a couple of months. And that episodic thing in a handful of markets, which I highlighted, is certainly going to put a little dent into our revenue that is going to come across the P&L in 2020. But again, temporary impact and really goes back to the fluid dynamics around the COVID situation. And then last but not least, I would say, call it, the small minority, let's say, is Interxion related. I don't think when we stood at the beginning of the year, we thought we'd have the good fortune of navigating numerous European government jurisdictions and multiple shareholder votes and closed the transaction at the middle of March like we did. We initially estimated 1% to 2% dilution on that transaction, but the pull forward in earlier timing. And I would say a little bit, we're seeing some investment opportunities in our combined EMEA business, which will be $0.01 or so till 2020. That kind of rounds up the minority of the $0.25. Net-net, this is obviously -- we are always looking to grow our earnings as fast as possible. At the same time, I would look at our combination with Interxion, our balance sheet management, be it our cap or recycling or even the more smaller opportunistic things like further equitizing the balance sheet to fund future growth opportunities are really setting us up for more accelerating growth. And also at the same time, I don't think doing anything that's reckless in terms of our dividend coverage and the like. And then turning briefly to the re-leasing spreads. Taking a step back for half a second. Four of the five of the last years four of the last five years, we've actually had positive re-leasing spreads, if you go back to our supplemental to each of those years. This year, we're obviously guiding to down slightly. This is a stat where we usually overestimate the negative impact and outperform relative to guidance, as you saw just last year. In any given quarter, they could have an episodic customer that is renewing with an above-market lease. Usually, those transactions, be it any form of renewal, is something that's additive to our commercial negotiations where we can help these customers across multiple products, multiple geos, new business and renewals in a kind of comprehensive fashion. So, I don't think we're out of the woods on every single one of our contracts being below market whatsoever. And I think the trend is moving in the right direction in the stat. And we're certainly looking forward to getting to -- in the green territory on that stat moving forward and overall driving higher organic growth. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Hi, good afternoon. Since this might be one of the last quarters that your reporting metrics for the heritage DLR business, back when you filed the S-4 for the transaction with Interxion, it was inferred from there that organic growth for the -- just heritage Digital business would be about 5%. Can you frame what that growth rate looks like that's embedded in the guidance for 2020 in terms of the expectation for heritage Digital revenue growth?\nBill Stein: I think -- honestly, if you look at the results so far, Interxion really only contributed, call it, two weeks or so of contribution. So, the first quarter results is primarily Digital. And just to reiterate, we did really do the facts and circumstances of moving to a work-from-home environment literally the day we closed Interxion. Put all of our statistics in here, excluding Interxion's, you could see the entire legacy or classic Digital business fundamentals. And in terms of contribution to guidance, I was not on the fourth quarter call, but Matt Mercier stepped in and did a very nice job, I thought, in laying out some kind of guide rails for legacy Digital, including on a standalone basis, what our top line would be and adjusting for the ins and outs of our dispositions and capital recycling, what we've called organic revenue growth in the mid-single-digits in 2020, which I would affirm is still accurate. And I would also -- we also stated that we had industry-leading EBITDA margins, which I would also affirm is still accurate. And I think that -- I'd say that's accurate, even pro forma for our Interxion combination, which obviously is a lower EBITDA margin business. So, just the comments were made back in February in terms of our organic growth profile, I would say, flow through into the guidance. And I would say the organic growth of the Digital business was a major driver of the outperformance from our internal perspective in the first quarter, which was a largely Digital-only quarter.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nOperator: And now our next question will come from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nErik Rasmussen: Thank you. Maybe just with the Q1 and sort of breaking things down with the -- your Q1 results, the $823 million. Can you just maybe break that down in terms of the organic DLR versus what Interxion's contribution? Obviously, we go back into the math, but just wanted to get a sense of what those numbers were. And was -- were there anything else? And then with that, I thought you were going to be consolidating the Westin Exchange. What's -- what was the can you just maybe comment on what that was in the quarter?\nBill Stein: Sure. Thanks, Erik. So, just to be clear, you're asking kind of to unpackage the $823 million of revenue in the quarter in terms of contribution from each of the major transactions. The -- is -- that was your question, correct?\nErik Rasmussen: Yes. Thank you.\nBill Stein: So, of the $823 million, and I'm kind of bridging you between the quarter's changes, I would say, Interxion was probably like a $40 million -- almost $47-ish million contribution and the rest was really the ins and outs of Digital. And I think we put a cap rate and a return on the Westin purchase, about a 5.8% return so that you can kind of back into flipping that from an unconsolidated joint venture to a consolidated joint venture investment. And Erik, we're also more than happy to follow up post the call or work through any of the granularity. We understand when you joint venture and recycle $1.4 billion of capital in the last 90-plus days, buy out a partner on a $700 million asset and close a $8.5 billion strategic combination in Europe, it's not a simple quarter from anyone's modeling perspective.\nErik Rasmussen: No, definitely. I appreciate that. And I will do that. And then maybe just my follow-up on Northern Virginia, it seems to be recovering and we're hearing of improved demand. How are you seeing this market and your opportunities? And can you comment on other markets where you're seeing an improvement versus what you thought just 90 days ago? And that's maybe just not here in the U.S., but obviously, now with Interxion, you have a lot more visibility into that European base as well.\nBill Stein: Sure. So, maybe I'll start off with like a little kind of market tour, and I'll ask Corey to chime in a little bit on what he's seeing on the customer standpoint. Northern Virginia was a very strong quarter. It was, I believe, our top quarter top market in terms of overall signings. It was strong on the colocation or connection front. Some great startings at pretty attractive pricings into our colo suites on that campus. We also were very successful in backfilling into that market, numerous recently vacated suites. So, that's kind of high flow-through leasing activity because the suite is already built and constructed. And lastly, it was the home of our largest transaction for the quarter where we imported from out of region, a fairly sizable transaction all on the hyperscale front. So all around, pretty strong. I would say it's not a market that is completely out of the woods. I would attribute our success there due to a few things. One, our offering is really an entire platform offering, numerous of our sales into any market are going to include numerous products and numerous geos at the same time. Two, we have a very large installed and growing customer base that wants to grow with adjacency; and then three, in Northern Virginia, we have, I believe, the longest runway of future-proofing our customers' growth in terms of capacity, potential build-out. And I would say, while more commodity-like providers on the periphery in North Virginia are certainly cutting rates, that kind of almost internal competitive [Indiscernible] for our customers to get specific suites on various products within the various campuses in Ashburn certainly accrued itself to our platform and generate better economics. If you can turn to kind of quickly the rest of North America, brighter spots, I would say, is Toronto. It has been a very attractive location where we're quickly going through capacity there, and we're about to launch our colocation suite, which will be a great new entrance to that market. Northern -- New York City Metro, both in the city and also in New Jersey has been seeing a rebound. That's been on the colocation connectivity side as well as, I'd say, call it, half a megawatt to two megawatt-type scale as enterprise-type demand, financial service in particular. Santa Clara remains very tight. Other markets of robustness outside of North America, Asia-Pacific had a very strong quarter. Early signs in the smaller dollars or kilowatts from our Osaka launch of colocation interconnection, we're off to a great start there. And our SIN12 building, I think I mentioned, has had wins with a major enterprise, a leading Asia-Pacific bank as well as a major CSP. Swinging down to Latin America, S\u00e3o Paulo had success where we export demand from a European-based customer on the enterprise side into the colo connectivity suites in our Ascenty platform. And then last but not least, in Europe, we -- in our prepared remarks, we mentioned the strength of selling some Asia customers into our legacy Digital colo facility in Frankfurt. The London Cloud House is off to a good start. And then last but not least, Interxion, which we didn't kind of put on the page in our results, I would reiterate, did a very healthy $10 million of signings. It was a very attractive book of business with no major signing above 180 kilowatts. I believe the connectivity signings were close to 35-plus percent of the signings. So, also a very successful quarter in terms of the Interxion activity. Corey, anything to add on that? \nCorey Dyer: You gave him pretty much a rock star world tour of what we've got going on, so I was trying to think of what to add. I guess I would say, Andy, is the only thing to add is that we're really happy with what we've seen in Ashburn, if that's the base question here. We've had deals each of the last couple of quarters that have helped us. And we're continuing to see demand in that area that we're going to continue to source and take care of. It puts us in a position to think about expanding and growing more there. And then as you said, if you looked across our regions, each of our regions was really successful this year or in this last quarter, as well as AP just going gangbusters for us. So, I think you did a great job summarizing it. But we're happy with how PlatformDIGITAL has been received by customers. We're seeing a lot more multi-metro deals come through and a big pickup on the enterprise wins with new logos. So, I appreciate it, Andy.\nErik Rasmussen: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Choe: Hi. I just wanted to ask about the base business. And given that there's so many puts and takes on the financial side, just to focus on what's going on with the underlying business. It seems like $70 million in signings has been pretty steady over the past four quarters. Is that the new normal? And is it fair to say, even though Northern Virginia contributed, it doesn't seem like you had a kind of out of trend win there. And later on, that could boost that overall signings number from $70 million to a much bigger number.\nAndrew Power: Thanks Richard. So, I would say -- I mean we've showed a pretty consistent stair step up over now several quarters. And each and every quarter has gotten a little bit better in terms of its volume and composition on multiple fronts. So, we're at just under 75, excluding anything for Interxion and it was very diverse. As we mentioned, APAC was a big contributor. It was -- Northern Virginia was a solid contributor, but I wouldn't say it took -- stole the entire show. And I think that if you got to really to peel the onion, going back to some of Corey's and Bill's comments, either in our prepared remarks, very healthy new logos. When you add up -- our new logos up, we're up to 120 new logos. So I don't -- usually don't like to annualize that, but on a 4% -- 4,000 customers, we're talking like almost 12% new logo generation growth from the combined platform. So, very pleased on numerous other key performance indicators and I think you heard a little bit about Corey's outlook on the pipeline, moving it into 2Q. \nRichard Choe: And as a follow-up, the interaction of 10 million signings; is that kind of the normal level? Or was that kind of them having a very good quarter? And how should we think about that going forward?\nAndrew Power: I'm pretty sure -- I don't believe David's ever given a signings pipeline or even a signings number. So, I'm not going to be the first one to unpack that on public air here. But I'm sure some transactions probably didn't get done during the quarter. I would say Europe, in particular, was in the middle of the COVID crisis a lot sooner than the United States. But I was pretty pleased when I saw close to 10 million of signings with that healthy consistency, numerous -- across numerous markets and so connectivity rich.\nRichard Choe: It's a nice contribution. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nColby Synesael: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one, just you guys have talked about in the past a goal of getting to maybe 5%, 7% core FFO per share. When you think about 2021 and getting past some of the things that you've talked about that are impacting you specifically in 2020, is that still a fair approximation for where you would aspire to see growth going, particularly with the leasing numbers that have been so strong? And then secondly, well, I appreciate you don't guide to AFFO, I was hoping you could give us a little bit of color on some of the metrics that go into it, such as straight-line and market rent amortization. I mean some of us do focus a little bit more on that metric as well. Thank you.\nAndrew Power: Thanks Colby. So, I think our growth objectives for the business remain consistent. The only ounce of caution I put then is we're obviously in a whole brand-new world here that could have interim drag or longer-term acceleration, overall digital transformation that could further emphasize the growth of our business. But I think that mid to high single-digits kind of growth in our recurring cash flows or FFO, AFFO per share is still the bogey to -- or hurdle to shoot for and overcome. Going to the adjustments to FFO and to AFFO, really straight-line rents is just a GAAP phenomenon where we essentially kind of include the rental escalations or bumps. And depending on where the customers' contracts are in their life cycle, it can have a positive or negative impact. And depending on what type of -- whether customers ramping into our space or not can obviously have an impact. And the above and below market amortization is also a non-cash impact as well. So, I'm happy to -- with 4,000 customers in the breadth of our business, there's a lot of ins and outs that go into that number. If you want to ask another -- I'm not sure -- maybe I'm not hitting the heart of what you're seeking to understand there in terms of the impact.\nColby Synesael: Sure. Well, just given the interaction and how that's a slightly different business than what you guys had what your business predominantly is, I was just wondering if there's any color you can give. But maybe more simply, would you expect AFFO to be notably below, above, similar to your core FFO? Maybe that's an easier way of asking it. And then, I guess, since if you're not able to answer that question, just curious, just in terms of COVID-19, if you're seeing, as a result of that, some of the larger hyperscalers are shifting more to an outsourced model opposed to a self-build model, given perhaps their own desires to reduce their own CapEx expense in this environment?\nAndrew Power: Yes, I think the more elegant answer to your first question is what's a combination of consolidating our highly connected colocation facility, the Westin Building and our combination with Interxion. Our mix of business is certainly moving much more towards a more granular customer base, more network-oriented customers. We're obviously going after the enterprise customer in hybrid multi-cloud environments. And that customer mix is going to have less -- much, much less of, call it, 15-year steady Eddie bump contracts, which is going to be at the end of the day, narrow, I believe, the gap between our FFO and AFFO per share over time versus if -- going back to our legacy, much more legacy business even -- kind of tell us kind of five years back. And then going to your second question on -- maybe I'll turn this over to Corey or Chris to answer about the second question, about customer behaviors or the buying patterns of the hyperscalers. \nChris Sharp: Yes, I can help out with this one, Andy. And I think on the hyperscalers, Colby, there are requirements. They've got them all across the globe. So we're well positioned to help out where they need to look at it. And they generally handle that demand with a combination of like their self-build and their -- and then outsourcing to groups like us. Many of the hyperscaler requirements also involve compute nodes combined with connectivity. And I think we're really well positioned just to take care of them from a full spectrum of data center solutions, both highly connected and wholesale. And I think, while you might hear that some of them want to in-source for whatever different reasons or build their own, we haven't seen that come through in the pipeline yet, and we haven't seen that come through in any kind of change in our customer conversations and our engagements with them, is what I'd I tell you, Colby. Thanks.\nColby Synesael: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein for any closing remarks. Bill, please go ahead.\nBill Stein: Thanks Shawn. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we enhanced the value of our platform, successfully closing on our highly strategic combination with Interxion as well as the acquisition of the Westin Building in Seattle and the Mapletree portfolio sale. Second, we also underscored our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders with community outreach initiatives, a renewable wind energy contract and new additions to our Board. Third, we maintain steadfast support for our customers, prioritizing health and safety while maintaining service levels. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet with the opportunistic issuance of $650 million of equity capital. I'd like to conclude today's call by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family, but particularly our frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world turning in the midst of this global pandemic. I hope you all stay safe and healthy and we hope to see many of you in person again soon. Thank you. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Corey Dyer",
            "content": "Hey Jordan, thanks a lot and I appreciate the sentiment on -- for everybody and how COVID is affecting everyone across the globe. I'll probably answer kind of in two parts, a little bit about just what our pipeline looks like and then separately, I'll try to give you a sense of what the COVID impact of that was, if that makes sense for you, Jordan. But I would tell you that from a demand perspective overall, it's really been a strong demand. It's really picked up and continued through when we did our launch of PlatformDIGITAL in Q4. Q1 has kind of continued on that momentum. It was really well received by customers, partners in the industry. You guys -- we just mentioned the NVIDIA sign off, which is just another example of customers and partners adhering to our platform and some of the unique values that we have. Bill, in his opening remarks, mentioned that IDC MarketScape ranked us as a leader in the data center space. And then we saw the same follow-through on our enterprise new logos. So, the new logos, we had -- 75% of them were enterprise. Still staying on kind of that demand aspect and looking forward to Q2, really strong pipeline that we have, continuing that momentum around PlatformDIGITAL that we just started on. And so when we look at it kind of late-stage pipeline, quarter-on-quarter, it's up over 50%, 100% year-on-year. We go and look at new logo pipeline, it's similar kind of robust metrics. And then looked at the enterprise to see if we had anything there thinking who would maybe be the most impacted, Jordan. And a really strong pipeline on our enterprise side. So, happy with it across the board. The concern we have is just as you would expect. We've got some enterprises that are being impacted by it. And those that you would expect where we saw some slowdowns there. But on a net, it was taken up by new enterprise opportunities, CSPs, content network and really interconnection growth across the board.

            "name": "Andrew Power",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Let's pick up here on page 10. As you may have seen from our supplemental reporting package, given the compressed time frame post-closing and the complexity of reconciling different reporting practices with both teams working remotely, we've included the partial period contribution from Interxion in our financial statements, but we have not included Interxion's portfolio statistics in the supplemental until next quarter. We've also tabled most of the changes to our disclosure package we discussed last quarter. We continue to see the lines blurring between product types, and we believe the distinction is becoming less meaningful. As a result, we still expect to evolve our disclosure in the coming quarters to more closely align with our customers' buying behavior and the way we manage the business. We also expect to fully reflect the Interxion portfolio statistics within our disclosure next quarter as well. Nonetheless, we provided a few pro forma data points in summary form here on page 10 to help frame the power of the combined business. I would like to point out that we slightly tweaked our definition of adjusted EBITDA this quarter to include our pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture taxes and interest expense. We use net debt to adjusted EBITDA as our primary leverage governor, and we calculate leverage on a look-through basis. In other words, we include our pro rata share of unconsolidated JV debt in the numerator. And we believe that including our pro rata share of unconsolidated JV, joint venture, EBITDA in the denominator is the intellectually honest approach. Our pro rata share of joint venture interest expense and taxes has historically been negligible, but it's becoming more meaningful as we expand our strategic private capital initiative through ventures like Ascenty in Latin America and MC Digital Realty in Japan. Let's turn to our leasing activity on page 11. We delivered solid leasing volume with balanced performance across sectors, products and geographies. We signed total bookings of $75 million, our second highest quarter on record. This does not include any contribution from Interxion, which separately signed another $10 million during the first quarter. Interxion's first quarter bookings were entirely colocation and connectivity business, with no single deal larger than 180 kilowatts. Standalone Digital Realty's first quarter bookings included a $9 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $66 million, with a weighted average lease term of nearly seven years, including a $7.5 million colocation contribution. Standalone Digital Realty added 54 new logos during the first quarter on a consolidated basis. In addition, Ascenty landed 20 new logos and Interxion added another 45 for a grand total of 119, underscoring the power of our global platform. In terms of regions, standalone Digital Realty's results showed particular strength in the Americas as well as APAC, notably in Northern Virginia here in the U.S. as well as Singapore in APAC. We leased 25 megawatts in Ashburn during the first quarter, bringing our total over the past three quarters to 57 megawatts. This activity has driven lease-up of active development as well as existing inventory, and we generated nearly 300 basis points of positive net absorption within our Northern Virginia in-service portfolio during the first quarter, from 90% occupied at year-end to 93% as of March 31. We have not yet begun to see meaningful improvement in Northern Virginia market rents, but the available inventory is being rapidly absorbed, and the pendulum appears to be swinging back towards tighter availability and healthy competitive tension. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, we've landed a leading global video streaming platform for their launch across much of Europe, which was a resounding success. Interxion, a Digital Realty company, supports this on-demand, ad-free streaming service by providing their data center infrastructure across five locations in Europe. With the growing demands for OTT video services, this is a sector that relies on highly connected data centers to deliver a superior customer experience, and we are honored to have partnered with its leading provider to help them bring their world-class content to European consumers. We helped a leading European digital service provider stand up a bare-metal cloud offering adjacent to cloud on-ramps in Sa\u0303o Paulo to support a major cloud provider's hybrid services in South America on our Ascenty platform. A global financial services firm using NVIDIA GPUs in their high-density compute cabinets chose Digital Realty because we met their high-performance computing requirements, including proximity to their legacy compute environment to ensure ultra-low latency and security. PlatformDIGITAL has been gaining significant momentum since its launch late last year. And customer-spanning industries, geographies and business objectives are making the migration. SEMrush, a SaaS provider offering online visibility and marketing analytics software subscriptions, had a requirement for a data hub with proximity to multiple leading global cloud providers and a global expansion under an aggressive timeline. We were able to solve their needs with a new deployment in Ashburn, including connectivity via our service exchange. Similarly, BIGO, a Singapore-based technology company specializing in AI-enabled video platforms needed a critical infrastructure provider to help them expand into EMEA. BIGO landed on legacy Digital Realty's Frankfurt campus. Interxion's capabilities across the region further solidifies the selection of their ideal partner. We were also able to support the 5G aspirations of a global Fortune 100 service provider by meeting their financial growth and power density requirements. We are continuing to build on our global momentum in the second quarter, and we look forward to helping customers achieve their goals during these uncertain times. Turning to our backlog on page 13. Standalone Digital Realty's curve backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stepped up from $116 million at year-end to $122 million at the end of the first quarter. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit better than our long-term historical average at four and a half months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 14, which again excludes Interxion, we signed $92 million of renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed. Activity was heavily skewed to our colocation business, and the weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the first quarter was a little over three years. While the positive mark-to-market on colocation renewals largely offset turnkey and PBB roll downs for an average cash re-leasing spread across the product types of negative 1.5%. As you may have seen, our guidance calls for cash re-leasing spreads to be down low single digits. Please keep in mind that our 2020 guidance does include Interxion, whereas we have not reflected Interxion results in our first quarter leasing statistics. Aside from a few select supplies constrained regions and metro areas, we have yet to see broad-based rental rate growth across most markets. However, we are continuing to make significant progress cycling through peak vintage renewals, the lion's share of our portfolio has recently been leased at current market rents and we are beginning to see barriers to entry emerge in a growing number of markets around the world. As a result, we expect to see continued gradual improvement on cash re-leasing spreads into 2020 and beyond. In terms of first quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy improved 40 basis points to 87.2%, largely due to positive absorption in Northern Virginia and Dallas. Same capital cash NOI was down 3.7% due to downtime related to record expirations in 2019 and reflecting a 40 basis point FX headwind. Our full year guidance implies improvement going forward. And barring any unforeseen shocks, we are cautiously optimistic that we put the low watermark for the cycle behind us. As a reminder, Interxion and the Westin Building are not included in the 2020 same-store pool, but we expect both acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward. Turning to economic risk mitigation strategies on page 15. The U.S. dollar continued to decline relative to prior year exchange rates, and FX represented roughly a 50 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results, from the top to the bottom-line. We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In terms of vertical concentration, as you can see from the pie chart on the upper right, we have limited exposure to the businesses that have been most directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our April rent collections are in line with our historical average and the sum total of customers who have reached out to request rent relief represent approximately 2% of total revenue. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have less than a 50 basis point impact to full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed, and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was down 11.6% year-over-year. As you may recall, there were several onetime items in 1Q 2019 affecting the year-over-year comparison, including a $0.065 U.K. tax benefit, another $0.065 of interest income on the Brookfield bridge loan and a full quarter contribution from consolidating Ascenty prior to closing the joint venture with Brookfield on the last day of the year ago quarter, whereas we had nearly a full quarter of dilution from the Mapletree asset sales in 1Q 2020. Excluding these non-comparable items, the year-over-year growth would have been up 1.2%. Core FFO per share missed consensus by $0.03 but was $0.03 ahead of our internal forecast, driven by strong leasing performance and operating expense savings. By our estimation, the first quarter miss relative to consensus was entirely due to the share count. Its actual results were 5% to 6% ahead of consensus on the top line and EBITDA. And most street models did not reflect the 54 million additional shares outstanding for 18 days upon closing of the Interxion combination in mid-March. As you may have seen from the press release, we opportunistically issued a little over $650 million of equity on our ATM in late March and early April. In addition, we now expect to draw down our forward equity offering sooner rather than later this year. Our 2020 guidance includes just over $0.25, or 4% headwind comprised of three items; the opportunistic equity issuance and accelerated drawdown of our equity forward; FX and COVID-19 impact, including modest drag from development delivery delays in select markets; and finally, the earlier-than-expected closing of our combination with Interxion, along with additional investments in the Interxion business to fund future growth. As you can see from the bridge chart on page 16, we expect the quarterly run rate to dip down by $0.06 in the second and third quarters before rebounding in the fourth quarter and beyond. Our recent investment activity, including Ascenty in Latin America and Interxion in EMEA, along with our capital recycling initiative and balance sheet management, have lowered the per share bar in 2020. But we believe each of these initiatives will create long-term value and set us up for accelerating growth and a greater share of global customer wallet going forward, while still providing for a well-covered dividend, which the Board raised for the 15th consecutive year in February. Last, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 17. Fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 3.8 times, while net debt to adjusted EBITDA stood at 6.6 times as of the end of the first quarter, primarily due to showing 100% of Interxion's debt on our balance sheet as of March 31, whereas it contributed just 18 days of EBITDA in the first quarter. Pro forma for a full quarter contribution from Interxion and the Westin Building, the equity issuance activity on the ATM after quarter end and settlement of the $1.1 billion forward equity offering, net debt to adjusted EBITDA remains in line with our targeted range at just over five times, while fixed charge coverage is just under five times. As a result of our proactive balance sheet management, we have ample liquidity to fund our capital spending with nearly $250 million of cash on the balance sheet as of March 31, another $1.7 billion of equity coming in post quarter end and $2 billion of availability on our global revolving credit facilities. The successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on page 18, our weighted average debt maturity is over six years and our weighted average coupon is 3%. 60% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment, and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 18, we have a clear runway with virtually no near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Shawn, would you please begin the Q&A session. Thanks for the question. This is Andy speaking. I think given the Digital team on the call is in different locations right now to social distancing, Bill asked that I quarterback handing off the questions. I think I actually can start the first one and let that team chime in. So, Singapore, obviously, is a country that was early out of the woods and now kind of back in lockdown, so -- and having some impact to our delivery time there. And Amsterdam, a different story, not really COVID-related. It's more of the government's restrictions on certain locations. I would say, in Amsterdam, we've done a very nice job about being ahead of the game there with planning for an existing now multiple campuses with our combination with Interxion, in addition to tying up some lands that are outside the restricted area. I don't -- I'm not aware of restrictions that are akin to the Amsterdam scenario really elsewhere in the portfolio. There's obviously markets where we're running up to supply constraints. I think that Amsterdam scenario is -- lends itself to the incumbent players, like Digital, and keep some of the new entrants out for sure. We are seeing more COVID-related impacts that have government intertwined. Toronto is a market where we have our campus is under construction, building out future capacity, and that the government kind of leaned in and put a halt for some time before reopening, in particular, Hillsboro, Oregon, where we're building out a campus that's significantly pre-leased. That less government restrictions, I'd say, some -- we saw a significant amount of absenteeism that caused some delay in the labor side. But again, this is just a handful of select markets where we saw some potential disruptions to our deliveries that will impact our 2020, which we try to lay out in the script. I wouldn't say it's a widespread phenomenon within our portfolio at Digital. Thank you. I'll toss that to Bill, start there. So, thanks, Jordan. Let me try and tackle this. So -- and one quick clarification. The first quarter came in above our internal expectations at $1.53. I think you might have said $1.57. So close enough for what -- where you're getting at here. So -- and we certainly had a complicated quarter for our friends on -- in the research community to follow us. I think when we're tracking the 23 or so analysts that cover us, I think we -- we only got to around seven that we're able to get all the moving parts, including interaction closing orderly into the numbers. So where we saw consensus, if you did the math, including the interaction in the share count and the like, was closer to 630-ish. And relative to beginning of the year and today, I think the things that changed that we try to highlight in our prepared remarks are -- roughly total a little over $0.25 of impact. Three buckets, the first two buckets being the major components. First one is we took this time in the context of certainly uncertain times, probably more so outside of our industry, but broader capital markets disruption and the like to do some balance sheet management. We opportunistically issued $650 million under our ATM, and we plan to bring our equity forward down sooner. That, I would say is, call it, $0.08 or so of the $0.25, and that was intentional. And that was intentional in the broader backdrop that was intentional because we also see investment opportunities to fund future growth. Hence, we've kind of took a more conservative balance sheet posture. The second major component, what I'd call on the FX and COVID impact maybe, call it, $0.13 or so in total. And I'd say it's roughly 50/50 between those two buckets. COVID has some smaller items like some -- a more conservative posture on our estimations of bad debt expense. But the major COVID item, I would say, is really going back to my response to the first question, was we are seeing certain jurisdictions in select markets putting restrictions on our ability to bring labor to the sites. So, a fantastic -- it's fantastic to have our global platform across 20 countries in 44 markets. But when you have a country like Singapore that was originally out of woods in terms of its exposure and then kind of goes back into lockdown, our 50-megawatt shell or, call it, 11 or 12-megawatt pre-leasing already, is going to certainly get delayed a couple of months. And that episodic thing in a handful of markets, which I highlighted, is certainly going to put a little dent into our revenue that is going to come across the P&L in 2020. But again, temporary impact and really goes back to the fluid dynamics around the COVID situation. And then last but not least, I would say, call it, the small minority, let's say, is Interxion related. I don't think when we stood at the beginning of the year, we thought we'd have the good fortune of navigating numerous European government jurisdictions and multiple shareholder votes and closed the transaction at the middle of March like we did. We initially estimated 1% to 2% dilution on that transaction, but the pull forward in earlier timing. And I would say a little bit, we're seeing some investment opportunities in our combined EMEA business, which will be $0.01 or so till 2020. That kind of rounds up the minority of the $0.25. Net-net, this is obviously -- we are always looking to grow our earnings as fast as possible. At the same time, I would look at our combination with Interxion, our balance sheet management, be it our cap or recycling or even the more smaller opportunistic things like further equitizing the balance sheet to fund future growth opportunities are really setting us up for more accelerating growth. And also at the same time, I don't think doing anything that's reckless in terms of our dividend coverage and the like. And then turning briefly to the re-leasing spreads. Taking a step back for half a second. Four of the five of the last years four of the last five years, we've actually had positive re-leasing spreads, if you go back to our supplemental to each of those years. This year, we're obviously guiding to down slightly. This is a stat where we usually overestimate the negative impact and outperform relative to guidance, as you saw just last year. In any given quarter, they could have an episodic customer that is renewing with an above-market lease. Usually, those transactions, be it any form of renewal, is something that's additive to our commercial negotiations where we can help these customers across multiple products, multiple geos, new business and renewals in a kind of comprehensive fashion. So, I don't think we're out of the woods on every single one of our contracts being below market whatsoever. And I think the trend is moving in the right direction in the stat. And we're certainly looking forward to getting to -- in the green territory on that stat moving forward and overall driving higher organic growth. Thanks Richard. So, I would say -- I mean we've showed a pretty consistent stair step up over now several quarters. And each and every quarter has gotten a little bit better in terms of its volume and composition on multiple fronts. So, we're at just under 75, excluding anything for Interxion and it was very diverse. As we mentioned, APAC was a big contributor. It was -- Northern Virginia was a solid contributor, but I wouldn't say it took -- stole the entire show. And I think that if you got to really to peel the onion, going back to some of Corey's and Bill's comments, either in our prepared remarks, very healthy new logos. When you add up -- our new logos up, we're up to 120 new logos. So I don't -- usually don't like to annualize that, but on a 4% -- 4,000 customers, we're talking like almost 12% new logo generation growth from the combined platform. So, very pleased on numerous other key performance indicators and I think you heard a little bit about Corey's outlook on the pipeline, moving it into 2Q. I'm pretty sure -- I don't believe David's ever given a signings pipeline or even a signings number. So, I'm not going to be the first one to unpack that on public air here. But I'm sure some transactions probably didn't get done during the quarter. I would say Europe, in particular, was in the middle of the COVID crisis a lot sooner than the United States. But I was pretty pleased when I saw close to 10 million of signings with that healthy consistency, numerous -- across numerous markets and so connectivity rich. Thanks Colby. So, I think our growth objectives for the business remain consistent. The only ounce of caution I put then is we're obviously in a whole brand-new world here that could have interim drag or longer-term acceleration, overall digital transformation that could further emphasize the growth of our business. But I think that mid to high single-digits kind of growth in our recurring cash flows or FFO, AFFO per share is still the bogey to -- or hurdle to shoot for and overcome. Going to the adjustments to FFO and to AFFO, really straight-line rents is just a GAAP phenomenon where we essentially kind of include the rental escalations or bumps. And depending on where the customers' contracts are in their life cycle, it can have a positive or negative impact. And depending on what type of -- whether customers ramping into our space or not can obviously have an impact. And the above and below market amortization is also a non-cash impact as well. So, I'm happy to -- with 4,000 customers in the breadth of our business, there's a lot of ins and outs that go into that number. If you want to ask another -- I'm not sure -- maybe I'm not hitting the heart of what you're seeking to understand there in terms of the impact. Yes, I think the more elegant answer to your first question is what's a combination of consolidating our highly connected colocation facility, the Westin Building and our combination with Interxion. Our mix of business is certainly moving much more towards a more granular customer base, more network-oriented customers. We're obviously going after the enterprise customer in hybrid multi-cloud environments. And that customer mix is going to have less -- much, much less of, call it, 15-year steady Eddie bump contracts, which is going to be at the end of the day, narrow, I believe, the gap between our FFO and AFFO per share over time versus if -- going back to our legacy, much more legacy business even -- kind of tell us kind of five years back. And then going to your second question on -- maybe I'll turn this over to Corey or Chris to answer about the second question, about customer behaviors or the buying patterns of the hyperscalers."

            "name": "Bill Stein",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. The last 90 days have been unlike anything that we've experienced in our lifetime, and our hearts go out to all those who have been directly impacted by COVID-19 especially those who've lost loved ones. No one has been immune to this crisis, but the data center industry has been fortunate to remain open for business while huge portions of the global economy have been put on hold. As you probably know, data centers have been classified as critical infrastructure and essential businesses by government agencies around the world. Our top priority is, of course, the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners. The entire data center industry has delivered a strong track record of operational excellence and uptime throughout this crisis. Digital Realty has made 100% uptime. And while we have deferred preventative maintenance and have asked customers to limit site visits to critical activities, our doors have remained open and our data centers continue to provide the trusted foundation for the digital economy. Business continuity is our core competency. We have a full-fledged pandemic playbook to ensure that we maintain service levels while prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners. We have received very high marks from our customers for our professional protocol and proactive communications throughout the crisis. For this, we owe a debt of gratitude to our operations team and particularly our frontline employees in critical data center roles. Despite the challenging environment, they have continued coming to work so that industries, governments and families can continue to connect, keep in touch and keep commerce and information flowing. We are deeply appreciative of their efforts. Let's turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on page four. In early January, we issued \u20ac1.4 billion of green euro bonds. This was our third green bond issuance, and we are now the largest U.S. REIT green bond issuer. Our green bond framework is aligned with the ICMA green bond principles with a second-party opinion provided by Sustainalytics. In mid-January, we announced that we had achieved EPA ENERGY STAR Certification for an industry-leading 29 data centers last year. In early April, we were honored to be the first data center provider to receive an EPA ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award for Energy Management. Finally, in late April, we announced a wind energy agreement to supply approximately 30% of our power needs in the Dallas, Texas area with renewable energy. On the social front, we are fortunate to be in a position to give back in the midst of this crisis. We have undertaken a comprehensive, philanthropic initiative consisting of corporate contributions, employee-matching gifts and community outreach initiatives to help support organizations combating COVID-19 around the world. We are also waiving fees for expanded service exchange connectivity for the next six months to help customers in the government, medical, emergency services and educational verticals keep critical services running. On the governance front, Jean Mandeville has joined the Board of Directors, bolstering the additions of Alexis B. Bjorlin and Dash Jamieson in January. Jean was previously Chairman of the Board at Interxion. And he has extensive experience in the technology and telecom sectors, having previously served as the CFO of Global Crossing and Singapore Technologies Telemedia as well as President of APAC for British Telecom. We are pleased to welcome Jean to the Board, and we look forward to benefiting from his leadership and expertise. On a more bittersweet note, we also have a departure to announce. Former Chairman, Dennis Singleton, has reached mandatory retirement age and will not be standing for reelection at our annual meeting. Dennis had a distinguished career prior to joining our Board, most notably as a founding partner of Spieker Properties. He has served as a Digital Realty director since our IPO in 2004, and he served as Chairman of the Board from 2012 to 2017. The company has grown nearly 50-fold since Dennis joined the Board, and he has provided sound counsel and steady leadership through the most critical junctures in the company's history, including the strategic investments that have built the business as well as leadership changes at the Board and the C-suite. He is a true gentleman and his sage counsel and collegial bearing will be sorely missed. On behalf of the entire Board of Directors, I would like to thank Dennis for his more than 15 years of service to Digital Realty, and we wish him the very, very best. Let's turn to page five, our first quarter investment activity showcased the breadth of our global platform and crystallized the transformation of our business. The highlight of the quarter was, of course, our combination with Interxion in a highly strategic and complementary transaction, creating a leading global provider of cloud and carrier-neutral data center solutions. We also closed the acquisition of a 49% interest in the Westin Building Exchange in Seattle. The Westin Building is one of the most densely interconnected facilities in North America and is home to leading global cloud, content and interconnection providers with over 150 carriers and more than 10,000 cross connects. We closed on the sale of a portfolio of 10 North American data centers to Mapletree in January, generating approximately $550 million of proceeds. We also launched our colocation product offering in Osaka, building upon the success of our hyperscale business in Japan. We opened a new data center in Dublin, the new Clonshaugh facility supports the growth of Dublin's technology sector, which is projected to boom over the next decade. We acquired a small land parcel in Frankfurt, adjacent to our existing Sossenheim campus to accelerate time to market and supply-constrained metro. Separately, Interxion has line of sight on a sizable land parcel expected to represent a strategic extension of its existing Frankfurt campus that would support the development of up to 180 megawatts of IT capacity, providing runway to support customer growth in key European metro for years to come. We announced that we turned the power on at SIN12, a 50-megawatt new development in Singapore, partially pre-leased to a major Singaporean bank and a leading global cloud provider. Finally, in April, Interxion announced it has broken ground on Interxion Paris Digital Park, a major expansion project in Paris with up to 85 megawatts of capacity. The first of four new data centers on this site will be Interxion's 8th in Paris. And the first phase is scheduled to open in late 2021. Let's turn to integration on page six. We believe our combination with Interxion has the potential to change the global data center landscape. The combined organization is well placed to meet the growing demand from cloud and content platforms, IT service providers and enterprises seeking colocation, hybrid cloud and hyperscale data center solutions. These are global, long-term opportunities that we are ideally positioned to address. Integration is our top priority for 2020. The combined company offers a comprehensive global platform for our customers and gives us a runway for significant growth. We have obviously had to adapt to the current environment. The transaction closed on March 13, and we began sheltering in place the following week. Many of the initial meetings between teams that would have taken place in person have been virtual instead, and that has obviously created some challenges. But both teams have risen to the challenge. During that first week, we had to implement policies, procedures and customer communications for operating in the midst of a global pandemic. As I mentioned earlier, I'm deeply grateful for the way both teams have come together to continue to serve our customers' needs throughout this crisis. Based on our work prior to closing and within just the past few weeks, we've made progress on our corporate integration efforts, including finalizing our integration governance and combined EMEA leadership structure, which we will be rolling out in the coming weeks. There will be more to come over the next several quarters, but we are pleased with our progress to date. Let's turn to the macro environment on page seven. As we are all aware, the global economy has ground to a halt. As you've heard me say many times before, data center demand is not directly correlated to job growth, and we are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers, both growing faster than global GDP growth and somewhat insulated from economic volatility. To put a finer point on the secular demand drivers underpinning our business, I'd like to draw your attention to page eight. McKinsey recently conducted a global survey of 3,600 B2B decision-makers on their business outlook and priorities. The surveyed executives stated they value digital interactions with customers as two to three times more important than traditional interactions, reflecting continued need for digital infrastructure and capacity demand for data centers. According to the market intelligence firm Intricately, on average, enterprises utilize 27 cloud products, deployed and consumed across eight points of presence globally. We are seeing indicators of this demand globally across our platform in the volume of new logos led by our enterprise vertical, as these firms shift their strategy to enable digital interactions for their customers. Digital Realty was recently named a worldwide leader in the IDC MarketScape Colocation and Interconnection Services Provider Assessment report, noting PlatformDIGITAL provides a global scale platform to enable digital transformation in a consistent, modular fashion. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our unique positioning to capture the global data center demand opportunity. Given the resiliency of demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our portfolio to meet these needs, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Thanks, Andy. So, we're absolutely delighted to partner with NVIDIA to extend machine and deep learning to data center to accelerate artificial intelligence. Digital is an early stage partner with NVIDIA. And together, we've pre-certified 24 locations around the world. Our Data Hub solution featuring NVIDIA DGX PODs provides buyers with a validated reference architecture and solution starter kit for rapid AI deployments on PlatformDIGITAL around the world. The combination of NVIDIA DGX and PlatformDIGITAL enables a secure and performance data center architecture for enterprises at any scale. We do have a pipeline of similar ones. In addition to NVIDIA, we've released solution offers with Cisco, IBM and Vapor IO. This is part of the PlatformDIGITAL road map that we published last November when we launched the platform. We're seeing multiple customer use cases across many industries. We've captured multiple customer wins across financial services, transportation and logistics and IT service industries. All of these customers are looking to unbound data processing and exchange limitations to enable intelligent insights for their business. Initial use cases include complex trade analytics and risk, AI-based cybersecurity and route optimization for connected vehicles. Hey thanks, Jordan. I hope you and your family are healthy and safe as well. I'm going to toss it over to Corey to talk pipeline in response to your question there. I think -- honestly, if you look at the results so far, Interxion really only contributed, call it, two weeks or so of contribution. So, the first quarter results is primarily Digital. And just to reiterate, we did really do the facts and circumstances of moving to a work-from-home environment literally the day we closed Interxion. Put all of our statistics in here, excluding Interxion's, you could see the entire legacy or classic Digital business fundamentals. And in terms of contribution to guidance, I was not on the fourth quarter call, but Matt Mercier stepped in and did a very nice job, I thought, in laying out some kind of guide rails for legacy Digital, including on a standalone basis, what our top line would be and adjusting for the ins and outs of our dispositions and capital recycling, what we've called organic revenue growth in the mid-single-digits in 2020, which I would affirm is still accurate. And I would also -- we also stated that we had industry-leading EBITDA margins, which I would also affirm is still accurate. And I think that -- I'd say that's accurate, even pro forma for our Interxion combination, which obviously is a lower EBITDA margin business. So, just the comments were made back in February in terms of our organic growth profile, I would say, flow through into the guidance. And I would say the organic growth of the Digital business was a major driver of the outperformance from our internal perspective in the first quarter, which was a largely Digital-only quarter. Sure. Thanks, Erik. So, just to be clear, you're asking kind of to unpackage the $823 million of revenue in the quarter in terms of contribution from each of the major transactions. The -- is -- that was your question, correct? So, of the $823 million, and I'm kind of bridging you between the quarter's changes, I would say, Interxion was probably like a $40 million -- almost $47-ish million contribution and the rest was really the ins and outs of Digital. And I think we put a cap rate and a return on the Westin purchase, about a 5.8% return so that you can kind of back into flipping that from an unconsolidated joint venture to a consolidated joint venture investment. And Erik, we're also more than happy to follow up post the call or work through any of the granularity. We understand when you joint venture and recycle $1.4 billion of capital in the last 90-plus days, buy out a partner on a $700 million asset and close a $8.5 billion strategic combination in Europe, it's not a simple quarter from anyone's modeling perspective. Sure. So, maybe I'll start off with like a little kind of market tour, and I'll ask Corey to chime in a little bit on what he's seeing on the customer standpoint. Northern Virginia was a very strong quarter. It was, I believe, our top quarter top market in terms of overall signings. It was strong on the colocation or connection front. Some great startings at pretty attractive pricings into our colo suites on that campus. We also were very successful in backfilling into that market, numerous recently vacated suites. So, that's kind of high flow-through leasing activity because the suite is already built and constructed. And lastly, it was the home of our largest transaction for the quarter where we imported from out of region, a fairly sizable transaction all on the hyperscale front. So all around, pretty strong. I would say it's not a market that is completely out of the woods. I would attribute our success there due to a few things. One, our offering is really an entire platform offering, numerous of our sales into any market are going to include numerous products and numerous geos at the same time. Two, we have a very large installed and growing customer base that wants to grow with adjacency; and then three, in Northern Virginia, we have, I believe, the longest runway of future-proofing our customers' growth in terms of capacity, potential build-out. And I would say, while more commodity-like providers on the periphery in North Virginia are certainly cutting rates, that kind of almost internal competitive [Indiscernible] for our customers to get specific suites on various products within the various campuses in Ashburn certainly accrued itself to our platform and generate better economics. If you can turn to kind of quickly the rest of North America, brighter spots, I would say, is Toronto. It has been a very attractive location where we're quickly going through capacity there, and we're about to launch our colocation suite, which will be a great new entrance to that market. Northern -- New York City Metro, both in the city and also in New Jersey has been seeing a rebound. That's been on the colocation connectivity side as well as, I'd say, call it, half a megawatt to two megawatt-type scale as enterprise-type demand, financial service in particular. Santa Clara remains very tight. Other markets of robustness outside of North America, Asia-Pacific had a very strong quarter. Early signs in the smaller dollars or kilowatts from our Osaka launch of colocation interconnection, we're off to a great start there. And our SIN12 building, I think I mentioned, has had wins with a major enterprise, a leading Asia-Pacific bank as well as a major CSP. Swinging down to Latin America, Sa\u0303o Paulo had success where we export demand from a European-based customer on the enterprise side into the colo connectivity suites in our Ascenty platform. And then last but not least, in Europe, we -- in our prepared remarks, we mentioned the strength of selling some Asia customers into our legacy Digital colo facility in Frankfurt. The London Cloud House is off to a good start. And then last but not least, Interxion, which we didn't kind of put on the page in our results, I would reiterate, did a very healthy $10 million of signings. It was a very attractive book of business with no major signing above 180 kilowatts. I believe the connectivity signings were close to 35-plus percent of the signings. So, also a very successful quarter in terms of the Interxion activity. Corey, anything to add on that? Thanks Shawn. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we enhanced the value of our platform, successfully closing on our highly strategic combination with Interxion as well as the acquisition of the Westin Building in Seattle and the Mapletree portfolio sale. Second, we also underscored our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders with community outreach initiatives, a renewable wind energy contract and new additions to our Board. Third, we maintain steadfast support for our customers, prioritizing health and safety while maintaining service levels. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet with the opportunistic issuance of $650 million of equity capital. I'd like to conclude today's call by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family, but particularly our frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world turning in the midst of this global pandemic. I hope you all stay safe and healthy and we hope to see many of you in person again soon. Thank you."

During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Callers will be limited to one question plus a follow-up and we will conclude promptly at the bottom of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Huseby, Digital Realty\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJim Huseby: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me on today\u2019s call are CEO, Bill Stein; and President and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call, and they will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today\u2019s call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of the risks related to our business, please see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I\u2019d like to hit the tops of the waves on our fourth quarter results. We further strengthened connections with customers with $156 million of new bookings with record results in both a zero to one megawatt and greater than a megawatt category and ended the year with $500 million in new bookings, a 15% increase over the prior year. We also continue to enhance our global platform with the completion of organic development projects in multiple metros despite the continued challenges presented by the pandemic and the global supply chain in addition to strategic investments, establishing Digital Realty as the leading pan-African provider. Financially, we had a solid quarter with full year results above the high end of the guidance range that we provided this time last year. And finally, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet by raising equity capital through the establishment of Digital Core REIT in a highly successful IPO on the Singapore Stock Exchange and the related sale of a 90% interest in 10 fully utilized core data centers. As a perpetual capital partner, Digital Realty and Digital Core REIT can continue to work together while providing our customers with a seamless experience. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Stein: Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework. And we made further progress on each front during the fourth quarter. First, we continue to globalize our business with record global bookings and strength across all regions and all product types, including quarterly highs in both our sub-one megawatt and greater than one megawatt categories. We also announced two significant global initiatives. First, in December, we announced the successful listing of Digital Core REIT as a standalone publicly traded company on the Singapore Stock Exchange. Digital Realty contributed a 90% interest in a portfolio of 10 core data centers concentrated in top-tier markets across the U.S. and Canada, valued at $1.4 billion at a 4.25% cap rate. We generated net proceeds of over $950 million from the transaction and we retained a 35% equity interest in the publicly traded REIT. The offering was very well received, and Digital Core REIT has traded up approximately 30% since the IPO, enhancing the gain on our remaining ownership stake. In addition to providing investors a stable cash flow stream from a portfolio of high-quality core data centers, Digital Core REIT offers key strategic benefits to Digital Realty. First, Digital Core REIT is a perpetual capital partner. It has a long-term investment horizon and a global mandate to invest in stabilized income-producing data centers. Second, Digital Core REIT has been carefully crafted to provide a seamless customer experience. Digital Core REIT is sponsored by and externally managed by Digital Realty. We will continue to manage the properties providing the same level of operational excellence, and we will earn fees for asset and property management as well as acquisitions, dispositions and development. From a customer perspective, nothing changes when we contribute an asset to Digital Core REIT. Third, Digital Core REIT is an ideal partner vehicle for Digital Realty. We expect to contribute additional stabilized core assets to Digital Core REIT in the future, and we may also co-invest alongside Digital Core REIT on future investment activity. Finally, our interests are aligned. As mentioned, Digital Realty will continue to own a 10% direct ownership stake in each of the assets in addition to 35% in the publicly traded vehicle. Digital Core REIT is led by two long-time Digital Realty team members, John Stewart, who most of you know well, along with Dan Tith. We are excited about their opportunity to create value for Digital Core REIT unitholders, including Digital Realty. Our second global initiative, which we announced just after quarter-end, is the definitive agreement to acquire roughly a 55% stake in Teraco, Africa\u2019s leading carrier-neutral colocation provider. This acquisition immediately establishes Digital Realty as the leading colocation and interconnection provider on the high-growth African continent and builds upon our earlier investments in Africa with iColo, in both Kenya and Mozambique and in Medallion in Nigeria. Teraco complements these investments as well as our highly connected facilities in the Mediterranean by hosting the key strategic landing endpoints for subsea cables circling Africa. From Marseille and Athens in the North; Mombasa and Maputo along the east; Durban and Cape Town in the South; and Lagos along the Western Coast, PlatformDIGITAL is supporting the growth of our customers as well as the broader digital transformation of the entire African continent. Teraco has seven state-of-the-art data centers across three key metros in South Africa and serves over 600 customers, including more than 275 connectivity providers, over 25 cloud and content platforms and approximately 300 enterprises. Teraco facilitates approximately 22,000 interconnections between customers and hosts seven cloud on-ramps and provides direct access to seven subsea cables. Teraco has historically generated healthy double-digit growth in revenue and EBITDA. In addition, more than half of Teraco\u2019s in-service portfolio was developed within the past two years. The current development pipeline will expand the existing asset base by over 25%. And Teraco owns land adjacent to its highly connected campuses in Johannesburg and Cape Town that will support another doubling of the in-place capacity, representing significant embedded growth potential and providing considerable runway to support our customers\u2019 growth. Leading global cloud and content platforms have recently begun making significant investments in Africa, given the existing capacity within the in-service portfolio, the incremental capacity currently under construction and the strategic landholdings to support future expansion. Teraco is uniquely positioned to support the expected growth of digital infrastructure in Africa over the next several years. Let\u2019s discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3. During the fourth quarter, Digital Realty earned Nareit\u2019s Leader in the Light Award for the fifth consecutive year, complementing the company\u2019s five-star GRESB rating and top ranking within the technology and science sector. Digital Realty was also named one of America\u2019s most responsible companies by Newsweek and was the number one ranked data center company. We continue to advance our sustainable financing strategy, recasting and upsizing our credit facility with improved terms while incorporating a sustainability-linked pricing component with pricing subject to adjustment based on annual performance against certain green targets. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment, while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors and our employees, along with the broader society and advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all these stakeholders. Let\u2019s turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in the expansion of our global platform. In addition to the Teraco transaction, we\u2019ve grown our presence along the Eastern Coast of Africa with iColo and supplemented our acquisition of Medallion data centers in Nigeria with two land purchases in Lagos for future development. Over the next decade, we expect to see huge opportunity for global businesses to tap into Africa\u2019s rapidly growing Internet economy, and Digital Realty is uniquely positioned to enable this growth. We also continue to invest in the organic growth of our platform. We spent $580 million on growth CapEx in the fourth quarter, our largest quarterly growth CapEx investment to date. We currently have 44 projects underway, totaling more than 250 megawatts of IT capacity in 27 metros around the world. This capacity was 46% presold as of year-end. Geographically, we continue to invest most heavily in EMEA with 27 projects underway, totaling more than 140 megawatts across 16 metros. In Asia-Pacific, we delivered several development projects during the fourth quarter, including facilities in Singapore and Hong Kong. In January, we opened Digital Seoul 1, our first data center in South Korea and the first carrier-neutral facility in the country. This facility will serve as a connectivity gateway for latency-sensitive customer workloads, but can be connected to hyperscale applications hosted in our second facility in Korea, totaling over 60 megawatts of capacity currently under construction just outside of the city center. The two facilities will be tied together with fiber to create a connected campus and will complement each other by providing solutions for the full customer spectrum, from small performance sensitive colocation customers to huge hyperscale deployments. In North America, our development pipeline is diversified by product mix as well as geographically with projects underway in seven different markets. We continue to see strong hyperscale demand in Hillsboro, while we are expanding in Downtown Atlanta to bring on additional colocation capacity at one of the most highly connected destinations in the Southeastern United States. We are bringing capacity online in both these markets, among others, given the robust demand backdrop and our tightening inventory position. Let\u2019s turn to the macro environment on Page 5. We\u2019re fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. Our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on platform digital. Our customers continue to solve some of the most complex IT infrastructure connectivity and data integration challenges. We are witnessing a growing trend of multinational companies across all segments, deploying and connecting large, private data infrastructure footprints on PlatformDIGITAL across multiple regions and metros globally. Industry research firm Gartner recently updated their global IT spending forecast for 2022, projecting a 5.1% increase to $4.5 trillion, driven by companies investing in digital data growth strategies. Additionally, Gartner believes that by 2024, 75% of organizations will have deployed multiple data hubs to drive mission-critical data analytics sharing and governance in support of digital data growth strategies. These forecasts are consistent with our view of where the puck is headed. Our market intelligence tool, the Data Gravity Index, forecasts similar growth in the intensity of data creation and its gravitational pull on global IT infrastructure. In addition, our industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities serves as the global playbook for industry collaboration to tackle data gravity challenges head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity for all companies. Digital Realty was recently named Company of the Year by Frost & Sullivan for North American Data Center Best Practices. This award reflects our continued focus on operational excellence, underpinned by continuous innovation and execution of the PlatformDIGITAL road map. We are honored by the strong validation of the differentiated value proposition we are creating for customers and partners. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.\nAndy Power: Thank you, Bill. Let\u2019s turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. As Bill noted, we delivered record bookings of $156 million with an $11 million contribution from interconnection during the fourth quarter. Volume was elevated across both of our primary reporting categories in the quarter with a healthy mix between enterprise and hyperscale business. For the full year, we booked $0.5 billion of new business with roughly a 60/40 split between greater than one megawatt and less than one megawatt plus interconnection. The EMEA region had a particularly strong quarter accounting for approximately 60% of total bookings led by Frankfurt with standout performance across product types. The fourth quarter was also notable for the strength of cross-selling between regions. Nearly 30% of our sub-one megawatt plus interconnection bookings were exported from one region to another, a strong indication of the value customers derive from our global platform. Not surprisingly, the Americas was our biggest exporter with most deals landing in EMEA, followed by APAC. Both EMEA and APAC had strong export quarters as well, with over 15% of their sub-one megawatt plus interconnection bookings landing out of region. The weighted average lease term was nearly 10 years primarily driven by hyperscale pre-leasing in EMEA. We landed over 130 new logos during the fourth quarter, our second best quarterly result and just shy of last quarter\u2019s record 140 for our full year total of 480 new logos. We are encouraged by the consistent organic growth of our customer base, and we view these results as strong validation of platform digital and our global strategy. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, Graphcore, a British semiconductor company that develops accelerators and systems for AI and machine learning, selected PlatformDIGITAL to address their density, security and scale requirements. The initial deployment will land in Amsterdam to be followed by a global rollout, and we are also collaborating on solution engineering and joint go-to-market activities. A leading high-frequency trading shop is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to extend their high-performance computing platform across two continents and expand trading into two new international metros, while approving cloud access and business continuity state side. A Global 2000 U.S. energy provider is expanding with Digital Realty, consolidating their own on-premise facilities and using PlatformDIGITAL to scale their business across multiple metros. A leading aerospace manufacturing and services company is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL, leveraging dense interconnection to support data exchange across four new markets. A Global 2000 insurance brokerage is consolidating their data center footprint and has adopted PlatformDIGITAL to remove data gravity barriers and interconnect with clouds across multiple metros. An Ivy League university is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to exit their own on-premise facility and enhance their access to the health care provider community for data exchange. And finally, a major APAC food services organization selected PlatformDIGITAL to improve cloud connectivity and leverage the local centers of data exchange in Japan. Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced, rose from $330 million to $378 million as our fourth \u2013 record fourth quarter signings more than offset commencements. The lag between signings and commencements was unusually high at nearly 14 months primarily driven by long-term leases on recent development starts in EMEA as customers accelerated efforts to secure a long-term runway for growth against a backdrop of steadily dwindling inventory. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed $151 million of renewal leases during the fourth quarter in addition to the record new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the fourth quarter was nearly four years. Renewal rates rolled down 4%, driven by a handful of large deals in North America as negative re-leasing spreads on greater than one megawatt renewals more than offset the positive releasing spreads on the sub-one megawatt renewals. In terms of operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy ticked down 60 basis points, almost entirely due to development deliveries placed in service during the quarter. Same capital cash NOI growth was negative 6.6% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by churn in North America as well as higher property operating and net utilities expense. As a reminder, the 2021 same-store pool did not include the Westin Building in Seattle, the Interxion platform in EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece or Altus IT in Croatia. Each of these businesses will be included in the same-store pool beginning in the first quarter of 2022, and each is expected to contribute to improving same-store growth going forward, partially offset by higher property taxes as well as FX headwinds expected in 2022. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. The U.S. dollar strengthened during the fourth quarter relative to prior year exchange rates, and FX represented roughly a 130 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to the currency risk from an economic perspective. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed-rate debt, a 100 basis point move in base rates would have roughly a 50 basis point impact on our full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed with a well-diversified menu of public and private capital sources available to fund the growth of our business. In terms of earnings growth, fourth quarter core FFO per share was up 4% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially, driven by solid operational execution, cost controls and a reduction in financing costs due to proactive balance sheet management over the past 12 months. For the full year, core FFO per share was up 5% year-over-year and came in $0.03 above the high end of our initial guidance range, which did not contemplate the contribution of $1.4 billion of assets through Digital Core REIT in early December. As a reminder, full year core FFO per share excludes the $20 million promote fee on the Prudential joint venture in the third quarter as well as the $25 million PPA settlement in the first quarter. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect core FFO per share will be between $6.80 and $6.90, including the 1% dilution from Teraco as well as 100 basis points to 200 basis points of expected FX headwinds due to the strength of the dollar relative to 2021. We expect to deliver revenue between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion in 2022 and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.5 billion. Given the tightened supply environment, we expect flat cash renewal rates in 2022, up from slightly negative in 2021. And we expect overall portfolio occupancy to remain within the current range despite the significant new capacity scheduled to come online during the year in addition to the embedded lease-up potential within the Teraco portfolio. We are off to a great start on our financing plans for the year with a highly successful \u20ac750 million bond offering in early January of 10.5-year paper at 1 3/8% [ph] coupon. Finally, we expect to raise $500 million to $1 billion from capital recycling whether through contributions to Digital Core REIT, noncore asset sales to third parties or a combination of both. In terms of the quarterly dividend, the distribution policy is ultimately a Board-level decision. Given the continued growth in our cash flows and taxable income, we would expect to see continued growth in the per share dividend, just as we have had each and every year since our IPO in 2004. Last, but certainly not least, let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet on Page 12. As of year-end, our reported leverage ratio stood at 6.1 times, while fixed charge coverage was 5.4 times. Pro forma for settlement of the $1 billion September forward equity offering, leverage drops to 5.7 times, while fixed charge coverage also improved to 5.7 times. We continue to execute on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. As Bill previously mentioned, we recast our credit facility during the fourth quarter, upsizing from $2.35 billion to $3 billion, extending the maturity by three years and tightening pricing by five basis points. We also incorporated a sustainability-linked pricing component subject to adjustment based on annual performance targets, further demonstrating our commitment to sustainable business practices. Subsequent to quarter end, we raised approximately $850 million from the 10.5-year euro bonds at 1.375%, and we used a portion of the proceeds to redeem all $450 million of our outstanding 4.75% U.S. dollar bonds due 2025. This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is over six years and our weighted average coupon is just over 2%. A little over three quarters of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 94% of our debt is fixed rate, guarding against a rising rate environment. And 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we\u2019ll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jon Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJon Atkin: Thanks. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about supply chain. Last call, you talked about kind of on time and on budget in terms of delivery of turnkey inventory. Any update on that? And did that play a role in the slightly more elongated commencement timeframe associated with your leasing of 14 months compared to what you\u2019ve done in the past?\nBill Stein: Thanks, John. We are seeing some effects on the supply chain. Clearly, most of the equipment is strained in terms of availability, including data center infrastructure, servers and network gear, and shortages in things like chips and fans are impacting many industries, not just ours. Our VMI program, the vendor-managed inventory program, utilizes our knowledge and market way to overcome some of these disruptions. I believe that we\u2019re the gold standard for managing vendors and for forecasting. And this gives us priority for production slots with our suppliers. This program has allowed us to reduce lead times by an average of 70% versus standard. Increased \u2013 we increased the VMI pool when COVID hit. So, I think we\u2019re pretty well prepared for the current disruptions. And we\u2019re evaluating the program to expand it even further to better support our programs. Steel, aluminum and copper is also rising, which affects some fit-out by cages and cabinets. This is only \u2013 this really only comes into play though, for projects that are scheduled for completion in the next six to 12 months. And in those cases, we\u2019re working closely with our customers to order gear early to lock in the pricing and avoid any shipment delays. Let me hand it over to Andy to address the relationship to delay in construction and anything else that he might want to add.\nAndy Power: Sure. I think Bill covered it. But just on the \u2013 John, the elongated book-to-bill or time line, which had nothing really do with supply chain. Two factors there: one, you can see in the Americas region, we did a powered base shell deal, obviously, a longer lead time to develop that and bring that online; and then in Europe, where we have the concentration of our large deals obviously, stand out quarter for EMEA across the board. Some of the plus megawatt deals were rather large in size and takedowns. And I think there\u2019s a project or two where we\u2019re literally at land state and the customers are looking to really just book that future runway to growth. So that was kind of what drugged the overall time line out for sign to commence.\nJon Atkin: And then maybe more broadly, I wondered if you could maybe comment on the willingness to flex for \u2013 your CapEx budget to a higher level, you accelerated compared to last year. But given all the demand that\u2019s out there and all the aggressive investment by some of your peers in order to maintain your share, what is your thought about flexing the CapEx budget higher? And any kind of updated thoughts on financing mix as to how you might do that? It seems like that would really affect 2022 CapEx. But further out, any kind of broad thoughts on that would be appreciated.\nAndy Power: Sure. So, we finished 2021 at south of $2.2 billion of development CapEx or so. Our guidance range is a step-up of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion of CapEx. You can just look at our press release throughout the year. We\u2019ve been opening new markets, expanding addressable market, building out the pipeline from land to shells to finish suites to colo and connectivity inventory. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking to change our posture. We really go market-by-market supply chain \u2013 or excuse me, market-by-market supply-demand view. And we think we\u2019re positioning ahead of our competitors. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a really necessary reactionary flex needed into our business. But if the opportunity presents itself, we look at that, and we\u2019ll make those investments. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ve got a diverse menu of capital sources to fuel our growth.\nJon Atkin: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. I was curious, first, if you can unpack the guidance for the same capital cash NOI growth of down 2.5% to 3.5%. Maybe some of the puts and takes in there and how that might play out over the course of the year? I can share the follow-up after this one.\nAndy Power: Sure. Thanks, Michael. So just a quick backdrop on same capital. So last year, we guided slightly negative on same capital or \u2013 and we came in at 4.4% same-capital cash NOI is negative. This was slightly worse than the year prior. As I mentioned, that was a real subset of the pool that we reported in 2021. You flip to 2022, you call it almost 80% of our company is in that pool with the addition of the Westin Building, Interxion, Lamda Hellix and Altus IT in Croatia. So you get a much larger sample set and an improving complexion. So from negative 4.4%, we guided to, call it, negative 3% at the midpoint. It\u2019s really being impacted by two elements: one, currency. We hedge to the balance sheet. So all the currency fluctuations are hitting that pool, if you call \u2013 look at that on a constant currency, you\u2019re probably closer to negative 1%. And then if you peel back the onion on that, it\u2019s really strong positives \u2013 several \u2013 like 3% or so in that APAC, close to flat in EMEA due to the utilities being elevated and then the negative contribution largely focused in the Americas region, where we are getting hit by what looks like it would be a property tax increase that\u2019s going to hit us in that year \u2013 or excuse me, in 2022, but not continue in 2023 and beyond. And the major driver of still not being more firmly into positive, although improving really is downtime for releasing of some of the larger non-retentions. We\u2019ve been working away at that and making good activity. Actually re-leasing it and then moving those customers into that space. It just takes time, not because of supply chain politics, more of that one 5-megawatt customer leads and a new 5-megawatt customer refills the refurbs, the new PDUs, et cetera, it just takes time. And for those chunky deals, you lose a month or two or rent in a year, that\u2019s just \u2013 it won\u2019t flow through until you get into 2023. So net-net, not in positive territory firmly on a reported basis yet, but heading that way.\nMichael Rollins: And just to follow up on some comments that you and the team have provided earlier on just pricing. Can you give us an update on the pricing strategy, the opportunities to leverage price, whether it\u2019s because of the inflationary backdrop or some of the other macro factors that you\u2019re dealing with? And then how that would affect the financial performance over time?\nAndy Power: Sure. So I mean, pricing from two lenses. Obviously, you saw in the guidance, the \u2013 we\u2019re guiding towards flat releasing spreads on our renewals for 2020. So that\u2019s not new news. We\u2019ve been mentioning that we\u2019ve been working our way into that positive territory partly due to mix of expirations, but certainly, I would say, pricing related and then also, call it, pricing on new deals. Holistically, I think our supply chain team has done a really and design [indiscernible] team done a really good job insulating us given our scale, our consistency in market. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s industry-wide. And if you\u2019re a newer, smaller, more fledgling or regional competitor that\u2019s creating disruptions from an inflation standpoint and there\u2019s just overall strains on delivery of capacity, whether it\u2019s moratoriums in certain countries or the ability to deliver power. All of these elements, I\u2019d say, add up together to, I think, be an incremental benefit to our value proposition to our customer of having this incumbent platform of 26 countries, 50 metros with one way for growth that the pricing pendulum feels like it\u2019s continuing to slowly swing more and more in our favor.\nOperator: The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk about the strength you had in the less than one megawatt category. Maybe you could break down where you\u2019re seeing the most success, whether it\u2019s traditional enterprise, smaller hyperscale edge nodes? And do you think that study improvement you\u2019ve had is sustainable going forward? And then my second question was on the asset disposition front. Andy, I think in the past, you said you don\u2019t have a lot left to do on noncore. So should we assume that on a heavier weighting towards SREIT contributions throughout the course of the year? And related to that, where do you think your leverage slightly north of six times, should we expect it to remain elevated? Or are you looking to drive that down with the Teraco financing and potentially other asset sales? Thanks.\nAndy Power: Well, I\u2019ll have Corey start us off on the enterprise less-than-megawatt interconnection category. And then I can filling any factoids and talked about source and uses on your second question.\nCorey Dyer: Yes. Thanks, Eric, for the question. I\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019re really happy and feel good about the healthy demand that we\u2019re getting out of the sub-1 megawatt smart space. It seem to be consistent about kind of where we\u2019re growing that and how it\u2019s been building. We mentioned the enterprise demand and just where it\u2019s coming across. It\u2019s coming across from a lot of our customers trying to take advantage of hybrid IT environments. And so we\u2019re seeing that come across the board. Across the globe, we have really strong demand in pipeline. And the nice thing about it is it\u2019s coming from an enterprise perspective from us, two thirds of that pipeline is coming through as enterprise. And we\u2019re also getting good channel progress from it. So from a sub-1 megawatt perspective, is it sustainable? Is it something that we\u2019re going to continue. I think you\u2019re going to see it continue. And we\u2019re happy with where we\u2019re seeing that demand across all regions and coming through the channel specifically and then also enterprises. So, we\u2019re happy about where that is, and I think it\u2019s going to continue.\nAndy Power: Just to add a couple of more reasonable tidbits, Eric. So EMEA was an absolute standout for the less than a megawatt, as you saw in the numbers. Frankfurt, London, Paris, Amsterdam Marseille, big contributors. Over half of our new logos actually came out of that region. In the Americas, New York, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta were the top markets and Singapore is obviously the standout in APAC. And do you \u2013 Eric, do you mind just repeating the second part of your question about the source use? I know I heard the first part about it is noncore versus contribution actually. What was the second part of your question?\nEric Luebchow: And just how we should think about your leverage throughout the year? You\u2019re a little above six times. I know you have the equity forward, you have the Teraco financing. Just how we should think about the cadence of leverage this year? That would be helpful. Thanks.\nAndy Power: Sure. As so you see in the guidance table, we put about $0.5 billion to $1 billion of, call it, capital recycling, which would be both of these categories. We ended the year with really a 60 \u2013 a one-off asset for $60 million that will be likely redeveloped into a residential project in San Jose. And there are, call it, a short list of whittling down of incremental noncore dispositions that could happen during the year it would be a piece of that. And then I think looking for incremental contributions to digital core REIT would probably be the larger segment of that source of capital. That\u2019s obviously been a great success. John Stewart, after 32 earnings calls, hung up the HP 12C, now looking to grow that vehicle. In terms of funding for the year, \u2013 we finished out the year with about almost $1 billion of proceeds if you include that one-off asset plus digital core REIT in December. That all put the back on 12/31 with $140-ish million of cash, $40 million of \u2013 excuse me, $400 million drawn on a $3.3 billion credit facility. We got lucky and beat the rate march with a $850 million euro bond beginning of the year. That\u2019s probably an incremental $500 million proceeds. We still have the $1 billion undrawn forward that will take down. So those combinations of forces and uses will essentially fund the closing of the $1.7 billion purchase of Teraco. And then obviously, those incremental noncore dispose or incremental contributions in the back half of the year will be the, call it, the replenishing of the capital stack, and we\u2019ll look to leverage to, call it, say, to move more in line to our targeted leverage levels below six times for sure, as we move through the year.\nEric Luebchow: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you very much. Good evening. Andy, I just wanted to continue on the Digital Core REIT. How should we think about what to expect there for 2022? Is this going to be something where it will potentially do more deals with you? And how are those? Is it really North America focused today and in the near term? Or could we see assets from Europe or elsewhere go in there? And you mentioned the stock price appreciation. Is there any magic is 35% of magic number in terms of your stake? Or could you get \u2013 use that as a source of funding as well to take your stake down in the critical. Thanks.\nAndy Power: Yes. So the \u2013 this was essentially an evolution of our capital sources here. Date back to probably the origins when Bill created a prudential JV that just actually ran its course, and we recognized a promote in the fall. Perpetual externally managed public vehicle with a global mandate, although albeit originally a North America portfolio. So over time, I would expect it to \u2013 through contributions of assets from Digital Realty, and they can also \u2013 and can also acquire third-party assets, diversify its portfolio geographically. But really with core assets, data centers that Digital Realty believes in for the long run, that have really long-term weighted average lease terms, high occupancies core to our strategy. We don\u2019t have a set exact dollar amount or time of 2022, where we\u2019re looking to do a contribution, we\u2019ll work collaboratively with John and his team to position that at the right time for Digital Core REIT and its shareholders and Digital Realty\u2019s funding plans. But I would think it will diversify over time and continue to scale, and it\u2019s been well received to date. And I think that we\u2019ll be able to build upon that success.\nSimon Flannery: And your 35% stake?\nAndy Power: I\u2019m sorry, that \u2013 there\u2019s no magic to that. That was really just a product of the size of the initial portfolio, the conservative leverage we\u2019ve put on the vehicle day one in a modest IPO size. We \u2013 the underwriters\u2019 lockup tactically expires in the next several months. So not \u2013 it\u2019s right around the corner. We have no interest to sell down. We can sell down if we want to. More likely, over time, I could see us being diluted down as digital quarry buys for cash, more assets and Digital Realty makes room for incremental investors both institutional and retail to participate in the growth of the vehicle.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Eric Rasmussen of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nEric Rasmussen: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. New logos were quite strong. I think you highlighted in your record in the quarter. Maybe just talk about what\u2019s behind the success there? And then maybe do you see that momentum sustaining into the New Year?\nCorey Dyer: Yes. So, what was our second \u2013 so first of all, thanks for the question and also thanks for just the acknowledgment of the success we\u2019re having around new logos. Second highest quarter in new logos yet our highest year in new logos at $480 million. It\u2019s really with customers coming to a hybrid IT and a data-centric kind of mindset around what they\u2019re going to do, that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing come through on the new logos. We\u2019ve got a lot of customers now picking us consistently in making those decisions on it. Where we\u2019ve seen kind of an outside growth from the new logos is around our channel. We went from channel sales of 15% up to \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, from 10% in 2020 to 15% in 2021. But the new logos we\u2019re getting are close to 20% to 25% on a quarterly basis from the channel. So when you ask where it\u2019s coming from, it\u2019s coming across the whole globe. You also think through our exports. We mentioned that 30% of our export business \u2013 or 30% of our business is growing export, meaning across regions and landing in EMEA at 60%. So really good progress, across the globe on new logos supported by strong success with the channel. And I think we\u2019re going to see that continue as well. So thanks for the question, Eric.\nEric Rasmussen: Great. And then maybe just \u2013 my follow-up, obviously, hyperscale was strong. But maybe talk about the types of hyperscalers you\u2019re seeing \u2013 is there a shift in the customer makeup? And what\u2019s driving that demand?\nAndy Power: So, I would maybe go region by region real quickly. I just saw there wasn\u2019t a lot of activity in APAC this particular quarter, but we had a great 2021 overall in that region across all product types, but certainly including hyperscale and we\u2019re seeing significant demand continue. And really excited with the introduction of Seoul 1, which we just opened up as well as significant activity across the Japanese market. In EMEA, we had four of the five top CSPs, all signed new business with us during the quarter. A lot of activity in Frankfurt, both in the East with the legacy interaction campus in the West with the legacy digital campus, Zurich, Marseille, Madrid and Paris were also contributors as well as Amsterdam. In North America, in the \u2013 I would say, the social media category has been a contributor and Ashburn was probably the standout for the quarter where we\u2019ve remained incredibly tight during the recovering market and continue to see strong demand.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Two, if I could, please. One was, Andy, you talked about co-investment with the Singapore Core REIT. And I\u2019m wondering now, given -- I think we\u2019re looking at about a 3.7% cap rate implied on the market cap now. whether this \u2013 how this affects how you guys think about mergers and acquisitions, and we\u2019ve seen a lot of partnership models emerge across all sorts of digital infrastructure asset classes. I\u2019d be interested in kind of hearing a little bit more about what you meant by that. And then Bill, look, I\u2019m a long-time listener, first-time caller. It\u2019s not gone unnoticed that John is taking over as CEO of Singapore Core REIT. Andy has become President, you\u2019ve moved to Austin. I mean, we\u2019re all big fans of what you\u2019ve done, what are we \u2013 should we be expecting something? And I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on the succession right now. Thank you.\nGreg Wright: David, it\u2019s Greg Wright. Let me take the first question. Your question with respect to the SREIT and how we think about it in terms of our M&A strategy. I mean, look, I think when you look at the mandate that John and his team have for that vehicle, it\u2019s clearly \u2013 it\u2019s a yield-driven vehicle. And obviously, we assess that cost of capital for that vehicle like we do Digital Realty stand-alone. And those assets that are going to go into that, they\u2019re not going to be development, they\u2019re going to be stabilized. You\u2019ve heard John\u2019s pitch in terms of the types of assets they\u2019re looking for that to put it into that vehicle. Well, if we do future M&A or anything like that, and there happens to be those kinds of assets, they will be a natural home for that. Now we obviously have a partner, how to pursue those transactions simultaneously and be able to bifurcate the assets and to get the best cost of capital. So that\u2019s how we think about it from an M&A standpoint. But in terms of cost of capital, we still go back, we do our underwrites we\u2019re going to go out and do DCFs and take a look at the projections and take a look at the risk of the asset and we\u2019re going to price it accordingly. And obviously, having a vehicle that\u2019s got a better cost of capital is helpful. But that\u2019s generally the approach we\u2019ll use for M&A.\nAndy Power: The only thing I would add to that question, John \u2013 David was \u2013 listen, Singapore is opening up its moratorium in a very rational and prudent way. Now with the development of, call it, three new data center locations. I can\u2019t think of a better partner to be one of the three given our experience in this business, 4,000 global customers. Leadership and sustainability, experience in region. And last but not least, having a partner Digital Core REIT listed on the Singapore Exchange that could be an eventual owner of that asset allow all the citizens of Singapore to participate in the digital transformation of that country in the region. So that\u2019s a unique incremental attribute, that could play in the future.\nBill Stein: Relative to the move to Austin, I am not the only person who has moved to Austin. We moved the corporate headquarters to Austin. January of last year. And I\u2019m surrounded by people who have also moved to Austin. On my right is my Chief of Staff, Bill Bradley, on my left is my Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright. I\u2019m looking down the table here at our Chief Operating Officer, Eric Sanchak. So we have quite a few people who have moved. Andy Power is planning to move at the end of the year. So this is the corporate headquarters. We made a conscious decision to leave California for a number of reasons. I think we\u2019ve articulated that. We\u2019re going to be moving our staffs out of California and New York. We\u2019ve announced that. We have downsized in California, our offices there. We moved from [indiscernible] center up the block to space it on California Street, and we\u2019re going to be downsizing in New York as well. So there\u2019s nothing about this move to Austin that is related to succession. Relative to the movement of Andy into the President\u2019s log, I think that\u2019s your question. Our \u2013 my goal and the goal of the Board is to try to give our top-performing executives as much experience and different experience as we possibly can. So this gives Andy an opportunity to spend time in operations as well as working with Chris Sharp on the networking side, the product development side, the innovation side. We have a number of very capable executives that work for this company that report to me. And I think many of them are potential candidates to succeed me. My obligation to the Board is to make sure that they have choices. And I\u2019m trying to provide for that. And so when the time is right for me to move into retirement, I\u2019d like our Board to be able to look at a number of potential candidates inside the company and potentially consider at candidates outside the company as well. But I have no plans to step down at any point in the near future. I like what I do. And I think we\u2019re pretty good at it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brendan Lynch of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe this one is for Chris. With your growing pool of colo assets, do you have any interest in creating an internal software-defined network? And if so, what would that entail? And what competitive advantages would that provide to you?\nChris Sharp: Yes. Thanks, Brendan. I appreciate the question. Absolutely, right? That\u2019s what the customers are looking for. And I just want to go back a little bit on what Eric had asked Corey on what\u2019s driving that sub-1 megawatt. It\u2019s a sweet spot where customers are starting to outgrow colo. So it\u2019s very beneficial to our asset class to be able to support that growing need and allow them to land and expand even beyond the one megawatt and start to go to more market. But that all requires an SDN, just a software-defined networking, for the broader group, that capability to tie it all together. And so one of the things you\u2019re going to hear about later in the year is, we are absolutely bringing to market one of two platforms in the world that is purpose built for orchestrating at a higher level, that type of capability on our customer behalf, right? And I\u2019ll just impress upon everybody, it\u2019s not improving on a 10-year-old product. It\u2019s definitely purpose-built. And at the core of that is enhancing our customer experience where we\u2019re removing that technical complexity that a lot of customers are impacted by around interconnection and making it easier for them to procure and deploy in all of these locations. And that\u2019s why that new logo growth is starting to grow at record numbers, and you\u2019ll see that continually feed off of itself because they\u2019re getting a big benefit out of the community of interest that\u2019s being created around the globe. But again, at the end of the day, it\u2019s about open access and unfettered customer experience, which allows all of our customers to access the right partners throughout the globe. And this fabric, again, will facilitate the easiest route to all destinations.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. And maybe you could give a little color on the type of investment that, that will take?\nChris Sharp: Yes, absolutely, Brendan. And we had referenced a while back. We had acquired a smaller firm that was some of the leading software developers out in the market. And it\u2019s something that Andy and I constantly talk about on the right amount of capital. And so we have a dedicated software team that is purpose built in delivering that capability. And so I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s material as of yet, and we\u2019re not disclosing the details around the investment, but the impact that we get with having that team dedicated to building not only an SDN capability, but that broader orchestration is absolutely going to be beneficial, and we already have some great conversations with beta customers that are driving the direction of what those feature functionalities are going to be.\nAndy Power: And Brendan, I can confirm that the cost CapEx otherwise is included and not material to the guidance we have on the sub today.\nOperator: The next question will come from Matt Nickman of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt Nickman: Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me and I\u2019ll keep this brief. Maybe two for Andy. First off, does the 2022 guide, can you quantify what\u2019s embedded in there from Tareco, just thinking about revenue, EBITDA and core FFO? And then secondly, maybe detailing on that. Typically, you\u2019ll give some directional color on how to think about forward quarter core FFO. I\u2019m just wondering if there are any puts and takes for 1Q core FFO per share that you would flag to be mindful off? Thanks.\nAndy Power: Sure. So just working backwards. So \u2013 we didn\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t think we have like our famous bar charts without numbers on them for you in terms of the weighted distribution. We do have a pretty decent moving part here with the timing of Teraco, which I can\u2019t remember Greg mentioned this yet, but I mean we\u2019re working through the closing conditions and really the process for, call it, competition community review. But feels like it\u2019s going to happen in call it the early \u2013 very early second quarter to a couple of months in the second quarter time frame. So that does put a little bit of puts and takes from a quarterly blend. It is just to confirm the dilution from Teraco is included in our guidance table in the sub. So at the bottom line, our midpoint is call it growing, call it, 5% which is about 100 basis points increase from our guidance a year ago, which we did beat by 140 bps. We also are absorbing call it, 100 to 200 basis points of FX headwinds. And so if you normalize for those items, you call it close to the 6.5%, call it core FFO per share growth. The components of Teraco, I would call it, ballpark for a rough swag, a partial year contribution to revenue and an EBITDA basis, call it, $100-ish of revenue and 70-ish of EBITDA contribution of rough swags. Just a reminder, a data point, our year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth is deflated when you just look at our reported financials. Remember that we had a PPA in a settlement NH promote in 2021. So that plus \u2013 really that plus FX calls it has \u2013 what you call it, and 9.3% growth on a revenue basis on a constant currency basis. And then as a reminder, we\u2019re also losing revenue from our contribution to the Singapore REIT, Digital Core REIT. So that puts you up another 100 or 150 basis points higher on the revenue standpoint from a constant currency basis.\nMatt Nickman: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nBill Stein: Thank you. I\u2019d like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for 2021, as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. Our value proposition is clearly resonating with customers. We booked over $0.5 billion of new business in 2021, a 15% increase over the prior year. While attracting nearly 500 new logos. Digital Realty\u2019s operational excellence is second to none, whether it be uninterrupted performance during a record Texas ice storm or on-time delivery of new capacity despite a global pandemic and the resulting strain on global supply chains. Our customers trust us with mission-critical applications and digital delivers. We\u2019re expanding our global platform, establishing Digital Realty as the unquestioned leading colocation interconnection provider in Africa and positioning PlatformDIGITAL at key points of interconnection and subsea cable landing stations. We announced our expansion into India, together with our partner, Brookfield, and we invested in Atlas Edge gaining exposure to the European edge market all while investing over $2 billion in organic development around the world. We posted solid financial results and core FFO revenue and adjusted EBITDA above the high end of our initial guidance. Our 2022 guidance represents mid-single-digit growth in core FFO per share despite absorbing headwinds from FX, Teraco and capital recycling. Constant currency guidance for CFFO, if we were to exclude Teraco, would be in high single digits. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, raising $1 billion of proceeds from asset sales all the while positioning ourselves as the leading global provider of the full spectrum of data center solutions. I\u2019d like to once again thank the Digital Realty frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world turning. I hope that all of you stay safe and healthy, and we hope to see many of you in person again soon. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bill Stein",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework. And we made further progress on each front during the fourth quarter. First, we continue to globalize our business with record global bookings and strength across all regions and all product types, including quarterly highs in both our sub-one megawatt and greater than one megawatt categories. We also announced two significant global initiatives. First, in December, we announced the successful listing of Digital Core REIT as a standalone publicly traded company on the Singapore Stock Exchange. Digital Realty contributed a 90% interest in a portfolio of 10 core data centers concentrated in top-tier markets across the U.S. and Canada, valued at $1.4 billion at a 4.25% cap rate. We generated net proceeds of over $950 million from the transaction and we retained a 35% equity interest in the publicly traded REIT. The offering was very well received, and Digital Core REIT has traded up approximately 30% since the IPO, enhancing the gain on our remaining ownership stake. In addition to providing investors a stable cash flow stream from a portfolio of high-quality core data centers, Digital Core REIT offers key strategic benefits to Digital Realty. First, Digital Core REIT is a perpetual capital partner. It has a long-term investment horizon and a global mandate to invest in stabilized income-producing data centers. Second, Digital Core REIT has been carefully crafted to provide a seamless customer experience. Digital Core REIT is sponsored by and externally managed by Digital Realty. We will continue to manage the properties providing the same level of operational excellence, and we will earn fees for asset and property management as well as acquisitions, dispositions and development. From a customer perspective, nothing changes when we contribute an asset to Digital Core REIT. Third, Digital Core REIT is an ideal partner vehicle for Digital Realty. We expect to contribute additional stabilized core assets to Digital Core REIT in the future, and we may also co-invest alongside Digital Core REIT on future investment activity. Finally, our interests are aligned. As mentioned, Digital Realty will continue to own a 10% direct ownership stake in each of the assets in addition to 35% in the publicly traded vehicle. Digital Core REIT is led by two long-time Digital Realty team members, John Stewart, who most of you know well, along with Dan Tith. We are excited about their opportunity to create value for Digital Core REIT unitholders, including Digital Realty. Our second global initiative, which we announced just after quarter-end, is the definitive agreement to acquire roughly a 55% stake in Teraco, Africa's leading carrier-neutral colocation provider. This acquisition immediately establishes Digital Realty as the leading colocation and interconnection provider on the high-growth African continent and builds upon our earlier investments in Africa with iColo, in both Kenya and Mozambique and in Medallion in Nigeria. Teraco complements these investments as well as our highly connected facilities in the Mediterranean by hosting the key strategic landing endpoints for subsea cables circling Africa. From Marseille and Athens in the North; Mombasa and Maputo along the east; Durban and Cape Town in the South; and Lagos along the Western Coast, PlatformDIGITAL is supporting the growth of our customers as well as the broader digital transformation of the entire African continent. Teraco has seven state-of-the-art data centers across three key metros in South Africa and serves over 600 customers, including more than 275 connectivity providers, over 25 cloud and content platforms and approximately 300 enterprises. Teraco facilitates approximately 22,000 interconnections between customers and hosts seven cloud on-ramps and provides direct access to seven subsea cables. Teraco has historically generated healthy double-digit growth in revenue and EBITDA. In addition, more than half of Teraco's in-service portfolio was developed within the past two years. The current development pipeline will expand the existing asset base by over 25%. And Teraco owns land adjacent to its highly connected campuses in Johannesburg and Cape Town that will support another doubling of the in-place capacity, representing significant embedded growth potential and providing considerable runway to support our customers' growth. Leading global cloud and content platforms have recently begun making significant investments in Africa, given the existing capacity within the in-service portfolio, the incremental capacity currently under construction and the strategic landholdings to support future expansion. Teraco is uniquely positioned to support the expected growth of digital infrastructure in Africa over the next several years. Let's discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3. During the fourth quarter, Digital Realty earned Nareit's Leader in the Light Award for the fifth consecutive year, complementing the company's five-star GRESB rating and top ranking within the technology and science sector. Digital Realty was also named one of America's most responsible companies by Newsweek and was the number one ranked data center company. We continue to advance our sustainable financing strategy, recasting and upsizing our credit facility with improved terms while incorporating a sustainability-linked pricing component with pricing subject to adjustment based on annual performance against certain green targets. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment, while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors and our employees, along with the broader society and advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all these stakeholders. Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in the expansion of our global platform. In addition to the Teraco transaction, we've grown our presence along the Eastern Coast of Africa with iColo and supplemented our acquisition of Medallion data centers in Nigeria with two land purchases in Lagos for future development. Over the next decade, we expect to see huge opportunity for global businesses to tap into Africa's rapidly growing Internet economy, and Digital Realty is uniquely positioned to enable this growth. We also continue to invest in the organic growth of our platform. We spent $580 million on growth CapEx in the fourth quarter, our largest quarterly growth CapEx investment to date. We currently have 44 projects underway, totaling more than 250 megawatts of IT capacity in 27 metros around the world. This capacity was 46% presold as of year-end. Geographically, we continue to invest most heavily in EMEA with 27 projects underway, totaling more than 140 megawatts across 16 metros. In Asia-Pacific, we delivered several development projects during the fourth quarter, including facilities in Singapore and Hong Kong. In January, we opened Digital Seoul 1, our first data center in South Korea and the first carrier-neutral facility in the country. This facility will serve as a connectivity gateway for latency-sensitive customer workloads, but can be connected to hyperscale applications hosted in our second facility in Korea, totaling over 60 megawatts of capacity currently under construction just outside of the city center. The two facilities will be tied together with fiber to create a connected campus and will complement each other by providing solutions for the full customer spectrum, from small performance sensitive colocation customers to huge hyperscale deployments. In North America, our development pipeline is diversified by product mix as well as geographically with projects underway in seven different markets. We continue to see strong hyperscale demand in Hillsboro, while we are expanding in Downtown Atlanta to bring on additional colocation capacity at one of the most highly connected destinations in the Southeastern United States. We are bringing capacity online in both these markets, among others, given the robust demand backdrop and our tightening inventory position. Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. We're fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. Our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on platform digital. Our customers continue to solve some of the most complex IT infrastructure connectivity and data integration challenges. We are witnessing a growing trend of multinational companies across all segments, deploying and connecting large, private data infrastructure footprints on PlatformDIGITAL across multiple regions and metros globally. Industry research firm Gartner recently updated their global IT spending forecast for 2022, projecting a 5.1% increase to $4.5 trillion, driven by companies investing in digital data growth strategies. Additionally, Gartner believes that by 2024, 75% of organizations will have deployed multiple data hubs to drive mission-critical data analytics sharing and governance in support of digital data growth strategies. These forecasts are consistent with our view of where the puck is headed. Our market intelligence tool, the Data Gravity Index, forecasts similar growth in the intensity of data creation and its gravitational pull on global IT infrastructure. In addition, our industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities serves as the global playbook for industry collaboration to tackle data gravity challenges head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity for all companies. Digital Realty was recently named Company of the Year by Frost & Sullivan for North American Data Center Best Practices. This award reflects our continued focus on operational excellence, underpinned by continuous innovation and execution of the PlatformDIGITAL road map. We are honored by the strong validation of the differentiated value proposition we are creating for customers and partners. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Thanks, John. We are seeing some effects on the supply chain. Clearly, most of the equipment is strained in terms of availability, including data center infrastructure, servers and network gear, and shortages in things like chips and fans are impacting many industries, not just ours. Our VMI program, the vendor-managed inventory program, utilizes our knowledge and market way to overcome some of these disruptions. I believe that we're the gold standard for managing vendors and for forecasting. And this gives us priority for production slots with our suppliers. This program has allowed us to reduce lead times by an average of 70% versus standard. Increased \u2013 we increased the VMI pool when COVID hit. So, I think we're pretty well prepared for the current disruptions. And we're evaluating the program to expand it even further to better support our programs. Steel, aluminum and copper is also rising, which affects some fit-out by cages and cabinets. This is only \u2013 this really only comes into play though, for projects that are scheduled for completion in the next six to 12 months. And in those cases, we're working closely with our customers to order gear early to lock in the pricing and avoid any shipment delays. Let me hand it over to Andy to address the relationship to delay in construction and anything else that he might want to add. Relative to the move to Austin, I am not the only person who has moved to Austin. We moved the corporate headquarters to Austin. January of last year. And I'm surrounded by people who have also moved to Austin. On my right is my Chief of Staff, Bill Bradley, on my left is my Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright. I'm looking down the table here at our Chief Operating Officer, Eric Sanchak. So we have quite a few people who have moved. Andy Power is planning to move at the end of the year. So this is the corporate headquarters. We made a conscious decision to leave California for a number of reasons. I think we've articulated that. We're going to be moving our staffs out of California and New York. We've announced that. We have downsized in California, our offices there. We moved from [indiscernible] center up the block to space it on California Street, and we're going to be downsizing in New York as well. So there's nothing about this move to Austin that is related to succession. Relative to the movement of Andy into the President's log, I think that's your question. Our \u2013 my goal and the goal of the Board is to try to give our top-performing executives as much experience and different experience as we possibly can. So this gives Andy an opportunity to spend time in operations as well as working with Chris Sharp on the networking side, the product development side, the innovation side. We have a number of very capable executives that work for this company that report to me. And I think many of them are potential candidates to succeed me. My obligation to the Board is to make sure that they have choices. And I'm trying to provide for that. And so when the time is right for me to move into retirement, I'd like our Board to be able to look at a number of potential candidates inside the company and potentially consider at candidates outside the company as well. But I have no plans to step down at any point in the near future. I like what I do. And I think we're pretty good at it. Thank you. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for 2021, as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. Our value proposition is clearly resonating with customers. We booked over $0.5 billion of new business in 2021, a 15% increase over the prior year. While attracting nearly 500 new logos. Digital Realty's operational excellence is second to none, whether it be uninterrupted performance during a record Texas ice storm or on-time delivery of new capacity despite a global pandemic and the resulting strain on global supply chains. Our customers trust us with mission-critical applications and digital delivers. We're expanding our global platform, establishing Digital Realty as the unquestioned leading colocation interconnection provider in Africa and positioning PlatformDIGITAL at key points of interconnection and subsea cable landing stations. We announced our expansion into India, together with our partner, Brookfield, and we invested in Atlas Edge gaining exposure to the European edge market all while investing over $2 billion in organic development around the world. We posted solid financial results and core FFO revenue and adjusted EBITDA above the high end of our initial guidance. Our 2022 guidance represents mid-single-digit growth in core FFO per share despite absorbing headwinds from FX, Teraco and capital recycling. Constant currency guidance for CFFO, if we were to exclude Teraco, would be in high single digits. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, raising $1 billion of proceeds from asset sales all the while positioning ourselves as the leading global provider of the full spectrum of data center solutions. I'd like to once again thank the Digital Realty frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world turning. I hope that all of you stay safe and healthy, and we hope to see many of you in person again soon. Thank you."

            "name": "Andy Power",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. As Bill noted, we delivered record bookings of $156 million with an $11 million contribution from interconnection during the fourth quarter. Volume was elevated across both of our primary reporting categories in the quarter with a healthy mix between enterprise and hyperscale business. For the full year, we booked $0.5 billion of new business with roughly a 60/40 split between greater than one megawatt and less than one megawatt plus interconnection. The EMEA region had a particularly strong quarter accounting for approximately 60% of total bookings led by Frankfurt with standout performance across product types. The fourth quarter was also notable for the strength of cross-selling between regions. Nearly 30% of our sub-one megawatt plus interconnection bookings were exported from one region to another, a strong indication of the value customers derive from our global platform. Not surprisingly, the Americas was our biggest exporter with most deals landing in EMEA, followed by APAC. Both EMEA and APAC had strong export quarters as well, with over 15% of their sub-one megawatt plus interconnection bookings landing out of region. The weighted average lease term was nearly 10 years primarily driven by hyperscale pre-leasing in EMEA. We landed over 130 new logos during the fourth quarter, our second best quarterly result and just shy of last quarter's record 140 for our full year total of 480 new logos. We are encouraged by the consistent organic growth of our customer base, and we view these results as strong validation of platform digital and our global strategy. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, Graphcore, a British semiconductor company that develops accelerators and systems for AI and machine learning, selected PlatformDIGITAL to address their density, security and scale requirements. The initial deployment will land in Amsterdam to be followed by a global rollout, and we are also collaborating on solution engineering and joint go-to-market activities. A leading high-frequency trading shop is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to extend their high-performance computing platform across two continents and expand trading into two new international metros, while approving cloud access and business continuity state side. A Global 2000 U.S. energy provider is expanding with Digital Realty, consolidating their own on-premise facilities and using PlatformDIGITAL to scale their business across multiple metros. A leading aerospace manufacturing and services company is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL, leveraging dense interconnection to support data exchange across four new markets. A Global 2000 insurance brokerage is consolidating their data center footprint and has adopted PlatformDIGITAL to remove data gravity barriers and interconnect with clouds across multiple metros. An Ivy League university is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to exit their own on-premise facility and enhance their access to the health care provider community for data exchange. And finally, a major APAC food services organization selected PlatformDIGITAL to improve cloud connectivity and leverage the local centers of data exchange in Japan. Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced, rose from $330 million to $378 million as our fourth \u2013 record fourth quarter signings more than offset commencements. The lag between signings and commencements was unusually high at nearly 14 months primarily driven by long-term leases on recent development starts in EMEA as customers accelerated efforts to secure a long-term runway for growth against a backdrop of steadily dwindling inventory. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed $151 million of renewal leases during the fourth quarter in addition to the record new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the fourth quarter was nearly four years. Renewal rates rolled down 4%, driven by a handful of large deals in North America as negative re-leasing spreads on greater than one megawatt renewals more than offset the positive releasing spreads on the sub-one megawatt renewals. In terms of operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy ticked down 60 basis points, almost entirely due to development deliveries placed in service during the quarter. Same capital cash NOI growth was negative 6.6% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by churn in North America as well as higher property operating and net utilities expense. As a reminder, the 2021 same-store pool did not include the Westin Building in Seattle, the Interxion platform in EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece or Altus IT in Croatia. Each of these businesses will be included in the same-store pool beginning in the first quarter of 2022, and each is expected to contribute to improving same-store growth going forward, partially offset by higher property taxes as well as FX headwinds expected in 2022. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. The U.S. dollar strengthened during the fourth quarter relative to prior year exchange rates, and FX represented roughly a 130 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to the currency risk from an economic perspective. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed-rate debt, a 100 basis point move in base rates would have roughly a 50 basis point impact on our full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed with a well-diversified menu of public and private capital sources available to fund the growth of our business. In terms of earnings growth, fourth quarter core FFO per share was up 4% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially, driven by solid operational execution, cost controls and a reduction in financing costs due to proactive balance sheet management over the past 12 months. For the full year, core FFO per share was up 5% year-over-year and came in $0.03 above the high end of our initial guidance range, which did not contemplate the contribution of $1.4 billion of assets through Digital Core REIT in early December. As a reminder, full year core FFO per share excludes the $20 million promote fee on the Prudential joint venture in the third quarter as well as the $25 million PPA settlement in the first quarter. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect core FFO per share will be between $6.80 and $6.90, including the 1% dilution from Teraco as well as 100 basis points to 200 basis points of expected FX headwinds due to the strength of the dollar relative to 2021. We expect to deliver revenue between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion in 2022 and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.5 billion. Given the tightened supply environment, we expect flat cash renewal rates in 2022, up from slightly negative in 2021. And we expect overall portfolio occupancy to remain within the current range despite the significant new capacity scheduled to come online during the year in addition to the embedded lease-up potential within the Teraco portfolio. We are off to a great start on our financing plans for the year with a highly successful \u20ac750 million bond offering in early January of 10.5-year paper at 1 3/8% [ph] coupon. Finally, we expect to raise $500 million to $1 billion from capital recycling whether through contributions to Digital Core REIT, noncore asset sales to third parties or a combination of both. In terms of the quarterly dividend, the distribution policy is ultimately a Board-level decision. Given the continued growth in our cash flows and taxable income, we would expect to see continued growth in the per share dividend, just as we have had each and every year since our IPO in 2004. Last, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 12. As of year-end, our reported leverage ratio stood at 6.1 times, while fixed charge coverage was 5.4 times. Pro forma for settlement of the $1 billion September forward equity offering, leverage drops to 5.7 times, while fixed charge coverage also improved to 5.7 times. We continue to execute on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. As Bill previously mentioned, we recast our credit facility during the fourth quarter, upsizing from $2.35 billion to $3 billion, extending the maturity by three years and tightening pricing by five basis points. We also incorporated a sustainability-linked pricing component subject to adjustment based on annual performance targets, further demonstrating our commitment to sustainable business practices. Subsequent to quarter end, we raised approximately $850 million from the 10.5-year euro bonds at 1.375%, and we used a portion of the proceeds to redeem all $450 million of our outstanding 4.75% U.S. dollar bonds due 2025. This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is over six years and our weighted average coupon is just over 2%. A little over three quarters of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 94% of our debt is fixed rate, guarding against a rising rate environment. And 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? Sure. I think Bill covered it. But just on the \u2013 John, the elongated book-to-bill or time line, which had nothing really do with supply chain. Two factors there: one, you can see in the Americas region, we did a powered base shell deal, obviously, a longer lead time to develop that and bring that online; and then in Europe, where we have the concentration of our large deals obviously, stand out quarter for EMEA across the board. Some of the plus megawatt deals were rather large in size and takedowns. And I think there's a project or two where we're literally at land state and the customers are looking to really just book that future runway to growth. So that was kind of what drugged the overall time line out for sign to commence. Sure. So, we finished 2021 at south of $2.2 billion of development CapEx or so. Our guidance range is a step-up of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion of CapEx. You can just look at our press release throughout the year. We've been opening new markets, expanding addressable market, building out the pipeline from land to shells to finish suites to colo and connectivity inventory. I don't think we're looking to change our posture. We really go market-by-market supply chain \u2013 or excuse me, market-by-market supply-demand view. And we think we're positioning ahead of our competitors. And I don't think there's a really necessary reactionary flex needed into our business. But if the opportunity presents itself, we look at that, and we'll make those investments. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got a diverse menu of capital sources to fuel our growth. Sure. Thanks, Michael. So just a quick backdrop on same capital. So last year, we guided slightly negative on same capital or \u2013 and we came in at 4.4% same-capital cash NOI is negative. This was slightly worse than the year prior. As I mentioned, that was a real subset of the pool that we reported in 2021. You flip to 2022, you call it almost 80% of our company is in that pool with the addition of the Westin Building, Interxion, Lamda Hellix and Altus IT in Croatia. So you get a much larger sample set and an improving complexion. So from negative 4.4%, we guided to, call it, negative 3% at the midpoint. It's really being impacted by two elements: one, currency. We hedge to the balance sheet. So all the currency fluctuations are hitting that pool, if you call \u2013 look at that on a constant currency, you're probably closer to negative 1%. And then if you peel back the onion on that, it's really strong positives \u2013 several \u2013 like 3% or so in that APAC, close to flat in EMEA due to the utilities being elevated and then the negative contribution largely focused in the Americas region, where we are getting hit by what looks like it would be a property tax increase that's going to hit us in that year \u2013 or excuse me, in 2022, but not continue in 2023 and beyond. And the major driver of still not being more firmly into positive, although improving really is downtime for releasing of some of the larger non-retentions. We've been working away at that and making good activity. Actually re-leasing it and then moving those customers into that space. It just takes time, not because of supply chain politics, more of that one 5-megawatt customer leads and a new 5-megawatt customer refills the refurbs, the new PDUs, et cetera, it just takes time. And for those chunky deals, you lose a month or two or rent in a year, that's just \u2013 it won't flow through until you get into 2023. So net-net, not in positive territory firmly on a reported basis yet, but heading that way. Sure. So I mean, pricing from two lenses. Obviously, you saw in the guidance, the \u2013 we're guiding towards flat releasing spreads on our renewals for 2020. So that's not new news. We've been mentioning that we've been working our way into that positive territory partly due to mix of expirations, but certainly, I would say, pricing related and then also, call it, pricing on new deals. Holistically, I think our supply chain team has done a really and design [indiscernible] team done a really good job insulating us given our scale, our consistency in market. I don't think that's industry-wide. And if you're a newer, smaller, more fledgling or regional competitor that's creating disruptions from an inflation standpoint and there's just overall strains on delivery of capacity, whether it's moratoriums in certain countries or the ability to deliver power. All of these elements, I'd say, add up together to, I think, be an incremental benefit to our value proposition to our customer of having this incumbent platform of 26 countries, 50 metros with one way for growth that the pricing pendulum feels like it's continuing to slowly swing more and more in our favor. Well, I'll have Corey start us off on the enterprise less-than-megawatt interconnection category. And then I can filling any factoids and talked about source and uses on your second question. Just to add a couple of more reasonable tidbits, Eric. So EMEA was an absolute standout for the less than a megawatt, as you saw in the numbers. Frankfurt, London, Paris, Amsterdam Marseille, big contributors. Over half of our new logos actually came out of that region. In the Americas, New York, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta were the top markets and Singapore is obviously the standout in APAC. And do you \u2013 Eric, do you mind just repeating the second part of your question about the source use? I know I heard the first part about it is noncore versus contribution actually. What was the second part of your question? Sure. As so you see in the guidance table, we put about $0.5 billion to $1 billion of, call it, capital recycling, which would be both of these categories. We ended the year with really a 60 \u2013 a one-off asset for $60 million that will be likely redeveloped into a residential project in San Jose. And there are, call it, a short list of whittling down of incremental noncore dispositions that could happen during the year it would be a piece of that. And then I think looking for incremental contributions to digital core REIT would probably be the larger segment of that source of capital. That's obviously been a great success. John Stewart, after 32 earnings calls, hung up the HP 12C, now looking to grow that vehicle. In terms of funding for the year, \u2013 we finished out the year with about almost $1 billion of proceeds if you include that one-off asset plus digital core REIT in December. That all put the back on 12/31 with $140-ish million of cash, $40 million of \u2013 excuse me, $400 million drawn on a $3.3 billion credit facility. We got lucky and beat the rate march with a $850 million euro bond beginning of the year. That's probably an incremental $500 million proceeds. We still have the $1 billion undrawn forward that will take down. So those combinations of forces and uses will essentially fund the closing of the $1.7 billion purchase of Teraco. And then obviously, those incremental noncore dispose or incremental contributions in the back half of the year will be the, call it, the replenishing of the capital stack, and we'll look to leverage to, call it, say, to move more in line to our targeted leverage levels below six times for sure, as we move through the year. Yes. So the \u2013 this was essentially an evolution of our capital sources here. Date back to probably the origins when Bill created a prudential JV that just actually ran its course, and we recognized a promote in the fall. Perpetual externally managed public vehicle with a global mandate, although albeit originally a North America portfolio. So over time, I would expect it to \u2013 through contributions of assets from Digital Realty, and they can also \u2013 and can also acquire third-party assets, diversify its portfolio geographically. But really with core assets, data centers that Digital Realty believes in for the long run, that have really long-term weighted average lease terms, high occupancies core to our strategy. We don't have a set exact dollar amount or time of 2022, where we're looking to do a contribution, we'll work collaboratively with John and his team to position that at the right time for Digital Core REIT and its shareholders and Digital Realty's funding plans. But I would think it will diversify over time and continue to scale, and it's been well received to date. And I think that we'll be able to build upon that success. I'm sorry, that \u2013 there's no magic to that. That was really just a product of the size of the initial portfolio, the conservative leverage we've put on the vehicle day one in a modest IPO size. We \u2013 the underwriters' lockup tactically expires in the next several months. So not \u2013 it's right around the corner. We have no interest to sell down. We can sell down if we want to. More likely, over time, I could see us being diluted down as digital quarry buys for cash, more assets and Digital Realty makes room for incremental investors both institutional and retail to participate in the growth of the vehicle. So, I would maybe go region by region real quickly. I just saw there wasn't a lot of activity in APAC this particular quarter, but we had a great 2021 overall in that region across all product types, but certainly including hyperscale and we're seeing significant demand continue. And really excited with the introduction of Seoul 1, which we just opened up as well as significant activity across the Japanese market. In EMEA, we had four of the five top CSPs, all signed new business with us during the quarter. A lot of activity in Frankfurt, both in the East with the legacy interaction campus in the West with the legacy digital campus, Zurich, Marseille, Madrid and Paris were also contributors as well as Amsterdam. In North America, in the \u2013 I would say, the social media category has been a contributor and Ashburn was probably the standout for the quarter where we've remained incredibly tight during the recovering market and continue to see strong demand. The only thing I would add to that question, John \u2013 David was \u2013 listen, Singapore is opening up its moratorium in a very rational and prudent way. Now with the development of, call it, three new data center locations. I can't think of a better partner to be one of the three given our experience in this business, 4,000 global customers. Leadership and sustainability, experience in region. And last but not least, having a partner Digital Core REIT listed on the Singapore Exchange that could be an eventual owner of that asset allow all the citizens of Singapore to participate in the digital transformation of that country in the region. So that's a unique incremental attribute, that could play in the future. And Brendan, I can confirm that the cost CapEx otherwise is included and not material to the guidance we have on the sub today. Sure. So just working backwards. So \u2013 we didn't \u2013 I don't think we have like our famous bar charts without numbers on them for you in terms of the weighted distribution. We do have a pretty decent moving part here with the timing of Teraco, which I can't remember Greg mentioned this yet, but I mean we're working through the closing conditions and really the process for, call it, competition community review. But feels like it's going to happen in call it the early \u2013 very early second quarter to a couple of months in the second quarter time frame. So that does put a little bit of puts and takes from a quarterly blend. It is just to confirm the dilution from Teraco is included in our guidance table in the sub. So at the bottom line, our midpoint is call it growing, call it, 5% which is about 100 basis points increase from our guidance a year ago, which we did beat by 140 bps. We also are absorbing call it, 100 to 200 basis points of FX headwinds. And so if you normalize for those items, you call it close to the 6.5%, call it core FFO per share growth. The components of Teraco, I would call it, ballpark for a rough swag, a partial year contribution to revenue and an EBITDA basis, call it, $100-ish of revenue and 70-ish of EBITDA contribution of rough swags. Just a reminder, a data point, our year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth is deflated when you just look at our reported financials. Remember that we had a PPA in a settlement NH promote in 2021. So that plus \u2013 really that plus FX calls it has \u2013 what you call it, and 9.3% growth on a revenue basis on a constant currency basis. And then as a reminder, we're also losing revenue from our contribution to the Singapore REIT, Digital Core REIT. So that puts you up another 100 or 150 basis points higher on the revenue standpoint from a constant currency basis."

            "name": "Chris Sharp",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Brendan. I appreciate the question. Absolutely, right? That's what the customers are looking for. And I just want to go back a little bit on what Eric had asked Corey on what's driving that sub-1 megawatt. It's a sweet spot where customers are starting to outgrow colo. So it's very beneficial to our asset class to be able to support that growing need and allow them to land and expand even beyond the one megawatt and start to go to more market. But that all requires an SDN, just a software-defined networking, for the broader group, that capability to tie it all together. And so one of the things you're going to hear about later in the year is, we are absolutely bringing to market one of two platforms in the world that is purpose built for orchestrating at a higher level, that type of capability on our customer behalf, right? And I'll just impress upon everybody, it's not improving on a 10-year-old product. It's definitely purpose-built. And at the core of that is enhancing our customer experience where we're removing that technical complexity that a lot of customers are impacted by around interconnection and making it easier for them to procure and deploy in all of these locations. And that's why that new logo growth is starting to grow at record numbers, and you'll see that continually feed off of itself because they're getting a big benefit out of the community of interest that's being created around the globe. But again, at the end of the day, it's about open access and unfettered customer experience, which allows all of our customers to access the right partners throughout the globe. And this fabric, again, will facilitate the easiest route to all destinations. Yes, absolutely, Brendan. And we had referenced a while back. We had acquired a smaller firm that was some of the leading software developers out in the market. And it's something that Andy and I constantly talk about on the right amount of capital. And so we have a dedicated software team that is purpose built in delivering that capability. And so I wouldn't say it's material as of yet, and we're not disclosing the details around the investment, but the impact that we get with having that team dedicated to building not only an SDN capability, but that broader orchestration is absolutely going to be beneficial, and we already have some great conversations with beta customers that are driving the direction of what those feature functionalities are going to be."

I mean, look, I think when you look at the mandate that John and his team have for that vehicle, it's clearly \u2013 it's a yield-driven vehicle. And obviously, we assess that cost of capital for that vehicle like we do Digital Realty stand-alone. And those assets that are going to go into that, they're not going to be development, they're going to be stabilized. You've heard John's pitch in terms of the types of assets they're looking for that to put it into that vehicle. Well, if we do future M&A or anything like that, and there happens to be those kinds of assets, they will be a natural home for that. Now we obviously have a partner, how to pursue those transactions simultaneously and be able to bifurcate the assets and to get the best cost of capital. So that's how we think about it from an M&A standpoint. But in terms of cost of capital, we still go back, we do our underwrites we're going to go out and do DCFs and take a look at the projections and take a look at the risk of the asset and we're going to price it accordingly. And obviously, having a vehicle that's got a better cost of capital is helpful. But that's generally the approach we'll use for M&A."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. John, please go ahead. \nJohn Stewart: Thank you, operator. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. \n Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. \n This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. \n Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our third quarter results. We further strengthened connections with customers, landing record new logos and delivering our fourth consecutive quarter with over $100 million of bookings. We also continued to deliver for our customers around the world despite volatility in the global supply chain, leveraging our scale, diversification and strategic procurement processes to continue to deliver on time and on budget for our customers. \n We continue to enhance our global platform by expanding into new markets with tremendous growth potential while continuing to expand capacity in existing markets around the world. We delivered solid financial results, with double-digit revenue growth leading to a beat in the current quarter and a raise to the outlook for the balance of the year. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet by raising approximately $600 million of low-coupon Swiss green bonds and over $1 billion of common equity to fund our future growth. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. \nA. William Stein: Thank you, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework, and we made further progress on each front during the third quarter. We continue to globalize our business with significant bookings and solid performance across regions. Our bookings were diversified by both region and product type, reflecting our unique full-spectrum global product offering. \n We also announced our entry into 2 high-potential emerging markets, India and Nigeria, during the third quarter while expanding our connectivity capabilities by working with Zayo to develop the largest open fabric-of-fabrics that will interconnect key centers of data exchange. We are also extending our capabilities for customers to the edge with the announcement of what will be one of a few strategic partnerships in this arena. \n Let's discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3. During the third quarter, Digital Realty was honored to be recognized by GRESB as an overall global sector leader in the technology and science category for exemplary ESG performance, receiving a coveted 5-star rating from this leading global ESG benchmarking organization and reflecting Digital Realty's commitment to being a global leader in ESG. We also became a UN Global Compact signatory in September, aligning our ESG goals and commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals with a global initiative. \n We also advanced our sustainable financing strategy, raising our first-ever Swiss green bonds and publishing the allocation of $440 million of proceeds from our September 2020 Euro green bond, which funded sustainable data center development projects in 4 countries across 3 continents certified in accordance with leading sustainable rating standards. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and broader society while advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all of these stakeholders. \n While on the topic of energy, I'm pleased to report that Digital Realty experienced only a small negative impact from the substantial rise in energy costs during the third quarter. In Europe, where concerns of an energy crisis were most acute, we typically contract for energy supplies a year or more in advance, providing price visibility and certainty for our customers. Elsewhere around the world, energy costs are typically passed through to customers, minimizing our direct exposure. We continue to keep a close eye on energy prices, but given the resiliency of our business model, we do not expect rising energy costs to impact our reported results by more than a few pennies. \n Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform. As previously announced, we entered into a joint venture with Brookfield to expand PlatformDIGITAL into India, a giant underserved market with the fifth largest GDP in the world. Like many emerging markets, India presents some unique challenges, underscoring the need for local knowledge and experience. To that end, we were pleased to announce the hiring of Seema Ambastha as CEO for the India joint venture. Seema has years of experience in the Indian IT sector broadly and in the data center industry specifically where she most recently served as a senior executive leader with the NTT Netmagic data center business across India. We believe the India data center market has the potential to experience significant growth over the next decade, and we're thrilled to have such a strong partner and strong leader in this exciting new venture. \n During the third quarter, we continued to expand iColo, our Kenyan data center operator, acquiring a land parcel in Mozambique to build a facility positioned to land subsea cables and other connectivity-focused customers. We also acquired a controlling interest in Medallion Communications, the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Nigeria in partnership with our existing African partner, Pembani Remgro. As the African Internet economy matures, we expect Nigeria will represent a significant growth opportunity, given its large and relatively young population, a growing and diversifying economy as well as a maturing regulatory environment. Given the connectivity of Africa from our existing hub in Marseille, our platform will now offer the market-leading destinations, connecting Africa to Europe and beyond. \n We're also investing to organically expand our capacity. As of September 30, we had 44 projects underway around the world, totaling almost 270 megawatts of incremental capacity with over 250 megawatts scheduled for delivery before the end of 2022. We continue to invest most heavily in EMEA, where we now have 27 projects underway in 15 different markets totaling 150 megawatts of incremental capacity, most of which is highly connected, including significant expansions in Frankfurt, Marseille, Paris and Zurich. Our investment in organic development is a reflection of the strength of demand across EMEA. \n We're being a bit more selective in North America. We're seeing strong demand in Portland where we have a 30-megawatt facility under construction that is 100% pre-leased and scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of next year, while we also have significant projects underway in Northern Virginia, New York and Toronto. \n Finally, in Asia Pacific, we continue to pursue strong organic development, both on our own and with our joint venture partners. We are adding capacity in Hong Kong that will open this quarter and expect to open Korea's first carrier-neutral facility in Seoul in early 2022. We are building a connected campus in Seoul to provide the full spectrum of solutions for our customers. The larger second facility will accommodate up to 64 megawatts of capacity and will be located within 25 kilometers of our first facility. \n Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers, and our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect developing trends as they emerge globally on PlatformDIGITAL. Just over a year ago, we introduced the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool that forecasts the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. \n Earlier this year, we published an industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities to guide cross-industry collaboration, tackle data gravity head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity. Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of data gravity. According to IDC, the amount of digital data created over the next 5 years will be greater than twice the amount of data created since the advent of digital storage. This digital data creation is expected to drive exponential growth in enterprise user data aggregation, storage and exchange, providing a powerful tailwind for data center demand. \n We continue to see enterprise and service provider customers deploying their own data hubs and using interconnection to securely exchange data in multiple metros on PlatformDIGITAL to accommodate their own data creation growth. Recently, for the second consecutive year, Digital Realty was ranked as the only outperformer and global leader by GigaOm for edge colocation. This ranking reflects our continued innovation and the execution of our PlatformDIGITAL road map for delivering global differentiated capabilities and value for our customers and partners. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market-leading innovation to capture the growing global demand opportunity from data-driven businesses. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. \nAndrew Power: Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. For the second straight quarter, we signed total bookings of $113 million, this time with a $12 million contribution from interconnection. Deal mix was consistent with the prior 4-quarter average, sub-1 megawatt deals plus interconnection represented about 40% of the total, while larger deals represented around 60%. Space and power bookings were also well diversified by region, with EMEA and APAC contributing 45% of our total, about the same as the Americas, with interconnection accounting for the remaining 10%. \n The weighted average lease term was a little over 5.5 years, and we landed a record 140 new logos during the third quarter, with strong showings across all regions, demonstrating the power of our global platform. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a leading cloud-native cybersecurity platform is expanding its high-performance computing capabilities by leveraging PlatformDIGITAL in 4 markets across North America and Europe, connecting with cloud providers, improving performance and driving down cost. \n A market-leading autonomous driving technology developer partnered with Digital Realty to tailor an innovative and unique infrastructure solution for simulation workloads. Two major North American energy firms chose Digital Realty to leverage our geographic reach and re-architect their network to interconnect with cloud providers and implement security controls as part of their hybrid IT strategy. A public university in the eastern U.S. is launching a global research initiative with other universities in EMEA and deploying PlatformDIGITAL network hubs across 2 continents and 3 cities to help enable this project. \n A maker of high-performance computing systems is expanding their footprint by deploying on PlatformDIGITAL across multiple regions to guarantee GDPR compliance while enhancing their security, performance and sustainability. And finally, a Global 500 fintech provider is expanding their own hybrid IT availability zones into multiple new metros, using PlatformDIGITAL to support their data-intensive and high-performance computing requirements. \n Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced rose from $303 million to $330 million, and third quarter signings more than offset commencements. The lag between signings and commencements was down slightly from last quarter at just over 7 months. \n Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed $223 million of renewal leases during the third quarter, our largest-ever renewal quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the quarter was a little over 3.5 years. Renewal rates for sub-1 megawatt deals remain consistently positive. Greater than 1 megawatt renewals were skewed by our largest deal of the quarter that combined a sizable 30-megawatt renewal with our largest new deal for the quarter, which will land entirely in existing currently vacant or soon-to-be-vacant capacity across Chicago and Ashburn. Excluding this 1 transaction, our cash mark-to-market would have been a positive 1%. \n This multifaceted transaction was a prime example of what we mean when we talk about our holistic long-term approach to customer relationship management. We believe we have a distinct advantage when we are competing for new business with a customer that we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio. And whenever we can, we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings, including both new business as well as renewals. \n In terms of first quarter operating performance, reported portfolio occupancy ticked down by 50 basis points, largely driven by the sale of fully-leased assets during the quarter. Upon commencement of the large combination renewal expansion lease I mentioned a moment ago, portfolio occupancy is expected to improve by 70 basis points. Same-capital cash NOI growth was negative 5.5% in the third quarter, primarily driven by a spike in property taxes in Chicago, where local assessors have adopted a very aggressive posture along with the impact of the Ashburn churn event in January. \n Of the 70 megawatts we've got back on January 1, approximately 80% has since been released to multiple large and growing customers. As a reminder, the Westin Building in Seattle, the Interxion platform in EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece and Altus IT in Croatia are not yet included in the same-store pool, so these same-capital comparisons are less representative of our underlying business today than usual. And while we're still in the early stages of our budgeting process, we are optimistic in terms of where our same-store NOI growth goes for 2022. \n Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. The U.S. dollar strengthened during the third quarter, providing a small FX headwind in the third quarter. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. Our Swiss green bond offering during the quarter is a good example of this. \n In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have approximately a 50 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. \n In terms of earnings growth, third quarter core FFO per share was up 7% on both a year-over-year and sequential basis, driven by strong operational execution, cost controls and a reduction in financing costs from the debt refinancings and redemptions of preferred stock over the past year. To avoid any confusion, our core FFO outperformance excludes the benefit of a nearly $20 million promote fee received in connection with the monetization of our joint venture with Prudential. Heading into the final quarter of the year, we have solid momentum so we are raising our full year outlook for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and core FFO per share to reflect this underlying momentum in our business. \n Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 12. We continue to recycle capital by disposing of assets that have limited growth prospects, raising over $100 million in the third quarter for our 20% position in the Prudential JV and some land in Arizona. We also raised approximately $95 million of common equity under our ATM program in July, as well as $950 million of common equity in a September forward equity offering. Our reported leverage ratio remains at 6x, but including committed proceeds from the September forward equity offering, the leverage ratio drops to 5.6x, while our fixed charge coverage improves to 6x. \n We continued to execute our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. Our 2 capital markets transactions this quarter are examples of our prudent approach to balance sheet management. This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. \n As you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is over 6 years and our weighted average coupon is down to 2.2%. 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate, guarding against a rising rate environment, and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. \n Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 14, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC. \nJonathan Atkin: I think I'll ask both of mine upfront. I wondered, first of all, if you could talk about the factors that are affecting your CapEx to develop incremental capacity. John Stewart, I guess, in the prepared remarks talked about on time and on budget. But going forward, given what's happening with materials costs, I wondered whether you see an opportunity to adjust your pricing on new leases accordingly. \n And then the second question is just earlier this month, you acknowledged that you're exploring the potential creation of a Singapore REIT, and I wonder if you can just provide an update on that around the timing and scale and rationale on that project. \nA. William Stein: Thanks, Jon. I'll take your first question and I'll hand it over to Andy to adjust the -- to answer the Singapore REIT. First of all, I think you're right about inflation in terms of the opportunity that it presents. I think there's no doubt that it disproportionately, adversely affects our smaller competitors and widens our competitive moat. Over time, I would expect that rental rate increases will disproportionately accrue to the larger incumbent providers. \n There are basically 2 pieces to the inflation issue: the first is development, the second is operations. On the development side, we are -- our pipeline is on time and it's on budget, and they're kudos to Erich Sanchack, who leads our operations and procurement team for the vendor management programs that he's put in place, providing us fixed pricing for several years out, for diversifying our vendor mix and for allowing our -- for locking in our general contractors. We have a lot of construction sites around the world, and we're able to move our GCs around and keep them fully occupied. \n And I think our global scale as well as our maturity as a builder gives us a substantial competitive advantage here. But again, I don't think there's any doubt that market rents will eventually need to move up to maintain risk-adjusted returns. And I think that, that's both because of the increase in construction costs that show up in the denominator. But I think for our private competitors who are operating with more leverage, I think you're going to see that show up in the higher interest rates. So to -- I think they're going to have to raise their costs for that reason as well. \n And I think the readthrough here is actually really positive for our renewals because as our rates on new product increase, our rates will also, I expect, increase for renewals. So the bottom line there is that modest inflation, we think, is quite healthy for the business. And in terms of our customers, this shouldn't come as a surprise to them because to the extent that they're doing it themselves, they're seeing this development in their own supply chains. \n Relative to the operations of the P&L, I think as you probably know, our leases provide for significant pass-throughs. So for example, over 90% of our utility costs this last quarter were passed through to customers. We also have rent bumps generally between 2% and 3%. And then we have, I think, the highest operating -- or the best operating leverage of highest margins in the business. So what that means is that labor or labor costs, which I think is what's most susceptible to inflationary pressure, is a relatively low percentage of the revenue component in the income statement. And so with that, I'll hand it over to Andy to talk about the Singapore REIT. \nAndrew Power: Thanks, Bill. So Jon, you picked up obviously in the 8-K we put out there a few weeks ago. We are kind of heading down the path of exploring essentially an IPO of a portfolio on the Singapore market. This is not our APAC business, which has significant amounts of capacity under construction and land and the like. This is essentially being more analogous to almost like a private capital partner to Digital Realty for stabilized, fully well-leased, high-quality core long-term hold data centers to Digital and our strategy. \n Somewhat analogous to one of our joint ventures that we've done in the past couple of years with that one of which was with a Singapore REIT. We're still working through this. It's a long IPO process. There's no certainty on the outcome or completion. Sizing would be obviously a modest IPO size to begin with. But we do think this option has the merits of being an attractive long-term partner vehicle to Digital Realty. \nOperator: The next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nJordan Sadler: So first, I wanted to follow up, Bill, on sort of the price increase opportunity. I'm interested specifically in the greater 1 megawatt rents achieved in the Americas this quarter. They seem quite the opposite. I wonder at $80 per kW, it seemed like a low point relative to recent prints. I'm wondering what portion of that is a function of geography mix, et cetera. And then any color you could provide around the ability to push rate there. \nA. William Stein: Jordan, it's definitely a function of geographic mix. It's also a function of an extension that we were doing with existing customers that we were providing some rentable concession as well. Andy, you want to add anything to that? \nAndrew Power: Yes. Just maybe just a little more color. I mean the overall sign was a strong quarter, well north of $100 million. In North America, as you pointed out, it was in our prepared remarks, we had a sizable signing where we essentially came to the table with a holistic relationship-oriented solution for our customer, combining a renewal that impacted our mark-to-markets as well as the new signing. \n On the renewal, if you pulled that out of our mark-to-markets, we're positive 1%, but it was a 30-megawatt signing so it was a large kind of contributor to that. And on the new signing, I think it was into 4 or so different data halls. It was spread across both Ashburn and Chicago. It was 100% into existing vacant or to-be-vacated capacity, so a direct flow through to the bottom line, not, call it, future re-leasing. And so we think it was an attractive combination of helping a customer grow with us on our campus. And this is a customer we see future growth in years to come. So happy to support them. \nJordan Sadler: Okay. And then coming back to the supply chain, I have a little bit of a two-parter, which is one, how much urgency are you seeing from your larger customers that are looking to procure available inventory and just have line of sight to future product and infrastructure? And then second, how far forward have you pre-bought critical construction materials like generators, PDUs, crack units, UPSs? \nAndrew Power: So maybe I'll -- Jordan, this is Andy again. I'll try to take them in backwards order. So we have, call it, approaching 300, 270-something of megawatts, shovels in ground all the way to opening doors as we speak. And we are insulated in terms of our cost and procurement, whether it's through our VMI programs or through just supplier contracts and other things we do have been focused on building new capacity for so many years consistently. \n Beyond that, we are not fully insulated but those VMIs I just mentioned do extend. They're primarily focused in North America. They extend until 2023 so we do have a fair bit of insulation. We're not whistling by the graveyard on this topic. Obviously, inflation is here and will impact anyone that's called in the development arena. But we do believe given our size, scale as the largest developer and track record, that we're going to fare better than our competitor set and especially any newer incumbents to development. \n In terms of urgency, I think our customers are always urgent despite making massive financial decisions. Maybe I'll have Corey jump in a little bit to give you a little bit of flavor on the customer plans. \nCorey Dyer: Yes, sure. I can do that, Jordan. On the questions around this with via demand from the shortages in chips, we haven't seen it negatively affect any of our pipeline across the regions. We've actually seen it grow. And then also, we've got some sophisticated customers that thought forward about what was going to happen with the chip shortages and planned accordingly and therefore, have accelerated some of our opportunities across the globe. \n So at a net perspective, we kind of see it as a positive and people are thinking through it. Our customers are thinking through it. And on our end, it has really helped us kind of grow our pipeline at this point. \nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. \nDavid Barden: I'll ask my 2 upfront, too, if I could. I guess the first one would be, Bill, investors have been waiting a long time to kind of see how the big data center companies evolve their edge strategies. You've obviously struck a partnership a week or 2 ago and it sounds like you're planning on doing some more. Wondering if you could kind of elaborate a little bit now on what you're looking for and how you settled on this path that you've chosen with Atlas to begin with. \n And then maybe, Andy, just I want to kind of go back to the power thing. 90% pass-through, that leaves about $20 million on the income statement. A few pennies, still about $15 million of exposure. Is that kind of what you're budgeting to potentially happen in 2022? \nA. William Stein: Yes, I'm going to turn it over to Chris to handle the edge questions since he spends a fair bit of his days on that particular initiative. \nChris Sharp: No, I appreciate it, Bill, and thanks for the question, David. Yes, we've definitely been watching the edge for some time now. We do see -- it's still in its early stages of being a material opportunity. But one of the things that we've done is partner with AtlasEdge that we think they can provide a significant value in extending our platform deeper into the metro. And so that's something that we're looking at learning and understanding how to gain more intelligence in their new types of infrastructure they're bringing to market. And quite frankly, it expands and enhances our core to edge strategy so that our partners and our customers can get the benefit of extending their existing infrastructure out to the edge when it matures over time. \n I would also say that a critical piece that I think you picked up on, David, which is great, is that we at Digital, we're open, right? This is one of many partners and relationships that we're going to continue to prosecute because we see that there's many types of avenues out into accessing this edge infrastructure. But you're going to see a lot of partnerships over the course of the next couple of quarters where we'll further invest and refine exactly how we're going to prosecute that edge opportunity. \nA. William Stein: Andy? \nAndrew Power: And then David, on the second question, so just to review a few facts. So 90%, if you look at our just P&L, 90% of the power is reimbursed overall. We do pursue a hedging strategy primarily on our deregulated markets where you see potential greater volatility. We're about 85% hedged with contract durations ranging from 1 to 3 years. We also, as you know, are incredibly focused on sustainability. Green power procurement is a massive part of that playbook, and we pride ourselves in what we've done in that efforts to further green our portfolio, including power purchase agreements. \n Some of those have a potentially offsetting impact if in the event that power prices are to surge that provides an incremental hedge to power costs. So where we see it in the event that this elevated power scenario plays out for the duration of 2022, we'd look at it as just a couple of cents, which call it, every $0.01 is just almost $3 million. So not -- I wouldn't say a material headwind at this time. \nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. \nSimon Flannery: Andy, I just want to clarify, you made a comment that you're optimistic on 2022 same-store NOI growth. Does that mean you can -- you think it's going to be positive or better than this year? Any clarity you have there? And then just more broadly, Bill, and to maybe just talk about leasing has been consistently strong this year. How does the pipeline look? And how does the competitive environment look going forward? \nA. William Stein: Thanks, Simon. So listen, we are in the middle of budget season, and I got my head of FP&A to my right and he'll step on my foot really painfully if I get out of my skis here. But that being said, listen, we got a same-store pool that's going to materially grow. And I think it's in a positive direction with the addition of Interxion, the Westin Building, Altus IT, our business in Athens. We've acquired higher pricing power components added to the mix. \n We're also making great progress on re-leasing the capacity that was vacated at the beginning of this year, a huge portion of signings as -- that I mentioned we did this quarter has been falling into vacant or vacated capacity, so a quick resumption of cash flow from that space that sat idle for a portion of 2021. So net-net, I think there's a few things that kind of point to this kind of more positive trajectory in the same-store pool. Hence, my comment about optimistic of where we're going for 2022. \nUnknown Executive: And then Q4 is best situated to address the pipeline. \nAndrew Power: Yes. And then also from a pipeline perspective, Simon, I would just tell you that PlatformDIGITAL and just our thought leadership around data gravity is really taking hold, right? Our enterprise pipeline's growing across all regions, so really happy with that. Gartner was forecasting solid growth in enterprise IT spend. It just feels like we're in kind of the early innings of the IT transformation for the enterprises. \n As mentioned in the opening remarks, this quarter represented a new high for us, new logos at 140 new logos, so think about that as a proxy for enterprises continuing to decide to buy and partner with us. So we feel good about the demand signals in our pipeline going forward. Hopefully, that answers your question, Simon. \nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. \nMatthew Niknam: Both of these are maybe piggybacking a little bit on the back of Simon's questions, but first, on the competitive landscape. I'm just wondering, you mentioned upfront being a little bit more selective as it relates to investments in the U.S. Just wondering if you can update us the competitive landscape you're seeing from both public and private peers, whether that's changed much at all in the last 3 months. \n And then secondly, as we think about core FFO or maybe even AFFO per share growth next year, I don't want to jump the gun, I know we may get an outlook in 3 months' time. But Andy, if there's any updates in terms of how you're thinking about that bottom line growth into '22, that would be great. \nAndrew Power: Sure. So Matt, maybe I'll do it in reverse order here for just in order of efficiency here, make sure everyone gets the question. So core FFO, we're not -- we didn't pull forward our 2022 guidance dramatically. But I think we're definitely pleased with how we're putting up results this year that has got, call it, double digits top line, kind of 7% year-over-year performance at the bottom line. We've now raised our guidance, so we're just over the 5%, call it, year-over-year for 2021. And you heard from Corey and Bill and the others we're confident in the pipeline. \n So we think -- we're looking to kind of grow the bottom line higher next year than this year. So that's a continuation of things I've been saying for pretty much every quarter of '21. But sorry, no sneak preview on '22 guidance just yet. On competitive landscape, I think that refers to leasing competitive landscape, and has there been any changes on the backs of M&A or whatever in our space? I mean, Corey should chime in here, but by and large, I don't think I've seen any dramatic change. \n I think the trend has been our friend, for now, several quarters of more and more customers attracted to a global platform across 25 countries, 50 metropolitan areas, spanning the full customer spectrum, supporting those -- most of those 4,000 customers in the retail-oriented environments all the way up to the dedicated data halls for hyperscalers who we have in, call it, north of 45 different locations. And I've not seen any dramatic change in that. And I think you can see that now on several quarters of consistent, call it, results. But Corey, I don't know if you have any different observations. \nCorey Dyer: No, I would just add to it that yes, we've had consistent results for a long time. To your point on our scale, we see all the competition out there. Our win rates and our cap rates are improving. So yes, I would just pile on to what you said and the success we're having and what we're seeing in the pipeline, the demand. \nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. \nMichael Rollins: Two questions, if I could. First, just a little bit more on the edge strategy. Just curious how you're contemplating the edge in the North America market. And is that something that you're looking to create some further progression on in the near term or is that more of a longer-term ambition? \n And then just going back on some of the portfolio and pricing commentary. Just curious, when you have these large multi-megawatt deals where you're discounting to get new business or you have some repricing risk, is it because some of the needs of the customers are changing? Is it just market rents? Like what are some of the factors that are driving that? And how should investors think about just what might be left in the portfolio to get through on that basis? \nAndrew Power: Thanks, Mike. Maybe I'll take the second question and hand off to Chris to talk about what's next on edge. So I mean, listen, we're always in active relationship-oriented dialogues with our customers but especially our largest customers who we're supporting in so many different markets and really the full suite of products from network-oriented deployments, hybrid IT, all the way out to their true massive cloud compute. \n And we just want to -- we try to come to the table with holistic solutions. If they have a renewal that's coming in the coming years, we just make sure that's part of the conversation, right? And it often leads to situations like which recently transpired in the last quarter where they may not take some of the new business out to a full search of the market or say, \"You know what, I've already deployed on your campus and then growing these adjacent data halls is the right move.\" So it's really a holistic relationship-oriented approach. \n As it relates to, I think, the heart of your question, yes, we don't like having any mark-to-market go down at all, so a negative 5% quarter is not great. But in the scheme of things, we're still holding our guidance for the full year. We had a positive 0-point -- a very modest positive last quarter and we're seeing strength in the fourth quarter. And we've been saying for some time, we think the front [ review ] of these expirations are getting better in terms of the mix, more higher pricing power footprints as well as more international footprints where we have greater pricing power on these renewals. And that's putting aside incremental uplift potential from this inflation-related impact that Bill kind of highlighted that should manifest itself over time. Chris, do you want to tackle the edge? \nChris Sharp: Absolutely. Thanks, Michael, for the question. It gives me an opportunity. I just want to also commend Giuliano as getting the role of CEO over at AtlasEdge. It's a great opportunity for him and we'll continue to work closely with him. So I appreciate the question, Michael. But going one step further, and I think you're spot on in that we often talk about the edge evolving from the core out deeper into the metro. And I think one aspect of that is no 2 markets are equal, so there's definitely varying degrees of capabilities in each of the markets globally. \n So Europe is one, in a general sense, North America and APAC. We absolutely are pursuing different types of partnerships within all of these markets because, quite frankly, our largest customers are looking for a global solution. And so we're always looking at what is the best path to enable our customers in the most efficient way possible. That's at the core of what is our edge thesis that we continually refine and that's what we referenced even in the prepared remarks, I think, in Bill's section about you'll see other partnerships in different markets just to really helping us prosecute that opportunity when it matures over time. \nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. \nFrank Louthan: What is sort of the development yield that you're targeting on that re-leasing, particularly the new customer that kind of dragged down the greater than 1 megawatt leasing? And then I've got a follow-up. \nAndrew Power: Honestly, Frank, they're backfilling vacant capacity so it wasn't like we were building out a new building. I think a good chunk of that is legacy DFT capacity, which we did a stock-for-stock deal and hence, it was kind of a currency exchange. So I don't think the development -- I don't think the development yield would be the right way to look at it. \n You can look at the -- given its size, it was the preponderance of the North America signings in the plus megawatt category, which -- listen, we always want rates to be higher, but we -- those are 2 markets where I would say that we -- I think we garnered a fair economic rate for that capacity, and we're refilling something that's already built in our capitalization. We're paying tax -- real estate taxes on it. We're operating the capacity so it's going to flow through to our bottom line. And we've not changed, I would say, our development target returns on the, call it, 270 megawatts that we have under construction. That actually inched up a smidge this last quarter. \nFrank Louthan: All right, great. So the follow-up. Bill, you mentioned that you could see inflation work in your favor in the re-leasing. When should we expect that? Or I guess, it didn't help as much this quarter. Or is that going to help more broadly for colo and smaller deals as opposed to more hyperscale deals? \nA. William Stein: Yes, Frank, I mean, that's -- I don't think that's going to be -- that's not going to show up next quarter or the quarter after, I think. But I do think if you see sustained inflation, it's going to start flowing through to our competitors' construction costs. As I said, I think it will show up in higher interest rates. And I think it will put upward pressure on rents across the board, which will affect not just our new leasing but renewal leasing. But it's hard to put a specific time on it, certainly not going to be in the next quarter or two. \nOperator: The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. \nEric Luebchow: Curious on what you see in the enterprise funnel. We heard there are some larger deals coming to the market, particularly in the financial services arena. Have you seen deal requirements across enterprise picking up in size? And do you think an acceleration in deal flow could give you the opportunity to do even better in that arena as we go forward? \n And then just one more question. You've said in the past capital recycling may start to moderate in the coming years. But given the cap rate on the Prudential joint venture sale sub-5%, are there opportunities to maybe sell more noncore markets or assets in the coming years? \nAndrew Power: Corey, why don't you hit the first one and Greg and I can tag team the second one? \nCorey Dyer: Yes. So Eric, thanks. The question, I think, was on enterprise demand and continuing that as well as possible deals we have for the quarter. I'm not going to talk through specific deals. But we do see an uptick in requirements as well as uptick in the size of the requirements, which is what you were specifically asking when you think through our full spectrum of offerings and opportunity that we have for the enterprises that uniquely positions us around PlatformDIGITAL and how you're going to handle the data gravity and the opportunities around that. \n So yes, we're seeing some larger footprints go in across, call it, our 300 kW band and 600 kW band that speaks to people thinking through data performance hubs for us and data hubs out there for us to improve in their enterprise solutions. So yes, we're seeing that across the board. Did I get you your answer, Eric? \nEric Luebchow: Yes. Yes, that's great. \nGregory Wright: Eric, with respect to capital recycling, I guess what I would say is things are still consistent with what we said a few years ago. And a few years ago, we said we were going to sell a few billion dollars of assets over a few years. And again, the reasons that we were recycling out of those assets and redeploying that capital into more core strategic assets remains. Whether they were assets that weren't core to our business or certain markets that weren't core to our business, that's why we're selling assets. We're not just selling assets because there's strong cap rate activity in the market. \n Now that obviously helps. But again, if an asset is core to us, we're not going to sell it just because cap rates are getting better. But again, it does put a little wind at our back to the extent we are selling assets now, given the improved pricing we're seeing in the market. And you're right, we saw strong pricing in our portfolio disposition in Europe this past year. And now on the Prudential deal, we saw very strong pricing, as you said, on the stabilized assets. It was mid-4s, of which we were fortunate to recognize almost $20 million of promote out of that transaction as well. \n So look, your point is right, pricing is strong. We think that bodes well for the sector and for big owners of assets like ourselves. But maybe I'll turn it over to Andy to go ahead and see if he has anything to add. \nAndrew Power: Just one thing, just 2 buckets there, selling outright noncore assets that Greg did a great job of describing, streamlining our portfolio, aligning with growing customers, long-term growth assets. And then I think it was touched on one of the first or second questions on also evolving our capital sources in terms of core assets and raising private capital, all of this with the initiative of trying to accelerate our bottom line growth through capital efficiency. \nOperator: The next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. \nErik Rasmussen: Just two. First, on the Africa JV. You announced that yesterday with Pembani. Can you just provide any additional color around how big these data centers are, maybe some details around the acquisition? And then as you look -- what sort of investments are you looking to make as you look to expand in that market? \nGregory Wright: Sure. Erik, it's Greg again. Look, I think when you look at the transactions, right, the transactions we've talked about here are clearly a company called Medallion Communications in Nigeria, and the total consideration for that project was $29 million. We partnered with Pembani on that, so the amount of capital we have is even less. \n And another transaction we disclosed was the acquisition of a land parcel in Mozambique, again, with Pembani. That was for $3 million. So I mean, look, these are clearly -- what I would say is these are small Cs that we're planning in these highly connected assets because they are, they're highly connected communities of interest. And we're doing it with a smart local partner in Pembani. And when you look at a market like Nigeria, right, it's got the largest GDP and population in Africa. And the size of that investment, as I said, is very small for a company our size. And as I mentioned, Mozambique is even smaller. And we did that one to gain a location that again will play a critical role with the subsea cable activity that will encircle Africa. \n I think as you think about it, right, you look and see in Europe, right, we have Marseille in Western Europe, right, which is a highly connected hub. Then we've done a transaction with Lamda Hellix in Greece, which we believe is going to become a highly connected hub. And as you look at that, so you have Marseille to the west, you have Greece to the east. And as you move down into Africa, right, you look at Nigeria on the west, you look at Kenya in the east, right, and then you look at Mozambique that goes down to the south, and we really view this as really one large, like, crossroads of connectivity, if you will, that we think are going to bode well long term for the company. \nErik Rasmussen: Great. Look forward to hearing more about it. And then maybe just on the Q3 leasing. It held steady at $113 million. As the U.S. and, I think, hyperscale ease somewhat, were there any limitations with capacity in certain markets? Or was there anything else that you could really call out as we think about Q3 results? \nAndrew Power: Erik, I don't think there's any limitations. We always have room for more leasing in any given quarter. And I know Corey's also chomping at the bit for more inventory to sell into quickly. But listen, I think it was a pretty very healthy quarter. You look at the geo mix, how well spread across each of the regions. You look at the enterprise mix with less than 1 megawatt in interconnection, call it, 40%; record 140 new logos. That record 140 had a record contribution from -- on quarter lease, [ reckon ] last 6 quarters from North America and I think #2 from an EMEA contribution. \n You could see from the new logo or some of the logos we called out in my prepared remarks, kind of like more old world enterprise, global power firms and universities to burgeoning technologies like autonomous driving. And I think on the hyperscale side, a little bit similar. Some of the, call it, house names of digital growing with us into existing inventory as well as some, call it, next-generation hyperscalers landing with us in Tokyo, which I think was our second and third largest signing. So broadly pretty healthy and we're not done yet for 2021. \nOperator: The next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. \nColby Synesael: A few questions. One, on renewals, renewal spread's down negative 5.6%, still guiding to slightly negative for the year. Do you think renewal spreads could be positive in 2022? Second question, just a little bit of clarification. Are you saying that your biggest deal, which I guess was the combination of Chicago and Northern Virginia was for 30 megawatts? Or was that what the megawatts were that were renewed? \n And then Facebook just put out their earnings last night. They increased their CapEx budget for 2022 by over 50% to somewhere, I think, near $30 billion. Do you think that, that could have positive implications for the data center space? And then forgive me, but you just did an ATM. You have an 18-month draw on that. The ATMs you've done in the past have been 12 months. I'm curious why you pushed it out to 18. \nAndrew Power: So Colby, I think that's 4 questions relative to our 2 limit, but [indiscernible] color to... \nColby Synesael: Some of them are like 5 seconds. \nAndrew Power: So we're going to get them all rapid-fire here. Listen, I think we've been saying for some time, we think we're moving into a better territory on the cash mark-to-market. And I think the -- what you see in our guidance, including the fourth quarter, relative to what we are trending already reported for the year speaks to that. And I think I've been saying that for some time that I think we're heading to more -- better territories. So again, we're not done with the budget and certainly not our guidance for 2022, but it feels like we're -- based on the mix, both product and geos and composition, we're in a better territory than we were certainly at the beginning of this year on that stat. \n We did -- across 4 or so suites, so different buildings across roughly half and half Ashburn and Chicago, a total of about 30 megawatts of new signings with the same customer that also did roughly 30 megawatts of renewals in the same quarter. And you could see this was a really super high renewal quarter overall for us. We've usually been doing like 100 megawatts or just shy of that in that plus than [ 1-megawatt ] LTM standpoint on. And so you can see, I think we had 53 or something in that category this quarter. So a high renewal activity quarter. So hopefully, that paints the picture on those two. \n Undrawn forward equity offering, yes, we -- listen, we -- the equity offering was again opportunistically derisking our development CapEx plan, and we're able to extend the duration of that contract so we have greater flexibility to essentially feather it into our sources or uses over time at the right time for the business, which hopefully better -- is better measured and help contributes to our earnings growth in the ensuing years. \n Facebook CapEx increasing, I don't think we have got any inside information on that. They're a large customer. We've done -- we did new business with them in the last quarter. But I don't see how it could be a negative necessarily, but I don't want to over-index that is super positive to the industry. \nOperator: The next question comes from Aryeh Klein of BMO Capital Markets. \nAryeh Klein: Andy, earlier on the call, you kind of mentioned inflation is here. How is that flowing through from a lease pricing standpoint? Are there any terms that are changing tax DLR against inflation, maybe some kind of change in that escalator structure? \nAndrew Power: Yes, Aryeh, so I mean, inflation -- I believe inflation is here. If you filled up your car or purchased milk at the grocery store, I think Bill's comments to one of the questions, it didn't mean like overnight, the data center industry got a rate reset. I think we've seen inflationary pressures prior to this hard cost inflation happen where markets just got tighter as they ran up to the physical boundaries of infrastructure, right? So our Santa Clara and Northern -- Santa Clara's an example of that. I mean our leasing success has been certainly a [ healing ] to the Ashburn market. We saw this in Frankfurt. Singapore saw this in terms of supply limitations, driving up pricing, which we've raised pricing there at least 5 times, I think, in the last 12 months. \n And I think Bill's commentary is that, listen, as this continues to hit [ car ] costs and delivery or access to the infrastructure is to bring on new supply which is, we believe, is going to be disproportionately impacting smaller subscale newer entrants, that means that our customers have less options in terms of their providers. And I think that as our costs get inflated, we have to examine our rates and on a market-by-market supply and demand and costing basis. \n And listen, I think we're -- do the -- going to be the best out there in terms of insulating our customers from this. But I know -- I think if this period continues for a long time, we haven't had inflation realistically since, call it, the end of the Carter administration. So we're in new territory for many of us. But I think it's -- I think we're going to fare better at the end of the day. \n And we are insulated in terms of we have rent escalators, fixed bumps in most of our contracts. And I think our scale and purchasing power on an operating side as well as the build cost side provides insulation in addition to some of the other risk mitigations we mentioned earlier in the call. \nAryeh Klein: And then just on that large renewal, how did that mark-to-market rate compare to actual market rates? Or was it some percentage above market rates? \nAndrew Power: I would -- I believe it's probably 10-ish percent above new signings in apples-to-apples comparable markets. We typically see renewals have greater pricing power than new deals, just on the customer has a strong preference to not risk infrastructure or workload on a move. \nAryeh Klein: And is that 10% kind of the normal range that you'd see? \nAndrew Power: It could be higher than that, actually. I would say it's probably that's maybe on the skinnier side. But it all depends on the facts and circumstances of the supply and demand, the utilization of the infrastructure, the customers' growth plans, the workload. Is it B2C? Is it B2B? All these things kind of go into the factors that drive the commercial outcome on those. And it was 30 megawatts all at once, right? So 30 megawatts of new signs for 30 megawatts of renewals, all with a stroke of a pen. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Please go ahead. \nA. William Stein: Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap our call today by recapping our highlights for the third quarter as outlined here on the last page of the presentation. One, our value proposition is clearly resonating with customers. PlatformDIGITAL attracted a record number of new logos. We had another quarter of strong new bookings and a record level of renewals. Most importantly, customers know that we will do what we say. Even when global supply chains are stressed, Digital Realty delivers. \n Two, we're continuing to extend our global platform. We are investing organically to enhance our global footprint while expanding our platform into India, along with additional strategic connectivity destinations circling the African continent. \n Three, we generated double-digit revenue growth during the third quarter, once again exceeding consensus expectations. And once again, we raised our full year outlook. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, locking in attractively priced long-term debt and supplementing it with equity capital that will be drawn down over the next 18 months to support our global development program. \n I'd like to once again thank the Digital Realty frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world turning. I hope that you all stay safe and healthy, and we hope to see many of you virtually in a couple of weeks at NAREIT and hopefully in person again sometime soon. Thank you. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Corey Dyer",
            "content": "Yes, sure. I can do that, Jordan. On the questions around this with via demand from the shortages in chips, we haven't seen it negatively affect any of our pipeline across the regions. We've actually seen it grow. And then also, we've got some sophisticated customers that thought forward about what was going to happen with the chip shortages and planned accordingly and therefore, have accelerated some of our opportunities across the globe. \n So at a net perspective, we kind of see it as a positive and people are thinking through it. Our customers are thinking through it. And on our end, it has really helped us kind of grow our pipeline at this point. No, I would just add to it that yes, we've had consistent results for a long time. To your point on our scale, we see all the competition out there. Our win rates and our cap rates are improving. So yes, I would just pile on to what you said and the success we're having and what we're seeing in the pipeline, the demand. Yes. So Eric, thanks. The question, I think, was on enterprise demand and continuing that as well as possible deals we have for the quarter. I'm not going to talk through specific deals.

            "name": "A. William Stein",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework, and we made further progress on each front during the third quarter. We continue to globalize our business with significant bookings and solid performance across regions. Our bookings were diversified by both region and product type, reflecting our unique full-spectrum global product offering. \n We also announced our entry into 2 high-potential emerging markets, India and Nigeria, during the third quarter while expanding our connectivity capabilities by working with Zayo to develop the largest open fabric-of-fabrics that will interconnect key centers of data exchange. We are also extending our capabilities for customers to the edge with the announcement of what will be one of a few strategic partnerships in this arena. \n Let's discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3. During the third quarter, Digital Realty was honored to be recognized by GRESB as an overall global sector leader in the technology and science category for exemplary ESG performance, receiving a coveted 5-star rating from this leading global ESG benchmarking organization and reflecting Digital Realty's commitment to being a global leader in ESG. We also became a UN Global Compact signatory in September, aligning our ESG goals and commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals with a global initiative. \n We also advanced our sustainable financing strategy, raising our first-ever Swiss green bonds and publishing the allocation of $440 million of proceeds from our September 2020 Euro green bond, which funded sustainable data center development projects in 4 countries across 3 continents certified in accordance with leading sustainable rating standards. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and broader society while advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all of these stakeholders. \n While on the topic of energy, I'm pleased to report that Digital Realty experienced only a small negative impact from the substantial rise in energy costs during the third quarter. In Europe, where concerns of an energy crisis were most acute, we typically contract for energy supplies a year or more in advance, providing price visibility and certainty for our customers. Elsewhere around the world, energy costs are typically passed through to customers, minimizing our direct exposure. We continue to keep a close eye on energy prices, but given the resiliency of our business model, we do not expect rising energy costs to impact our reported results by more than a few pennies. \n Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform. As previously announced, we entered into a joint venture with Brookfield to expand PlatformDIGITAL into India, a giant underserved market with the fifth largest GDP in the world. Like many emerging markets, India presents some unique challenges, underscoring the need for local knowledge and experience. To that end, we were pleased to announce the hiring of Seema Ambastha as CEO for the India joint venture. Seema has years of experience in the Indian IT sector broadly and in the data center industry specifically where she most recently served as a senior executive leader with the NTT Netmagic data center business across India. We believe the India data center market has the potential to experience significant growth over the next decade, and we're thrilled to have such a strong partner and strong leader in this exciting new venture. \n During the third quarter, we continued to expand iColo, our Kenyan data center operator, acquiring a land parcel in Mozambique to build a facility positioned to land subsea cables and other connectivity-focused customers. We also acquired a controlling interest in Medallion Communications, the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Nigeria in partnership with our existing African partner, Pembani Remgro. As the African Internet economy matures, we expect Nigeria will represent a significant growth opportunity, given its large and relatively young population, a growing and diversifying economy as well as a maturing regulatory environment. Given the connectivity of Africa from our existing hub in Marseille, our platform will now offer the market-leading destinations, connecting Africa to Europe and beyond. \n We're also investing to organically expand our capacity. As of September 30, we had 44 projects underway around the world, totaling almost 270 megawatts of incremental capacity with over 250 megawatts scheduled for delivery before the end of 2022. We continue to invest most heavily in EMEA, where we now have 27 projects underway in 15 different markets totaling 150 megawatts of incremental capacity, most of which is highly connected, including significant expansions in Frankfurt, Marseille, Paris and Zurich. Our investment in organic development is a reflection of the strength of demand across EMEA. \n We're being a bit more selective in North America. We're seeing strong demand in Portland where we have a 30-megawatt facility under construction that is 100% pre-leased and scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of next year, while we also have significant projects underway in Northern Virginia, New York and Toronto. \n Finally, in Asia Pacific, we continue to pursue strong organic development, both on our own and with our joint venture partners. We are adding capacity in Hong Kong that will open this quarter and expect to open Korea's first carrier-neutral facility in Seoul in early 2022. We are building a connected campus in Seoul to provide the full spectrum of solutions for our customers. The larger second facility will accommodate up to 64 megawatts of capacity and will be located within 25 kilometers of our first facility. \n Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers, and our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect developing trends as they emerge globally on PlatformDIGITAL. Just over a year ago, we introduced the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool that forecasts the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. \n Earlier this year, we published an industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities to guide cross-industry collaboration, tackle data gravity head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity. Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of data gravity. According to IDC, the amount of digital data created over the next 5 years will be greater than twice the amount of data created since the advent of digital storage. This digital data creation is expected to drive exponential growth in enterprise user data aggregation, storage and exchange, providing a powerful tailwind for data center demand. \n We continue to see enterprise and service provider customers deploying their own data hubs and using interconnection to securely exchange data in multiple metros on PlatformDIGITAL to accommodate their own data creation growth. Recently, for the second consecutive year, Digital Realty was ranked as the only outperformer and global leader by GigaOm for edge colocation. This ranking reflects our continued innovation and the execution of our PlatformDIGITAL road map for delivering global differentiated capabilities and value for our customers and partners. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market-leading innovation to capture the growing global demand opportunity from data-driven businesses. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Thanks, Jon. I'll take your first question and I'll hand it over to Andy to adjust the -- to answer the Singapore REIT. First of all, I think you're right about inflation in terms of the opportunity that it presents. I think there's no doubt that it disproportionately, adversely affects our smaller competitors and widens our competitive moat. Over time, I would expect that rental rate increases will disproportionately accrue to the larger incumbent providers. \n There are basically 2 pieces to the inflation issue: the first is development, the second is operations. On the development side, we are -- our pipeline is on time and it's on budget, and they're kudos to Erich Sanchack, who leads our operations and procurement team for the vendor management programs that he's put in place, providing us fixed pricing for several years out, for diversifying our vendor mix and for allowing our -- for locking in our general contractors. We have a lot of construction sites around the world, and we're able to move our GCs around and keep them fully occupied. \n And I think our global scale as well as our maturity as a builder gives us a substantial competitive advantage here. But again, I don't think there's any doubt that market rents will eventually need to move up to maintain risk-adjusted returns. And I think that, that's both because of the increase in construction costs that show up in the denominator. But I think for our private competitors who are operating with more leverage, I think you're going to see that show up in the higher interest rates. So to -- I think they're going to have to raise their costs for that reason as well. \n And I think the readthrough here is actually really positive for our renewals because as our rates on new product increase, our rates will also, I expect, increase for renewals. So the bottom line there is that modest inflation, we think, is quite healthy for the business. And in terms of our customers, this shouldn't come as a surprise to them because to the extent that they're doing it themselves, they're seeing this development in their own supply chains. \n Relative to the operations of the P&L, I think as you probably know, our leases provide for significant pass-throughs. So for example, over 90% of our utility costs this last quarter were passed through to customers. We also have rent bumps generally between 2% and 3%. And then we have, I think, the highest operating -- or the best operating leverage of highest margins in the business. So what that means is that labor or labor costs, which I think is what's most susceptible to inflationary pressure, is a relatively low percentage of the revenue component in the income statement. And so with that, I'll hand it over to Andy to talk about the Singapore REIT. Jordan, it's definitely a function of geographic mix. It's also a function of an extension that we were doing with existing customers that we were providing some rentable concession as well. Andy, you want to add anything to that? Yes, I'm going to turn it over to Chris to handle the edge questions since he spends a fair bit of his days on that particular initiative. Andy? Thanks, Simon. So listen, we are in the middle of budget season, and I got my head of FP&A to my right and he'll step on my foot really painfully if I get out of my skis here. But that being said, listen, we got a same-store pool that's going to materially grow. And I think it's in a positive direction with the addition of Interxion, the Westin Building, Altus IT, our business in Athens. We've acquired higher pricing power components added to the mix. \n We're also making great progress on re-leasing the capacity that was vacated at the beginning of this year, a huge portion of signings as -- that I mentioned we did this quarter has been falling into vacant or vacated capacity, so a quick resumption of cash flow from that space that sat idle for a portion of 2021. So net-net, I think there's a few things that kind of point to this kind of more positive trajectory in the same-store pool. Hence, my comment about optimistic of where we're going for 2022. Yes, Frank, I mean, that's -- I don't think that's going to be -- that's not going to show up next quarter or the quarter after, I think. But I do think if you see sustained inflation, it's going to start flowing through to our competitors' construction costs. As I said, I think it will show up in higher interest rates. And I think it will put upward pressure on rents across the board, which will affect not just our new leasing but renewal leasing. But it's hard to put a specific time on it, certainly not going to be in the next quarter or two. Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap our call today by recapping our highlights for the third quarter as outlined here on the last page of the presentation. One, our value proposition is clearly resonating with customers. PlatformDIGITAL attracted a record number of new logos. We had another quarter of strong new bookings and a record level of renewals. Most importantly, customers know that we will do what we say. Even when global supply chains are stressed, Digital Realty delivers. \n Two, we're continuing to extend our global platform. We are investing organically to enhance our global footprint while expanding our platform into India, along with additional strategic connectivity destinations circling the African continent. \n Three, we generated double-digit revenue growth during the third quarter, once again exceeding consensus expectations. And once again, we raised our full year outlook. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, locking in attractively priced long-term debt and supplementing it with equity capital that will be drawn down over the next 18 months to support our global development program. \n I'd like to once again thank the Digital Realty frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world turning. I hope that you all stay safe and healthy, and we hope to see many of you virtually in a couple of weeks at NAREIT and hopefully in person again sometime soon. Thank you."

            "name": "Gregory Wright",
            "content": "Eric, with respect to capital recycling, I guess what I would say is things are still consistent with what we said a few years ago. And a few years ago, we said we were going to sell a few billion dollars of assets over a few years. And again, the reasons that we were recycling out of those assets and redeploying that capital into more core strategic assets remains. Whether they were assets that weren't core to our business or certain markets that weren't core to our business, that's why we're selling assets. We're not just selling assets because there's strong cap rate activity in the market. \n Now that obviously helps. But again, if an asset is core to us, we're not going to sell it just because cap rates are getting better. But again, it does put a little wind at our back to the extent we are selling assets now, given the improved pricing we're seeing in the market. And you're right, we saw strong pricing in our portfolio disposition in Europe this past year. And now on the Prudential deal, we saw very strong pricing, as you said, on the stabilized assets. It was mid-4s, of which we were fortunate to recognize almost $20 million of promote out of that transaction as well. \n So look, your point is right, pricing is strong. We think that bodes well for the sector and for big owners of assets like ourselves. But maybe I'll turn it over to Andy to go ahead and see if he has anything to add. Sure. Erik, it's Greg again. Look, I think when you look at the transactions, right, the transactions we've talked about here are clearly a company called Medallion Communications in Nigeria, and the total consideration for that project was $29 million. We partnered with Pembani on that, so the amount of capital we have is even less. \n And another transaction we disclosed was the acquisition of a land parcel in Mozambique, again, with Pembani. That was for $3 million. So I mean, look, these are clearly -- what I would say is these are small Cs that we're planning in these highly connected assets because they are, they're highly connected communities of interest. And we're doing it with a smart local partner in Pembani. And when you look at a market like Nigeria, right, it's got the largest GDP and population in Africa. And the size of that investment, as I said, is very small for a company our size. And as I mentioned, Mozambique is even smaller. And we did that one to gain a location that again will play a critical role with the subsea cable activity that will encircle Africa. \n I think as you think about it, right, you look and see in Europe, right, we have Marseille in Western Europe, right, which is a highly connected hub. Then we've done a transaction with Lamda Hellix in Greece, which we believe is going to become a highly connected hub. And as you look at that, so you have Marseille to the west, you have Greece to the east. And as you move down into Africa, right, you look at Nigeria on the west, you look at Kenya in the east, right, and then you look at Mozambique that goes down to the south, and we really view this as really one large, like, crossroads of connectivity, if you will, that we think are going to bode well long term for the company."

            "content": "No, I appreciate it, Bill, and thanks for the question, David. Yes, we've definitely been watching the edge for some time now. We do see -- it's still in its early stages of being a material opportunity. But one of the things that we've done is partner with AtlasEdge that we think they can provide a significant value in extending our platform deeper into the metro. And so that's something that we're looking at learning and understanding how to gain more intelligence in their new types of infrastructure they're bringing to market. And quite frankly, it expands and enhances our core to edge strategy so that our partners and our customers can get the benefit of extending their existing infrastructure out to the edge when it matures over time. \n I would also say that a critical piece that I think you picked up on, David, which is great, is that we at Digital, we're open, right? This is one of many partners and relationships that we're going to continue to prosecute because we see that there's many types of avenues out into accessing this edge infrastructure. But you're going to see a lot of partnerships over the course of the next couple of quarters where we'll further invest and refine exactly how we're going to prosecute that edge opportunity. Absolutely. Thanks, Michael, for the question. It gives me an opportunity. I just want to also commend Giuliano as getting the role of CEO over at AtlasEdge. It's a great opportunity for him and we'll continue to work closely with him. So I appreciate the question, Michael. But going one step further, and I think you're spot on in that we often talk about the edge evolving from the core out deeper into the metro. And I think one aspect of that is no 2 markets are equal, so there's definitely varying degrees of capabilities in each of the markets globally. \n So Europe is one, in a general sense, North America and APAC. We absolutely are pursuing different types of partnerships within all of these markets because, quite frankly, our largest customers are looking for a global solution. And so we're always looking at what is the best path to enable our customers in the most efficient way possible. That's at the core of what is our edge thesis that we continually refine and that's what we referenced even in the prepared remarks, I think, in Bill's section about you'll see other partnerships in different markets just to really helping us prosecute that opportunity when it matures over time."

            "name": "Andrew Power",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. For the second straight quarter, we signed total bookings of $113 million, this time with a $12 million contribution from interconnection. Deal mix was consistent with the prior 4-quarter average, sub-1 megawatt deals plus interconnection represented about 40% of the total, while larger deals represented around 60%. Space and power bookings were also well diversified by region, with EMEA and APAC contributing 45% of our total, about the same as the Americas, with interconnection accounting for the remaining 10%. \n The weighted average lease term was a little over 5.5 years, and we landed a record 140 new logos during the third quarter, with strong showings across all regions, demonstrating the power of our global platform. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a leading cloud-native cybersecurity platform is expanding its high-performance computing capabilities by leveraging PlatformDIGITAL in 4 markets across North America and Europe, connecting with cloud providers, improving performance and driving down cost. \n A market-leading autonomous driving technology developer partnered with Digital Realty to tailor an innovative and unique infrastructure solution for simulation workloads. Two major North American energy firms chose Digital Realty to leverage our geographic reach and re-architect their network to interconnect with cloud providers and implement security controls as part of their hybrid IT strategy. A public university in the eastern U.S. is launching a global research initiative with other universities in EMEA and deploying PlatformDIGITAL network hubs across 2 continents and 3 cities to help enable this project. \n A maker of high-performance computing systems is expanding their footprint by deploying on PlatformDIGITAL across multiple regions to guarantee GDPR compliance while enhancing their security, performance and sustainability. And finally, a Global 500 fintech provider is expanding their own hybrid IT availability zones into multiple new metros, using PlatformDIGITAL to support their data-intensive and high-performance computing requirements. \n Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced rose from $303 million to $330 million, and third quarter signings more than offset commencements. The lag between signings and commencements was down slightly from last quarter at just over 7 months. \n Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed $223 million of renewal leases during the third quarter, our largest-ever renewal quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the quarter was a little over 3.5 years. Renewal rates for sub-1 megawatt deals remain consistently positive. Greater than 1 megawatt renewals were skewed by our largest deal of the quarter that combined a sizable 30-megawatt renewal with our largest new deal for the quarter, which will land entirely in existing currently vacant or soon-to-be-vacant capacity across Chicago and Ashburn. Excluding this 1 transaction, our cash mark-to-market would have been a positive 1%. \n This multifaceted transaction was a prime example of what we mean when we talk about our holistic long-term approach to customer relationship management. We believe we have a distinct advantage when we are competing for new business with a customer that we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio. And whenever we can, we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings, including both new business as well as renewals. \n In terms of first quarter operating performance, reported portfolio occupancy ticked down by 50 basis points, largely driven by the sale of fully-leased assets during the quarter. Upon commencement of the large combination renewal expansion lease I mentioned a moment ago, portfolio occupancy is expected to improve by 70 basis points. Same-capital cash NOI growth was negative 5.5% in the third quarter, primarily driven by a spike in property taxes in Chicago, where local assessors have adopted a very aggressive posture along with the impact of the Ashburn churn event in January. \n Of the 70 megawatts we've got back on January 1, approximately 80% has since been released to multiple large and growing customers. As a reminder, the Westin Building in Seattle, the Interxion platform in EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece and Altus IT in Croatia are not yet included in the same-store pool, so these same-capital comparisons are less representative of our underlying business today than usual. And while we're still in the early stages of our budgeting process, we are optimistic in terms of where our same-store NOI growth goes for 2022. \n Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. The U.S. dollar strengthened during the third quarter, providing a small FX headwind in the third quarter. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. Our Swiss green bond offering during the quarter is a good example of this. \n In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have approximately a 50 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. \n In terms of earnings growth, third quarter core FFO per share was up 7% on both a year-over-year and sequential basis, driven by strong operational execution, cost controls and a reduction in financing costs from the debt refinancings and redemptions of preferred stock over the past year. To avoid any confusion, our core FFO outperformance excludes the benefit of a nearly $20 million promote fee received in connection with the monetization of our joint venture with Prudential. Heading into the final quarter of the year, we have solid momentum so we are raising our full year outlook for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and core FFO per share to reflect this underlying momentum in our business. \n Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 12. We continue to recycle capital by disposing of assets that have limited growth prospects, raising over $100 million in the third quarter for our 20% position in the Prudential JV and some land in Arizona. We also raised approximately $95 million of common equity under our ATM program in July, as well as $950 million of common equity in a September forward equity offering. Our reported leverage ratio remains at 6x, but including committed proceeds from the September forward equity offering, the leverage ratio drops to 5.6x, while our fixed charge coverage improves to 6x. \n We continued to execute our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. Our 2 capital markets transactions this quarter are examples of our prudent approach to balance sheet management. This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. \n As you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is over 6 years and our weighted average coupon is down to 2.2%. 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate, guarding against a rising rate environment, and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. \n Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 14, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? Thanks, Bill. So Jon, you picked up obviously in the 8-K we put out there a few weeks ago. We are kind of heading down the path of exploring essentially an IPO of a portfolio on the Singapore market. This is not our APAC business, which has significant amounts of capacity under construction and land and the like. This is essentially being more analogous to almost like a private capital partner to Digital Realty for stabilized, fully well-leased, high-quality core long-term hold data centers to Digital and our strategy. \n Somewhat analogous to one of our joint ventures that we've done in the past couple of years with that one of which was with a Singapore REIT. We're still working through this. It's a long IPO process. There's no certainty on the outcome or completion. Sizing would be obviously a modest IPO size to begin with. But we do think this option has the merits of being an attractive long-term partner vehicle to Digital Realty. Yes. Just maybe just a little more color. I mean the overall sign was a strong quarter, well north of $100 million. In North America, as you pointed out, it was in our prepared remarks, we had a sizable signing where we essentially came to the table with a holistic relationship-oriented solution for our customer, combining a renewal that impacted our mark-to-markets as well as the new signing. \n On the renewal, if you pulled that out of our mark-to-markets, we're positive 1%, but it was a 30-megawatt signing so it was a large kind of contributor to that. And on the new signing, I think it was into 4 or so different data halls. It was spread across both Ashburn and Chicago. It was 100% into existing vacant or to-be-vacated capacity, so a direct flow through to the bottom line, not, call it, future re-leasing. And so we think it was an attractive combination of helping a customer grow with us on our campus. And this is a customer we see future growth in years to come. So happy to support them. So maybe I'll -- Jordan, this is Andy again. I'll try to take them in backwards order. So we have, call it, approaching 300, 270-something of megawatts, shovels in ground all the way to opening doors as we speak. And we are insulated in terms of our cost and procurement, whether it's through our VMI programs or through just supplier contracts and other things we do have been focused on building new capacity for so many years consistently. \n Beyond that, we are not fully insulated but those VMIs I just mentioned do extend. They're primarily focused in North America. They extend until 2023 so we do have a fair bit of insulation. We're not whistling by the graveyard on this topic. Obviously, inflation is here and will impact anyone that's called in the development arena. But we do believe given our size, scale as the largest developer and track record, that we're going to fare better than our competitor set and especially any newer incumbents to development. \n In terms of urgency, I think our customers are always urgent despite making massive financial decisions. Maybe I'll have Corey jump in a little bit to give you a little bit of flavor on the customer plans. And then David, on the second question, so just to review a few facts. So 90%, if you look at our just P&L, 90% of the power is reimbursed overall. We do pursue a hedging strategy primarily on our deregulated markets where you see potential greater volatility. We're about 85% hedged with contract durations ranging from 1 to 3 years. We also, as you know, are incredibly focused on sustainability. Green power procurement is a massive part of that playbook, and we pride ourselves in what we've done in that efforts to further green our portfolio, including power purchase agreements. \n Some of those have a potentially offsetting impact if in the event that power prices are to surge that provides an incremental hedge to power costs. So where we see it in the event that this elevated power scenario plays out for the duration of 2022, we'd look at it as just a couple of cents, which call it, every $0.01 is just almost $3 million. So not -- I wouldn't say a material headwind at this time. Yes. And then also from a pipeline perspective, Simon, I would just tell you that PlatformDIGITAL and just our thought leadership around data gravity is really taking hold, right? Our enterprise pipeline's growing across all regions, so really happy with that. Gartner was forecasting solid growth in enterprise IT spend. It just feels like we're in kind of the early innings of the IT transformation for the enterprises. \n As mentioned in the opening remarks, this quarter represented a new high for us, new logos at 140 new logos, so think about that as a proxy for enterprises continuing to decide to buy and partner with us. So we feel good about the demand signals in our pipeline going forward. Hopefully, that answers your question, Simon. Sure. So Matt, maybe I'll do it in reverse order here for just in order of efficiency here, make sure everyone gets the question. So core FFO, we're not -- we didn't pull forward our 2022 guidance dramatically. But I think we're definitely pleased with how we're putting up results this year that has got, call it, double digits top line, kind of 7% year-over-year performance at the bottom line. We've now raised our guidance, so we're just over the 5%, call it, year-over-year for 2021. And you heard from Corey and Bill and the others we're confident in the pipeline. \n So we think -- we're looking to kind of grow the bottom line higher next year than this year. So that's a continuation of things I've been saying for pretty much every quarter of '21. But sorry, no sneak preview on '22 guidance just yet. On competitive landscape, I think that refers to leasing competitive landscape, and has there been any changes on the backs of M&A or whatever in our space? I mean, Corey should chime in here, but by and large, I don't think I've seen any dramatic change. \n I think the trend has been our friend, for now, several quarters of more and more customers attracted to a global platform across 25 countries, 50 metropolitan areas, spanning the full customer spectrum, supporting those -- most of those 4,000 customers in the retail-oriented environments all the way up to the dedicated data halls for hyperscalers who we have in, call it, north of 45 different locations. And I've not seen any dramatic change in that. And I think you can see that now on several quarters of consistent, call it, results. But Corey, I don't know if you have any different observations. Thanks, Mike. Maybe I'll take the second question and hand off to Chris to talk about what's next on edge. So I mean, listen, we're always in active relationship-oriented dialogues with our customers but especially our largest customers who we're supporting in so many different markets and really the full suite of products from network-oriented deployments, hybrid IT, all the way out to their true massive cloud compute. \n And we just want to -- we try to come to the table with holistic solutions. If they have a renewal that's coming in the coming years, we just make sure that's part of the conversation, right? And it often leads to situations like which recently transpired in the last quarter where they may not take some of the new business out to a full search of the market or say, \"You know what, I've already deployed on your campus and then growing these adjacent data halls is the right move.\" So it's really a holistic relationship-oriented approach. \n As it relates to, I think, the heart of your question, yes, we don't like having any mark-to-market go down at all, so a negative 5% quarter is not great. But in the scheme of things, we're still holding our guidance for the full year. We had a positive 0-point -- a very modest positive last quarter and we're seeing strength in the fourth quarter. And we've been saying for some time, we think the front [ review ] of these expirations are getting better in terms of the mix, more higher pricing power footprints as well as more international footprints where we have greater pricing power on these renewals. And that's putting aside incremental uplift potential from this inflation-related impact that Bill kind of highlighted that should manifest itself over time. Chris, do you want to tackle the edge? Honestly, Frank, they're backfilling vacant capacity so it wasn't like we were building out a new building. I think a good chunk of that is legacy DFT capacity, which we did a stock-for-stock deal and hence, it was kind of a currency exchange. So I don't think the development -- I don't think the development yield would be the right way to look at it. \n You can look at the -- given its size, it was the preponderance of the North America signings in the plus megawatt category, which -- listen, we always want rates to be higher, but we -- those are 2 markets where I would say that we -- I think we garnered a fair economic rate for that capacity, and we're refilling something that's already built in our capitalization. We're paying tax -- real estate taxes on it. We're operating the capacity so it's going to flow through to our bottom line. And we've not changed, I would say, our development target returns on the, call it, 270 megawatts that we have under construction. That actually inched up a smidge this last quarter. Corey, why don't you hit the first one and Greg and I can tag team the second one? Just one thing, just 2 buckets there, selling outright noncore assets that Greg did a great job of describing, streamlining our portfolio, aligning with growing customers, long-term growth assets. And then I think it was touched on one of the first or second questions on also evolving our capital sources in terms of core assets and raising private capital, all of this with the initiative of trying to accelerate our bottom line growth through capital efficiency. Erik, I don't think there's any limitations. We always have room for more leasing in any given quarter. And I know Corey's also chomping at the bit for more inventory to sell into quickly. But listen, I think it was a pretty very healthy quarter. You look at the geo mix, how well spread across each of the regions. You look at the enterprise mix with less than 1 megawatt in interconnection, call it, 40%; record 140 new logos. That record 140 had a record contribution from -- on quarter lease, [ reckon ] last 6 quarters from North America and I think #2 from an EMEA contribution. \n You could see from the new logo or some of the logos we called out in my prepared remarks, kind of like more old world enterprise, global power firms and universities to burgeoning technologies like autonomous driving. And I think on the hyperscale side, a little bit similar. Some of the, call it, house names of digital growing with us into existing inventory as well as some, call it, next-generation hyperscalers landing with us in Tokyo, which I think was our second and third largest signing. So broadly pretty healthy and we're not done yet for 2021. So Colby, I think that's 4 questions relative to our 2 limit, but [indiscernible] color to... So we're going to get them all rapid-fire here. Listen, I think we've been saying for some time, we think we're moving into a better territory on the cash mark-to-market. And I think the -- what you see in our guidance, including the fourth quarter, relative to what we are trending already reported for the year speaks to that. And I think I've been saying that for some time that I think we're heading to more -- better territories. So again, we're not done with the budget and certainly not our guidance for 2022, but it feels like we're -- based on the mix, both product and geos and composition, we're in a better territory than we were certainly at the beginning of this year on that stat. \n We did -- across 4 or so suites, so different buildings across roughly half and half Ashburn and Chicago, a total of about 30 megawatts of new signings with the same customer that also did roughly 30 megawatts of renewals in the same quarter. And you could see this was a really super high renewal quarter overall for us. We've usually been doing like 100 megawatts or just shy of that in that plus than [ 1-megawatt ] LTM standpoint on. And so you can see, I think we had 53 or something in that category this quarter. So a high renewal activity quarter. So hopefully, that paints the picture on those two. \n Undrawn forward equity offering, yes, we -- listen, we -- the equity offering was again opportunistically derisking our development CapEx plan, and we're able to extend the duration of that contract so we have greater flexibility to essentially feather it into our sources or uses over time at the right time for the business, which hopefully better -- is better measured and help contributes to our earnings growth in the ensuing years. \n Facebook CapEx increasing, I don't think we have got any inside information on that. They're a large customer. We've done -- we did new business with them in the last quarter. But I don't see how it could be a negative necessarily, but I don't want to over-index that is super positive to the industry. Yes, Aryeh, so I mean, inflation -- I believe inflation is here. If you filled up your car or purchased milk at the grocery store, I think Bill's comments to one of the questions, it didn't mean like overnight, the data center industry got a rate reset. I think we've seen inflationary pressures prior to this hard cost inflation happen where markets just got tighter as they ran up to the physical boundaries of infrastructure, right? So our Santa Clara and Northern -- Santa Clara's an example of that. I mean our leasing success has been certainly a [ healing ] to the Ashburn market. We saw this in Frankfurt. Singapore saw this in terms of supply limitations, driving up pricing, which we've raised pricing there at least 5 times, I think, in the last 12 months. \n And I think Bill's commentary is that, listen, as this continues to hit [ car ] costs and delivery or access to the infrastructure is to bring on new supply which is, we believe, is going to be disproportionately impacting smaller subscale newer entrants, that means that our customers have less options in terms of their providers. And I think that as our costs get inflated, we have to examine our rates and on a market-by-market supply and demand and costing basis. \n And listen, I think we're -- do the -- going to be the best out there in terms of insulating our customers from this. But I know -- I think if this period continues for a long time, we haven't had inflation realistically since, call it, the end of the Carter administration. So we're in new territory for many of us. But I think it's -- I think we're going to fare better at the end of the day. \n And we are insulated in terms of we have rent escalators, fixed bumps in most of our contracts. And I think our scale and purchasing power on an operating side as well as the build cost side provides insulation in addition to some of the other risk mitigations we mentioned earlier in the call. I would -- I believe it's probably 10-ish percent above new signings in apples-to-apples comparable markets. We typically see renewals have greater pricing power than new deals, just on the customer has a strong preference to not risk infrastructure or workload on a move. It could be higher than that, actually. I would say it's probably that's maybe on the skinnier side. But it all depends on the facts and circumstances of the supply and demand, the utilization of the infrastructure, the customers' growth plans, the workload. Is it B2C? Is it B2B? All these things kind of go into the factors that drive the commercial outcome on those. And it was 30 megawatts all at once, right? So 30 megawatts of new signs for 30 megawatts of renewals, all with a stroke of a pen."

I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. John, please go ahead.\nJohn Stewart: Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today\u2019s call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I\u2019d like to hit the tops of the waves on our second quarter results. We continue to enhance our product mix, with a record contribution from our sub-1-megawatt plus interconnection category. We extended our sustainability leadership with the publication of our third Annual ESG Report. We raised revenue and EBITDA guidance for the second quarter in a row, setting the stage for accelerating growth in cash flow. Last but not least, we further strengthen the balance sheet with the redemption of high coupon preferred stock and the issuance of low cost long-term fixed rate debt. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Stein: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global connected sustainable framework. We continue to advance along these lines during the second quarter. Our business continues to globalize, and once again, we generated solid performance and strong bookings across all regions. Our full spectrum product offering continues to blossom, with record sub-1-megawatt bookings in the second quarter and regional highs in both EMEA and APAC. Together with interconnection, the sub-1-megawatt category comprise nearly half of our total bookings, demonstrating customers enthusiastic adoption of PlatformDIGITAL to help accomplish their digital transformation initiatives. I\u2019ll discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on page three. In June, we were awarded the Green Lease Leader Gold Award from the Institute for Market Transformation and the U.S. Department of Energy for the third year. We remain the only data center provider to receive this award, which recognizes Digital Realty as a leader in the real estate industry that incorporates green leasing provisions to better align our interests with our customers and drive high performance and healthy buildings. During the second quarter, we published our third Annual ESG Report, detailing our 2020 sustainability initiatives, including the utilization of renewable energy for 100% of our energy needs across our entire portfolio in Europe, as well as our U.S. colocation portfolio, and reaching 50% of our global needs. We also reported progress towards our science-based target, ensuring a deep focus on our renewable energy, energy efficiency and supply chain sustainability initiatives. Our ESG Report highlights many of our ongoing initiatives including our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, along with our community involvement. Digital Realty is committed to being an active member of and giving back to the communities where we operate globally. We encourage and celebrate community involvement and employee engagement activities through our Do Better Together initiative. We also recently underscored our commitment to transparency and accountability on our diversity, equity and inclusion journey with the publication of our EEO-1 report. Events over the past year and a half have demonstrated that now more than ever ESG belongs at the forefront of our business. I\u2019m proud of our leadership in this area as we advance our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities we serve around the world. Let\u2019s turn to our investment activity on page four. We are continuing to invest in our global platform, with 39 projects underway around the world as of June 30th, totaling nearly 300 megawatts of incremental capacity, most of which is scheduled for delivery over the next 12 months. We\u2019re investing most heavily in EMEA, with 19 projects totaling over 150 megawatts of capacity under construction. Most of this capacity is highly connected, including projects in Frankfurt, Marc\u00e9, Paris, and Zurich. Demand remains strong across these metros and each continues to attract service providers, as well as enterprise customers from around the world, many of which contributed to a truly stand up performance by the region during the second quarter in the up to 1-megawatt category. In North America, over half of our capacity under construction is concentrated in two hot markets, Portland and Toronto that can sometimes be overlooked in favor of more traditional North American data center metros. We\u2019ve had tremendous recent success in these two metros. We have 30-megawatts under construction in Portland or more specifically Hillsborough that are now fully pre-leased. While our Toronto connected campus continues to gain momentum as the premier Canadian hub for global cloud service providers and enterprise customers. Finally, in Asia-Pacific, we are accelerating our organic growth in this underserved region. We opened our third data center in Singapore, a 50-megawatt facility that received permitting prior to the moratorium on new data center construction. Demand for this scarce capacity is robust and we have another 18 megawatts largely pre sold and scheduled to open this quarter. Also coming soon in this region, are a pair of MC Digital Realty data centers in Japan. With the world\u2019s eyes currently on Tokyo for the Olympics, we are opening a new Tokyo facility that\u2019s poised to win the gold medal. We\u2019re also opening another data center in Osaka this quarter, along with our first data center and the first carrier-neutral offering in Seoul, Korea during the fourth quarter. We are very excited about the opportunity in Seoul and earlier this morning, we announced that we\u2019ve acquired another land parcel to expand our connected campus, enabling us to accommodate the hyperscale demand that has been clamoring for capacity and our first highly connected facility. Finally, earlier this month, we announced our intention to enter India in partnership with Brookfield Infrastructure, given the success of our existing partnership on the Ascenty platform in Latin America, the complementary skills and expertise that we both bring to this partnership, and with the significant growth opportunity available in India, we are excited to expand our footprint in this robust and dynamic market. Let\u2019s turn to the macro environment on page five. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. Our leadership position provides us with a unique advantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on PlatformDIGITAL. The first of these trends is the growing importance of data gravity for Global 2000 Enterprises. Last year, we introduced the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool, which forecast the rolling intensity of enterprise data creation lifecycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure between key global markets. Earlier this year, we took the next step and published an industry manifesto enabling connected data communities to guide cross industry collaboration, tackle data gravity head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity for all companies. Earlier this week, we announced a collaboration with Zayo to further interconnection business through the creation of an open fabric of fabrics. With data sets exploding and data gravity challenges expanding, this initiative will enable multinational enterprises to connect these data oceans through fabric and orchestration. Third-party research continues to support data gravity\u2019s growing importance. Market intelligence firm Gartner recently conducted its sixth annual survey of Chief Data officers and less than 35% of these executives reported their business have achieved their data sharing objectives, including data exchange with external data sources that drive revenue generating business outcomes. Issues often arise due to multiple data hosting and processing meeting places, together with the need for appropriate security controls and the inability to overcome latency challenges with direct private interconnection between many counterparties. PlatformDIGITAL was designed to solve these problems. Digital transformation is compounding as enterprise data and connectivity problem. Recent research indicates that enterprise workflows utilize an average of 400 unique data sources by exchanging data with 27 external cloud products, Digital Realty\u2019s enterprise and service provider customers are turning to PlatformDIGITAL to overcome these issues by deploying their own data hubs and using interconnection to securely exchange data in and across multiple metros. Our leadership position is resonating with industry experts and influencers. For the second consecutive year, Digital Realty was named a global leader by IDC MarketScape for Data Center Colocation and Interconnection Services, further acknowledgement of our consistently improving customer capabilities. This recognition reflects our execution against the PlatformDIGITAL roadmap, providing unique differentiated value for customers with our fit-for-purpose, full spectrum, global capabilities. Earlier this month, Cloudscene again ranked Digital Realty as the strongest provider of Data Center Ecosystems in EMEA for the second consecutive year. Digital Realty was ranked second in both North America, as well as Latin America, and jumped up three spots to number seven in Asia. Also in July, Kagame [ph] published their analysis of edge infrastructure capabilities. Digital Realty ranked as an industry leader on multiple criteria across three broad categories. Our capabilities were ranked highest in vendor positioning and evaluation metrics comparison and second among the key criteria comparison. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform to meeting customer\u2019s needs, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold and store. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.\nAndy Power: Thank you, Bill. Let\u2019s turn to our leasing activity on page seven. We signed total bookings of $113 million in the second quarter, including a $13 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise oriented deals of 1-megawatt or less reached an all time high of 41 million, demonstrating our consistent momentum and the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand. The weighted average lease term was over eight years. We landed 109 new logos during the second quarter with a strong showings across all regions. Again, demonstrating the power of a global platform. The geographic and product mix of our new activity was quite healthy, with APAC and EMEA each contributing approximately 20%, the Americas representing nearly 50% and interconnection responsible for a little over 10%. The megawatt or less plus interconnection category accounted for almost half our total bookings, with particular strength in the cloud, content and financial services verticals. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world. We landed a top five cloud service provider to anchor our new Tokyo campus. Close on the heels of this magnetic customer deployment, Japan\u2019s most popular social media application selected PlatformDIGITAL on the same campus. NAVER, the leading Korea based cloud provider serving the greater APAC region selected our new carrier-neutral facility in Singapore to support data intensive workloads for their high performance computing and I -- AI intensive technology based platform. A European broadcaster is leveraging PlatformDIGITAL in Vienna and Frankfurt to rewire their network in favor of data intensive interconnection with benefits in performance, scalability and cost savings. A Global 2000 Enterprise Data Platform is adopting PlatformDIGITAL in Amsterdam, Dublin and Frankfurt to orchestrate workloads across hundreds of ecosystem applications, delivering improved performance, security, cost savings and simplicity. In London, PlatformDIGITAL is supporting a top three global money center banks fortification of their business continuity capabilities, without compromising their data intensive interconnection requirements On the continent, our connectivity and operational capabilities are helping two independent FinTech customers, improve performance, enhanced -- and enhanced access to their connected data communities. Finally, in North America, a life sciences digital marketing firm chose PlatformDIGITAL to improve their network architecture enable future growth. Turning to our backlog on page nine. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced ticked down from $307 million to $303 million as commencement slightly eclipsed space and power leases signed during the quarter. The live between signings and commencement was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at just over seven months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 10. We signed $178 million of renewals during the second quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the second quarter was just under three years. Again, reflecting a greater mix of enterprise deals smaller than 1-megawatt. We retained 77% of expiring leases, while cash releasing spreads on renewals were slightly positive, also reflective of the greater mix of sub-1-megawatt renewals in the total. In terms of second quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy ticked down by 60 basis points, as we brought additional capacity online across six metros during the quarter. Same capital cash NOI growth was negative 1.5% in the second quarter, largely driven by the churn in Ashburn at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, the Western building in Seattle, the Interxion platform in EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece and Altus IT in Croatia, are not yet included in the same store pool. So these same capital comparisons are less representative of our underlying business today than usual. Let\u2019s turn to our economic risk mitigation strategies on page 11. The U.S. dollar fluctuated during the second quarter, but remained below the prior year average providing a bit of an FX tailwind. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to acts as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing, given our strategy and matching the duration of our long lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt and 100 basis point move in benchmark rates were roughly is 75-basis-point impact on full year FFO per share. In terms of earnings growth, second quarter core FFO per share was flat year-over-year, but down 8% from last quarter, driven by a $0.12 non-cash deferred tax charge related to the higher corporate tax rate in the U.K., which came into effect during the second quarter. Excluding the tax charge, which was not previously contemplated in our guidance, we outperformed our internal forecast due to a beat on a topline with a slight assist from FX tailwinds, as well as operating expense savings, partially due to lower property level spending in the COVID-19 environment. For the second time this year, we are raising our full year outlook for total revenue and adjusted EBITDA to reflect the underlying momentum in our business. The deferred tax charge does run through a core FFO per share, but as you can see from the press release, we are lowering the midpoint by just $0.05, which all else equal would imply $0.07 raise excluding the deferred tax charge. Since it is non-cash, the deferred tax charge does not hit AFFO. Most of the drivers of our guidance table are unchanged. But I would like to point out that we are lowering our expected recurrent CapEx spend for the remainder of the year, setting the stage for accelerated growth in cash flow. As you can see from the bridge chart on page 12, we expect our bottomline result to improve sequentially over the balance of the year, as the deferred tax charge comes out of the quarterly run rate and the momentum in our underlying business continues to accelerate. We do still expect to see some normalization in our cost structure, with an increase in property level operating expenses that have been deferred due to COVID along with an uptick in G&A expense, as we return to the office and resume a more normal travel schedule, so your models should reflect these higher costs. Last but certainly not least, let\u2019s turn the balance sheet on page 13. As you may recall, we closed on the sale of a portfolio of non-core assets in Europe for $680 million late in the first quarter, which impacted second quarter adjusted EBITDA to the tune of approximately $10 million. As a result, net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was slightly elevated 6 times as the end of the second quarter, but is expected to come back down in line with our long-term range over the course of the year, through a combination of proceeds from asset sales and growth in cash flows as signed leases commence. Fixed charge coverage ticked down slightly, also reflecting the near-term impact from asset sales, but remains well above our target and closer to all time high at 5.4 times, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management. We continue to execute our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long lived assets. In mid-May, we redeemed 200 million of preferred stock at 0.625%, which brought total preferred equity redemptions over the prior 12 months to $700 million and a weighted average coupon of just over 6.25 effectively lowering leverage by 0.3 terms. In mid-June, we issued 0.5 million shares under our ATM program raising approximately $77 million. In early July, we raised another $26 million with the sale of the balance of our Megaport stock. We also took our first trip to the Swiss bond market in early July, raising approximately $595 million in a dual tranche offering of Swiss green bonds with a weighted average maturity of a little over six and a half years and a weighted average coupon of approximately 0.37%. This successful execution against our financial strategy reflects the strength of a global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public, as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is nearly six and a half years, and our weighted average coupon is down to 2.2%. Over 70% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and serving as a natural FX hedge for our investment outside the U.S. 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see on the left side of page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we\u2019d be pleased to take your question. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jon Atkins of RBC. Please go ahead.\nJon Atkins: Thanks. I got one question and then a follow up. First on M&A, Interxion is now more than a year under your belt and then you announced kind of the JV expansion into India. I wondered if you could maybe symbolize your strategy for organic growth as it pertains to the potential purchases of existing platforms or assets. Sometimes there can be assets out there with dislocated valuation, so I thought it would be worth asking about that topic and getting a refresh? Thanks.\nBill Stein: Sure. Jon, happy to provide a refresh. First of all, we don\u2019t comment on M&A speculation, particularly as it relates to specific opportunities in the marketplace. But to refresh everyone\u2019s memory, we try to do only strategic deals. And by that, I mean, we\u2019re looking for investments that enhance either our geographic footprint or our product offering, thinking about specific deals. When you look back on Interxion, I think, we were fortunate with there we were able to do both. We were able to enhance our geographic penetration and add significantly to the colocation mix in Europe. We -- as it relates to --and the CyrusOne situation, which I think is what you probably were alluding to. We think that\u2019s a good platform. We have all this respect in the world for both Bruce Duncan and Steve and Dave Ferdman. But its gives us more of what we already have. And so I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s something that would be of interest to us.\nJon Atkins: And then on asset recycling that Andy mentioned towards the end, there was a press item from June about the potential formation of a Singapore REIT. And I wonder if you could give us an update as to what\u2019s happening and kind of the rationale?\nAndy Power: Thanks, Jon. So I think there\u2019s two concepts kind of interlinked in your question. So non-core capital recycling, we\u2019ve been doing a fair bit of that, most recently executed on portfolio in EMEA close to $700 million. That was not core or strategically digital. And it\u2019s kind of similar to a transaction we did back in, I think, 2019. So call it, folks in our portfolio, we see the most robust and diverse customer growth. So that\u2019s one leg of the stool that you can see will continue on, we activated this year, again, in terms of funding our business plan by recycling that capital into more strategic projects. We\u2019ve also done what\u2019s I will call it private capital partnerships. So similarly with that same transaction back in 2019 with Mapletree, we raised 80% stake and $1 billion of core assets, assets that we never really want to part with and we maintain operational control of as a minority partner. And so, I think, you\u2019ll see us continue to do both. But there\u2019s a big difference in our minds. Non-core things that we\u2019re willing to call it 100% and we wish the new owners well, and core really keeping those assets as part of our collective platform and just trying to recycle capital of the slower growth assets. Both of which I think at the end of the day, hopefully, accelerates our growth and allows us to redeploy that capital into higher return opportunities.\nJon Atkins: Anything specifically about the price item from I think Bloomberg and data center knowledge about forming a REIT in Singapore?\nBill Stein: I can say that kind of ties to both the questions. Coincidentally, Singapore REITs have been the buyers of our two biggest portfolio sales. They\u2019ve not been the only buyers. We\u2019ve also done other one-off assets sales to other private buyers that were non-core. As relates to any vehicle that we would do like that, we would only think about that in the core contacts, if we\u2019re going to extend our brand and sponsorship to it. So I think -- I can\u2019t comment on what that specific rumor was kind of pointing to, but it kind of is interwoven with both concepts a little bit.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you. Good afternoon. So I wanted to follow up a little bit in terms of sort of investment opportunity. Bill, you\u2019ve talked about, strategic, accretive and I think enhancing growth -- growth enhancing for some of the strategic objectives or criteria for acquisitions. If you can check those boxes, it would seem that, an acquisition even something domestic could make sense. The piece that I am struggling with a little bit, it may be like the growth enhancing. Strategic make some sense that even though there\u2019s some overlap accretive, I get -- we can figure that out, growth enhancing, the piece I wanted to ask you about was, does market share help in terms of sort of the growth outlook. In other words, if you\u2019re controlling certain -- a greater extent of the marketplaces and certainly these large hyperscale Tier 1 markets in the U.S. You think that would mitigate some of the downside rent pressure we\u2019ve seen in that vertical?\nBill Stein: Yeah. Jordan, I guess, when I think about -- so what we\u2019re trying to accomplish here and certainly in recent history, I mean, you saw the press release today, right, where we bought a piece of land in Seoul Korea and we already own a carrier-neutral data center in downtown Seoul, and now we\u2019re going to build a campus out in the suburbs. And what we\u2019re trying to do is replicated and so what we\u2019ve created in other markets in the world -- and around the world to the connected campus with a carrier-neutral dense network that you can tether the campus back into. And I think that when you look around the world today, they\u2019re just aren\u2019t that many platforms. I mean, there is not an Interxion in Asia. And I think that would you going to more likely see from us is what you\u2019re seeing in Seoul, we are in fact pursuing similar models in other parts of Asia and in other parts of the world where we\u2019re going into new markets and planting the flag with both network dense facilities and campuses. So just to repeat what our criteria is, yes, it has to be strategically important to us in terms of either geography or product additive to both, it needs to be, we\u2019d like it to be accretive to our near-term earnings idea and certainly accretive to growth, which is what Interxion was and Ascenty. And importantly prudently financed, so a capitalization\u2026\nJordan Sadler: Okay.\nBill Stein: \u2026 that is consistent with how we finance the rest of the business here at Digital. And anything you want to add or?\nAndy Power: I got two\u2026\nBill Stein: All right.\nAndy Power: Yes. I got two out of three right.\nBill Stein: You did. And we -- we\u2019re not the levered up in other words to make\u2026\nAndy Power: It was very to higher [inaudible] rate...\nJordan Sadler: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nBill Stein: Yes.\nJordan Sadler: Okay. I hope this wasn\u2019t the interview.\nBill Stein: But to put a finer point on it, we\u2019re not going to lever up these assets to make the number works -- numbers work.\nJordan Sadler: Okay. Andy, if you have anything else, I will follow up.\nAndy Power: I think the second or third part of your question was, can you drive pricing power to market share, which I think episodically there is opportunities to do that. I think if you look back to our DuPont Fabros transaction that was a market share moving transaction where we up-tiered our relationships with many customers to kind of to control near-term supply. And I think that concept maybe works in more overall supply-constrained markets predominantly outside the U.S. or even like a Santa Clara for that example. I do not -- I\u2019m not confident. I think your line of thinking would be other domestically-focused larger footprint players is that, does that M&A create better pricing power and today\u2019s backdrop, I don\u2019t see that same events playing out, but again life such in America.\nJordan Sadler: That\u2019s helpful. And then coming back Bill to sort of been around the world. India, can you guys potentially de-size the India JV opportunity for us? Just sort of initial sizing, I mean, is this -- could we see a platform purchase like Ascenty, like you did with Brookfield then there or is this going to be a de novo opportunity?\nBill Stein: I\u2019m going to hand that one over to Greg.\nGreg Wright: Okay. Thanks. Hey, Jordan. Look, I think, describe the India joint venture. Jordan, it\u2019s actually a hybrid. Look, as you know, we\u2019ve had a strong relationship with Brookfield. We\u2019ve had a great experience with the Ascenty, but when we purchase Ascenty, we bought -- we came into that platform together and purchase an existing platform that had 14 assets. Eight of which were under construction, six of which were operational assets and a team in place. This is going to be different from that. But we are, again, going in 50-50 joint partners, joint branding and alike, which you\u2019ve seen in some of our press materials. But here, we\u2019re going to be and we have some folks that are already residing in the JV, but we\u2019re actually going into India here to build a platform, and ultimately, we expect it to be like Ascenty. I mean being a standalone platform with a strong management team that drives the business. And I think when we look at India, we\u2019re not looking to go into India and just do like-for-like product. We\u2019re looking to do differentiated product and we think Brookfield as a partner here and given their presence in the tower space, and given what\u2019s happening in India in the mobile market and alike. We think we have a great opportunity to do that. And so, but the general governance and construct if you will is very similar to Ascenty, but the basic premise of going in. We\u2019re going into build a platform. We\u2019re not buying a platform. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s how I describe it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you. First question I just wanted to just run by you guys is, maybe you could give us a little bit more color on what\u2019s going on releasing spreads? Because in the greater than 1-megawatt releasing spread slide, which is slide 10, there was a meaningful improvement in spreads and I think we were going from down 11% to just down 1%. And I was hoping you just walk us through this. So that\u2019s part one of the question. Part two is, are essentially done with a lot of those high negative renewal spread, I mean, leases that we\u2019ve kind of been discussing on a last couple of quarters. Are you guys in the clear, is this -- are we going to see some lumpiness? Thank you.\nBill Stein: Hey. Thanks, Sami. Let me tackle that. So, like-for-like megawatt -- north of a megawatt quarter-over-quarter certainly saw an improvement from down just close to 11% on the prior quarters, 30-ish megs, the 23.5 megs came -- renew this quarter, came through this quarter, basically flat, negative 90 bps. Overall also improvement basically at 0.1% positive and over 2% positive GAAP. So, definitely move in the right direction. At the same time, I wouldn\u2019t call it be standing on the aircraft carrier with a victory flag just yet. We\u2019re still working through some still certain contracts that are above market. Hence we maintained, I will call it, language around our full year guidance of slightly negative. I did -- since parsing through both categories, in the -- in that category literally 82% of the megawatts that renewed were positive. So close to 2% positive. So really was like one or two negative that drug down the category to be flat. And in the over-to-up to that is greater than [Audio Gap] percent positive cash mark-to-markets in terms of the megawatts renewed. So, I would call, it\u2019s still episodic, moving in a better direction and that\u2019s a thematic things that I don\u2019t think this one quarter was a massive inflection point. We did gradually getting to better territory this year versus last year. And also feel that same trend kind of continuing based on the mix we see in the future. Sami, can you remind me your second question though?\nSami Badri: I think you kind of already hit it, but the second part of the question was just kind of, are you guys essentially going into the clear regarding a lot of the high negative renewal spreads leases that came with the DFT portfolio? You kind of answered it, but that was the second question?\nBill Stein: I don\u2019t think, I won\u2019t kind of go through my victories piece here. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re fully out of the woods, but where the trend is moving in our direction and we benefit from an incredibly diverse platform and as you look at our expirations going into this year, rest of this year or 2022 and beyond. The mix just is improving, right? The bars have gotten shorter. The concentration in the greater than megawatt is become more international, places where we\u2019ve had greater pricing power. So, not fully in the clear, but I feel like we\u2019re inching our way into better territory every day.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brendan Lynch of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, Andy, I\u2019ll just follow up on that renewal issue. It does seem like things are going better now. Is it possible that a few years out renewals could actually be a tailwind or are the escalator structured, so that it\u2019s generally neutral at best?\nAndy Power: Yes. I think there\u2019s definitely potential for fewer out cash mark-to-markets to be a positive tailwind here. I mean, we -- if you look at our -- the diversity of our product here we are -- it\u2019s a very sticky product. We\u2019re typically doing renewals in many markets better than new rates on new deals given the propensity inertia for our customer to stay. Our interconnection capabilities kind of further that stickiness, these markets where we\u2019re even bringing on new capacity are running up to physical barriers, whether supply of power, access to land, connectivity, government moratoriums are popping up in certain countries. And then the whole concept inflation and its impact to newer incumbents and overall cost structures. All those things point to a world of higher pricing power in this aspect and certainly more so for Digital relative to a new entrance.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe a question for Chris as well. Chris, maybe you can give us just a little bit of insight on the fabric of fabrics platform and kind of simplify that for us if you can?\nChris Sharp: No. Absolutely. Appreciate it. Yeah. So it\u2019s a continuation. We\u2019ve been investing in PlatformDIGITAL to make it more robust, where we have over 4,000 customers today. And as Andy alluded to earlier on Bill\u2019s comments earlier that we\u2019re adding 100 new customers every quarter. So, what we\u2019ve talked about with the fabric of fabrics and the partnership that we pulled together with Zayo is that these capabilities are proven to be very successful with our enterprise customers. And I think what we\u2019re talking about here today is about expanding those capabilities and those connectivity capabilities to a broader set of customers. And so I think that\u2019s one of the core things that we\u2019re really starting to drive and it\u2019s resonating well with our customers and that a lot of enterprises are out there looking for an open platform to really achieve their goals and remove complexity out of their deployments. And so that\u2019s what the PlatformDIGITAL is and what fabric of fabrics means as we pulled together a carrier-grade partner with Zayo and there the first partner that we\u2019ve executed this with and you will see other partners coming online to expand that value focused on our customers\u2019 success.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Funk of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Funk: Yeah. Thank you for the questions, and good evening, everyone. First was the basic just math question to check my facts. So, I think, in the first quarter you did core FFO of 167 a share. I think you guided same kind of down $0.10 sequentially due to a number of factors. But the $0.12 non-cash charge wasn\u2019t in that guide, right? So, if you strip that out, you actually were really only down about a penny quarter-over-quarter, right, for the core FFO. And if you think about rolling that forward the second half of the year saying you really had an $0.08 core FFO each, why wouldn\u2019t that core FFO per share a be excluding the $0.12. Why wouldn\u2019t that recur in 3Q and 4Q? What\u2019s going to change in those two quarters stripping out that one-time charge?\nBill Stein: So, two data points. One, we are increasing the guidance, net of the $0.12, right? So the $0.12 is a non-cash deferred tax hit. Sensibly, we revaluing a liability that due to the U.K. changing its corporate tax rates by 600 basis points that $35 million or $0.12 flows through one-time and it\u2019s non-cash, does not hit AFFO, which you can see that I think the lowest payout ratio we\u2019ve had in five quarters now. So, by the fact that we\u2019ve increased the guidance notwithstanding that $0.12, it\u2019s essentially would have been a raise. And if you backed out the $0.12 to the midpoint of our new guidance you\u2019re close to, what would be 6% year-over-year growth on the core FFO. The reason it doesn\u2019t all the beat in this quarter to heart of your question like it doesn\u2019t all flow-through some of the beat which is OpEx timing, so timing relative to some of the OpEx spend which got pushed out from 2Q into back half of the year.\nMichael Funk: And that was related to some of the deferred OpEx in 2020, is that still what you\u2019re talking about?\nBill Stein: Correct. Correct. I would call COVID-related\u2026\nMichael Funk: Okay.\nBill Stein: \u2026 catch up a little bit.\nMichael Funk: Got it. Understood. And then let me a little bit of commentary on the leasing environment. I know there was a lot of concern about leasing this quarter for the industry, but came in very strong, given the visibility you have into the back half of the year would have it might be. What are you seeing in terms of demand from hyperscalers and/or demand picking back up from enterprise customers?\nBill Stein: I think, Corey, why don\u2019t you pick us up there?\nCorey Dyer: Yeah. Sure. Thanks a lot. Thanks, Mike, for the question. With regard to enterprise demand and then I\u2019ll let you handle the hyperscale I think was part of this question as well. But in our opening remarks, we mentioned that over $50 million of our business was from the sub-1-megawatt plus interconnection, which is really approaching about 50% of our bookings. That\u2019s really proxy or our -- for our enterprise business. On top of that our best channel quarter ever, we also saw an increase in multi-site, multi-region customers, which are all indicative of kind of the strength of the enterprise demand where we\u2019re going. So, I would tell you that for the second half we see strong sufficient demand across all the regions, as they take care of and addressed the needs for data gravity and hybrid IT architectures, all of which has been driven by enterprise customers across all the regions. We mentioned the strength in each of the regions both AP and EMEA, as well as North America. So we\u2019re seeing that kind of flow-through. And looking at our funnel, we see strength across all those regions multiple industries and verticals, financial services to cloud and others. So, pretty excited about where we are and confident in demand from the enterprise side and I feel like that\u2019s going to continue. I don\u2019t know if, Andy, want to talk to the hyperscale part of it.\nAndy Power: Yeah. I\u2019ll just add on real quick on the larger hyperscale customers, strong Americas quarter, which is really largely, we did have a top five CSP land with us in Sao Paulo, but the lion\u2019s share was Hillsboro in Toronto. So, some great wins from hyperscalers in that market. Top five hyperscale landed both in Paris and Frankfurt, grew with us in Paris and Frankfurt and then over in APAC as mentioned in prepared remarks at the leading Japanese social media platform landed with us in Tokyo in addition to a top five CSP. I think we\u2019ve now set as the anchor to Tokyo -- our Tokyo campus on the prior call. So, I think, dramatically two things are playing out here. One, the hard work in terms of creating this global platform for these hyperscalers across approaching 50 metropolitan areas on six continents and really trying to be their trusted partner of choice around the globe is certainly benefiting our leasing or signing activity. And I would also say, we\u2019re making some great inroads to whether you call it next here or next-gen hyperscalers. We made -- I think couple of quarters ago, we had a hyperscale win with a Singaporean-based technology company. I mentioned the Japanese social media company. We mentioned Korean company NAVER. So, definitely penetrating a broader cast of customers than just top five CSPs that we have done.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. Just a couple of questions. First, if you look at the bookings trajectory and just some of the commentary we just heard, as well as just the backlog position. Should 2022 to be a better year for organic revenue growth and core FFO per share growth relative to 2021. And then, secondly, on a separate topic, just curious as you have a range of assets in your portfolio, some very young, some older, what are you seeing in terms of the maintenance capital and the pricing on facilities that are a bit more tenured relative to maybe similar facilities that are a bit newer in vintage? Thanks.\nBill Stein: Sure. Michael, why don\u2019t I try to tackle those in reverse order? So in terms of maintenance capital, obviously, the older facility, the more you propose end of life on various components. But that\u2019s no different than any piece of infrastructure or real estate. So, we\u2019re placing the roof, placing a chiller, you kind of get to these 20-year, 30-year end of life and one by one. Now, the good thing is, we\u2019ve built this portfolio over many years and essentially keep adding newer product to the mix at the same time. So, we\u2019ve been able to keep our -- recurring CapEx at a pretty modest hit to our AFFO. We actually dialed it back slightly just this for the year our guidance table. So, I wouldn\u2019t say any material upticks and we do a lot of maintenance throughout the year in terms of fixed repair, preventative and to ensure that there is no looming infrastructure headaches call on the horizon. From a pricing standpoint, obviously, there is a smaller nuance, whether it\u2019s PV efficiencies or power densities, which we certainly are innovating and bring to bear a new technologies in terms of legacy facilities. But net-net, the biggest drivers supply and demand in the market, a data center that becomes available for us in Santa Clara or Singapore or Frankfurt or markets that are compelling demand outpacing supply, customers are creating the availability and not looking for the birth date. So, I think that\u2019s more of a driver of the pricing activity. From your first question, I mean, on call it, 2022, I mean, we\u2019re only called halftime here, so not ready to rollout season two or wherever. But I would say, a couple of things that set us up for accelerated growth overall. One, I just talk a little bit to the cash mark-to-market position and it\u2019s been improving this year relative last year and see horizon where it could continue to prove. Two, this year, we took significant -- relative to our certainly -- actually we took back significant amount of capacity that we\u2019re chopping wood on releasing. So that we\u2019re having downtime from that baking capacity in our numbers this year, you can see that our occupancy as well. And you\u2019re going to see that kind of come online as we refill that and have a greater contribution to revenue in 2022 than it does in 2021. So, I think those elements and the fact that I think we\u2019ve now put up I should count this, but I think it\u2019s close to eight pretty darn good quarter of consecutive leasing, right? You obviously have to adjust to our pre-Interaction days relative to our denominator, but the leasing has been pretty darn consistent for some quarters now. So, I think, all those things paint the picture, as well as a pretty attractive development pipeline, which will obviously create as contribution to 2022 to 2021.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Great to see the enterprise coming back this quarter. Do you think we\u2019re pretty much back to normal now in terms of your operations? I know there\u2019s been COVID and picking up again in certain regions. Any comments around supply chain inflationary impacts and how that might be affecting you?\nBill Stein: Let me try to give up that question, because I think there is a couple of great points in here. Maybe, Corey, you want to pick up on enterprise demand? I was really pleased on that front of -- north of $90 million in EMEA, zero to 1 megawatt close 30% of our bookings, before I could speak to that and then maybe Chris and I can handle inflation impacts on our customers and our supply chain.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks.\nCorey Dyer: Yeah. Thanks. I mean I went through it a little bit with some of the kind of I\u2019ll say proxy items for enterprise success and the fact that we\u2019ve got a strong pipeline. And I call it a strong well-qualified pipeline with quality as well. So really feel good about where the enterprise is and the follow-on. All of the acceleration in the hybrid IT and the move to, I\u2019ll call it, work-from-home, I think, it\u2019s just accelerated the enterprise demand and how we\u2019re set up with our channel initiatives and what we\u2019re doing there are just going to help us continue to build on that. So, rather than repeat what I -- I think I answered with Mike earlier, I would just tell you that the enterprise demand is strong and I think we\u2019re in a good place going forward. It\u2019s been accelerated a little bit by the pandemic in the last couple of years. But in a good place going forward.\nBill Stein: Yeah. No. Thanks, Corey, and I appreciate the question, Simon. I think from a supply chain and what we\u2019ve seen in the industry, we haven\u2019t seen any material impacts or delays at this point in time. We work extensively with our customers to understand their needs and the requirements for the infrastructure in their deployments and so we align their orders to manufacturing dates. There has been some delays, but most of the time we can signal that right in the beginning of the sales cycle to ensure that they can order them and not miss any kind of delivery dates from that perspective. But again it\u2019s something we constantly watch with the different types of manufacturers out there. And I think, Andy, referenced this earlier, our VMI program with the infrastructure that we leverage and delivering our own services. We\u2019re way ahead of that and I think we\u2019ve really differentiate ourselves with the weight in the market that we can execute I think beyond most of the other companies out there. So, it\u2019s something that we watch closely, but no material impacts to-date.\nOperator: The next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nErik Rasmussen: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. So, Q2 leasing was somewhat steady in the quarter. I know you called out U.S. and hyperscale came back, and then I think the strength on the less than 1-megawatt category. But were there any limitations with overall capacity in certain markets or is there anything else to sort of call out that could have put a damper on or kept a lid on sort of your leasing in the quarter?\nBill Stein: I mean, in any given mark -- quarter, there is always certain markets that I call it tighter on the inventory standpoint. I mean we spoke about that how we went into that Ashburn, luckily, it was a good time for us to run into that in Ashburn because the market has softened. What comes to mind right now, Erik, are a few markets that are certainly a little bit on the tighter side. We have -- I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done a much activity in Santa Clara for several quarters now, because that market has been so tight and we are waiting for a new capacity to come online. In Atlanta where we\u2019re really solely focused on colo connectivity of 56 Marietta, which is both highly connected data center in Southeast is 100% full. We\u2019re waiting for an annex building essentially to bring on the call it several megawatts of colo capacity. Outside the states, Frankfurt, has been a bit of a Tetris game in terms of fitting the customers in, in certain markets. And then Singapore, that\u2019s a market where I don\u2019t think we\u2019re fully sold out, but it\u2019s -- we\u2019ve raised our rates, given the supply/demand -- tremendous supply/demand imbalance. We do look at -- any turn will have in that market, where we look to reprioritize for enterprise colocation and connectivity. Those are the ones the main we want to come top of mind. But I mean, across 47 metros and developing a new capacity, at least half of them. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s one or two else that will be similar.\nErik Rasmussen: Great. And then maybe just staying with the leasing, Europe seemed to -- there was some lower leasing on the greater than 1-megawatt category. Has there been any change in sort of the hyperscale side that would suggest that things may be slowing or that we could be getting a little bit of an air pocket there or, I wouldn\u2019t say, air pocket, but just a slowing or is it more of just sort of timing in that market and just the lumpiness nature of overall hyperscale?\nBill Stein: I don\u2019t see anything close to an air pocket in Europe. So, as a reminder, Europe had a pretty phenomenal 4Q and a pretty strong 1Q. So you are coming off two quarters of pretty good leasing and what we\u2019re seeing in the back half of the year. I think that trends going in the north of megawatt territory is going to continue its broad phrase. It\u2019s certainly flat oriented where we\u2019ve talked about Paris and Frankfurt is to extend our markets, but we\u2019re also seeing some great demand outside the flat markets and we now have a European platform that\u2019s across 10, maybe 12 European countries. So we\u2019re servicing the hyperscalers and some larger enterprise requirements in many of them. But I think -- the thing -- what -- I hate, Europe didn\u2019t have a great, what -- north of megawatt quarter because had a really fantastic less than megawatt quarter over $19 million and had numerous markets through major contribution in that less than megawatt interconnection category. So net-net, still really pleased with Europe\nOperator: The last question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you very much. On Singapore, what goes up comes down. It\u2019s been a really nice boost this year with kind of their, where they restricted the supply. But at some point, is that -- at some point, it probably resolves itself, what kind of terms are you getting there with the higher prices, signing leases, are customer just taking shorter duration terms given the price hikes. And are we looking at a -- some of this pulling back a little bit in 12 months or 24 months or do you think this is going to be a longer term situation there?\nBill Stein: Yeah. One, I would say, the customers are not seeking shorter contract durations, because we price those at higher rates. And you saw the activity, the Singapore rates are clearly shown through our APAC rates, which you can see our up again quarter-over-quarter. I don\u2019t -- Singapore is one part of the world that I have a high degree of confidence. What goes up may not come back down. I mean, one, it\u2019s an island state. It is incredibly government-controlled. Everyone\u2019s operating under long-term ground leases with the government and they take a very thoughtful and measured approach to supply chain overall, who gets land, who gets to bring data center capacity online and they\u2019re really trying to curate it, so they have the right providers and do so in a more environmentally friendly way. That\u2019s the genesis of this, right? So that\u2019s a market I do not see, in addition to the fact it\u2019s an island. So, you quick -- more quickly rather the natural resources in Singapore.\nFrank Louthan: Great. All right. Thank you very much.\nBill Stein: Thanks, Frank.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call. I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nBill Stein: Thank you, Andrea. I\u2019d like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the second quarter. As outlined here on the last page of our presentation. One, we continue to enhance our product mix, with record bookings within our sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection category demonstrating the progress we\u2019ve made in offering the full product spectrum to our customers globally. We are also committed to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders and we provided additional transparency with the publication of our third Annual ESG Report. We\u2019ve also raised full year revenue and EBITDA guidance for the second quarter in a row, setting the stage for accelerating growth in cash flow. Last, but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, redeeming high coupon preferred equity and raising very attractively priced long-term fixed rate financing to support customer growth around the world. I\u2019d like to wrap up today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. I hope all of you stay healthy and safe, and enjoy the rest of your summer. We hope to see many of you in person again later this year. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bill Stein",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global connected sustainable framework. We continue to advance along these lines during the second quarter. Our business continues to globalize, and once again, we generated solid performance and strong bookings across all regions. Our full spectrum product offering continues to blossom, with record sub-1-megawatt bookings in the second quarter and regional highs in both EMEA and APAC. Together with interconnection, the sub-1-megawatt category comprise nearly half of our total bookings, demonstrating customers enthusiastic adoption of PlatformDIGITAL to help accomplish their digital transformation initiatives. I'll discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on page three. In June, we were awarded the Green Lease Leader Gold Award from the Institute for Market Transformation and the U.S. Department of Energy for the third year. We remain the only data center provider to receive this award, which recognizes Digital Realty as a leader in the real estate industry that incorporates green leasing provisions to better align our interests with our customers and drive high performance and healthy buildings. During the second quarter, we published our third Annual ESG Report, detailing our 2020 sustainability initiatives, including the utilization of renewable energy for 100% of our energy needs across our entire portfolio in Europe, as well as our U.S. colocation portfolio, and reaching 50% of our global needs. We also reported progress towards our science-based target, ensuring a deep focus on our renewable energy, energy efficiency and supply chain sustainability initiatives. Our ESG Report highlights many of our ongoing initiatives including our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, along with our community involvement. Digital Realty is committed to being an active member of and giving back to the communities where we operate globally. We encourage and celebrate community involvement and employee engagement activities through our Do Better Together initiative. We also recently underscored our commitment to transparency and accountability on our diversity, equity and inclusion journey with the publication of our EEO-1 report. Events over the past year and a half have demonstrated that now more than ever ESG belongs at the forefront of our business. I'm proud of our leadership in this area as we advance our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities we serve around the world. Let's turn to our investment activity on page four. We are continuing to invest in our global platform, with 39 projects underway around the world as of June 30th, totaling nearly 300 megawatts of incremental capacity, most of which is scheduled for delivery over the next 12 months. We're investing most heavily in EMEA, with 19 projects totaling over 150 megawatts of capacity under construction. Most of this capacity is highly connected, including projects in Frankfurt, Marce\u0301, Paris, and Zurich. Demand remains strong across these metros and each continues to attract service providers, as well as enterprise customers from around the world, many of which contributed to a truly stand up performance by the region during the second quarter in the up to 1-megawatt category. In North America, over half of our capacity under construction is concentrated in two hot markets, Portland and Toronto that can sometimes be overlooked in favor of more traditional North American data center metros. We've had tremendous recent success in these two metros. We have 30-megawatts under construction in Portland or more specifically Hillsborough that are now fully pre-leased. While our Toronto connected campus continues to gain momentum as the premier Canadian hub for global cloud service providers and enterprise customers. Finally, in Asia-Pacific, we are accelerating our organic growth in this underserved region. We opened our third data center in Singapore, a 50-megawatt facility that received permitting prior to the moratorium on new data center construction. Demand for this scarce capacity is robust and we have another 18 megawatts largely pre sold and scheduled to open this quarter. Also coming soon in this region, are a pair of MC Digital Realty data centers in Japan. With the world's eyes currently on Tokyo for the Olympics, we are opening a new Tokyo facility that's poised to win the gold medal. We're also opening another data center in Osaka this quarter, along with our first data center and the first carrier-neutral offering in Seoul, Korea during the fourth quarter. We are very excited about the opportunity in Seoul and earlier this morning, we announced that we've acquired another land parcel to expand our connected campus, enabling us to accommodate the hyperscale demand that has been clamoring for capacity and our first highly connected facility. Finally, earlier this month, we announced our intention to enter India in partnership with Brookfield Infrastructure, given the success of our existing partnership on the Ascenty platform in Latin America, the complementary skills and expertise that we both bring to this partnership, and with the significant growth opportunity available in India, we are excited to expand our footprint in this robust and dynamic market. Let's turn to the macro environment on page five. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. Our leadership position provides us with a unique advantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on PlatformDIGITAL. The first of these trends is the growing importance of data gravity for Global 2000 Enterprises. Last year, we introduced the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool, which forecast the rolling intensity of enterprise data creation lifecycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure between key global markets. Earlier this year, we took the next step and published an industry manifesto enabling connected data communities to guide cross industry collaboration, tackle data gravity head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity for all companies. Earlier this week, we announced a collaboration with Zayo to further interconnection business through the creation of an open fabric of fabrics. With data sets exploding and data gravity challenges expanding, this initiative will enable multinational enterprises to connect these data oceans through fabric and orchestration. Third-party research continues to support data gravity's growing importance. Market intelligence firm Gartner recently conducted its sixth annual survey of Chief Data officers and less than 35% of these executives reported their business have achieved their data sharing objectives, including data exchange with external data sources that drive revenue generating business outcomes. Issues often arise due to multiple data hosting and processing meeting places, together with the need for appropriate security controls and the inability to overcome latency challenges with direct private interconnection between many counterparties. PlatformDIGITAL was designed to solve these problems. Digital transformation is compounding as enterprise data and connectivity problem. Recent research indicates that enterprise workflows utilize an average of 400 unique data sources by exchanging data with 27 external cloud products, Digital Realty's enterprise and service provider customers are turning to PlatformDIGITAL to overcome these issues by deploying their own data hubs and using interconnection to securely exchange data in and across multiple metros. Our leadership position is resonating with industry experts and influencers. For the second consecutive year, Digital Realty was named a global leader by IDC MarketScape for Data Center Colocation and Interconnection Services, further acknowledgement of our consistently improving customer capabilities. This recognition reflects our execution against the PlatformDIGITAL roadmap, providing unique differentiated value for customers with our fit-for-purpose, full spectrum, global capabilities. Earlier this month, Cloudscene again ranked Digital Realty as the strongest provider of Data Center Ecosystems in EMEA for the second consecutive year. Digital Realty was ranked second in both North America, as well as Latin America, and jumped up three spots to number seven in Asia. Also in July, Kagame [ph] published their analysis of edge infrastructure capabilities. Digital Realty ranked as an industry leader on multiple criteria across three broad categories. Our capabilities were ranked highest in vendor positioning and evaluation metrics comparison and second among the key criteria comparison. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform to meeting customer's needs, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold and store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Sure. Jon, happy to provide a refresh. First of all, we don't comment on M&A speculation, particularly as it relates to specific opportunities in the marketplace. But to refresh everyone's memory, we try to do only strategic deals. And by that, I mean, we're looking for investments that enhance either our geographic footprint or our product offering, thinking about specific deals. When you look back on Interxion, I think, we were fortunate with there we were able to do both. We were able to enhance our geographic penetration and add significantly to the colocation mix in Europe. We -- as it relates to --and the CyrusOne situation, which I think is what you probably were alluding to. We think that's a good platform. We have all this respect in the world for both Bruce Duncan and Steve and Dave Ferdman. But its gives us more of what we already have. And so I just don't think that's something that would be of interest to us. I can say that kind of ties to both the questions. Coincidentally, Singapore REITs have been the buyers of our two biggest portfolio sales. They've not been the only buyers. We've also done other one-off assets sales to other private buyers that were non-core. As relates to any vehicle that we would do like that, we would only think about that in the core contacts, if we're going to extend our brand and sponsorship to it. So I think -- I can't comment on what that specific rumor was kind of pointing to, but it kind of is interwoven with both concepts a little bit. Yeah. Jordan, I guess, when I think about -- so what we're trying to accomplish here and certainly in recent history, I mean, you saw the press release today, right, where we bought a piece of land in Seoul Korea and we already own a carrier-neutral data center in downtown Seoul, and now we're going to build a campus out in the suburbs. And what we're trying to do is replicated and so what we've created in other markets in the world -- and around the world to the connected campus with a carrier-neutral dense network that you can tether the campus back into. And I think that when you look around the world today, they're just aren't that many platforms. I mean, there is not an Interxion in Asia. And I think that would you going to more likely see from us is what you're seeing in Seoul, we are in fact pursuing similar models in other parts of Asia and in other parts of the world where we're going into new markets and planting the flag with both network dense facilities and campuses. So just to repeat what our criteria is, yes, it has to be strategically important to us in terms of either geography or product additive to both, it needs to be, we'd like it to be accretive to our near-term earnings idea and certainly accretive to growth, which is what Interxion was and Ascenty. And importantly prudently financed, so a capitalization... ... that is consistent with how we finance the rest of the business here at Digital. And anything you want to add or? All right. You did. And we -- we're not the levered up in other words to make... Yes. But to put a finer point on it, we're not going to lever up these assets to make the number works -- numbers work. I'm going to hand that one over to Greg. Hey. Thanks, Sami. Let me tackle that. So, like-for-like megawatt -- north of a megawatt quarter-over-quarter certainly saw an improvement from down just close to 11% on the prior quarters, 30-ish megs, the 23.5 megs came -- renew this quarter, came through this quarter, basically flat, negative 90 bps. Overall also improvement basically at 0.1% positive and over 2% positive GAAP. So, definitely move in the right direction. At the same time, I wouldn't call it be standing on the aircraft carrier with a victory flag just yet. We're still working through some still certain contracts that are above market. Hence we maintained, I will call it, language around our full year guidance of slightly negative. I did -- since parsing through both categories, in the -- in that category literally 82% of the megawatts that renewed were positive. So close to 2% positive. So really was like one or two negative that drug down the category to be flat. And in the over-to-up to that is greater than [Audio Gap] percent positive cash mark-to-markets in terms of the megawatts renewed. So, I would call, it's still episodic, moving in a better direction and that's a thematic things that I don't think this one quarter was a massive inflection point. We did gradually getting to better territory this year versus last year. And also feel that same trend kind of continuing based on the mix we see in the future. Sami, can you remind me your second question though? I don't think, I won't kind of go through my victories piece here. I don't think we're fully out of the woods, but where the trend is moving in our direction and we benefit from an incredibly diverse platform and as you look at our expirations going into this year, rest of this year or 2022 and beyond. The mix just is improving, right? The bars have gotten shorter. The concentration in the greater than megawatt is become more international, places where we've had greater pricing power. So, not fully in the clear, but I feel like we're inching our way into better territory every day. So, two data points. One, we are increasing the guidance, net of the $0.12, right? So the $0.12 is a non-cash deferred tax hit. Sensibly, we revaluing a liability that due to the U.K. changing its corporate tax rates by 600 basis points that $35 million or $0.12 flows through one-time and it's non-cash, does not hit AFFO, which you can see that I think the lowest payout ratio we've had in five quarters now. So, by the fact that we've increased the guidance notwithstanding that $0.12, it's essentially would have been a raise. And if you backed out the $0.12 to the midpoint of our new guidance you're close to, what would be 6% year-over-year growth on the core FFO. The reason it doesn't all the beat in this quarter to heart of your question like it doesn't all flow-through some of the beat which is OpEx timing, so timing relative to some of the OpEx spend which got pushed out from 2Q into back half of the year. Correct. Correct. I would call COVID-related... ... catch up a little bit. I think, Corey, why don't you pick us up there? Sure. Michael, why don't I try to tackle those in reverse order? So in terms of maintenance capital, obviously, the older facility, the more you propose end of life on various components. But that's no different than any piece of infrastructure or real estate. So, we're placing the roof, placing a chiller, you kind of get to these 20-year, 30-year end of life and one by one. Now, the good thing is, we've built this portfolio over many years and essentially keep adding newer product to the mix at the same time. So, we've been able to keep our -- recurring CapEx at a pretty modest hit to our AFFO. We actually dialed it back slightly just this for the year our guidance table. So, I wouldn't say any material upticks and we do a lot of maintenance throughout the year in terms of fixed repair, preventative and to ensure that there is no looming infrastructure headaches call on the horizon. From a pricing standpoint, obviously, there is a smaller nuance, whether it's PV efficiencies or power densities, which we certainly are innovating and bring to bear a new technologies in terms of legacy facilities. But net-net, the biggest drivers supply and demand in the market, a data center that becomes available for us in Santa Clara or Singapore or Frankfurt or markets that are compelling demand outpacing supply, customers are creating the availability and not looking for the birth date. So, I think that's more of a driver of the pricing activity. From your first question, I mean, on call it, 2022, I mean, we're only called halftime here, so not ready to rollout season two or wherever. But I would say, a couple of things that set us up for accelerated growth overall. One, I just talk a little bit to the cash mark-to-market position and it's been improving this year relative last year and see horizon where it could continue to prove. Two, this year, we took significant -- relative to our certainly -- actually we took back significant amount of capacity that we're chopping wood on releasing. So that we're having downtime from that baking capacity in our numbers this year, you can see that our occupancy as well. And you're going to see that kind of come online as we refill that and have a greater contribution to revenue in 2022 than it does in 2021. So, I think those elements and the fact that I think we've now put up I should count this, but I think it's close to eight pretty darn good quarter of consecutive leasing, right? You obviously have to adjust to our pre-Interaction days relative to our denominator, but the leasing has been pretty darn consistent for some quarters now. So, I think, all those things paint the picture, as well as a pretty attractive development pipeline, which will obviously create as contribution to 2022 to 2021. Let me try to give up that question, because I think there is a couple of great points in here. Maybe, Corey, you want to pick up on enterprise demand? I was really pleased on that front of -- north of $90 million in EMEA, zero to 1 megawatt close 30% of our bookings, before I could speak to that and then maybe Chris and I can handle inflation impacts on our customers and our supply chain. Yeah. No. Thanks, Corey, and I appreciate the question, Simon. I think from a supply chain and what we've seen in the industry, we haven't seen any material impacts or delays at this point in time. We work extensively with our customers to understand their needs and the requirements for the infrastructure in their deployments and so we align their orders to manufacturing dates. There has been some delays, but most of the time we can signal that right in the beginning of the sales cycle to ensure that they can order them and not miss any kind of delivery dates from that perspective. But again it's something we constantly watch with the different types of manufacturers out there. And I think, Andy, referenced this earlier, our VMI program with the infrastructure that we leverage and delivering our own services. We're way ahead of that and I think we've really differentiate ourselves with the weight in the market that we can execute I think beyond most of the other companies out there. So, it's something that we watch closely, but no material impacts to-date. I mean, in any given mark -- quarter, there is always certain markets that I call it tighter on the inventory standpoint. I mean we spoke about that how we went into that Ashburn, luckily, it was a good time for us to run into that in Ashburn because the market has softened. What comes to mind right now, Erik, are a few markets that are certainly a little bit on the tighter side. We have -- I don't think we've done a much activity in Santa Clara for several quarters now, because that market has been so tight and we are waiting for a new capacity to come online. In Atlanta where we're really solely focused on colo connectivity of 56 Marietta, which is both highly connected data center in Southeast is 100% full. We're waiting for an annex building essentially to bring on the call it several megawatts of colo capacity. Outside the states, Frankfurt, has been a bit of a Tetris game in terms of fitting the customers in, in certain markets. And then Singapore, that's a market where I don't think we're fully sold out, but it's -- we've raised our rates, given the supply/demand -- tremendous supply/demand imbalance. We do look at -- any turn will have in that market, where we look to reprioritize for enterprise colocation and connectivity. Those are the ones the main we want to come top of mind. But I mean, across 47 metros and developing a new capacity, at least half of them. I'm sure there's one or two else that will be similar. I don't see anything close to an air pocket in Europe. So, as a reminder, Europe had a pretty phenomenal 4Q and a pretty strong 1Q. So you are coming off two quarters of pretty good leasing and what we're seeing in the back half of the year. I think that trends going in the north of megawatt territory is going to continue its broad phrase. It's certainly flat oriented where we've talked about Paris and Frankfurt is to extend our markets, but we're also seeing some great demand outside the flat markets and we now have a European platform that's across 10, maybe 12 European countries. So we're servicing the hyperscalers and some larger enterprise requirements in many of them. But I think -- the thing -- what -- I hate, Europe didn't have a great, what -- north of megawatt quarter because had a really fantastic less than megawatt quarter over $19 million and had numerous markets through major contribution in that less than megawatt interconnection category. So net-net, still really pleased with Europe Yeah. One, I would say, the customers are not seeking shorter contract durations, because we price those at higher rates. And you saw the activity, the Singapore rates are clearly shown through our APAC rates, which you can see our up again quarter-over-quarter. I don't -- Singapore is one part of the world that I have a high degree of confidence. What goes up may not come back down. I mean, one, it's an island state. It is incredibly government-controlled. Everyone's operating under long-term ground leases with the government and they take a very thoughtful and measured approach to supply chain overall, who gets land, who gets to bring data center capacity online and they're really trying to curate it, so they have the right providers and do so in a more environmentally friendly way. That's the genesis of this, right? So that's a market I do not see, in addition to the fact it's an island. So, you quick -- more quickly rather the natural resources in Singapore. Thanks, Frank. Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the second quarter. As outlined here on the last page of our presentation. One, we continue to enhance our product mix, with record bookings within our sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection category demonstrating the progress we've made in offering the full product spectrum to our customers globally. We are also committed to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders and we provided additional transparency with the publication of our third Annual ESG Report. We've also raised full year revenue and EBITDA guidance for the second quarter in a row, setting the stage for accelerating growth in cash flow. Last, but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, redeeming high coupon preferred equity and raising very attractively priced long-term fixed rate financing to support customer growth around the world. I'd like to wrap up today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. I hope all of you stay healthy and safe, and enjoy the rest of your summer. We hope to see many of you in person again later this year. Thank you."

            "name": "Andy Power",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on page seven. We signed total bookings of $113 million in the second quarter, including a $13 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise oriented deals of 1-megawatt or less reached an all time high of 41 million, demonstrating our consistent momentum and the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand. The weighted average lease term was over eight years. We landed 109 new logos during the second quarter with a strong showings across all regions. Again, demonstrating the power of a global platform. The geographic and product mix of our new activity was quite healthy, with APAC and EMEA each contributing approximately 20%, the Americas representing nearly 50% and interconnection responsible for a little over 10%. The megawatt or less plus interconnection category accounted for almost half our total bookings, with particular strength in the cloud, content and financial services verticals. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world. We landed a top five cloud service provider to anchor our new Tokyo campus. Close on the heels of this magnetic customer deployment, Japan's most popular social media application selected PlatformDIGITAL on the same campus. NAVER, the leading Korea based cloud provider serving the greater APAC region selected our new carrier-neutral facility in Singapore to support data intensive workloads for their high performance computing and I -- AI intensive technology based platform. A European broadcaster is leveraging PlatformDIGITAL in Vienna and Frankfurt to rewire their network in favor of data intensive interconnection with benefits in performance, scalability and cost savings. A Global 2000 Enterprise Data Platform is adopting PlatformDIGITAL in Amsterdam, Dublin and Frankfurt to orchestrate workloads across hundreds of ecosystem applications, delivering improved performance, security, cost savings and simplicity. In London, PlatformDIGITAL is supporting a top three global money center banks fortification of their business continuity capabilities, without compromising their data intensive interconnection requirements On the continent, our connectivity and operational capabilities are helping two independent FinTech customers, improve performance, enhanced -- and enhanced access to their connected data communities. Finally, in North America, a life sciences digital marketing firm chose PlatformDIGITAL to improve their network architecture enable future growth. Turning to our backlog on page nine. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced ticked down from $307 million to $303 million as commencement slightly eclipsed space and power leases signed during the quarter. The live between signings and commencement was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at just over seven months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 10. We signed $178 million of renewals during the second quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the second quarter was just under three years. Again, reflecting a greater mix of enterprise deals smaller than 1-megawatt. We retained 77% of expiring leases, while cash releasing spreads on renewals were slightly positive, also reflective of the greater mix of sub-1-megawatt renewals in the total. In terms of second quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy ticked down by 60 basis points, as we brought additional capacity online across six metros during the quarter. Same capital cash NOI growth was negative 1.5% in the second quarter, largely driven by the churn in Ashburn at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, the Western building in Seattle, the Interxion platform in EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece and Altus IT in Croatia, are not yet included in the same store pool. So these same capital comparisons are less representative of our underlying business today than usual. Let's turn to our economic risk mitigation strategies on page 11. The U.S. dollar fluctuated during the second quarter, but remained below the prior year average providing a bit of an FX tailwind. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to acts as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing, given our strategy and matching the duration of our long lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt and 100 basis point move in benchmark rates were roughly is 75-basis-point impact on full year FFO per share. In terms of earnings growth, second quarter core FFO per share was flat year-over-year, but down 8% from last quarter, driven by a $0.12 non-cash deferred tax charge related to the higher corporate tax rate in the U.K., which came into effect during the second quarter. Excluding the tax charge, which was not previously contemplated in our guidance, we outperformed our internal forecast due to a beat on a topline with a slight assist from FX tailwinds, as well as operating expense savings, partially due to lower property level spending in the COVID-19 environment. For the second time this year, we are raising our full year outlook for total revenue and adjusted EBITDA to reflect the underlying momentum in our business. The deferred tax charge does run through a core FFO per share, but as you can see from the press release, we are lowering the midpoint by just $0.05, which all else equal would imply $0.07 raise excluding the deferred tax charge. Since it is non-cash, the deferred tax charge does not hit AFFO. Most of the drivers of our guidance table are unchanged. But I would like to point out that we are lowering our expected recurrent CapEx spend for the remainder of the year, setting the stage for accelerated growth in cash flow. As you can see from the bridge chart on page 12, we expect our bottomline result to improve sequentially over the balance of the year, as the deferred tax charge comes out of the quarterly run rate and the momentum in our underlying business continues to accelerate. We do still expect to see some normalization in our cost structure, with an increase in property level operating expenses that have been deferred due to COVID along with an uptick in G&A expense, as we return to the office and resume a more normal travel schedule, so your models should reflect these higher costs. Last but certainly not least, let's turn the balance sheet on page 13. As you may recall, we closed on the sale of a portfolio of non-core assets in Europe for $680 million late in the first quarter, which impacted second quarter adjusted EBITDA to the tune of approximately $10 million. As a result, net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was slightly elevated 6 times as the end of the second quarter, but is expected to come back down in line with our long-term range over the course of the year, through a combination of proceeds from asset sales and growth in cash flows as signed leases commence. Fixed charge coverage ticked down slightly, also reflecting the near-term impact from asset sales, but remains well above our target and closer to all time high at 5.4 times, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management. We continue to execute our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long lived assets. In mid-May, we redeemed 200 million of preferred stock at 0.625%, which brought total preferred equity redemptions over the prior 12 months to $700 million and a weighted average coupon of just over 6.25 effectively lowering leverage by 0.3 terms. In mid-June, we issued 0.5 million shares under our ATM program raising approximately $77 million. In early July, we raised another $26 million with the sale of the balance of our Megaport stock. We also took our first trip to the Swiss bond market in early July, raising approximately $595 million in a dual tranche offering of Swiss green bonds with a weighted average maturity of a little over six and a half years and a weighted average coupon of approximately 0.37%. This successful execution against our financial strategy reflects the strength of a global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public, as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is nearly six and a half years, and our weighted average coupon is down to 2.2%. Over 70% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and serving as a natural FX hedge for our investment outside the U.S. 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see on the left side of page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we'd be pleased to take your question. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session. Thanks, Jon. So I think there's two concepts kind of interlinked in your question. So non-core capital recycling, we've been doing a fair bit of that, most recently executed on portfolio in EMEA close to $700 million. That was not core or strategically digital. And it's kind of similar to a transaction we did back in, I think, 2019. So call it, folks in our portfolio, we see the most robust and diverse customer growth. So that's one leg of the stool that you can see will continue on, we activated this year, again, in terms of funding our business plan by recycling that capital into more strategic projects. We've also done what's I will call it private capital partnerships. So similarly with that same transaction back in 2019 with Mapletree, we raised 80% stake and $1 billion of core assets, assets that we never really want to part with and we maintain operational control of as a minority partner. And so, I think, you'll see us continue to do both. But there's a big difference in our minds. Non-core things that we're willing to call it 100% and we wish the new owners well, and core really keeping those assets as part of our collective platform and just trying to recycle capital of the slower growth assets. Both of which I think at the end of the day, hopefully, accelerates our growth and allows us to redeploy that capital into higher return opportunities. I got two... Yes. I got two out of three right. It was very to higher [inaudible] rate... I think the second or third part of your question was, can you drive pricing power to market share, which I think episodically there is opportunities to do that. I think if you look back to our DuPont Fabros transaction that was a market share moving transaction where we up-tiered our relationships with many customers to kind of to control near-term supply. And I think that concept maybe works in more overall supply-constrained markets predominantly outside the U.S. or even like a Santa Clara for that example. I do not -- I'm not confident. I think your line of thinking would be other domestically-focused larger footprint players is that, does that M&A create better pricing power and today's backdrop, I don't see that same events playing out, but again life such in America. Yes. I think there's definitely potential for fewer out cash mark-to-markets to be a positive tailwind here. I mean, we -- if you look at our -- the diversity of our product here we are -- it's a very sticky product. We're typically doing renewals in many markets better than new rates on new deals given the propensity inertia for our customer to stay. Our interconnection capabilities kind of further that stickiness, these markets where we're even bringing on new capacity are running up to physical barriers, whether supply of power, access to land, connectivity, government moratoriums are popping up in certain countries. And then the whole concept inflation and its impact to newer incumbents and overall cost structures. All those things point to a world of higher pricing power in this aspect and certainly more so for Digital relative to a new entrance. Yeah. I'll just add on real quick on the larger hyperscale customers, strong Americas quarter, which is really largely, we did have a top five CSP land with us in Sao Paulo, but the lion's share was Hillsboro in Toronto. So, some great wins from hyperscalers in that market. Top five hyperscale landed both in Paris and Frankfurt, grew with us in Paris and Frankfurt and then over in APAC as mentioned in prepared remarks at the leading Japanese social media platform landed with us in Tokyo in addition to a top five CSP. I think we've now set as the anchor to Tokyo -- our Tokyo campus on the prior call. So, I think, dramatically two things are playing out here. One, the hard work in terms of creating this global platform for these hyperscalers across approaching 50 metropolitan areas on six continents and really trying to be their trusted partner of choice around the globe is certainly benefiting our leasing or signing activity. And I would also say, we're making some great inroads to whether you call it next here or next-gen hyperscalers. We made -- I think couple of quarters ago, we had a hyperscale win with a Singaporean-based technology company. I mentioned the Japanese social media company. We mentioned Korean company NAVER. So, definitely penetrating a broader cast of customers than just top five CSPs that we have done."

            "content": "No. Absolutely. Appreciate it. Yeah. So it's a continuation. We've been investing in PlatformDIGITAL to make it more robust, where we have over 4,000 customers today. And as Andy alluded to earlier on Bill's comments earlier that we're adding 100 new customers every quarter. So, what we've talked about with the fabric of fabrics and the partnership that we pulled together with Zayo is that these capabilities are proven to be very successful with our enterprise customers. And I think what we're talking about here today is about expanding those capabilities and those connectivity capabilities to a broader set of customers. And so I think that's one of the core things that we're really starting to drive and it's resonating well with our customers and that a lot of enterprises are out there looking for an open platform to really achieve their goals and remove complexity out of their deployments. And so that's what the PlatformDIGITAL is and what fabric of fabrics means as we pulled together a carrier-grade partner with Zayo and there the first partner that we've executed this with and you will see other partners coming online to expand that value focused on our customers' success."

            "content": "Okay. Thanks. Hey, Jordan. Look, I think, describe the India joint venture. Jordan, it's actually a hybrid. Look, as you know, we've had a strong relationship with Brookfield. We've had a great experience with the Ascenty, but when we purchase Ascenty, we bought -- we came into that platform together and purchase an existing platform that had 14 assets. Eight of which were under construction, six of which were operational assets and a team in place. This is going to be different from that. But we are, again, going in 50-50 joint partners, joint branding and alike, which you've seen in some of our press materials. But here, we're going to be and we have some folks that are already residing in the JV, but we're actually going into India here to build a platform, and ultimately, we expect it to be like Ascenty. I mean being a standalone platform with a strong management team that drives the business. And I think when we look at India, we're not looking to go into India and just do like-for-like product. We're looking to do differentiated product and we think Brookfield as a partner here and given their presence in the tower space, and given what's happening in India in the mobile market and alike. We think we have a great opportunity to do that. And so, but the general governance and construct if you will is very similar to Ascenty, but the basic premise of going in. We're going into build a platform. We're not buying a platform. So I'd say that's how I describe it."

During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Callers will be limited to one question plus a follow-up. Due to time constraints, we will conclude promptly at the bottom of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. John, please go ahead.\nJohn Stewart: Thank you, Operator. The speakers on today\u2019s call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I\u2019d like to hit the tops of the waves on our first quarter results. First, we demonstrated our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders with efficient and socially responsible capital raises and corporate governance enhancements. We continue to enhance the value of our global platform, extending connectivity offerings globally, recycling capital and investing to fuel high quality organic growth. We delivered solid financial results with core FFO per share up 9% year-over-year and $0.09 ahead of consensus. Finally, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet, lowering our weighted average cost of debt with the redemption of high coupon debt and preferred equity, while extending our weighted average duration with the issuance of attractively priced long-term capital. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Stein: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global connected sustainable framework and our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of this framework. Our business is increasingly global, with first quarter bookings very evenly balanced across regions. We continue to align PlatformDIGITAL with our customer\u2019s digital transformation issues by expanding our unique interconnection capabilities focusing on connecting centers of data across our robust, reliable global platform. Last, but not least, we continue to advance our initiatives to deliver sustainable growth for all stakeholders. Let\u2019s turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on page three. We were recently honored to be named EPA ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year for Energy Management for the second year in a row. We were also recently honored to receive the 2020 largest financial Corporate Green Bond Award from Climate Bonds Initiative. We expect to publish our third annual ESG report during the second quarter, providing transparency on our ESG performance for 2020, as well as a comprehensive overview of our clean energy commitment, resource conservation, diversity, equity and inclusion, and other sustainable business practices. We are committed to minimize our impact on the environment, while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and the broader society. In terms of our social efforts, we recently joined leaders across 85 industries, inciting the CEO pledge on CEO action for diversity and inclusion, an initiative to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Our Board of Directors also amended our corporate governance guidelines to clarify that director candidate pools must include candidates with diversity of race, ethnicity and gender. Finally in February, our Board of Directors amended our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter to formalize oversight of our ESG programs, including sustainability, as well as diversity, equity and inclusion. We are doing our best to play a constructive, proactive role in advancing our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities we serve around the world. Let\u2019s turn to our investment activity on page four. We continue to invest in our global platform, with 44 projects underway around the world, totaling more than three 100 megawatts of incremental capacity scheduled for delivery over the next 18 months. Half of this expansion is underway in EMEA, while the balance is split roughly evenly between the Americas and APAC. In EMEA we continued our extension of the highly connected legacy Interxion campus in Frankfurt and began construction on the Neckermann expansion campus. During the first quarter, we broke ground on the first 26 megawatts on the expansion campus which are scheduled for delivery next year. Demand in Frankfurt remains strong and our campus with access to over 700 carriers and ISP continues to attract customers from around the world. In France, we were adding capacity in Marseille, as well as Paris. Demand in Marseille is largely driven by the 14 subsea cables that terminate in our facilities where we are transforming a former abandoned World War II U-boat bunker into a modern and vital communications hub for over half of the world\u2019s population. In Paris, we continue to develop Interxion Paris Digital Park, while the Dunant subsea cable that links Paris to Virginia Beach, was connected in our Paris campus during the quarter. We are also expanding our highly connected Brussels campus and breaking ground on another facility in Madrid to serve the broadening needs of service providers, as well as enterprises. In APAC, we recently announced the grand opening of our third data center in Singapore. We were particularly pleased to be recognized by Singapore\u2019s Desmond Lee, Minister of National Development, highlighting the sustainable design of our most energy efficient data center in the region. Despite some COVID related construction challenges last year, we were gratified to be able to deliver this highly connected and sustainably designed facility to meet customer needs in our tightest market. Finally, in mid-March, we closed on a sale of a portfolio of 11 assets in Europe for approximately $680 million, executing on our strategy of recycling capital from stabilized assets, reinvesting proceeds into higher growth opportunities, while prioritizing long-term value creation over near-term earnings growth. Let\u2019s turn to the demand drivers on page five. We are fortunate to be operating in a business leverage of secular demand drivers. Our leadership position provides us with a unique advantage point that enables us to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on PlatformDIGITAL. In the second half of last year, we introduced to our customers the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool that projects the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation lifecycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. In the first quarter of this year, we took the next step and published an industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities to guide cross industry collaboration for our customers, as they tackle data gravity head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity. Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of data gravity. Market intelligence from Gartner recently hosted an executive retreat and surveyed over 400 Chief Data and Analytic officers, with 83% of CEOs expecting to increase investments in digital business, with a large percentage of these firms prioritizing digital data products to drive growth. With this transition to data driven businesses, Gartner predicts that by 2024, more than 75% of companies will deployed multiple data hubs to drive mission critical data analytics, sharing and governance. We are seeing growing momentum across our enterprise and service provider customers deploying their own data hubs and analytics environments in multiple metros on PlatformDIGITAL. As I mentioned earlier, Digital Realty was recently named ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for the second consecutive year. This award reflects our sharpened focus on driving sustainable design and operations on PlatformDIGITAL, underpinned by ambitious science-based targets to significantly reduce our carbon footprint by 2030. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market leading innovation to capture the growing global data center demand opportunity from data driven businesses. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform to meeting these needs, we believe that we are well-positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold and store. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.\nAndy Power: Thank you, Bill. Let\u2019s turn to our leasing activity on page seven. We signed total bookings of $117 million in the first quarter, including a $13 million contribution from Interxion. Network and enterprise oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less total $33 million, building upon our consistent momentum and demonstrating the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL, as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand. The weighted average lease term was over seven years. We landed 100 new logos during the first quarter, with strong showing across all regions, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. The midst of our new signings was quite healthy, with APAC and EMEA, each contributing approximately 30% and the Americas accounting for the remaining 40%. In addition, nearly 40% of bookings were generated within the megawatt or less plus Interxion category, with strengthen in the e-commerce, gaming and financial services segments. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a particular highlight of the quarter was landing a leading APAC-based diversified digital economy platform in Singapore, where we were able to support this customer\u2019s needs across our full product spectrum, from colocation and connectivity to a hyperscale dedicated data hall. Elsewhere in APAC, a leading cloud service provider expanded with us simultaneously in both Melbourne and Osaka. Subsequent to quarter end, we landed a leading cloud provider to anchor our Tokyo campus in Inzai, where we\u2019ve assembled a runway of over 100 megawatts of growth capacity, as well as key magnetic connectivity solutions. In EEMEA an automotive digital technology maker deployed an artificial intelligence machine learning footprint on PlatformDIGITAL to gain access to a community of leading cloud service providers on our Frankfurt campus. In the Americas, a leading cloud provider spin it on our campuses in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. A global 2000 industrial manufacturer leveraged a partner to deploy on PlatformDIGITAL to support growing demand, enabled by our global platform and runway for growth on our Suburban Chicago campus. A global digital advertising exchange platform expanded its presence on PlatformDIGITAL to gain access to connected data communities in the Northern Virginia Metro area. Also in Ashburn, a leading video game developer selected PlatformDIGITAL to build centers of data exchange. And finally, a global IT service provider expanded a multiple metros across North America to enable new services on PlatformDIGITAL. Turning to our backlog on page nine, the current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced reach another all time high of $307 million. The step up from $269 million last quarter reflects $66 million of commencements during the first quarter, offset by roughly $104 million of combined space and power leases signed. The lag between signage and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average adjusted on eight months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 10. We signed $193 million of renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the first quarter was a little less than three years, reflecting a greater mix of enterprise deals smaller than 1 megawatt. We retained 75% of expiring leases, just a bit below our long-term average. Cash re-leasing spreads on renewals were negative 2.1%, which was in line with guidance, but weighed down by to customers who were new to existing capacity as part of the expansion of their footprint on our platform. These transactions are prime examples of what we mean when we talk about our holistic long-term approach to customer relationship management. We believe we have a distinct advantage when we\u2019re competing for new business with a customer, we -- that we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio. And whenever we can we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings, including both new business, as well as renewals. In terms of first quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy tick down to 100 basis points, driven by anticipated churn in Ashburn, as well as the sale of 11 almost fully leased facilities in Europe. Same capital cash NOI growth was negative 2.8% in the first quarter, in line with guidance and largely driven by this same Ashburn churn. As a reminder, our recently acquired Western building in Seattle, Interxion across EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece and Altus IT in Croatia, are not yet included in the same store pool. But we expect each of these acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on page 11. The U.S. dollar strengthened in the first quarter, but still remain somewhat depressed relative to the prior year average, providing a bit of an FX tailwind in the first quarter. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, 100-basis-point move in LIBOR would have less than a 50-basis-point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, first quarter core FFO per share was up 9% year-over-year and $0.09 ahead of consensus. The upside relative to our internal forecasts was driven by a beat on the topline with an assist from an FX tailwind, as well as operating expense savings, primarily due to lower property level spending in the COVID-19 environment and a later the budget of closing on the non-core European portfolio sale. A portion of the OpEx savings is likely timing related and represents more of a deferral rather than permanent savings. But substantially all of the beat flows through to the raise and we are taking core FFO per share guidance up by $0.075 at the midpoint. In terms of the quarterly run rate, we still expect the split between first half of the year and the second half of the year to be approximately 49/51. In other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on page 12, we expect to dip down by about $0.10 in the second quarter, before wrapping up fairly steadily over the rest of the year due to the mid-March closing of the non-core European portfolio sale, as well as an expected catch-up in OpEx spend previously budgeted for the first quarter. I would like to point out that although we are raising our G&A forecast by $15 million at the midpoint, our implied EBITDA margin guidance is unchanged, as the lion\u2019s share of the increase is due to geography on the income statement as we finalize mapping the Interxion cost structure and reap characterize a portion of Interxion\u2019s OpEx spend as overhead. In terms of our financing plans, we\u2019ve already made great strides this year, with a highly successful $1 billion green euro bond offering in early January at 0.625%, in addition to the proceeds from the asset sales in March. As always, we expect to remain nimble for the rest of the year and we may look to capitalize on favorable market conditions to lock in long-term fixed rate financing at attractive coupons across the currencies that support our assets to proactively manage future liabilities. Last but certainly not least, let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet on page 13. As previously mentioned, we\u2019ve closed on the sale of a portfolio of 11 assets in Europe for approximately $680 million and use the proceeds to pay down debt, bringing net debt to adjusted EBITDA back down to 5.6 times in line with our long-term target range. Fixed charge coverage reached an all time high of 5.8 times, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management. We continue to execute on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options, while minimizing the related cost and extending the durations of our liabilities to match our long lived assets. In early January, we raised $1 billion to 10.5-year green euro bonds at an all time low coupon for Digital Realty 0.625%. We also retired $350 million of 2.75% bonds due in 2023 and we\u2019ve repaid all $530 million outstanding on the term loan due in 2023. In mid-April, we announced the redemption of $200 million of preferred stock at 0.625% also bring total preferred equity redemptions over the past 12 months to $700 million and a weighted average coupon of just over 6.25, effectively lowering leverage by another 0.3 turns. This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public, as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on page 13, we extended our weighted average debt maturity up to nearly seven years or ratcheting our weighted average coupon down to 2.3%. A little over 70% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 94% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see on the left side of the page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to feel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we\u2019d be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jon Atkins with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJon Atkins: Thanks. I wanted to ask a question about, I guess, customer retention, as well as about new logo generation. As we look at your pending lease expirations out through year end 2022, any kind of update you can give us on which markets might have greatest exposure? And is there a way to characterize how much of that you will consider it to be highly likely to renew or extend their commitments? And then on the kind of on the new business that you\u2019re bringing on, if you think about your sub-megawatts or low single-digit -- megawatt colocation win, any way to characterize how much of that has a high kind of connectivity attach rate to it? And more broadly, I wondered if you could maybe just review initiatives you have underway to enhance productivity in your direct and indirect channels and manage those ongoing relationships? Thanks.\nAndy Power: Hey. Thanks, Jon. I will -- maybe I\u2019ll try to tackle some of the number of questions on the beginning and I\u2019ll turn it over to Corey to talk about our channels and productivity. So just a cut them up in a little bit order here. So I would characterize, going to your second question about how much of our less than megawatt of colocation is kind of connectivity rich, I would characterize that is a highly connectivity rich piece of our business. In terms of the numbers of our customers of the 4,000 customers that we have a digital, the lion\u2019s share of the customer count falls in that. They sit in typically some of our more highly connected destinations either dating back many years to our legacy Telx business or Interxion or Westin building or where we\u2019ve organically grown our colocation connectivity suites across North America, I think, we have five markets across Asia-Pacific and elsewhere around the globe. So you typically see fairly sticky high retention, low churn, as well as fairly substantial pricing power quarter-after-quarter and you can see that in the retention table at the back of sup. And the definition didn\u2019t change all that much when we migrated from the work colocation to a sizing definition. I think the first part of your question was called, look at the expiration schedule. I thought I heard a post year in 2022. I\u2019m not sure my crystal ball can go with that much precision out that far. I would say, dramatically, we\u2019ve been working through a few years now of more tougher sledding when it came to our expiration and that was in 2020, 2019, 2018, that was in size of the volume of the expirations, that was in the mix of expirations, in terms of kind of going back to more higher -- less pricing power locations, telco deals, concentrations of some multi-market, major customer renewals, I think we\u2019ve done a nice job chopping a fair bit of wood and the front view mirror on the expiration schedule. What certainly looks better than what we\u2019ve come through and I think you\u2019ve seen that now, in terms of how our mark-to-market has called is being progressing in back into a better fashion as we kind of work through some of the lumpier contracts and you\u2019re going to see it on the percentages of where the expirations kind of fall between the plus or minus megawatt category. So feels like we\u2019re heading in the right direction on the expiration schedule and I didn\u2019t touch -- definitely geographically just by the maturity of our business much were non-U.S. are out, call in EMEA, APAC type expirations into the future, which also call up higher barrier to entry, tough -- high pricing power markets. But I will turn to Corey to hit your -- the last part of your question.\nCorey Dyer: Yeah. Hey. Thanks, Andy, and Jon, thanks for the question. I think I kind of captured it and you correct me if I missed it. But you asked a question around channels and how we\u2019re doing there. And then a little bit about with the new logo that we\u2019re getting an increase in interconnect I think are the questions, and, Jonathan, if I missed it, then you can always clarify it later. But I will tell you that really happy with the progress we\u2019re making on channels of our, I will call it, enterprise business, non-scale business, the channel is now about a quarter of the business. So we\u2019re pretty happy with the progress there. And then your question around new logos and how much of the new logos are adding interconnection to it. We\u2019ve seen an increase in that. It really kind of just comes through when you think through PlatformDIGITAL and how we\u2019re getting many, many more multi-use cases deployment, multi-site deployment, most of those look like network connectivity, as well as in control our hub. And so we\u2019re seeing good progress across those and we\u2019re seeing, I guess, the net of it is the channels bringing up a lot more new logos and those new logos are a little bit more interconnections in and they were in the past. Hopefully that answers the question.\nJon Atkins: Yeah. I was -- just given the challenge you brought on from Interxion and then a lot of legacy Equinix people such as yourself that are on Board, just interested in any kind of machine learning, AI, predictive analytics, tools\u2026\nCorey Dyer: Oh! Okay. Yes.\nJon Atkins: \u2026are continuing. Yeah. Yeah.\nCorey Dyer: No. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. That\u2019s good question. Yeah. I\u2019m pretty familiar with that. And I\u2019ll tell you that, you referenced a few places that some of have been, so we are not going to comment on what they\u2019re doing. But I would tell you that, yes, we do use call it AI and I\u2019ll say target based data set for both our prospects, our customers. And I\u2019ll tell you that we use data and that\u2019s really what the essence of the Data Gravity Index was, it was a -- Data Gravity Index published based on data and what we see in the industry. And it really helped us identify the shift in the infrastructure placement and connectivity that\u2019s required across the full spectrum colocation. And so I feel like we\u2019re doing pretty good across both those Jonathan using AI, using data to make our decision to how we target our customers. So, pretty on top of that, oh, yeah.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJordan Sadler: Thanks. I wanted to touch base on sort of the connectivity piece of the business, looked like there were some particular strengths in your connection this quarter sequentially in particular and just kind of curious if the pacing and the growth is something that\u2019s sustainable, that you potentially got some momentum there or if there was anything in particular that drove it?\nAndy Power: Hey. Thanks, Jordan. I would say, all -- in total volume connectivity new signs was up. I think in terms of, call, lumpier concentrations, our Latin America portion of the portfolio was certainly a major contributor. In terms of the top markets for just overall the interconnection signs, in North America was some of the usual, New York Metro, Chicago, Atlanta. But also, I didn\u2019t notice we had some pretty strong connectivity growth in both our Northern Virginia campus, as well as our Franklin Park Chicago campus. So not necessarily a legacy highly connectivity dense location, but it\u2019s great to see that enterprise is landing there and growing their connectivity footprint. An answer to -- partly answer to Jon Atkins question we track our new logos on a year-over-year growth basis. We don\u2019t have this for all of our new logos, because we\u2019re kind of combining businesses over the last year, but I call the legacy digital subset that were here a year ago, there -- they grew their connectivity footprint north of 10% on a year-over-year basis, so the new logos are growing post-landing with us. So definitely pleased, and I mean, I think, it goes back to a lot of what Corey was saying about our reorientation across the Board in terms of bringing some critical puzzle pieces together in terms of our asset profile, our go-to-market strategy led by Corey, our PlatformDIGITAL bringing to the market and many other elements I think are tied together that\u2019s driving that success.\nJordan Sadler: Okay. And then maybe just honing in on Northern Virginia, you touched on it there in interconnect -- interconnectivity, but what\u2019s your availability looking like in that market and how -- what are you seeing in terms of customer demand there This year?\nAndy Power: Yeah. So, Northern Virginia, Jordan, obviously, you\u2019re aware we have pretty incredible 2020 close to 85 megawatts sold overall. We kind of ran pretty darn tight on inventory based on that success, which is not necessarily a bad thing, given that the Northern Virginia has been kind of working its way out of the woods for some time now. So we ended the year with our development pathway with 100% preleased. We are now under construction and delivering building are in terms of our new build that will come along this summer. We did close to 5 megawatts of leasing in total in that market, including the full product suite. I would say the lion\u2019s share of our focus is on the capacity we got back at the very beginning of the year. So which I mentioned we already released or pre-released on the last call. So really focusing on some of that non-retained capacity on our existing campus, but also we did landed anchor deal, a little chunkier enterprise deal and the building are coming on back -- on the back half of the year, then building on as a large shell that will call it deliver 6 megawatts suites in call it every other month type of fashion. So little tight right now, focused on where we\u2019re place -- pushing customers, but a longer, larger runaway we\u2019re building our company on the back end of the year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Funk with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Funk: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for the questions. So, first, I am wondering if your posture or your approach to rental rates and renewals has changed at all in the last 12 months, given the tightening in some of the markets.\nAndy Power: I mean, I think, we have a pretty responsive pricing dynamic holistically, Mike. So it\u2019s not just on renewals. We have a call it inventory price book for every type of capacity, for every duration of contract, for every market, for every product that is update on a recurring basis in response to what we see in terms of the supply/demand dynamics in the market. We obviously don\u2019t have certain overlays in terms of customer relationships or in the larger growing customers or newer customers that we kind of make sure we\u2019re responsive to at the same time. We\u2019re certainly not sitting by idly when a market is weaker and we need to respond to that with pricing to be more competitive. And on the other flip side of that coin we\u2019ve had experienced like in Singapore or other markets like Santa Clara or Frankfurt, where we raised rates over time and those rates are impacted our renewals and our new pricing in response to, call it, the overall supply/demand dynamic.\nMichael Funk: And then one more if I could, Andy, so on the guidance, I saw the non-core expense add back increased for 2021. I didn\u2019t hear you call that out in the prepared remarks. What was the increase in the non-core?\nAndy Power: The increase in the non-core, I believe, we got a whole list of items in our FFO reconciliation that kind of hits the non-core that includes our investment in Megaport is good stock price mark-to-market when that flows through, and that obviously, is in the core up or down to our business. I believe there\u2019s a revaluation on our debt at SMP, given it\u2019s a resilient entity and with the U.S. dollar denominated debt to match the currency of the lot lion\u2019s share of our contracts. And we also have, I think, in this particular quarter, a little bit of a benefit from our PPA settlement that we added back, because we didn\u2019t do that as recurring benefits on core FFO.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you. And maybe I could go back to Corey, can you talk about where we are on sort of return to normal in terms of the sales process in some of the regions? Are you still able to get the virtual tours and get the connections or do you think there\u2019s still more room to come back to normal here? And then any commentary on the supply chain, I think you did talk a little bit in your disclosures about, generally not seeing huge issues, but in terms of building costs or building -- you\u2019re building up inventory there? Thanks.\nCorey Dyer: Andy, you want me to take the enterprise demand question and just date of use and you can just follow on the second half?\nAndy Power: Please go ahead.\nCorey Dyer: Okay. All right. So, yeah, thanks for the question. I would tell you that we\u2019re getting closer to the state of normal, if that\u2019s what you want to call it. Some of the things are opening up. But we\u2019ve got a lot of ability around doing tours virtually, we\u2019ve found a bunch of different ways to augment the need and take our customers during the pandemic. So I feel like we\u2019re getting close to it. We\u2019re not quite there. That said, enterprise demand has been really, really good. It\u2019s been strong, broad-based success, still on our platform, Andy mentioned it earlier, but early innings with long tail left. We\u2019re looking through some of the more macro trends. Gartner\u2019s got IT spending getting at 6% growth, with about $4.1 trillion annually and only about $400 billion of that go into public cloud. So we think that enterprise demand and the point of presence and the multi-use cases, as well as multi-markets that we\u2019re going after are going to be there and we\u2019re seeing it continue to sustain. Well, I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s a complete back to normal. We haven\u2019t seen, I guess, in enterprise demand and quite frankly, we think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job adjusting through it with all the ops and FCs and SAs we have important to it [ph]. I think that answer the question, I\u2019m not sure if I did it.\nSimon Flannery: Yeah. That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nCorey Dyer: Okay, Simon. Okay.\nAndy Power: Hey. Simon, can you just repeat the second part of the question to make sure we\u2026\nSimon Flannery: Yeah. It was really around the supply chain issues and what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the COVID impacts on your ability to bring on data centers on time, on budget, and any cost issues you might be seeing or inventory issues?\nAndy Power: Okay. Great. So let me take the, call it, our digital supply chain, I will let Chris touch on the customer supply chain, because I know that\u2019s been a question out there as well. So, I think, really hats off and kudos to our operational design, construction team and supply chain team for always keeping ahead of this consistently. Obviously, we do all have the benefit of our scale, our global nature, our deep operational expertise. But we\u2019ve not in recent quarters had any, call it, disruption to critical equipment, delays, cost impact and so the team really -- has done a really incredible job of navigating through that. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the case for all providers in the data center world, especially smaller stature, but they\u2019ve not been disruption today. And I\u2019d say we\u2019ve -- what we\u2019ve looked at our, call it, 300 megawatts of capacity under development is pretty darn insulated to these any potential inflation shocks and we\u2019re also keeping a keen eye on that. But, Chris, why don\u2019t you hit on the chip piece as well.\nChris Sharp: No. Absolutely not. I echo your sentiment, Andy, the vendor management program that we have in place today, I think, is something that has allowed us to overcome some of the shortcomings of some of the infrastructure within the facilities like breakers, optical infrastructure, things like that. But that\u2019s something that operating on a global basis has been a big benefit digital going forward. But we also stay very close to our customers and really watching if they\u2019re having trouble procuring infrastructure to deploy their architectures into our facility. We haven\u2019t seen a material impact on that as well. I know there\u2019s been a lot of concern around chip shortages and things like that, but again, just to reiterate, not all chips are the same and there\u2019s a lot of variability out there and so have not seen any kind of material impact from customers being able to deploy into the facility. And quite frankly, some of our larger hyperscale customers, they build the entire stack themselves, so they have strict control over their supply chain and so they\u2019ve also not experienced any slowdown in being able to deploy the massive amount of infrastructure required for their deployments as well.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks. Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Yes. Good evening. So when I look at the updated guidance, it seems like the only major change there really is the FX assumption around the pound. So is it fair to assume guidance is going up simply because of changes in FX assumptions or is there something also kind of operationally there\u2019s an improvement that that should also be signaled through the guidance increase?\nAndy Power: Hey. Thanks, Tayo. The -- I mean the sterling is especially today a much more smaller piece of our business, pro forma for some of our acquisitions over the last year. So while FX did contribute to our outperformance in the first quarter, and obviously, that flows through the guidance, I would not say that was the only thing that drove our increase in guidance. We did have a beat in terms of our internal forecast and was called in the same ballpark as where consensus was. We\u2019ve essentially raised a few elements, the revenue, the EBITDA, the G&A piece is really just the P&L geography you\u2019re mapping from Interxion integrations. And then we also kind of made sure that showed that that flowed through to the bottomline with, call it, an increase at the midpoint of the range, up, I think, $0.075, so 5% year-over-year growth and not all due to FX, it was due to some of the operational outperformance. Not all of our beat flowed through, because some of it was OPEX delayed from 1Q to 2Q, 3Q, 4Q rate of the year, but definitely pleased with the result and which, I would say, gave us the confidence to raise here in the first quarter, which is little, I don\u2019t think I can recall last time we did that in my now six years in Digital, but definitely pleased with the progress.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Is that way to separate the effect of those things, the rate some of the carriers do?\nAndy Power: Is -- I\u2019m sorry, is there a way to separate those things away from the --\nOmotayo Okusanya: The impacts of the two things of actual operational improvement versus FX in the guidance range the way some of your peers do if you can actually tell what\u2019s guiding\u2026\nAndy Power: I would\u2026\nOmotayo Okusanya: \u2026 what?\nAndy Power: We used to have a constant currency disclosure at the bottom here. I\u2019m not sure -- I don\u2019t think we have that anymore. I mean I would ballpark the $0.075, maybe $0.03 from FX.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt Niknam: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. First, maybe on bookings, can you talk about some of the strengths seen in Asia-Pac and what drove the uptick in bookings during the quarter? And then just on maybe a little bit more of a housekeeping item, margins in the quarter were pretty solid, I think they were the highest since you closed the Interxion deal, but we also saw tenant reimbursements pick up. And so I\u2019m just wondering what was behind the pickup in utilities reimbursements, was that tied to the winter storm in Texas? And then maybe what drove some of the offsetting cost benefits that helped drive EBITDA margins as high as they were? Thanks.\nAndy Power: Yeah. Thanks, Matt. So maybe I\u2019ll try to take in reverse order and I\u2019m going to, I think, probably bring in Corey here when we circle back to APAC, but just to the housekeeping piece. A little bit of a funky quarter on the margin front. So I\u2019ve guided you to, call it, to our full-year guidance table on the EBITDA margin. We do have a footprint across Texas, Dallas being the largest piece of that. We were impacted by the winter storm. Again, our operational team did a really marvelous job keeping up and running and customers happy. I literally kind of personally got a cold call from a CTO of a global customer who also had their own asset or data center in the market and needed diesel fuel rerouted to them in order to stay running and our operations team sprung it in action with like an hour\u2019s notice and kind of really saved that CTO\u2019s day. But -- so on the power front, power did increase unusually given the storm. Luckily, one, our team did a nice job hedging in terms of our power cost. Two, while it inflates the expense, it also inflates the reimbursement, because we have a sizable portion of our Dallas or Texas footprint is metered power, so reimbursed. So net-net, especially on the size of company, not really a major negative, but certainly funky when you got that spike in power when you look at your EBITDA margins coming through. In terms of APAC, I mean, I\u2019ll turn it to Corey over here, but I mean just really standout quarter across the full customer product spectrum. We\u2019re now live with, I believe, five, almost six colo projects across our platform from Seoul to Tokyo, Osaka, Singapore and I\u2019m missing one. So we have great success selling into those markets. And then also on the hyperscale or larger footprint front, I mentioned in the prepared remarks, one top CSP signed with us both in Osaka and Melbourne. We also had subsequent accord and anchor customers in Inzai in Tokyo. And then Singapore, maybe I\u2019ll let Corey kind of talk to some of the success we saw in Singapore.\nCorey Dyer: Yes, Andy. I would just add, you hit most of the data points I was thinking through in the response. Really broad-based success across the portfolio is what I would say. AP was really successful as well. You mentioned it in your prepared remarks, diversified e-commerce customers that\u2019s been doing a lot of business with us and we really are happy with that. But I would also tell you that our new logos coming out of that region has tripled in the last year. We\u2019re really happy with the team. It\u2019s where most of our organic growth as far as the sales team that we\u2019re putting out there in place. So we\u2019re really happy with it. But I wouldn\u2019t get focused just on AP. I think about the broad-based platform success we\u2019re having across all the regions. I think our largest export region this last quarter was EMEA. So we\u2019re really excited about just kind of broad-based successful we are, and we think there\u2019s a ton of opportunity in Asia Pacific, and, yes, in Singapore, we were pretty successful selling through that large building there that we have. Andy, was there any other data point I missed? I think we hit most of them.\nAndy Power: No. I think you got it. Thanks.\nCorey Dyer: Okay. Thanks.\nMatt Niknam: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nErik Rasmussen: Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. Looking at your table, it looks like Europe seemed to have sort of taken a breather this quarter with leasing down and especially in the greater than 1 megawatt category. Has anything changed there, I mean, I know you talked about a pretty robust pipeline? But maybe some commentary around that, just to understand where the opportunities are and what drove this decline and if there\u2019s anything else you can comment on?\nAndy Power: Thanks, Erik. So, I mean, really, Europe or EMEA just really came off of a blowout the quarter prior. I still think I was pretty pressed with the results and thought a really healthy quarter. On the larger footprint side, we had four different CSPs sign across three different markets, Frankfurt, two in Zurich, one in Amsterdam. So definitely pleased with the diversity of demand and from a customer energy offer standpoint. On the enterprise customer standpoint, within the flap, Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, certainly stood out this quarter in terms of new signings. And within the non-flap, Marseille, Stockholm, and Madrid were some of our top EMEA markets. So -- I -- and as you can see on our development table, we\u2019ve been continuing to increase our footprint of development and building out larger parcels in EMEA on our highly connected campuses there. So I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m still pretty really positive about the growth in Europe.\nErik Rasmussen: Great. And then maybe just on the releasing spreads, the greater than one megawatt. How does that 11.3% decline on a cash basis? How does that compare on a historical basis? I know this is all dependent on customers and mix and there\u2019s a few other things? But can you talk about that 11.3% in the context of what is -- what you\u2019ve seen in the past?\nAndy Power: Yeah. It\u2019s -- that\u2019s just a statistic when you slice it down to a quarterly basis and depending on what mix actually gets renewed in that quarter, because it\u2019s not just what actually expires, customers will renew quarters or even years earlier sometimes. In particular, there was two specific customers, one top-five CSP, another enterprise customer that did, call it, fairly chunky renewals in combination with new signings. The CSP was a multi-market renewal, multi-market growth. The enterprise was in one particular North American market. So we thought it was a very fair commercial compromise and love to see them continue to grow with us. I don\u2019t -- I mean, that bounces around and we\u2019ve had worse than that in a given quarter and we\u2019ve had much better than that in a given quarter, and I still -- as you saw we confirm that guidance on the mark-to-market. So we don\u2019t think that\u2019s a truly bad omen or anything like that. And as I mentioned, I think in response to John Atkins\u2019 question on the front part of the call, definitely feel like we\u2019re moving toward better and better territory and expirations based on the product mix and the geography.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nSami Badri: Hi. Thank you. I want to go back to slide number 10 and also back to the 11.3% that we\u2019re looking at for the greater than one megawatt. Now, I guess, if we go back to about a year ago, you guys are working through a very large vintage of leases and we were kind of -- we were informed that they would be high single-digit or double-digit negative roll down there. But are we pretty much done with the majority of those leases or could we expect a bit more negative rates at least at this magnitude in other quarters in 2021?\nAndy Power: Yes. Sam, kind of consistent with my response to Erik\u2019s question, being able to predict with accuracy, the quarterly blend to that precision is pretty challenging, because it\u2019s really out of our control when the customer inks a renewal. But I think I would agree with your outset statement, we started out 2020 with an outlook of net -- call it mid-to-high single-digit negative cash mark-to-markets overall and as we worked our way through that year, we outperformed that expectation. It ended up negative, but it was very slightly modestly negative. And then we went to guidance. Our guidance, again, was really in that same territory where it ended up, so a better outlook than the prior year. If you look at the overall results here, negative 2%, a cash market across all the products, it\u2019s kind of right in line, even, overall, it\u2019s kind of right in line with the language we\u2019ve described here. So, again, I can\u2019t promise you every single quarter is going to be positive. But I do believe, based on our understanding of the expiration of the contracts and the supply/demand market dynamics that we\u2019re heading into better territory on those mark to markets.\nSami Badri: Got it. The other thing is on the zero to 1 megawatt range for the 1.6%. In that zero to 1 megawatt and in those releasing spreads, could you give us an idea on customer mix in there in terms of how much of that is enterprise versus cloud versus other?\nAndy Power: Sure. In that zero to 1 megawatt, some of the chunkier deals were -- and those are kind of no particular order. In the New York Metro area, there was a fiber-oriented customer and also a content-oriented customer. In London, there was a top-five cloud service provider. In Singapore, there was a multinational financial services company. In Northern Virginia, there was an ad marketplace type business.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrendan Lynch: Hi. Good afternoon. This is Brendan Lynch on for Tim. Your slide deck indicates you\u2019ve announced commitments to reduce direct emissions by 68% and indirect emissions by 24% by 2030. Can you -- first I\u2019ve seen those numbers or any specific targets announced, can you provide some color on your execution strategy around that and what it means in practical terms for your operations?\nBill Stein: Sure. This is Bill. We -- as you noted, we\u2019ve established carbon reduction targets in conjunction with the science based targets initiative. And in connection with that, we\u2019ve committed to reducing direct admissions by 68% by 2030 and committed to reducing indirect emissions by 24% by 2030. As you also are probably aware, we lead the data center category and the REIT industry and green bond issuance. We\u2019ve issued $5.6 billion of green bonds since 2015. We also lead the data center industry in green building certifications. We have 796 megawatts of green building certifications. And we also have 556 megawatts of renewable energy that\u2019s contracted, which, of course, contributes to the direct admissions reduction and that includes 154 megawatts in two renewable projects in Texas. For the second year in a row, we\u2019ve been voted the ENERGY STAR partner of the year and for the fourth consecutive year, we\u2019ve been voted NAREIT leader in the Light Award for the data center category and NAREITs only had that leader in the Light Award for data centers for four years. So we\u2019re batting 1,000 right now.\nBrendan Lynch: Yeah. That\u2019s great color, and clearly, you\u2019re making some progress there. How does that affect your negotiations to the extent that it does with customers and how are they responding to these initiatives?\nBill Stein: The customers -- many of these customers share the same corporate values that we do with respect to ESG and we\u2019re all about reducing our carbon footprint. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re totally in sync with what our customers\u2019 long-term goals are in this area.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. Looking at the rent schedule, it looks like about 35% of the rent comes from 1 megawatt and below business. And I\u2019m just curious, given all the comments that you shared on the call today in terms of the financial performance of these rents. Is it a strategic priority within digital to continue to lift this percentage of mix that comes from the 1 megawatt or below leases?\nAndy Power: Thanks, Mike. I mean, maybe Corey and I can tag team this for a second. I mean our strategy is to be the leading global provider dedicated full customer spectrum from the service providers, all of the hyperscalers to the enterprise customer. I think we\u2019ve certainly demonstrated a pretty solid and consistent track record on the first leg of that stool with your, call it, top five CSP having 20, 25, 30 different locations with us on average, depending on the specific name. And that value prop of our land and expand and future proof their runway for growth, that operational expertise to the highest demands. Certainly proud of that, and you\u2019ve seen the success in our results. But I think going after and supporting the enterprise is a place we\u2019ve been investing in just as much over the last several years on a multifaceted front. Certainly in terms of the critical pieces of the business we\u2019ve acquired, putting the puzzle pieces together of the rightmost connectivity rich destinations. But also on many of the things both Chris and Corey have been, call it, driving here for digital for some time. So I\u2019ll let them speak to that a little bit as well.\nCorey Dyer: Yeah. Thanks, Andy. Right on to that. You think through just the tools we were talking earlier about how we use data to target. So we\u2019re moving that forward as well down that path, if you\u2019re asking about kind of how we\u2019re going after the market if we\u2019re going after that part of the business. As far as the demand that we have going forward, I\u2019m sorry, if I missed some of the question, but I think that was a sales funnel question as opposed to just how we were targeting it. Did I get it all? I\u2019m hearing background noise, sorry, guys. And Michael, can you repeat the second part of the question, I just want to make sure I\u2019m getting it right.\nMichael Rollins: Yeah. So the question is just how much of a strategic priority is it for digital to increase the revenue contribution from the one megawatt and below business?\nCorey Dyer: Oh! I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve got it. Yeah. I am sorry\u2026\nMichael Rollins: Just given the financial nature and performance of this type of business versus the larger scale business that you have.\nCorey Dyer: I guess I would tell you that we\u2019re going to try to increase both of them. We\u2019re not going to win every customer without discerning between them. But our plan is to continue to grow the enterprise and drive that. I think that will move that mix a little bit naturally, but it\u2019s not going to be at the expense of the CSPs. We\u2019re going to go continue to partner with CSPs, continue to partner with online customers, anybody that\u2019s in e-commerce, AI some of the high-performance computing. So we\u2019re going to continue to grow it everywhere as long as it adds to the value of PlatformDIGITAL and is helpful for us. So I just don\u2019t want you to think that we\u2019re only trying to raise one without the other. We\u2019re going to try to raise that enterprise business may be faster than others to help us with that mix, but we\u2019re going to win everything. Thanks.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nOperator: That concludes the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to now turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Bill, please go ahead.\nBill Stein: Thank you, Matt. I\u2019d like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. One, we understand our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders and we were honored to be named the EPA Energy Star Partner of the Year for the second year in a row. Two, we continue to enhance the value of our global platform, calling non-core assets and extending connectivity solutions. Three, we delivered very solid current period financial results, beating expectations and raising our full year outlook. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, raising attractively priced long-term debt, recycling capital and using proceeds to hire -- to retire high coupon debt and preferred equity. Our hearts go out to all those impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic. And as we approach a post-pandemic environment here in the United States, I\u2019d like to once again thank the Digital Realty frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world running. I hope all of you stay safe and healthy, and we hope to see many of you in person again later this year. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for joining today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "No. Absolutely not. I echo your sentiment, Andy, the vendor management program that we have in place today, I think, is something that has allowed us to overcome some of the shortcomings of some of the infrastructure within the facilities like breakers, optical infrastructure, things like that. But that's something that operating on a global basis has been a big benefit digital going forward. But we also stay very close to our customers and really watching if they're having trouble procuring infrastructure to deploy their architectures into our facility. We haven't seen a material impact on that as well. I know there's been a lot of concern around chip shortages and things like that, but again, just to reiterate, not all chips are the same and there's a lot of variability out there and so have not seen any kind of material impact from customers being able to deploy into the facility. And quite frankly, some of our larger hyperscale customers, they build the entire stack themselves, so they have strict control over their supply chain and so they've also not experienced any slowdown in being able to deploy the massive amount of infrastructure required for their deployments as well."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Andy Power",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on page seven. We signed total bookings of $117 million in the first quarter, including a $13 million contribution from Interxion. Network and enterprise oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less total $33 million, building upon our consistent momentum and demonstrating the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL, as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand. The weighted average lease term was over seven years. We landed 100 new logos during the first quarter, with strong showing across all regions, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. The midst of our new signings was quite healthy, with APAC and EMEA, each contributing approximately 30% and the Americas accounting for the remaining 40%. In addition, nearly 40% of bookings were generated within the megawatt or less plus Interxion category, with strengthen in the e-commerce, gaming and financial services segments. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a particular highlight of the quarter was landing a leading APAC-based diversified digital economy platform in Singapore, where we were able to support this customer's needs across our full product spectrum, from colocation and connectivity to a hyperscale dedicated data hall. Elsewhere in APAC, a leading cloud service provider expanded with us simultaneously in both Melbourne and Osaka. Subsequent to quarter end, we landed a leading cloud provider to anchor our Tokyo campus in Inzai, where we've assembled a runway of over 100 megawatts of growth capacity, as well as key magnetic connectivity solutions. In EEMEA an automotive digital technology maker deployed an artificial intelligence machine learning footprint on PlatformDIGITAL to gain access to a community of leading cloud service providers on our Frankfurt campus. In the Americas, a leading cloud provider spin it on our campuses in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. A global 2000 industrial manufacturer leveraged a partner to deploy on PlatformDIGITAL to support growing demand, enabled by our global platform and runway for growth on our Suburban Chicago campus. A global digital advertising exchange platform expanded its presence on PlatformDIGITAL to gain access to connected data communities in the Northern Virginia Metro area. Also in Ashburn, a leading video game developer selected PlatformDIGITAL to build centers of data exchange. And finally, a global IT service provider expanded a multiple metros across North America to enable new services on PlatformDIGITAL. Turning to our backlog on page nine, the current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced reach another all time high of $307 million. The step up from $269 million last quarter reflects $66 million of commencements during the first quarter, offset by roughly $104 million of combined space and power leases signed. The lag between signage and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average adjusted on eight months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 10. We signed $193 million of renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the first quarter was a little less than three years, reflecting a greater mix of enterprise deals smaller than 1 megawatt. We retained 75% of expiring leases, just a bit below our long-term average. Cash re-leasing spreads on renewals were negative 2.1%, which was in line with guidance, but weighed down by to customers who were new to existing capacity as part of the expansion of their footprint on our platform. These transactions are prime examples of what we mean when we talk about our holistic long-term approach to customer relationship management. We believe we have a distinct advantage when we're competing for new business with a customer, we -- that we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio. And whenever we can we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings, including both new business, as well as renewals. In terms of first quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy tick down to 100 basis points, driven by anticipated churn in Ashburn, as well as the sale of 11 almost fully leased facilities in Europe. Same capital cash NOI growth was negative 2.8% in the first quarter, in line with guidance and largely driven by this same Ashburn churn. As a reminder, our recently acquired Western building in Seattle, Interxion across EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece and Altus IT in Croatia, are not yet included in the same store pool. But we expect each of these acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on page 11. The U.S. dollar strengthened in the first quarter, but still remain somewhat depressed relative to the prior year average, providing a bit of an FX tailwind in the first quarter. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, 100-basis-point move in LIBOR would have less than a 50-basis-point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, first quarter core FFO per share was up 9% year-over-year and $0.09 ahead of consensus. The upside relative to our internal forecasts was driven by a beat on the topline with an assist from an FX tailwind, as well as operating expense savings, primarily due to lower property level spending in the COVID-19 environment and a later the budget of closing on the non-core European portfolio sale. A portion of the OpEx savings is likely timing related and represents more of a deferral rather than permanent savings. But substantially all of the beat flows through to the raise and we are taking core FFO per share guidance up by $0.075 at the midpoint. In terms of the quarterly run rate, we still expect the split between first half of the year and the second half of the year to be approximately 49/51. In other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on page 12, we expect to dip down by about $0.10 in the second quarter, before wrapping up fairly steadily over the rest of the year due to the mid-March closing of the non-core European portfolio sale, as well as an expected catch-up in OpEx spend previously budgeted for the first quarter. I would like to point out that although we are raising our G&A forecast by $15 million at the midpoint, our implied EBITDA margin guidance is unchanged, as the lion's share of the increase is due to geography on the income statement as we finalize mapping the Interxion cost structure and reap characterize a portion of Interxion's OpEx spend as overhead. In terms of our financing plans, we've already made great strides this year, with a highly successful $1 billion green euro bond offering in early January at 0.625%, in addition to the proceeds from the asset sales in March. As always, we expect to remain nimble for the rest of the year and we may look to capitalize on favorable market conditions to lock in long-term fixed rate financing at attractive coupons across the currencies that support our assets to proactively manage future liabilities. Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 13. As previously mentioned, we've closed on the sale of a portfolio of 11 assets in Europe for approximately $680 million and use the proceeds to pay down debt, bringing net debt to adjusted EBITDA back down to 5.6 times in line with our long-term target range. Fixed charge coverage reached an all time high of 5.8 times, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management. We continue to execute on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options, while minimizing the related cost and extending the durations of our liabilities to match our long lived assets. In early January, we raised $1 billion to 10.5-year green euro bonds at an all time low coupon for Digital Realty 0.625%. We also retired $350 million of 2.75% bonds due in 2023 and we've repaid all $530 million outstanding on the term loan due in 2023. In mid-April, we announced the redemption of $200 million of preferred stock at 0.625% also bring total preferred equity redemptions over the past 12 months to $700 million and a weighted average coupon of just over 6.25, effectively lowering leverage by another 0.3 turns. This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public, as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on page 13, we extended our weighted average debt maturity up to nearly seven years or ratcheting our weighted average coupon down to 2.3%. A little over 70% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 94% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see on the left side of the page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to feel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we'd be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session. Hey. Thanks, Jon. I will -- maybe I'll try to tackle some of the number of questions on the beginning and I'll turn it over to Corey to talk about our channels and productivity. So just a cut them up in a little bit order here. So I would characterize, going to your second question about how much of our less than megawatt of colocation is kind of connectivity rich, I would characterize that is a highly connectivity rich piece of our business. In terms of the numbers of our customers of the 4,000 customers that we have a digital, the lion's share of the customer count falls in that. They sit in typically some of our more highly connected destinations either dating back many years to our legacy Telx business or Interxion or Westin building or where we've organically grown our colocation connectivity suites across North America, I think, we have five markets across Asia-Pacific and elsewhere around the globe. So you typically see fairly sticky high retention, low churn, as well as fairly substantial pricing power quarter-after-quarter and you can see that in the retention table at the back of sup. And the definition didn't change all that much when we migrated from the work colocation to a sizing definition. I think the first part of your question was called, look at the expiration schedule. I thought I heard a post year in 2022. I'm not sure my crystal ball can go with that much precision out that far. I would say, dramatically, we've been working through a few years now of more tougher sledding when it came to our expiration and that was in 2020, 2019, 2018, that was in size of the volume of the expirations, that was in the mix of expirations, in terms of kind of going back to more higher -- less pricing power locations, telco deals, concentrations of some multi-market, major customer renewals, I think we've done a nice job chopping a fair bit of wood and the front view mirror on the expiration schedule. What certainly looks better than what we've come through and I think you've seen that now, in terms of how our mark-to-market has called is being progressing in back into a better fashion as we kind of work through some of the lumpier contracts and you're going to see it on the percentages of where the expirations kind of fall between the plus or minus megawatt category. So feels like we're heading in the right direction on the expiration schedule and I didn't touch -- definitely geographically just by the maturity of our business much were non-U.S. are out, call in EMEA, APAC type expirations into the future, which also call up higher barrier to entry, tough -- high pricing power markets. But I will turn to Corey to hit your -- the last part of your question. Hey. Thanks, Jordan. I would say, all -- in total volume connectivity new signs was up. I think in terms of, call, lumpier concentrations, our Latin America portion of the portfolio was certainly a major contributor. In terms of the top markets for just overall the interconnection signs, in North America was some of the usual, New York Metro, Chicago, Atlanta. But also, I didn't notice we had some pretty strong connectivity growth in both our Northern Virginia campus, as well as our Franklin Park Chicago campus. So not necessarily a legacy highly connectivity dense location, but it's great to see that enterprise is landing there and growing their connectivity footprint. An answer to -- partly answer to Jon Atkins question we track our new logos on a year-over-year growth basis. We don't have this for all of our new logos, because we're kind of combining businesses over the last year, but I call the legacy digital subset that were here a year ago, there -- they grew their connectivity footprint north of 10% on a year-over-year basis, so the new logos are growing post-landing with us. So definitely pleased, and I mean, I think, it goes back to a lot of what Corey was saying about our reorientation across the Board in terms of bringing some critical puzzle pieces together in terms of our asset profile, our go-to-market strategy led by Corey, our PlatformDIGITAL bringing to the market and many other elements I think are tied together that's driving that success. Yeah. So, Northern Virginia, Jordan, obviously, you're aware we have pretty incredible 2020 close to 85 megawatts sold overall. We kind of ran pretty darn tight on inventory based on that success, which is not necessarily a bad thing, given that the Northern Virginia has been kind of working its way out of the woods for some time now. So we ended the year with our development pathway with 100% preleased. We are now under construction and delivering building are in terms of our new build that will come along this summer. We did close to 5 megawatts of leasing in total in that market, including the full product suite. I would say the lion's share of our focus is on the capacity we got back at the very beginning of the year. So which I mentioned we already released or pre-released on the last call. So really focusing on some of that non-retained capacity on our existing campus, but also we did landed anchor deal, a little chunkier enterprise deal and the building are coming on back -- on the back half of the year, then building on as a large shell that will call it deliver 6 megawatts suites in call it every other month type of fashion. So little tight right now, focused on where we're place -- pushing customers, but a longer, larger runaway we're building our company on the back end of the year. I mean, I think, we have a pretty responsive pricing dynamic holistically, Mike. So it's not just on renewals. We have a call it inventory price book for every type of capacity, for every duration of contract, for every market, for every product that is update on a recurring basis in response to what we see in terms of the supply/demand dynamics in the market. We obviously don't have certain overlays in terms of customer relationships or in the larger growing customers or newer customers that we kind of make sure we're responsive to at the same time. We're certainly not sitting by idly when a market is weaker and we need to respond to that with pricing to be more competitive. And on the other flip side of that coin we've had experienced like in Singapore or other markets like Santa Clara or Frankfurt, where we raised rates over time and those rates are impacted our renewals and our new pricing in response to, call it, the overall supply/demand dynamic. The increase in the non-core, I believe, we got a whole list of items in our FFO reconciliation that kind of hits the non-core that includes our investment in Megaport is good stock price mark-to-market when that flows through, and that obviously, is in the core up or down to our business. I believe there's a revaluation on our debt at SMP, given it's a resilient entity and with the U.S. dollar denominated debt to match the currency of the lot lion's share of our contracts. And we also have, I think, in this particular quarter, a little bit of a benefit from our PPA settlement that we added back, because we didn't do that as recurring benefits on core FFO. Please go ahead. Hey. Simon, can you just repeat the second part of the question to make sure we... Okay. Great. So let me take the, call it, our digital supply chain, I will let Chris touch on the customer supply chain, because I know that's been a question out there as well. So, I think, really hats off and kudos to our operational design, construction team and supply chain team for always keeping ahead of this consistently. Obviously, we do all have the benefit of our scale, our global nature, our deep operational expertise. But we've not in recent quarters had any, call it, disruption to critical equipment, delays, cost impact and so the team really -- has done a really incredible job of navigating through that. I'm not sure that's the case for all providers in the data center world, especially smaller stature, but they've not been disruption today. And I'd say we've -- what we've looked at our, call it, 300 megawatts of capacity under development is pretty darn insulated to these any potential inflation shocks and we're also keeping a keen eye on that. But, Chris, why don't you hit on the chip piece as well. Hey. Thanks, Tayo. The -- I mean the sterling is especially today a much more smaller piece of our business, pro forma for some of our acquisitions over the last year. So while FX did contribute to our outperformance in the first quarter, and obviously, that flows through the guidance, I would not say that was the only thing that drove our increase in guidance. We did have a beat in terms of our internal forecast and was called in the same ballpark as where consensus was. We've essentially raised a few elements, the revenue, the EBITDA, the G&A piece is really just the P&L geography you're mapping from Interxion integrations. And then we also kind of made sure that showed that that flowed through to the bottomline with, call it, an increase at the midpoint of the range, up, I think, $0.075, so 5% year-over-year growth and not all due to FX, it was due to some of the operational outperformance. Not all of our beat flowed through, because some of it was OPEX delayed from 1Q to 2Q, 3Q, 4Q rate of the year, but definitely pleased with the result and which, I would say, gave us the confidence to raise here in the first quarter, which is little, I don't think I can recall last time we did that in my now six years in Digital, but definitely pleased with the progress. Is -- I'm sorry, is there a way to separate those things away from the -- I would... We used to have a constant currency disclosure at the bottom here. I'm not sure -- I don't think we have that anymore. I mean I would ballpark the $0.075, maybe $0.03 from FX. Yeah. Thanks, Matt. So maybe I'll try to take in reverse order and I'm going to, I think, probably bring in Corey here when we circle back to APAC, but just to the housekeeping piece. A little bit of a funky quarter on the margin front. So I've guided you to, call it, to our full-year guidance table on the EBITDA margin. We do have a footprint across Texas, Dallas being the largest piece of that. We were impacted by the winter storm. Again, our operational team did a really marvelous job keeping up and running and customers happy. I literally kind of personally got a cold call from a CTO of a global customer who also had their own asset or data center in the market and needed diesel fuel rerouted to them in order to stay running and our operations team sprung it in action with like an hour's notice and kind of really saved that CTO's day. But -- so on the power front, power did increase unusually given the storm. Luckily, one, our team did a nice job hedging in terms of our power cost. Two, while it inflates the expense, it also inflates the reimbursement, because we have a sizable portion of our Dallas or Texas footprint is metered power, so reimbursed. So net-net, especially on the size of company, not really a major negative, but certainly funky when you got that spike in power when you look at your EBITDA margins coming through. In terms of APAC, I mean, I'll turn it to Corey over here, but I mean just really standout quarter across the full customer product spectrum. We're now live with, I believe, five, almost six colo projects across our platform from Seoul to Tokyo, Osaka, Singapore and I'm missing one. So we have great success selling into those markets. And then also on the hyperscale or larger footprint front, I mentioned in the prepared remarks, one top CSP signed with us both in Osaka and Melbourne. We also had subsequent accord and anchor customers in Inzai in Tokyo. And then Singapore, maybe I'll let Corey kind of talk to some of the success we saw in Singapore. No. I think you got it. Thanks. Thanks, Erik. So, I mean, really, Europe or EMEA just really came off of a blowout the quarter prior. I still think I was pretty pressed with the results and thought a really healthy quarter. On the larger footprint side, we had four different CSPs sign across three different markets, Frankfurt, two in Zurich, one in Amsterdam. So definitely pleased with the diversity of demand and from a customer energy offer standpoint. On the enterprise customer standpoint, within the flap, Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, certainly stood out this quarter in terms of new signings. And within the non-flap, Marseille, Stockholm, and Madrid were some of our top EMEA markets. So -- I -- and as you can see on our development table, we've been continuing to increase our footprint of development and building out larger parcels in EMEA on our highly connected campuses there. So I don't -- I'm still pretty really positive about the growth in Europe. Yeah. It's -- that's just a statistic when you slice it down to a quarterly basis and depending on what mix actually gets renewed in that quarter, because it's not just what actually expires, customers will renew quarters or even years earlier sometimes. In particular, there was two specific customers, one top-five CSP, another enterprise customer that did, call it, fairly chunky renewals in combination with new signings. The CSP was a multi-market renewal, multi-market growth. The enterprise was in one particular North American market. So we thought it was a very fair commercial compromise and love to see them continue to grow with us. I don't -- I mean, that bounces around and we've had worse than that in a given quarter and we've had much better than that in a given quarter, and I still -- as you saw we confirm that guidance on the mark-to-market. So we don't think that's a truly bad omen or anything like that. And as I mentioned, I think in response to John Atkins' question on the front part of the call, definitely feel like we're moving toward better and better territory and expirations based on the product mix and the geography. Yes. Sam, kind of consistent with my response to Erik's question, being able to predict with accuracy, the quarterly blend to that precision is pretty challenging, because it's really out of our control when the customer inks a renewal. But I think I would agree with your outset statement, we started out 2020 with an outlook of net -- call it mid-to-high single-digit negative cash mark-to-markets overall and as we worked our way through that year, we outperformed that expectation. It ended up negative, but it was very slightly modestly negative. And then we went to guidance. Our guidance, again, was really in that same territory where it ended up, so a better outlook than the prior year. If you look at the overall results here, negative 2%, a cash market across all the products, it's kind of right in line, even, overall, it's kind of right in line with the language we've described here. So, again, I can't promise you every single quarter is going to be positive. But I do believe, based on our understanding of the expiration of the contracts and the supply/demand market dynamics that we're heading into better territory on those mark to markets. Sure. In that zero to 1 megawatt, some of the chunkier deals were -- and those are kind of no particular order. In the New York Metro area, there was a fiber-oriented customer and also a content-oriented customer. In London, there was a top-five cloud service provider. In Singapore, there was a multinational financial services company. In Northern Virginia, there was an ad marketplace type business. Thanks, Mike. I mean, maybe Corey and I can tag team this for a second. I mean our strategy is to be the leading global provider dedicated full customer spectrum from the service providers, all of the hyperscalers to the enterprise customer. I think we've certainly demonstrated a pretty solid and consistent track record on the first leg of that stool with your, call it, top five CSP having 20, 25, 30 different locations with us on average, depending on the specific name. And that value prop of our land and expand and future proof their runway for growth, that operational expertise to the highest demands. Certainly proud of that, and you've seen the success in our results. But I think going after and supporting the enterprise is a place we've been investing in just as much over the last several years on a multifaceted front. Certainly in terms of the critical pieces of the business we've acquired, putting the puzzle pieces together of the rightmost connectivity rich destinations. But also on many of the things both Chris and Corey have been, call it, driving here for digital for some time. So I'll let them speak to that a little bit as well."

            "name": "Corey Dyer",
            "content": "Yeah. Hey. Thanks, Andy, and Jon, thanks for the question. I think I kind of captured it and you correct me if I missed it. But you asked a question around channels and how we're doing there. And then a little bit about with the new logo that we're getting an increase in interconnect I think are the questions, and, Jonathan, if I missed it, then you can always clarify it later. But I will tell you that really happy with the progress we're making on channels of our, I will call it, enterprise business, non-scale business, the channel is now about a quarter of the business. So we're pretty happy with the progress there. And then your question around new logos and how much of the new logos are adding interconnection to it. We've seen an increase in that. It really kind of just comes through when you think through PlatformDIGITAL and how we're getting many, many more multi-use cases deployment, multi-site deployment, most of those look like network connectivity, as well as in control our hub. And so we're seeing good progress across those and we're seeing, I guess, the net of it is the channels bringing up a lot more new logos and those new logos are a little bit more interconnections in and they were in the past. Hopefully that answers the question. Oh! Okay. Yes. No. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. That's good question. Yeah. I'm pretty familiar with that. And I'll tell you that, you referenced a few places that some of have been, so we are not going to comment on what they're doing. But I would tell you that, yes, we do use call it AI and I'll say target based data set for both our prospects, our customers. And I'll tell you that we use data and that's really what the essence of the Data Gravity Index was, it was a -- Data Gravity Index published based on data and what we see in the industry. And it really helped us identify the shift in the infrastructure placement and connectivity that's required across the full spectrum colocation. And so I feel like we're doing pretty good across both those Jonathan using AI, using data to make our decision to how we target our customers. So, pretty on top of that, oh, yeah. Andy, you want me to take the enterprise demand question and just date of use and you can just follow on the second half? Okay. All right. So, yeah, thanks for the question. I would tell you that we're getting closer to the state of normal, if that's what you want to call it. Some of the things are opening up. But we've got a lot of ability around doing tours virtually, we've found a bunch of different ways to augment the need and take our customers during the pandemic. So I feel like we're getting close to it. We're not quite there. That said, enterprise demand has been really, really good. It's been strong, broad-based success, still on our platform, Andy mentioned it earlier, but early innings with long tail left. We're looking through some of the more macro trends. Gartner's got IT spending getting at 6% growth, with about $4.1 trillion annually and only about $400 billion of that go into public cloud. So we think that enterprise demand and the point of presence and the multi-use cases, as well as multi-markets that we're going after are going to be there and we're seeing it continue to sustain. Well, I wouldn't say that it's a complete back to normal. We haven't seen, I guess, in enterprise demand and quite frankly, we think we've done a pretty good job adjusting through it with all the ops and FCs and SAs we have important to it [ph]. I think that answer the question, I'm not sure if I did it. Okay, Simon. Okay. Yes, Andy. I would just add, you hit most of the data points I was thinking through in the response. Really broad-based success across the portfolio is what I would say. AP was really successful as well. You mentioned it in your prepared remarks, diversified e-commerce customers that's been doing a lot of business with us and we really are happy with that. But I would also tell you that our new logos coming out of that region has tripled in the last year. We're really happy with the team. It's where most of our organic growth as far as the sales team that we're putting out there in place. So we're really happy with it. But I wouldn't get focused just on AP. I think about the broad-based platform success we're having across all the regions. I think our largest export region this last quarter was EMEA. So we're really excited about just kind of broad-based successful we are, and we think there's a ton of opportunity in Asia Pacific, and, yes, in Singapore, we were pretty successful selling through that large building there that we have. Andy, was there any other data point I missed? I think we hit most of them. Okay. Thanks. Yeah. Thanks, Andy. Right on to that. You think through just the tools we were talking earlier about how we use data to target. So we're moving that forward as well down that path, if you're asking about kind of how we're going after the market if we're going after that part of the business. As far as the demand that we have going forward, I'm sorry, if I missed some of the question, but I think that was a sales funnel question as opposed to just how we were targeting it. Did I get it all? I'm hearing background noise, sorry, guys. And Michael, can you repeat the second part of the question, I just want to make sure I'm getting it right. Oh! I'm sorry. I've got it. Yeah. I am sorry... I guess I would tell you that we're going to try to increase both of them. We're not going to win every customer without discerning between them. But our plan is to continue to grow the enterprise and drive that. I think that will move that mix a little bit naturally, but it's not going to be at the expense of the CSPs. We're going to go continue to partner with CSPs, continue to partner with online customers, anybody that's in e-commerce, AI some of the high-performance computing. So we're going to continue to grow it everywhere as long as it adds to the value of PlatformDIGITAL and is helpful for us. So I just don't want you to think that we're only trying to raise one without the other. We're going to try to raise that enterprise business may be faster than others to help us with that mix, but we're going to win everything. Thanks."

            "content": "Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global connected sustainable framework and our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of this framework. Our business is increasingly global, with first quarter bookings very evenly balanced across regions. We continue to align PlatformDIGITAL with our customer's digital transformation issues by expanding our unique interconnection capabilities focusing on connecting centers of data across our robust, reliable global platform. Last, but not least, we continue to advance our initiatives to deliver sustainable growth for all stakeholders. Let's turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on page three. We were recently honored to be named EPA ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year for Energy Management for the second year in a row. We were also recently honored to receive the 2020 largest financial Corporate Green Bond Award from Climate Bonds Initiative. We expect to publish our third annual ESG report during the second quarter, providing transparency on our ESG performance for 2020, as well as a comprehensive overview of our clean energy commitment, resource conservation, diversity, equity and inclusion, and other sustainable business practices. We are committed to minimize our impact on the environment, while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and the broader society. In terms of our social efforts, we recently joined leaders across 85 industries, inciting the CEO pledge on CEO action for diversity and inclusion, an initiative to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Our Board of Directors also amended our corporate governance guidelines to clarify that director candidate pools must include candidates with diversity of race, ethnicity and gender. Finally in February, our Board of Directors amended our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter to formalize oversight of our ESG programs, including sustainability, as well as diversity, equity and inclusion. We are doing our best to play a constructive, proactive role in advancing our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities we serve around the world. Let's turn to our investment activity on page four. We continue to invest in our global platform, with 44 projects underway around the world, totaling more than three 100 megawatts of incremental capacity scheduled for delivery over the next 18 months. Half of this expansion is underway in EMEA, while the balance is split roughly evenly between the Americas and APAC. In EMEA we continued our extension of the highly connected legacy Interxion campus in Frankfurt and began construction on the Neckermann expansion campus. During the first quarter, we broke ground on the first 26 megawatts on the expansion campus which are scheduled for delivery next year. Demand in Frankfurt remains strong and our campus with access to over 700 carriers and ISP continues to attract customers from around the world. In France, we were adding capacity in Marseille, as well as Paris. Demand in Marseille is largely driven by the 14 subsea cables that terminate in our facilities where we are transforming a former abandoned World War II U-boat bunker into a modern and vital communications hub for over half of the world's population. In Paris, we continue to develop Interxion Paris Digital Park, while the Dunant subsea cable that links Paris to Virginia Beach, was connected in our Paris campus during the quarter. We are also expanding our highly connected Brussels campus and breaking ground on another facility in Madrid to serve the broadening needs of service providers, as well as enterprises. In APAC, we recently announced the grand opening of our third data center in Singapore. We were particularly pleased to be recognized by Singapore's Desmond Lee, Minister of National Development, highlighting the sustainable design of our most energy efficient data center in the region. Despite some COVID related construction challenges last year, we were gratified to be able to deliver this highly connected and sustainably designed facility to meet customer needs in our tightest market. Finally, in mid-March, we closed on a sale of a portfolio of 11 assets in Europe for approximately $680 million, executing on our strategy of recycling capital from stabilized assets, reinvesting proceeds into higher growth opportunities, while prioritizing long-term value creation over near-term earnings growth. Let's turn to the demand drivers on page five. We are fortunate to be operating in a business leverage of secular demand drivers. Our leadership position provides us with a unique advantage point that enables us to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on PlatformDIGITAL. In the second half of last year, we introduced to our customers the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool that projects the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation lifecycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. In the first quarter of this year, we took the next step and published an industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities to guide cross industry collaboration for our customers, as they tackle data gravity head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity. Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of data gravity. Market intelligence from Gartner recently hosted an executive retreat and surveyed over 400 Chief Data and Analytic officers, with 83% of CEOs expecting to increase investments in digital business, with a large percentage of these firms prioritizing digital data products to drive growth. With this transition to data driven businesses, Gartner predicts that by 2024, more than 75% of companies will deployed multiple data hubs to drive mission critical data analytics, sharing and governance. We are seeing growing momentum across our enterprise and service provider customers deploying their own data hubs and analytics environments in multiple metros on PlatformDIGITAL. As I mentioned earlier, Digital Realty was recently named ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for the second consecutive year. This award reflects our sharpened focus on driving sustainable design and operations on PlatformDIGITAL, underpinned by ambitious science-based targets to significantly reduce our carbon footprint by 2030. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market leading innovation to capture the growing global data center demand opportunity from data driven businesses. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform to meeting these needs, we believe that we are well-positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold and store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Sure. This is Bill. We -- as you noted, we've established carbon reduction targets in conjunction with the science based targets initiative. And in connection with that, we've committed to reducing direct admissions by 68% by 2030 and committed to reducing indirect emissions by 24% by 2030. As you also are probably aware, we lead the data center category and the REIT industry and green bond issuance. We've issued $5.6 billion of green bonds since 2015. We also lead the data center industry in green building certifications. We have 796 megawatts of green building certifications. And we also have 556 megawatts of renewable energy that's contracted, which, of course, contributes to the direct admissions reduction and that includes 154 megawatts in two renewable projects in Texas. For the second year in a row, we've been voted the ENERGY STAR partner of the year and for the fourth consecutive year, we've been voted NAREIT leader in the Light Award for the data center category and NAREITs only had that leader in the Light Award for data centers for four years. So we're batting 1,000 right now. The customers -- many of these customers share the same corporate values that we do with respect to ESG and we're all about reducing our carbon footprint. So I'd say we're totally in sync with what our customers' long-term goals are in this area. Thank you, Matt. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. One, we understand our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders and we were honored to be named the EPA Energy Star Partner of the Year for the second year in a row. Two, we continue to enhance the value of our global platform, calling non-core assets and extending connectivity solutions. Three, we delivered very solid current period financial results, beating expectations and raising our full year outlook. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, raising attractively priced long-term debt, recycling capital and using proceeds to hire -- to retire high coupon debt and preferred equity. Our hearts go out to all those impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic. And as we approach a post-pandemic environment here in the United States, I'd like to once again thank the Digital Realty frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world running. I hope all of you stay safe and healthy, and we hope to see many of you in person again later this year. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty\u2019s Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you, Andrea and welcome everybody to Digital Realty\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me on today\u2019s call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today\u2019s call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our fourth quarter. First, the combination of strong demand and tightening levels of supply are translating into broad-based price improvements, which is reflected in the increased re-leasing spread expectations and the positive inflection in stabilized NOI growth that we are forecasting for 2023. Second, we remain focused on achieving the highest potential returns on investment and some progress on this front is evident in the sequential improvement in our development pipeline yields. And third, as most of you already know, we have made some changes to our management team since we last reported. Andy and Matt both have a long history with Digital and as expected, the transition has been seamless. But just as important, they also bring fresh perspective and energy to their new roles and the team remains excited about the opportunity that lies ahead. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.\nAndy Power: Thanks, Jordan and thanks to everyone for joining our call. While my voice is probably pretty familiar to most of you, this is my first earnings call as CEO of Digital Realty. I am honored to lead Digital Realty\u2019s incredible global team and I am optimistic and excited as ever about the opportunity that lies ahead. I want to thank both the Board for their confidence in me and the support that they provide in executing our strategy and thank Bill Stein, who I first met in 2004 as we worked together on Digital\u2019s IPO for his leadership over these many years. Finally, I want to thank the numerous customers, partners, team members and shareholders for the kind words of support and encouragement that I have received over the past 2 months. When I joined Digital in 2015, we are primarily a North American scale data center provider. Since then, we have evolved the company to be a global provider of the full spectrum of scale, co-location and interconnection solutions to better serve the growing needs of our 4,000 plus customers. Today, Digital is the global data center leader with an unmatched footprint of over 300 data centers in over 50 metro areas in 28 countries on 6 continents. Globally, our portfolio comprises of more than 2.3 gigawatts of IT load and we have another 400 plus megawatts under construction. I am extremely proud of the success that we\u2019ve had and the position that we are in. But now is not the time to rest on our laurels as the path that has brought us to where we are today will not get us to where we want to be. In that being, we have swiftly taken action on a few fronts. First, we quickly backfilled the role of CFO with my long-time finance partner, Matt Mercier. Matt has played a leadership role across Digital\u2019s global finance organization for well over a decade, including the successful integration of multiple platform acquisitions and the implementation of systems that will provide the foundation for our operations and evolving strategy. Second, we aligned and combined our strategy of business segments and investments team to assure that we have the right capabilities and are making the right investments in order to deliver the global meeting place for service providers and enterprises. Third, we moved to align all technology under our Chief Technology Officer, including our CISO and our recently appointed Chief Information Officer which will support the acceleration of our journey and identity as both a technology and a real estate company. Recent product launches, including service fabric, demonstrate the potential of bringing together innovation and technology to help drive our customers\u2019 growth. Lastly, we further streamlined our global operations capabilities to maximize the potential of Digital Realty\u2019s 300 plus data centers and our people under the trusted hand of a long-time digital leader with a track record of bringing global teams together. And here is what\u2019s next on the agenda in terms of the top strategic priorities. First, as depicted on Slide 3, we will demonstrably strengthen our customer value proposition. Through the continued execution of our meeting place strategy by delivering sustainable connectivity-rich solutions to our enterprise and service provider customers, which will translate into better organic growth over the medium and long-term. Along these lines, yesterday, we announced a new AWS Direct Connect on-ramp at Digital Realty\u2019s Ashburn campus, landing one of the highest consumption markets and adding coast-to-coast U.S. coverage to our robust existing portfolio of AWS Direct Connect locations across EMEA. And earlier this month, we advanced our commitment to sustainability with a new 10-year power purchase agreement for 116 megawatts of renewable energy, supporting the construction of a new solar park in Germany. Second, we are integrating and innovating our capabilities across our entire unmatched global asset portfolio and have topped the largest open network platform in the world. Many of these integration and innovation efforts will benefit both our customers as they seek to deploy new and complex workloads on the leading data center platform and our own internal team, unifying our ability to deliver value to the market. Lastly, many of you are familiar with my many fishing poles in the water mantra. And in this vein, we plan to further diversify and bolster our sources of capital in order to support our customer\u2019s rapidly growing digital infrastructure needs, while improving capital efficiency and returns for Digital Realty investors. The opportunity before us is tremendous. We have all the key ingredients at our fingertips and a long runway for growth. When I assessed the digital infrastructure landscape today, including its fundamental prospects and then how Digital Realty is positioned within this sector, I\u2019d say the following. First, demand for our product remains quite strong and well supported by ongoing digital transformation, migration to the cloud, and the overall evolution towards centralized compute. As it goes, technology begets technology. And the growth in high-performance compute infrastructure has driven innovation that tends to spur the next wave of growth in technology that in many respects, advances productivity and hopefully, over time, driving improvement to the overall quality of our lives. While the demand drivers we have enjoyed for the last decade continue, we may now be on the precipice of the next wave of demand that will drive our sector for the next decade. For years, we have referenced new technology like artificial intelligence and machine learning as potential drivers of demand, but there have been relatively few identifiable workloads over specific infrastructure requirements tied to those specific technologies. The launch of ChatGPT 3.0 is a seemingly important milestone. Microsoft\u2019s incorporation of ChatGPT into Bing last week, Google is coming with the launch of Bard and Baidu\u2019s Ernie Bot all suggest that we are on the forefront of the broader introduction of AI, which could spawn a wave of adoption and a proliferation of use cases and ultimately drive demand for compute infrastructure at scale. This is our domain expertise. We are in the very early days of this technology and its potential and have yet to see the effects of its introduction in the data center sector, but we are well positioned to support our customers and partners and we are working diligently to understand how their requirements will evolve and making sure to incorporate these into our latest designs. Importantly, as we experience with the cloud, the advent of new technology can play out over a very extended timeframe. We have built Digital Realty with these timeframes in mind and plan to be there to support our existing and growing customer base across the globe in the future. Let\u2019s move to the quarter. Our core FFO landed within the implied guidance range that we provided last quarter as the term that is taking shape in our core portfolio continued to gain momentum. Capping off another record year of bookings, new leases signed moderated from the record we achieved in the prior quarter, but remained quite strong and were highlighted by a nice rebound in our 0 to 1 megawatt segment and record interconnection bookings. Demand was geographically broad-based with strong contributions from APAC, the Americas and EMEA. This demonstrates the breadth and momentum that we are seeing in this business, which is a reflection of our ongoing effort to deliver the meeting place for our service provider and enterprise customers. During the fourth quarter, we added 106 new customers, continuing the streak of 100 plus new logos that we have added each quarter since closing the InterXion transaction nearly 3 years ago. One of our key wins during the fourth quarter was an expansion of our relationship with Avnet, a leading global technology distributor and solution provider and a member of the Fortune 500. Avnet Integrated has standardized on PlatformDIGITAL for an initial three market deployment in Northern Virginia, Dallas and Silicon Valley. This partnership enables high-performance, cost effective computing solutions that can be deployed quickly in Digital Realty facilities globally while mitigating risk and complexity. A major global automotive manufacturer deploying internationally chose PlatformDIGITAL, leveraging Digital Realty\u2019s unrivaled global footprint and ability to manage complex deployments. 4 of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions, including 3 of the 10 largest in Europe selected PlatformDIGITAL seeking network-oriented solutions ranging from hybrid IT, trading and market data support to high-performance computing and more. A leading global asset manager and service provider leveraged Digital Realty\u2019s HPE GreenLake alliance to significantly reduce networking and IT infrastructure complexity. Importantly, pricing on new leases signed increased yet again in the fourth quarter in each of our business segments, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of price improvements in 2022. We also continue to add more CPI-based escalators with approximately 25% of the newly signed leases in the quarter containing inflation-linked increases with fixed rate escalators on the balance. We also saw another quarter of positive leasing spreads on renewals in the fourth quarter, helping to support a positive inflection for the full year 2022. While we acknowledge that the turn was driven by the strength in the 0 to 1 megawatt renewals, we are beyond the point of excuses and call us and prefer to highlight the forest rather than the trees and point to the overall inflection in market rents and re-leasing spreads that took place in 2022 as a whole. We expect market conditions to remain supportive this year and our guidance reflects a further inflection in this positive trend as Matt will lay out in a few minutes. Speaking of better pricing, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our largest market in Northern Virginia. We have continued to work constructively with the power provider in this market and we are now pleased to be in a position to say that we fully expect to be able to deliver on the commitments that we have made to our customers within our development pipeline. So while conditions are far from business as usual in this market, we are encouraged by the progress made over the last 90 days and remain hopeful that we will continue to be able to work with a local utility provider to support the growing needs of our mutual customers. Moving on to our investment activity. During the fourth quarter, we sold a 25% interest in a data center in Frankfurt, Germany to digital core REIT. The facility was valued at nearly $500 million and the transaction generated about $150 million of proceeds for Digital Realty. We also acquired land in 5 different metros for future development, including 2 organic new market entries into Rome and Akra [ph]. Rome is one of the largest cities in Europe by population, but has been essentially ignored by international data center providers. We have acquired a parcel within 15 kilometers off the coast that will make it an ideal interconnection point for future subsea cables that land in Rome, thereby enhancing our position in the Mediterranean while serving as a connectivity hub in the middle of the country. Before turning it over to Matt, I\u2019d like to reiterate my focus on ESG and share some of our recent progress with you. We were recognized by a variety of organizations for our ESG success, including for the sixth consecutive year, Digital was recognized by NAREIT with the Leader in the Light Award for Data Center sustainability. Sustainalytics recently included Digital Realty in the 2023 top-rated ESG company list. Newsweek recently named Digital as one of America\u2019s most responsible companies for 2023 and once again, Digital is one of the JUST Capital\u2019s Most JUST Companies. In addition to these awards, given the importance of energy security, availability and sustainability, Digital remains keenly focused on supporting the development of renewable power projects. During 2022, we contracted for a total of 470 megawatts of renewable energy and in green access to the energy grid and we already added another 160 megawatts of solar power to our portfolio in 2023. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. Before I turn it over to our new CFO to review our financial results, let me introduce Matt Mercier to those of you who don\u2019t already know him. Matt joined Digital in 2006 and has been my right-hand man, helping me run Digital\u2019s finance team. Matt has been intimately involved in nearly every facet of finance at Digital from capital markets to M&A, FP&A, IR and all things global finance. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to our new CFO, Matt Mercier.\nMatt Mercier: Thank you, Andy. I am privileged to succeed Andy as CFO and humbled by the opportunity to lead an incredibly capable team. Over the years, I have had a chance to meet and spend time with many of you and I look forward to catching up with all of you over the course of the next several months at industry conferences and events that we are slated to attend. Let me jump right into our fourth quarter results. We signed a total of $117 million of new leases in the fourth quarter, highlighted by strong rebound in our 0 to 1 megawatt segment and record interconnection signings, which accounted for 40% of total bookings. Demand was geographically diverse, particularly within the greater than a megawatt segment, which saw nearly even contributions across the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions. 9 of our 10 largest deals in the quarter landed outside of North America, with strong contributions from Japan, South Africa, Latin America and Europe, demonstrating the increasingly global nature of our footprint and customer base. At the other end of the scale, somewhat in contrast to the hesitation we noted on our last call, we saw a nice bounce back within our smallest customer segment under 500 kilowatts, which delivered the second best quarterly leasing volume of 2022 at the highest average rate seen all year. Geographically, our 0 to 1 megawatt deals play to our strengths in EMEA and the Americas with EMEA setting a quarterly record for 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection bookings. Importantly, pricing on new leases signed increased for the fourth consecutive quarter in each of our 0 to 1 and greater than a megawatt segments, reflecting improving fundamentals and tightening conditions across our regions. In the fourth quarter, we experienced nearly 90% customer retention and a further reduction in churn to just 0.8%, marking the lowest level in nearly 3 years, as our customers\u2019 digital infrastructure requirements continue to increase, but the prospect of future availability is decreasing. Turning to our backlog. On Page 9, the current backlog of signed, but not yet commenced leases increased to a record $477 million at year end, principally due to the inclusion of Teraco as other signings were largely offset by commencements. The lag between signings and commencements moderated slightly in the quarter, but remained elevated relative to historical levels at nearly 15 months due to a few larger longer term leases that require build-outs. Approximately, 60% of our record backlog is slated to commence throughout this year, split fairly evenly throughout the first and second halves. Moving on to Page 10, we signed $195 million of renewal leases during the fourth quarter with pricing increases of 0.8% on a cash basis. For the full year, we renewed nearly $700 million of existing business at a 1.8% increase on a cash basis, a touch better than our upwardly revised guidance of slightly positive for 2022. Renewal rates in the fourth quarter for 0 to 1 megawatt renewals remained strong across each of our three regions and were up 4.1% overall, the strongest quarterly increase since adding interaction. As Andy referenced, we did see a 3.6% decline on renewals in the greater than a megawatt category in the quarter, entirely due to a single lease at a single asset. However, we saw a better-than-anticipated improvement in market rents and an inflection in re-leasing spreads in 2022. More importantly, market conditions improved throughout the last year and our guidance for 2023 reflects this positive trend. Turning to our results. Digital Realty delivered operating and financial performance in the fourth quarter that was largely consistent with our expectations, highlighted by improving core operating performance, progress toward enhancing our returns on investment and increased liquidity. Let\u2019s jump into the metrics on Page 11. In terms of earnings growth, we reported fourth quarter core FFO per share of $1.65, consistent with the low end of our implied guidance range for the fourth quarter and down 1% on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, given a seasonal acceleration in operating expenses, a significant uptick in interest rates and a full quarter\u2019s dilution associated with the acquisition of Teraco on August 1. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was down 1% sequentially, but was up 2% year-over-year. For the full year 2022, we reported constant currency core FFO per share of $6.91, representing 6% growth over 2021. The improvement in operating performance is best gauged by our stabilized same capital portfolio, which was challenged in the first half of the year, but improved meaningfully in the second half particularly in the fourth quarter when stripping out the noise related to FX. Focusing on top line, data center revenue growth on a constant currency basis improved steadily throughout 2022 increasing by 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter compared to a 1.8% decline in the first quarter, demonstrating the turn in our core operations that we flagged last quarter. The sequential step-up from 3Q to 4Q was largely driven by an 80 basis point improvement in occupancy as commencements outpace churn as well as the benefit of positive re-leasing spreads and growing interconnection revenues. Turning to our currency slide on Page 12. 56% of our fourth quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, with 20% in euros, 7% in British pounds, 6% in Singapore dollars and 2% in Japanese yen. The U.S. dollar reversed course from the strength we have seen throughout the first 9 months of the year, removing the headwind on reported sequential growth. Nevertheless, the dollar was meaningfully stronger than it was versus 2021, negatively impacting our reported revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth by approximately 500 basis points a piece. Turning to the balance sheet on Page 13. Our reported leverage ratio at quarter end was 6.9x, while fixed charge coverage was at 4.9x. Given the sharp recovery in the euro and the pound in the fourth quarter and the convention of how leverage is calculated with the average exchange rate used for calculated adjusted EBITDA and the spot rate used to mark our debt at year-end, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was inflated by approximately 0.2 turns using the average exchange rate to mark our debt at year-end. Our leverage would be 6.7x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Since our last call, we drew the remaining $500 million outstanding from our 2021 forward equity offering and tapped our 5.55% 2028 notes for an additional $350 million to bring the total amount raised on that bond to $900 million. Since year-end, we also closed a $740 million 2-year term loan with a 1-year extension option. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that our investment grade credit ratings were affirmed with stable outlooks by all three rating agencies since our last call. While leverage is above our historical average and our long-term target, we have bolstered our liquidity, and we intend to reduce leverage towards our long-term target over the course of 2023. Our weighted average debt maturity is over 5 years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.7%. Approximately 86% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Over 80% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have minimal near-term debt maturities with only $100 million maturing in 2023, together with a well-laddered maturity schedule. Lastly, let\u2019s turn to our guidance on Page 14. We have provided an initial core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2023 of $6.65 to $6.75, reflecting flat growth at the midpoint of the range. as the recovery in our stabilized portfolio is balanced by the impact of higher interest expense and capital recycling. Focusing in on the organic recovery we forecast for 2023, we expect Cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads to improve to greater than 3%, same capital cash NOI growth of 3% to 4% and an 80 basis point uplift in total portfolio occupancy at the midpoint of our expected range by year-end. Importantly, as Andy referenced at the outset, one of our key priorities is to further diversify and bolster our capital sources, which is geared towards increasing our capital efficiency and investment returns while reducing leverage towards our long-term target. As reflected in this guidance, throughout 2023, we expect to recycle capital from a combination of non-core dispositions, joint ventures of core assets and joint ventures of scale development in select core markets. In addition, we expect to benefit from high single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth, the retention of free cash flow and the moderation of recent currency headwinds. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ari Klein of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAri Klein: Thanks and congrats, Andy and Matt on the new role. Maybe just starting on the balance sheet, the $2 billion in asset sales and JV is targeted for the year. Can you give us some additional color on the split between the two, the types of assets, the timing and pricing is a pretty wide range? Anything you can add on that front?\nAndy Power: Thanks, Ari. This is Andy. Why don\u2019t I kick it off, and then I\u2019ll hand it to Greg on, call it, valuations and we will receive in a broader asset class. So it\u2019s $2 billion at the midpoint as our funding plan. As a reminder, this has been part of our playbook for several years. I think we\u2019ve either sold outright or joint venture close to $4 billion of assets over the last handful of years. The competition is really threefold: one called rounding therapies or completion of our non-core assets, disposition program; selling outright to joint ventures around our stabilized assets; and three, joint ventures around our development program. Rough ballpark on numbers, I would say, the non-core dispositions are probably in the 500-ish area and the other two buckets are taking up the majority of the $2 billion at the midpoint. Greg, do you want to come in on valuations and broader?\nGreg Wright: Yes. Thanks, Ari. Look, I think when you look at the \u2013 let\u2019s look at first at the stabilized JVs and the development JVs, I mean, clearly, we are seeing strong demand for those assets. The private markets have a strong bid for those assets given the quality of the assets, stability of the income stream, the creditworthiness of the customer base. And the fact, quite frankly, that\u2019s a hard asset class with strong secular demands we\u2019ve seen really a significant rotation in the data center space from private capital over the last couple of years. Not to mention strong improvement in pricing and lower vacancies in all of our major markets have really gotten investors\u2019 attention in terms of growth potential. So on that front we still think pricing has held in there. We\u2019ve seen some transactions in the market recently. There is been some smaller transactions. We\u2019re also aware of three sizable hyperscale platforms where that pricing is staying strong from what I understand. But what it tells us is that the sellers and their equity backers, who we think are sophisticated, are seeing strong value. So simply put money on the sideline is outweighing the investment opportunities. And then in terms of cap rates with respect to the non-core asset sales, I mean, clearly, they are going to be all over the place like we\u2019ve seen in the past. As you recall, over the last few years, we\u2019ve sold roughly $2 billion of these non-core assets. And at some point, we talked about having roughly $1.5 billion left. But look, I think, when you look at this, it\u2019s important to understand that many of these assets are at different stages. So cap rates will end up in a range, and you look at our range right now at 0% to 10%, and it clearly depends on specific conditions. For example, if we sell land, right, that\u2019s a zero cap rate. So there is a wide range and it depends on the asset.\nAri Klein: Got it. And then just maybe a follow-up just on the leverage, if you do all this, where do you think that gets you to exiting 2023? Thanks.\nMatt Mercier: Yes. Ari, this is Matt. Thanks for the question. So look, I think with the way that we\u2019re looking at our plan this year, as Greg and Andy mentioned, in terms of $2 billion at the midpoint for asset sales and joint ventures, really being the bulk of funding for our \u2013 the development spend that we have left. And then if you look at \u2013 we\u2019re looking at 8% to 9% growth in our adjusted EBITDA, which I think will be a big part of our deleveraging plan also for this year. So without giving a specific number, I would say we\u2019re going to be well on our way to bringing leverage back down closer to 6x by the end of the year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to touch base just on the general demand environment. It\u2019s nice to see a pickup in kind of some of the enterprise colo bookings. Maybe you could talk about what you see in the hyperscale funnel. We obviously heard some a couple of hyperscalers talking about a bit of a slowing in revenue growth, but it seems like demand remains pretty robust, and maybe you could kind of touch on that for us?\nAndy Power: Corey, do you want to hit on the demand overall first?\nCorey Dyer: Yes. I\u2019ll hit the demand overall. Thanks, first of all, for the question, Eric. Look, demand remains as strong as ever, and we\u2019re more than happy with kind of what our pipeline looks like and whether or not we\u2019ve got enough to support our demand on the hyperscale end and actually I should just say thanks for the recognition on the improvement around enterprise and still 1 megawatt. But on the enterprise, we\u2019re still seeing some really strong demand across and across the globe, really the traditional large build, but also some other interconnection needs. These hyperscalers are starting to come up for their connectivity options. It\u2019s really the advantages that our portfolio plays out for them. We\u2019re seeing that continue to grow that demand from them, utilizing our platform as a meeting place as they need to enhance their connectivity requirement. And so you\u2019re seeing that across both places. And I would tell you that you also see the merits of our relationship around the opportunity to build up from the activity perspective for them. When you think through the cost and the difficulty getting power that we have right now, these hyperscalers and our relationship with them continue to evolve. I think improved and the value that we continue to bring to them will continue to drive demand for us and see the pipeline build across all of our regions, so really happy with where we are on that as well as the come back on the enterprise as well. Thanks a lot, Eric.\nEric Luebchow: Great. And just one follow-up, I just wanted to touch base on the renewal spread that you guided to this year. Any kind of color you can provide on how those will shake out versus the greater than 1 megawatt versus the sub 1 megawatt category? And are there any markets I\u2019m big in Northern Virginia where supply is extremely limited, where you\u2019re really starting to see material rental improvements throughout the year? Thanks.\nAndy Power: Sure. I mean I think we\u2019ve seen this pendulum on pricing moving our favor now for several quarters. It started to move at the beginning of 2022, gain steam, became more broad-brushed and I think it was a combination of not only supply and demand, but our value proposition really resonating with our customer base. In a backdrop, we\u2019re quite honestly, it\u2019s never probably been harder if you bring on capacity, procure power as well as the asset plan. This is \u2013 we ended the year overall in positive territory. The less than 1 megawatt, which is becoming a much larger and larger portion of our revenue base obviously led the way. We had some positive quarters in greater than net. We had some slightly negative quarters. If you look at the greater than 1 megawatt, again, and I know we\u2019re really tied to making excuses. It takes one single deal just to pull it down, just call to 3% in that category when predominant deals are moving in positive territory. This year is the first called overall inflection to positive territory and cash mark-to-markets in several years, where we\u2019re guiding to for 2023 will be literally the best cash mark-to-market inflection in close to 10 years for our business, and it\u2019s obviously it\u2019s increasingly a dramatic amount. And I think all those things I just mentioned in terms of our value proposition as well as supply/demand moving in our favor. Ashburn is \u2013 or Northern Virginia, excuse me, is a prime example of it. This quarter, 170 million of gap, 50 almost 60 megawatts had almost nil Ashburn signings in it. And you could say last quarter did not have a super large amount either due to, call it, the tightness of that market, the coming or deliveries or bringing on more capacity. So we don\u2019t have a water statistical set of data to point to. But what we\u2019re seeing on the quotes going out, the interactions with new customers is that these rates are moving swiftly well past the hundreds into the much more firmer territory and still have ways to go in terms of runway.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJon Atkin: Thanks. So I was interested in just kind of big picture, your first conference call as CEO, any kind of principles to underscore things to contemplate and things to be putting into action around changes in overall operating practices, changes in product focus strategy. I think you already hit on capital allocation, but just any kind of big picture kind of items to call out? And then secondly, maybe for Matt, but as we look at the FFO per share guidance for the year, what are the sort of operating catalysts that you can identify that might get neutral to the upper end of that range? I think you talked about renewal spreads, but what\u2019s your cover over kind of hitting the midpoint or maybe at the midpoint based when you see your commencement pipeline just the overall pricing comes? Thanks.\nAndy Power: Thanks, John. I\u2019ll tackle the first one and then let Matt tell you how we\u2019re going to beat the guidance we just put out an hour ago in real time to that one. So I won\u2019t rehash it what was all throughout the script of what\u2019s taking place for the last 60 days. But I can tell you, in that time had \u2013 I was able to see all three of our regions a lot of time with customers, the team made it home for Valentine\u2019s Day preschool and be able to put some preliminary thoughts together on top priorities, which I outlined in the prepared remarks. But just to rehash them in a little bit greater detail. Obviously, first and foremost is demonstrably strengthening our customer value proposition. That is number one for an important reason. We\u2019ve obviously assembled in a playful collection of digital in assets over the last several years, both inorganically and organically with what we\u2019re doing in the likes of Rome, Barcelona, Israel, across Africa. Mexico City and even so harnessing the power of that platform is sort of the full customer spectrum with this diverse array of capabilities is going to be key. I firmly believe in delivering that to our customers with a global scale and consistency with true local expertise and really become that meeting place for both the enterprise and the service provider customers plus in 50 in growing metros north of 30 countries and 6 continents, all with the vein of accelerating our pricing power, internal and organic growth. Two, integrating and innovating is priority number two. We\u2019ve had years of M&A that is in the rearview mirror. Just quite frankly, I think all the critical puzzle pieces when it comes to what we do have been taken off the board and we got more than our fair share. We need to complete that integration work and complete our own digital transformation, making it easier and for internal and external customers and also continue advancing on our innovation, both on the connectivity as well as the physical infrastructure front. You\u2019ve seen at the likes of service fabric, which is just still in its infancy. And it\u2019s got many great growth states to come. You\u2019ll see that on the space and power front or things like Direct Connect, we landed in such a high consumption market with AWS just announced yesterday, along with pressing our sustainability leadership and making sure that we are lifting the bar for our industry and our asset class and doing what\u2019s right for our customers and the world we live in. All that is about \u2013 it\u2019s about elevating a data-driven approach to all facets of our business. Last but not least, again, diversify and bolster our capital sources. It\u2019s about completing the non-core dispose we\u2019ve talked about and then expanding our private capital partnership programs for both stabilized as well as development hyperscale assets with that in mind of enhancing capital efficiency, accelerating growth and returns to our digital shareholders. So that\u2019s the nuts and bolts of the 3-point plan, and I\u2019ll let Matt tackle your second question.\nJon Atkin: Yes. Maybe just quickly just quick, yes, if I could just see in the direction. On the third-party funding of the development pipeline, what are \u2013 you have not done that to my recollection recently. And I am just interested, are there particular challenges around governance? Is it the economics? Is it finally the right partner or the right projects? What are some of the kind of factors that I think it\u2019s hard on that which you might need some sort of lower expense from JV through your development pipeline?\nAndy Power: I think you had six more questions in there, Jon. But the \u2013 as Greg touched on already, there is been a dramatic rotation of capital into digital infrastructure. And there is just not enough places to put it in terms of assets built or coming right now. And we\u2019re a great partner for that. We\u2019ve had a history of partnership. We\u2019ve done versions of this in parts of the world, be it Latin America or Africa and expanding that use of capital to \u2013 or call it, with traditional markets to accelerate our capital efficiency and tap into the resources of our platform and monetize these long runways of growth we have for the hyperscalers is really the playbook. So I don\u2019t think there is \u2013 we\u2019re all about trying to piece this together any simple fiduciary in mind playbook, limiting confident games. So we\u2019re going to be looking and already have been talking to partners that are like-minded in that approach long-term investors in the space that really appreciate the value we deliver for our customers day in and day out. Maybe Matt, do you want to quickly do Jon\u2019s question because I\u2019m sure we got a few of others as well.\nMatt Mercier: Yes. So, Jon, look, I think to be brief, we feel pretty good about the fundamentals of the business. I think that we have talked about, a number of us have talked about, pricing and demand feel good. And therefore, that leads us to have strong conviction on our same capital cash NOI growth and the associated mark-to-markets that are going to help drive that. And then on top of that, in terms of continuing to lease up our development pipeline, that goes back to, again, feeling strong about where we are in the demand cycle and our ability to capture that. So, what that leaves remaining, I would say is timing around when the dispositions and the joint venture capital come to close. And maybe last, I know we talked about FX a lot last year. Right now, we are assuming that FX is neither a headwind nor a tailwind, but that\u2019s also something we can\u2019t control that could have influenced next year based on where we are in the economy.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Elias of Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.\nMichael Elias: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. My first question for you is, I mean you have talked about establishing this global interconnection platform and you have taken steps to do that with Telx, InterXion and then also Telko [ph]. As we think about the next steps for you guys, what are the most meaningful steps you could take to accelerate your traction on the interconnection front, is it adding more cloud on ramps? Is it building platform capabilities, what is that? And then my second question for you would be, in the past, you talked about doing $1.5 billion of non-core asset dispositions over the coming quarters. And now it sounds like, we are at $500 million. Just wondering what changed in terms of your view on the dispositions, is it just timing, or was the cap rate environment not supportive of you getting the valuations that you want? Thank you.\nAndy Power: So, why don\u2019t we take in reverse, so Greg, why don\u2019t you hit on the program versus what gets done in calendar 2023.\nGreg Wright: Sure. Thanks Michael. I hope you are well. Look, I want to be clear. First of all, we talked about the $1.5 billion estimate of non-core assets previously. I hope we made it clear that\u2019s what was remaining. So, we sold $2 billion. And we said whether it was a quarter or two quarters ago that we had another $1.5 billion left. We didn\u2019t suggest that we were going to sell that all over the next several quarters, and we wouldn\u2019t suggest that. But instead, we said over time. So, as you look at that $1.5 billion and how it\u2019s going to start to run off, we earmarked roughly $500 million of that for \u201823. And if you look back at our level of activity, whether it was \u201822, \u201821, \u201820, there is obviously different volumes in those years. It\u2019s never perfect. Things roll over from 1 year to the next. Quite frankly, from my perspective, whether it\u2019s May or July, I don\u2019t think it really matters to say whether it\u2019s front half of the year or the back half of the year. But look, that has not changed. And again, just as our cap rate range this year is zero to 10%, it was the same last year, and the volumes haven\u2019t changed. So again, it\u2019s \u2013 I would say we are continuing to execute upon that program that we articulated to the market a couple of years ago. Actually, it\u2019s been 3-plus years ago now. And look, I would like to think we have done a pretty good job with it. So, that\u2019s it on that front.\nAndy Power: And then, Michael, on your second question, listen, I think I look at it as a coming together of numerous puzzle pieces here. One, we have been adding the critical locations the world that our customers need for a full platform solution, grow to north of 50 metropolitan areas, 30-plus countries across six continents. And really, I would say, demonstrably leading coverage in some of the hardest parts of the world with their irreplaceable platform capabilities. Two, adding to that legacy magnetic destinations or customers and next-generation versions of those magnets. And we have seen many of those press released across multiple categories Others have less no variety, but ensuring the broadest attractiveness for our customer base based on our curation of our meeting player community. Three, has been technology to bear. Internal technology I talked about. We have been eating our own cooking when it comes to digital transformation and tying this together for our internal team members, which ultimately provides better experiences for our customers and remove the friction in their procurement and their business. And lastly, external innovation, which we have been doing with the likes of evolving from Service Exchange to ServiceFabric tying together our connectivity platforms. And then harnessing all that in one platform offering essentially that has the best of both worlds, a global platform, $50-plus billion enterprise serving the largest customers to the most local customers and doing it that scale and expertise combined with true on-the-ground local experience. But Chris can maybe add on some of the technology elements as well.\nChris Sharp: Yes. I appreciate it, Andy. And thank you, Michael, for the question. Yes, ServiceFabric, I mean it\u2019s something that we have talked about for some time now. It\u2019s a purpose-built product that enhances the customer experience. And we have been aligning with our customers to remove that complexity. And quite frankly, it facilitates an easier process of deployment for our customers. And just to underpin Andy\u2019s kind of position around the broader reach, I think one of the things that\u2019s also driving a lot of traction and value to both our enterprise and our hyperscale customers as an open ecosystem that really accelerates the growth of the enterprise and they can solve more use cases and more markets on PlatformDIGITAL. And I think that\u2019s the key element that we are highlighting. And quite frankly, you are starting to see even yesterday with the announcement of the on-ramp coming into Ashburn. That\u2019s one of the largest cloud operators aligning to one of the largest markets for Digital Realty today. And I think just to underpin a couple of metrics. That\u2019s 25 data centers with 500-plus megawatts. So, if you slow down and you think about that, the value that\u2019s going to be created and to be further created in that market is demonstrable. And so the underpinning of why we brought ServiceFabric to market where we have purpose-built software developers, really we are moving that complexity and the last piece is in investing in our customers. We don\u2019t want to compete with them. So, you will see the likes of a further set of press releases coming out with bare metals, security, it\u2019s the full culmination of what enterprises are looking to do on that hybrid IT enablement, which is core to a broad swath of customers that we are servicing today and quite frankly, that we will be servicing in the not-too-distant future.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. I just want to also extend my congratulations to Andy and Matt in the new roles. If I can ask two financial questions. And I am just looking at Slide 14 from the deck. So, the first question is if you look at the midpoint of revenue growth guidance for revenue and EBITDA, can you break out the organic portion of the growth relative on revenue, you will have energy and you will have acquisitions and divestitures kind of a mix of stuff as you have been recycling assets and investing in new ones? And then for EBITDA, just split between the organic and the M&A impact? And then the second question, as you look at the EBITDA growth and you look at the core FFO per share growth, what is holding back the piece parts holding back core FFO per share growth? And what are the opportunities for Digital Realty to unlock that in the future and get back to see a more consistent relationship of the EBITDA growth relative to what that core profit per share growth should do? Thanks.\nMatt Mercier: Sure, Mike. So, let\u2019s talk about revenue because I think that\u2019s the one that\u2019s got more \u2013 a little bit more to unpack in it for when you are looking year-over-year. So, I think as most of us know, power has been a big topic, and we expect to be \u2013 continue to be a topic. We are, like other operators seeing increases in power costs, particularly in EMEA. So, if you look at that growth, it\u2019s around 23% from 22%, the midpoint 23%, roughly 14% of that is tied to utility reimbursements correlated to higher expected power costs. And just a reminder, we expect the majority \u2013 I would say the majority of our contracts are full pass-through. And even those contracts that are not full pass-through, we have for the majority of those, we have the ability to pass on price increases, which we either have done or will do soon. So, we are not expecting any or very minimal bottom line impact to our results in \u201823 from higher power costs. So, that also \u2013 when you then net that down, you are talking about roughly speaking, 9% growth in our rental and interconnection revenue driven by the business, which also coincides with the growth in adjusted EBITDA that you will see there as you do \u2013 as you have done the math as well. In terms of then having that flow down to core FFO, look, I think part of that is what\u2019s in the plan this year is to set us up for being able to do that going forward, being able to continue to leverage the fundamentals that are continuing to improve and accrue to our favor as demonstrated by the growth of the stabilized portfolio, so that when we get our leverage down and balance sheet and a stronger position, we should be able to see that going forward in \u201824.\nMichael Rollins: And does that mean that the PowerCo deal, the recycling divestitures that you did, those are kind of a neutral impact on the revenue and EBITDA growth rates for 2023 over 2022?\nMatt Mercier: So, the \u2013 I guess I will answer that in terms of like we are \u2013 obviously, timing is a factor, but our \u2013 the disposition, call it, joint venture capital plan that we have laid out, the range takes into consideration those potential dispositions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt Niknam: Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Andy and Matt congrats both on your new roles. I had a question about the supply chain. I was just wondering with supply chain constraints loosening, are you seeing maybe some of your larger customers moving slower or less actively engaged in procuring space they need maybe several years out giving shortening lead times. And then if I could just sneak in one more. I wanted to ask about the dividend. We are talking a lot about funding the business through divestitures and whatnot. I am just wondering how maybe Matt or even Andy, you are thinking about dividend per share, optimal payout levels. And is that even a lever you would be willing to consider to pull in order maybe to help fund the business and de-lever faster? Thanks.\nAndy Power: Thank you again. So, on supply chain, the \u2013 I would say there is a loosening, but I would say we are not back to normal. And the production slots that become available seem to get gobbled up quickly. So \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say that there has been a correlation between customer buying behaviors through to our supply chains. I mean quite frankly, which is a contributor to the pricing revival has been that the demand is remaining quite firm across the board for both enterprise and hyperscale business. And it\u2019s outpacing supply and supply is \u2013 I think that disconnect is in many money markets is going to continue for some time. You have got things like power shortages, you have got municipalities, you have got permitting, you got environmental impact. There is a whole host of reasons why it\u2019s a lot harder today to bring on capacity efficiently and effectively. I think we in our platform stand out above many, given our expertise, our time doing in business, our relationships, our consistency. But it\u2019s definitely helping on the overall pricing dynamic. And I don\u2019t think I have seen a correlation to customers feeling the luxury of time when they are buying and especially the larger customers, I wouldn\u2019t say are taking a wait and see due to that whatsoever. Matt, do you want to handle the dividend question?\nMatt Mercier: Sure. I mean look, ultimately, the dividend is a Board level decision. I would \u2013 what I would add on to that is that it\u2019s \u2013 in where we are, we would \u2013 our objective is to maximize our free cash flow available to us to fund the business. And then in relation to the dividend, we want to make sure that we are paying out 100% of our taxable income. We want to make sure that we have an appropriate payout ratio. And then on top of that, we need to consider some of the some of our plans, which include potential for dispositions that could generate capital gains that could also be part of that analysis.\nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you. What, if you can \u2013 a couple of questions on Ashburn. If you could walk us through sort of the available power and kind of the assurance that you have that those big lots to be there when you need them? And then kind of a follow-up on that, are you seeing any changes in the buying patterns from your customers? Are they re-architecting deployments so that they can push more things outside of Ashburn to kind of avoid some of these issues in the future? Any of that kind of activity would be helpful.\nAndy Power: Sure. Thanks Frank. So, I mean Ashburn, I would say overall, the story remains the same of what transpired at the end of last summer. And the power \u2013 incremental power deliveries into the largest, most robust in the first market, quite frankly, in the world, is going to be restrained greatly for several years. Last quarter, I basically said I couldn\u2019t guarantee it, but I have confidence that we, working with the power providers will be able to deliver on our customer commitments, which represents the lion\u2019s share of just shy of 80 megawatts we have in our development cycle. Today, as you heard in my prepared remarks, we are good to go. We will be able to deliver for those customers, and there is no concerns about the power being available. What comes next is still to be determined. So IP, and again, similar solid answers I provide, I can\u2019t promise you this, I can\u2019t guarantee it. But I do have a strong amount of confidence that the tools in our tool kit at Digital Realty, given our experience in region, our critical and strategic landholdings, our breadth of infrastructure and our relationships will be able to be creative in terms of bringing on some incremental power deliveries in this bottleneck period. That is on top of what I would say is, obviously, Ashford is our largest market. I just looked at the 2023 expirations, while we are \u2013 we certainly have a higher retention, lower churn year expected relative to prior years. A large portion of our expected churn happens to be in Ashburn, which is a blessing given the ability to remarket that space at higher and better uses. So, all of these, but the Ashford story or saga continues, but broadly, it is greatly improving the pricing dynamic to a much more healthier environment for digital and other providers in the market. In terms of buying patterns, just tremendous amount of infrastructure across this part of Northern Virginia is not really shifting large-scale demand to other locations to any great stakes. So, folks are still clamoring for available capacity or staying where they are with us or in market, and we have not seen a title shift on this market and it will take a few years, but the Calgary is supposedly coming with new power brining project in the region from the South and the North.\nFrank Louthan: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call. I would now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power, for his closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nAndy Power: Thank you, Andrea. So, in my earlier remarks, I did mention something we didn\u2019t talk about on in the Q&A, but I do think this is an incremental tailwind of demand for our industry and Digital Realty as it relates to AI-related applications that we believe is on the precipice of driving an incremental wave of demand. As a result, I just recently asked ChatGPT, how AI would impact demand for data centers. Here is a summary of the response, and I quote, \u201cThe impact of artificial intelligence and the demand for data centers is likely to be significant in the coming years. As AI continues to gain traction and more and more businesses adopt AI-powered solutions, the demand for data storage and processing is expected to increase significantly. AI also has the potential to create new data-intensive applications such as autonomous vehicles, virtual reality and personalized medicine, further driving the demand for data centers. In short, the impact of AI on the demand for data centers is expected to be substantial and companies operating in this space are well positioned to benefit from this trend.\u201d Obviously, self-serving \u2013 but when you see some of the innovation that\u2019s playing out here and just the general media in the news, this AI trend has certainly come to fruition. And while this AI is certainly still in its development phase, we at Digital Realty, agree and excited \u2013 are excited by the forecast that ChatGPT just provided. In closing, Digital Realty had a strong 2022. We believe we are making the appropriate adjustments here and now in 2023 to position us to take advantage of the incredible opportunity that lies before us. I would like to thank all of our data team and exceptional team members of Digital Realty and everyone on this call for joining us today. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Yes. I'll hit the demand overall. Thanks, first of all, for the question, Eric. Look, demand remains as strong as ever, and we're more than happy with kind of what our pipeline looks like and whether or not we've got enough to support our demand on the hyperscale end and actually I should just say thanks for the recognition on the improvement around enterprise and still 1 megawatt. But on the enterprise, we're still seeing some really strong demand across and across the globe, really the traditional large build, but also some other interconnection needs. These hyperscalers are starting to come up for their connectivity options. It's really the advantages that our portfolio plays out for them. We're seeing that continue to grow that demand from them, utilizing our platform as a meeting place as they need to enhance their connectivity requirement. And so you're seeing that across both places. And I would tell you that you also see the merits of our relationship around the opportunity to build up from the activity perspective for them. When you think through the cost and the difficulty getting power that we have right now, these hyperscalers and our relationship with them continue to evolve. I think improved and the value that we continue to bring to them will continue to drive demand for us and see the pipeline build across all of our regions, so really happy with where we are on that as well as the come back on the enterprise as well. Thanks a lot, Eric."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Andy Power",
            "content": "Thanks, Jordan and thanks to everyone for joining our call. While my voice is probably pretty familiar to most of you, this is my first earnings call as CEO of Digital Realty. I am honored to lead Digital Realty's incredible global team and I am optimistic and excited as ever about the opportunity that lies ahead. I want to thank both the Board for their confidence in me and the support that they provide in executing our strategy and thank Bill Stein, who I first met in 2004 as we worked together on Digital's IPO for his leadership over these many years. Finally, I want to thank the numerous customers, partners, team members and shareholders for the kind words of support and encouragement that I have received over the past 2 months. When I joined Digital in 2015, we are primarily a North American scale data center provider. Since then, we have evolved the company to be a global provider of the full spectrum of scale, co-location and interconnection solutions to better serve the growing needs of our 4,000 plus customers. Today, Digital is the global data center leader with an unmatched footprint of over 300 data centers in over 50 metro areas in 28 countries on 6 continents. Globally, our portfolio comprises of more than 2.3 gigawatts of IT load and we have another 400 plus megawatts under construction. I am extremely proud of the success that we've had and the position that we are in. But now is not the time to rest on our laurels as the path that has brought us to where we are today will not get us to where we want to be. In that being, we have swiftly taken action on a few fronts. First, we quickly backfilled the role of CFO with my long-time finance partner, Matt Mercier. Matt has played a leadership role across Digital's global finance organization for well over a decade, including the successful integration of multiple platform acquisitions and the implementation of systems that will provide the foundation for our operations and evolving strategy. Second, we aligned and combined our strategy of business segments and investments team to assure that we have the right capabilities and are making the right investments in order to deliver the global meeting place for service providers and enterprises. Third, we moved to align all technology under our Chief Technology Officer, including our CISO and our recently appointed Chief Information Officer which will support the acceleration of our journey and identity as both a technology and a real estate company. Recent product launches, including service fabric, demonstrate the potential of bringing together innovation and technology to help drive our customers' growth. Lastly, we further streamlined our global operations capabilities to maximize the potential of Digital Realty's 300 plus data centers and our people under the trusted hand of a long-time digital leader with a track record of bringing global teams together. And here is what's next on the agenda in terms of the top strategic priorities. First, as depicted on Slide 3, we will demonstrably strengthen our customer value proposition. Through the continued execution of our meeting place strategy by delivering sustainable connectivity-rich solutions to our enterprise and service provider customers, which will translate into better organic growth over the medium and long-term. Along these lines, yesterday, we announced a new AWS Direct Connect on-ramp at Digital Realty's Ashburn campus, landing one of the highest consumption markets and adding coast-to-coast U.S. coverage to our robust existing portfolio of AWS Direct Connect locations across EMEA. And earlier this month, we advanced our commitment to sustainability with a new 10-year power purchase agreement for 116 megawatts of renewable energy, supporting the construction of a new solar park in Germany. Second, we are integrating and innovating our capabilities across our entire unmatched global asset portfolio and have topped the largest open network platform in the world. Many of these integration and innovation efforts will benefit both our customers as they seek to deploy new and complex workloads on the leading data center platform and our own internal team, unifying our ability to deliver value to the market. Lastly, many of you are familiar with my many fishing poles in the water mantra. And in this vein, we plan to further diversify and bolster our sources of capital in order to support our customer's rapidly growing digital infrastructure needs, while improving capital efficiency and returns for Digital Realty investors. The opportunity before us is tremendous. We have all the key ingredients at our fingertips and a long runway for growth. When I assessed the digital infrastructure landscape today, including its fundamental prospects and then how Digital Realty is positioned within this sector, I'd say the following. First, demand for our product remains quite strong and well supported by ongoing digital transformation, migration to the cloud, and the overall evolution towards centralized compute. As it goes, technology begets technology. And the growth in high-performance compute infrastructure has driven innovation that tends to spur the next wave of growth in technology that in many respects, advances productivity and hopefully, over time, driving improvement to the overall quality of our lives. While the demand drivers we have enjoyed for the last decade continue, we may now be on the precipice of the next wave of demand that will drive our sector for the next decade. For years, we have referenced new technology like artificial intelligence and machine learning as potential drivers of demand, but there have been relatively few identifiable workloads over specific infrastructure requirements tied to those specific technologies. The launch of ChatGPT 3.0 is a seemingly important milestone. Microsoft's incorporation of ChatGPT into Bing last week, Google is coming with the launch of Bard and Baidu's Ernie Bot all suggest that we are on the forefront of the broader introduction of AI, which could spawn a wave of adoption and a proliferation of use cases and ultimately drive demand for compute infrastructure at scale. This is our domain expertise. We are in the very early days of this technology and its potential and have yet to see the effects of its introduction in the data center sector, but we are well positioned to support our customers and partners and we are working diligently to understand how their requirements will evolve and making sure to incorporate these into our latest designs. Importantly, as we experience with the cloud, the advent of new technology can play out over a very extended timeframe. We have built Digital Realty with these timeframes in mind and plan to be there to support our existing and growing customer base across the globe in the future. Let's move to the quarter. Our core FFO landed within the implied guidance range that we provided last quarter as the term that is taking shape in our core portfolio continued to gain momentum. Capping off another record year of bookings, new leases signed moderated from the record we achieved in the prior quarter, but remained quite strong and were highlighted by a nice rebound in our 0 to 1 megawatt segment and record interconnection bookings. Demand was geographically broad-based with strong contributions from APAC, the Americas and EMEA. This demonstrates the breadth and momentum that we are seeing in this business, which is a reflection of our ongoing effort to deliver the meeting place for our service provider and enterprise customers. During the fourth quarter, we added 106 new customers, continuing the streak of 100 plus new logos that we have added each quarter since closing the InterXion transaction nearly 3 years ago. One of our key wins during the fourth quarter was an expansion of our relationship with Avnet, a leading global technology distributor and solution provider and a member of the Fortune 500. Avnet Integrated has standardized on PlatformDIGITAL for an initial three market deployment in Northern Virginia, Dallas and Silicon Valley. This partnership enables high-performance, cost effective computing solutions that can be deployed quickly in Digital Realty facilities globally while mitigating risk and complexity. A major global automotive manufacturer deploying internationally chose PlatformDIGITAL, leveraging Digital Realty's unrivaled global footprint and ability to manage complex deployments. 4 of the world's largest financial institutions, including 3 of the 10 largest in Europe selected PlatformDIGITAL seeking network-oriented solutions ranging from hybrid IT, trading and market data support to high-performance computing and more. A leading global asset manager and service provider leveraged Digital Realty's HPE GreenLake alliance to significantly reduce networking and IT infrastructure complexity. Importantly, pricing on new leases signed increased yet again in the fourth quarter in each of our business segments, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of price improvements in 2022. We also continue to add more CPI-based escalators with approximately 25% of the newly signed leases in the quarter containing inflation-linked increases with fixed rate escalators on the balance. We also saw another quarter of positive leasing spreads on renewals in the fourth quarter, helping to support a positive inflection for the full year 2022. While we acknowledge that the turn was driven by the strength in the 0 to 1 megawatt renewals, we are beyond the point of excuses and call us and prefer to highlight the forest rather than the trees and point to the overall inflection in market rents and re-leasing spreads that took place in 2022 as a whole. We expect market conditions to remain supportive this year and our guidance reflects a further inflection in this positive trend as Matt will lay out in a few minutes. Speaking of better pricing, I'd like to provide an update on our largest market in Northern Virginia. We have continued to work constructively with the power provider in this market and we are now pleased to be in a position to say that we fully expect to be able to deliver on the commitments that we have made to our customers within our development pipeline. So while conditions are far from business as usual in this market, we are encouraged by the progress made over the last 90 days and remain hopeful that we will continue to be able to work with a local utility provider to support the growing needs of our mutual customers. Moving on to our investment activity. During the fourth quarter, we sold a 25% interest in a data center in Frankfurt, Germany to digital core REIT. The facility was valued at nearly $500 million and the transaction generated about $150 million of proceeds for Digital Realty. We also acquired land in 5 different metros for future development, including 2 organic new market entries into Rome and Akra [ph]. Rome is one of the largest cities in Europe by population, but has been essentially ignored by international data center providers. We have acquired a parcel within 15 kilometers off the coast that will make it an ideal interconnection point for future subsea cables that land in Rome, thereby enhancing our position in the Mediterranean while serving as a connectivity hub in the middle of the country. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to reiterate my focus on ESG and share some of our recent progress with you. We were recognized by a variety of organizations for our ESG success, including for the sixth consecutive year, Digital was recognized by NAREIT with the Leader in the Light Award for Data Center sustainability. Sustainalytics recently included Digital Realty in the 2023 top-rated ESG company list. Newsweek recently named Digital as one of America's most responsible companies for 2023 and once again, Digital is one of the JUST Capital's Most JUST Companies. In addition to these awards, given the importance of energy security, availability and sustainability, Digital remains keenly focused on supporting the development of renewable power projects. During 2022, we contracted for a total of 470 megawatts of renewable energy and in green access to the energy grid and we already added another 160 megawatts of solar power to our portfolio in 2023. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. Before I turn it over to our new CFO to review our financial results, let me introduce Matt Mercier to those of you who don't already know him. Matt joined Digital in 2006 and has been my right-hand man, helping me run Digital's finance team. Matt has been intimately involved in nearly every facet of finance at Digital from capital markets to M&A, FP&A, IR and all things global finance. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to our new CFO, Matt Mercier. Thanks, Ari. This is Andy. Why don't I kick it off, and then I'll hand it to Greg on, call it, valuations and we will receive in a broader asset class. So it's $2 billion at the midpoint as our funding plan. As a reminder, this has been part of our playbook for several years. I think we've either sold outright or joint venture close to $4 billion of assets over the last handful of years. The competition is really threefold: one called rounding therapies or completion of our non-core assets, disposition program; selling outright to joint ventures around our stabilized assets; and three, joint ventures around our development program. Rough ballpark on numbers, I would say, the non-core dispositions are probably in the 500-ish area and the other two buckets are taking up the majority of the $2 billion at the midpoint. Greg, do you want to come in on valuations and broader? Corey, do you want to hit on the demand overall first? Sure. I mean I think we've seen this pendulum on pricing moving our favor now for several quarters. It started to move at the beginning of 2022, gain steam, became more broad-brushed and I think it was a combination of not only supply and demand, but our value proposition really resonating with our customer base. In a backdrop, we're quite honestly, it's never probably been harder if you bring on capacity, procure power as well as the asset plan. This is \u2013 we ended the year overall in positive territory. The less than 1 megawatt, which is becoming a much larger and larger portion of our revenue base obviously led the way. We had some positive quarters in greater than net. We had some slightly negative quarters. If you look at the greater than 1 megawatt, again, and I know we're really tied to making excuses. It takes one single deal just to pull it down, just call to 3% in that category when predominant deals are moving in positive territory. This year is the first called overall inflection to positive territory and cash mark-to-markets in several years, where we're guiding to for 2023 will be literally the best cash mark-to-market inflection in close to 10 years for our business, and it's obviously it's increasingly a dramatic amount. And I think all those things I just mentioned in terms of our value proposition as well as supply/demand moving in our favor. Ashburn is \u2013 or Northern Virginia, excuse me, is a prime example of it. This quarter, 170 million of gap, 50 almost 60 megawatts had almost nil Ashburn signings in it. And you could say last quarter did not have a super large amount either due to, call it, the tightness of that market, the coming or deliveries or bringing on more capacity. So we don't have a water statistical set of data to point to. But what we're seeing on the quotes going out, the interactions with new customers is that these rates are moving swiftly well past the hundreds into the much more firmer territory and still have ways to go in terms of runway. Thanks, John. I'll tackle the first one and then let Matt tell you how we're going to beat the guidance we just put out an hour ago in real time to that one. So I won't rehash it what was all throughout the script of what's taking place for the last 60 days. But I can tell you, in that time had \u2013 I was able to see all three of our regions a lot of time with customers, the team made it home for Valentine's Day preschool and be able to put some preliminary thoughts together on top priorities, which I outlined in the prepared remarks. But just to rehash them in a little bit greater detail. Obviously, first and foremost is demonstrably strengthening our customer value proposition. That is number one for an important reason. We've obviously assembled in a playful collection of digital in assets over the last several years, both inorganically and organically with what we're doing in the likes of Rome, Barcelona, Israel, across Africa. Mexico City and even so harnessing the power of that platform is sort of the full customer spectrum with this diverse array of capabilities is going to be key. I firmly believe in delivering that to our customers with a global scale and consistency with true local expertise and really become that meeting place for both the enterprise and the service provider customers plus in 50 in growing metros north of 30 countries and 6 continents, all with the vein of accelerating our pricing power, internal and organic growth. Two, integrating and innovating is priority number two. We've had years of M&A that is in the rearview mirror. Just quite frankly, I think all the critical puzzle pieces when it comes to what we do have been taken off the board and we got more than our fair share. We need to complete that integration work and complete our own digital transformation, making it easier and for internal and external customers and also continue advancing on our innovation, both on the connectivity as well as the physical infrastructure front. You've seen at the likes of service fabric, which is just still in its infancy. And it's got many great growth states to come. You'll see that on the space and power front or things like Direct Connect, we landed in such a high consumption market with AWS just announced yesterday, along with pressing our sustainability leadership and making sure that we are lifting the bar for our industry and our asset class and doing what's right for our customers and the world we live in. All that is about \u2013 it's about elevating a data-driven approach to all facets of our business. Last but not least, again, diversify and bolster our capital sources. It's about completing the non-core dispose we've talked about and then expanding our private capital partnership programs for both stabilized as well as development hyperscale assets with that in mind of enhancing capital efficiency, accelerating growth and returns to our digital shareholders. So that's the nuts and bolts of the 3-point plan, and I'll let Matt tackle your second question. I think you had six more questions in there, Jon. But the \u2013 as Greg touched on already, there is been a dramatic rotation of capital into digital infrastructure. And there is just not enough places to put it in terms of assets built or coming right now. And we're a great partner for that. We've had a history of partnership. We've done versions of this in parts of the world, be it Latin America or Africa and expanding that use of capital to \u2013 or call it, with traditional markets to accelerate our capital efficiency and tap into the resources of our platform and monetize these long runways of growth we have for the hyperscalers is really the playbook. So I don't think there is \u2013 we're all about trying to piece this together any simple fiduciary in mind playbook, limiting confident games. So we're going to be looking and already have been talking to partners that are like-minded in that approach long-term investors in the space that really appreciate the value we deliver for our customers day in and day out. Maybe Matt, do you want to quickly do Jon's question because I'm sure we got a few of others as well. So, why don't we take in reverse, so Greg, why don't you hit on the program versus what gets done in calendar 2023. And then, Michael, on your second question, listen, I think I look at it as a coming together of numerous puzzle pieces here. One, we have been adding the critical locations the world that our customers need for a full platform solution, grow to north of 50 metropolitan areas, 30-plus countries across six continents. And really, I would say, demonstrably leading coverage in some of the hardest parts of the world with their irreplaceable platform capabilities. Two, adding to that legacy magnetic destinations or customers and next-generation versions of those magnets. And we have seen many of those press released across multiple categories Others have less no variety, but ensuring the broadest attractiveness for our customer base based on our curation of our meeting player community. Three, has been technology to bear. Internal technology I talked about. We have been eating our own cooking when it comes to digital transformation and tying this together for our internal team members, which ultimately provides better experiences for our customers and remove the friction in their procurement and their business. And lastly, external innovation, which we have been doing with the likes of evolving from Service Exchange to ServiceFabric tying together our connectivity platforms. And then harnessing all that in one platform offering essentially that has the best of both worlds, a global platform, $50-plus billion enterprise serving the largest customers to the most local customers and doing it that scale and expertise combined with true on-the-ground local experience. But Chris can maybe add on some of the technology elements as well. Thank you again. So, on supply chain, the \u2013 I would say there is a loosening, but I would say we are not back to normal. And the production slots that become available seem to get gobbled up quickly. So \u2013 I wouldn't say that there has been a correlation between customer buying behaviors through to our supply chains. I mean quite frankly, which is a contributor to the pricing revival has been that the demand is remaining quite firm across the board for both enterprise and hyperscale business. And it's outpacing supply and supply is \u2013 I think that disconnect is in many money markets is going to continue for some time. You have got things like power shortages, you have got municipalities, you have got permitting, you got environmental impact. There is a whole host of reasons why it's a lot harder today to bring on capacity efficiently and effectively. I think we in our platform stand out above many, given our expertise, our time doing in business, our relationships, our consistency. But it's definitely helping on the overall pricing dynamic. And I don't think I have seen a correlation to customers feeling the luxury of time when they are buying and especially the larger customers, I wouldn't say are taking a wait and see due to that whatsoever. Matt, do you want to handle the dividend question? Sure. Thanks Frank. So, I mean Ashburn, I would say overall, the story remains the same of what transpired at the end of last summer. And the power \u2013 incremental power deliveries into the largest, most robust in the first market, quite frankly, in the world, is going to be restrained greatly for several years. Last quarter, I basically said I couldn't guarantee it, but I have confidence that we, working with the power providers will be able to deliver on our customer commitments, which represents the lion's share of just shy of 80 megawatts we have in our development cycle. Today, as you heard in my prepared remarks, we are good to go. We will be able to deliver for those customers, and there is no concerns about the power being available. What comes next is still to be determined. So IP, and again, similar solid answers I provide, I can't promise you this, I can't guarantee it. But I do have a strong amount of confidence that the tools in our tool kit at Digital Realty, given our experience in region, our critical and strategic landholdings, our breadth of infrastructure and our relationships will be able to be creative in terms of bringing on some incremental power deliveries in this bottleneck period. That is on top of what I would say is, obviously, Ashford is our largest market. I just looked at the 2023 expirations, while we are \u2013 we certainly have a higher retention, lower churn year expected relative to prior years. A large portion of our expected churn happens to be in Ashburn, which is a blessing given the ability to remarket that space at higher and better uses. So, all of these, but the Ashford story or saga continues, but broadly, it is greatly improving the pricing dynamic to a much more healthier environment for digital and other providers in the market. In terms of buying patterns, just tremendous amount of infrastructure across this part of Northern Virginia is not really shifting large-scale demand to other locations to any great stakes. So, folks are still clamoring for available capacity or staying where they are with us or in market, and we have not seen a title shift on this market and it will take a few years, but the Calgary is supposedly coming with new power brining project in the region from the South and the North. Thank you, Andrea. So, in my earlier remarks, I did mention something we didn't talk about on in the Q&A, but I do think this is an incremental tailwind of demand for our industry and Digital Realty as it relates to AI-related applications that we believe is on the precipice of driving an incremental wave of demand. As a result, I just recently asked ChatGPT, how AI would impact demand for data centers. Here is a summary of the response, and I quote, \u201cThe impact of artificial intelligence and the demand for data centers is likely to be significant in the coming years. As AI continues to gain traction and more and more businesses adopt AI-powered solutions, the demand for data storage and processing is expected to increase significantly. AI also has the potential to create new data-intensive applications such as autonomous vehicles, virtual reality and personalized medicine, further driving the demand for data centers. In short, the impact of AI on the demand for data centers is expected to be substantial and companies operating in this space are well positioned to benefit from this trend.\u201d Obviously, self-serving \u2013 but when you see some of the innovation that's playing out here and just the general media in the news, this AI trend has certainly come to fruition. And while this AI is certainly still in its development phase, we at Digital Realty, agree and excited \u2013 are excited by the forecast that ChatGPT just provided. In closing, Digital Realty had a strong 2022. We believe we are making the appropriate adjustments here and now in 2023 to position us to take advantage of the incredible opportunity that lies before us. I would like to thank all of our data team and exceptional team members of Digital Realty and everyone on this call for joining us today. Thank you."

            "name": "Greg Wright",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Ari. Look, I think when you look at the \u2013 let's look at first at the stabilized JVs and the development JVs, I mean, clearly, we are seeing strong demand for those assets. The private markets have a strong bid for those assets given the quality of the assets, stability of the income stream, the creditworthiness of the customer base. And the fact, quite frankly, that's a hard asset class with strong secular demands we've seen really a significant rotation in the data center space from private capital over the last couple of years. Not to mention strong improvement in pricing and lower vacancies in all of our major markets have really gotten investors' attention in terms of growth potential. So on that front we still think pricing has held in there. We've seen some transactions in the market recently. There is been some smaller transactions. We're also aware of three sizable hyperscale platforms where that pricing is staying strong from what I understand. But what it tells us is that the sellers and their equity backers, who we think are sophisticated, are seeing strong value. So simply put money on the sideline is outweighing the investment opportunities. And then in terms of cap rates with respect to the non-core asset sales, I mean, clearly, they are going to be all over the place like we've seen in the past. As you recall, over the last few years, we've sold roughly $2 billion of these non-core assets. And at some point, we talked about having roughly $1.5 billion left. But look, I think, when you look at this, it's important to understand that many of these assets are at different stages. So cap rates will end up in a range, and you look at our range right now at 0% to 10%, and it clearly depends on specific conditions. For example, if we sell land, right, that's a zero cap rate. So there is a wide range and it depends on the asset. Sure. Thanks Michael. I hope you are well. Look, I want to be clear. First of all, we talked about the $1.5 billion estimate of non-core assets previously. I hope we made it clear that's what was remaining. So, we sold $2 billion. And we said whether it was a quarter or two quarters ago that we had another $1.5 billion left. We didn't suggest that we were going to sell that all over the next several quarters, and we wouldn't suggest that. But instead, we said over time. So, as you look at that $1.5 billion and how it's going to start to run off, we earmarked roughly $500 million of that for \u201823. And if you look back at our level of activity, whether it was \u201822, \u201821, \u201820, there is obviously different volumes in those years. It's never perfect. Things roll over from 1 year to the next. Quite frankly, from my perspective, whether it's May or July, I don't think it really matters to say whether it's front half of the year or the back half of the year. But look, that has not changed. And again, just as our cap rate range this year is zero to 10%, it was the same last year, and the volumes haven't changed. So again, it's \u2013 I would say we are continuing to execute upon that program that we articulated to the market a couple of years ago. Actually, it's been 3-plus years ago now. And look, I would like to think we have done a pretty good job with it. So, that's it on that front."

            "name": "Chris Sharp",
            "content": "Yes. I appreciate it, Andy. And thank you, Michael, for the question. Yes, ServiceFabric, I mean it's something that we have talked about for some time now. It's a purpose-built product that enhances the customer experience. And we have been aligning with our customers to remove that complexity. And quite frankly, it facilitates an easier process of deployment for our customers. And just to underpin Andy's kind of position around the broader reach, I think one of the things that's also driving a lot of traction and value to both our enterprise and our hyperscale customers as an open ecosystem that really accelerates the growth of the enterprise and they can solve more use cases and more markets on PlatformDIGITAL. And I think that's the key element that we are highlighting. And quite frankly, you are starting to see even yesterday with the announcement of the on-ramp coming into Ashburn. That's one of the largest cloud operators aligning to one of the largest markets for Digital Realty today. And I think just to underpin a couple of metrics. That's 25 data centers with 500-plus megawatts. So, if you slow down and you think about that, the value that's going to be created and to be further created in that market is demonstrable. And so the underpinning of why we brought ServiceFabric to market where we have purpose-built software developers, really we are moving that complexity and the last piece is in investing in our customers. We don't want to compete with them. So, you will see the likes of a further set of press releases coming out with bare metals, security, it's the full culmination of what enterprises are looking to do on that hybrid IT enablement, which is core to a broad swath of customers that we are servicing today and quite frankly, that we will be servicing in the not-too-distant future."

            "name": "Matt Mercier",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy. I am privileged to succeed Andy as CFO and humbled by the opportunity to lead an incredibly capable team. Over the years, I have had a chance to meet and spend time with many of you and I look forward to catching up with all of you over the course of the next several months at industry conferences and events that we are slated to attend. Let me jump right into our fourth quarter results. We signed a total of $117 million of new leases in the fourth quarter, highlighted by strong rebound in our 0 to 1 megawatt segment and record interconnection signings, which accounted for 40% of total bookings. Demand was geographically diverse, particularly within the greater than a megawatt segment, which saw nearly even contributions across the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions. 9 of our 10 largest deals in the quarter landed outside of North America, with strong contributions from Japan, South Africa, Latin America and Europe, demonstrating the increasingly global nature of our footprint and customer base. At the other end of the scale, somewhat in contrast to the hesitation we noted on our last call, we saw a nice bounce back within our smallest customer segment under 500 kilowatts, which delivered the second best quarterly leasing volume of 2022 at the highest average rate seen all year. Geographically, our 0 to 1 megawatt deals play to our strengths in EMEA and the Americas with EMEA setting a quarterly record for 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection bookings. Importantly, pricing on new leases signed increased for the fourth consecutive quarter in each of our 0 to 1 and greater than a megawatt segments, reflecting improving fundamentals and tightening conditions across our regions. In the fourth quarter, we experienced nearly 90% customer retention and a further reduction in churn to just 0.8%, marking the lowest level in nearly 3 years, as our customers' digital infrastructure requirements continue to increase, but the prospect of future availability is decreasing. Turning to our backlog. On Page 9, the current backlog of signed, but not yet commenced leases increased to a record $477 million at year end, principally due to the inclusion of Teraco as other signings were largely offset by commencements. The lag between signings and commencements moderated slightly in the quarter, but remained elevated relative to historical levels at nearly 15 months due to a few larger longer term leases that require build-outs. Approximately, 60% of our record backlog is slated to commence throughout this year, split fairly evenly throughout the first and second halves. Moving on to Page 10, we signed $195 million of renewal leases during the fourth quarter with pricing increases of 0.8% on a cash basis. For the full year, we renewed nearly $700 million of existing business at a 1.8% increase on a cash basis, a touch better than our upwardly revised guidance of slightly positive for 2022. Renewal rates in the fourth quarter for 0 to 1 megawatt renewals remained strong across each of our three regions and were up 4.1% overall, the strongest quarterly increase since adding interaction. As Andy referenced, we did see a 3.6% decline on renewals in the greater than a megawatt category in the quarter, entirely due to a single lease at a single asset. However, we saw a better-than-anticipated improvement in market rents and an inflection in re-leasing spreads in 2022. More importantly, market conditions improved throughout the last year and our guidance for 2023 reflects this positive trend. Turning to our results. Digital Realty delivered operating and financial performance in the fourth quarter that was largely consistent with our expectations, highlighted by improving core operating performance, progress toward enhancing our returns on investment and increased liquidity. Let's jump into the metrics on Page 11. In terms of earnings growth, we reported fourth quarter core FFO per share of $1.65, consistent with the low end of our implied guidance range for the fourth quarter and down 1% on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, given a seasonal acceleration in operating expenses, a significant uptick in interest rates and a full quarter's dilution associated with the acquisition of Teraco on August 1. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was down 1% sequentially, but was up 2% year-over-year. For the full year 2022, we reported constant currency core FFO per share of $6.91, representing 6% growth over 2021. The improvement in operating performance is best gauged by our stabilized same capital portfolio, which was challenged in the first half of the year, but improved meaningfully in the second half particularly in the fourth quarter when stripping out the noise related to FX. Focusing on top line, data center revenue growth on a constant currency basis improved steadily throughout 2022 increasing by 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter compared to a 1.8% decline in the first quarter, demonstrating the turn in our core operations that we flagged last quarter. The sequential step-up from 3Q to 4Q was largely driven by an 80 basis point improvement in occupancy as commencements outpace churn as well as the benefit of positive re-leasing spreads and growing interconnection revenues. Turning to our currency slide on Page 12. 56% of our fourth quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, with 20% in euros, 7% in British pounds, 6% in Singapore dollars and 2% in Japanese yen. The U.S. dollar reversed course from the strength we have seen throughout the first 9 months of the year, removing the headwind on reported sequential growth. Nevertheless, the dollar was meaningfully stronger than it was versus 2021, negatively impacting our reported revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth by approximately 500 basis points a piece. Turning to the balance sheet on Page 13. Our reported leverage ratio at quarter end was 6.9x, while fixed charge coverage was at 4.9x. Given the sharp recovery in the euro and the pound in the fourth quarter and the convention of how leverage is calculated with the average exchange rate used for calculated adjusted EBITDA and the spot rate used to mark our debt at year-end, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was inflated by approximately 0.2 turns using the average exchange rate to mark our debt at year-end. Our leverage would be 6.7x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Since our last call, we drew the remaining $500 million outstanding from our 2021 forward equity offering and tapped our 5.55% 2028 notes for an additional $350 million to bring the total amount raised on that bond to $900 million. Since year-end, we also closed a $740 million 2-year term loan with a 1-year extension option. It's also worth mentioning that our investment grade credit ratings were affirmed with stable outlooks by all three rating agencies since our last call. While leverage is above our historical average and our long-term target, we have bolstered our liquidity, and we intend to reduce leverage towards our long-term target over the course of 2023. Our weighted average debt maturity is over 5 years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.7%. Approximately 86% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Over 80% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have minimal near-term debt maturities with only $100 million maturing in 2023, together with a well-laddered maturity schedule. Lastly, let's turn to our guidance on Page 14. We have provided an initial core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2023 of $6.65 to $6.75, reflecting flat growth at the midpoint of the range. as the recovery in our stabilized portfolio is balanced by the impact of higher interest expense and capital recycling. Focusing in on the organic recovery we forecast for 2023, we expect Cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads to improve to greater than 3%, same capital cash NOI growth of 3% to 4% and an 80 basis point uplift in total portfolio occupancy at the midpoint of our expected range by year-end. Importantly, as Andy referenced at the outset, one of our key priorities is to further diversify and bolster our capital sources, which is geared towards increasing our capital efficiency and investment returns while reducing leverage towards our long-term target. As reflected in this guidance, throughout 2023, we expect to recycle capital from a combination of non-core dispositions, joint ventures of core assets and joint ventures of scale development in select core markets. In addition, we expect to benefit from high single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth, the retention of free cash flow and the moderation of recent currency headwinds. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? Yes. Ari, this is Matt. Thanks for the question. So look, I think with the way that we're looking at our plan this year, as Greg and Andy mentioned, in terms of $2 billion at the midpoint for asset sales and joint ventures, really being the bulk of funding for our \u2013 the development spend that we have left. And then if you look at \u2013 we're looking at 8% to 9% growth in our adjusted EBITDA, which I think will be a big part of our deleveraging plan also for this year. So without giving a specific number, I would say we're going to be well on our way to bringing leverage back down closer to 6x by the end of the year. Yes. So, Jon, look, I think to be brief, we feel pretty good about the fundamentals of the business. I think that we have talked about, a number of us have talked about, pricing and demand feel good. And therefore, that leads us to have strong conviction on our same capital cash NOI growth and the associated mark-to-markets that are going to help drive that. And then on top of that, in terms of continuing to lease up our development pipeline, that goes back to, again, feeling strong about where we are in the demand cycle and our ability to capture that. So, what that leaves remaining, I would say is timing around when the dispositions and the joint venture capital come to close. And maybe last, I know we talked about FX a lot last year. Right now, we are assuming that FX is neither a headwind nor a tailwind, but that's also something we can't control that could have influenced next year based on where we are in the economy. Sure, Mike. So, let's talk about revenue because I think that's the one that's got more \u2013 a little bit more to unpack in it for when you are looking year-over-year. So, I think as most of us know, power has been a big topic, and we expect to be \u2013 continue to be a topic. We are, like other operators seeing increases in power costs, particularly in EMEA. So, if you look at that growth, it's around 23% from 22%, the midpoint 23%, roughly 14% of that is tied to utility reimbursements correlated to higher expected power costs. And just a reminder, we expect the majority \u2013 I would say the majority of our contracts are full pass-through. And even those contracts that are not full pass-through, we have for the majority of those, we have the ability to pass on price increases, which we either have done or will do soon. So, we are not expecting any or very minimal bottom line impact to our results in \u201823 from higher power costs. So, that also \u2013 when you then net that down, you are talking about roughly speaking, 9% growth in our rental and interconnection revenue driven by the business, which also coincides with the growth in adjusted EBITDA that you will see there as you do \u2013 as you have done the math as well. In terms of then having that flow down to core FFO, look, I think part of that is what's in the plan this year is to set us up for being able to do that going forward, being able to continue to leverage the fundamentals that are continuing to improve and accrue to our favor as demonstrated by the growth of the stabilized portfolio, so that when we get our leverage down and balance sheet and a stronger position, we should be able to see that going forward in \u201824. So, the \u2013 I guess I will answer that in terms of like we are \u2013 obviously, timing is a factor, but our \u2013 the disposition, call it, joint venture capital plan that we have laid out, the range takes into consideration those potential dispositions. Sure. I mean look, ultimately, the dividend is a Board level decision. I would \u2013 what I would add on to that is that it's \u2013 in where we are, we would \u2013 our objective is to maximize our free cash flow available to us to fund the business. And then in relation to the dividend, we want to make sure that we are paying out 100% of our taxable income. We want to make sure that we have an appropriate payout ratio. And then on top of that, we need to consider some of the some of our plans, which include potential for dispositions that could generate capital gains that could also be part of that analysis."

I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today on the call are CEO, Bill Stein; and President and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer, also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to GAAP net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. One important item to note this quarter, while Teraco's results are consolidated into our financial statements since closing on August 1, we have excluded the platform's contribution from leasing backlog and other portfolio statistics that will be cited on this call and within our third quarter earnings materials. Before I turn the call over to Bill, let me offer a few key takeaways from our third quarter. First, we achieved another quarter of record bookings, led by robust demand within the greater than a megawatt segment. Second, the signs of improvement in our core portfolio continued to emerge in the quarter with 120 basis point sequential improvement and base data center revenues on a constant currency basis. Third, with the closing on our investment in Teraco, we cemented our position as a leading provider of colocation and connectivity in South Africa. And lastly, our management team guided by decades of experience remains focused on navigating the current environment and maximizing the opportunity that lies before us. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein.\nArthur Stein: Thank you, Jordan, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. The world has experienced significant change so far in 2022, and Digital Realty is adapting to that change. Our business continues to be levered to powerful long-term secular demand trends, broadly driven by ongoing digital transformation and the growth in IT and data as our record leasing results underscore. We also have an unmatched global operating footprint that is supported by a strong development pipeline that allows us to capture opportunities wherever they may emerge. As you all understand, global capital markets have become extraordinarily volatile and interest rates have risen sharply from historic lows to levels that we have not seen since 2008. At the same time, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against the euro to levels not seen in nearly 20 years. While you've had to look back over 30 years to find the last time the dollar was this elevated against the pound or the yen. This volatility is being driven by a number of factors from a global economy emerging from the pandemic to the war in Ukraine and of course, the heightened resolve of central bankers to tap down on elevated global inflation. And while the underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong and fortune can indeed favor the brave, experience has taught us that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. And we feel that it is most prudent today to adapt to the current environment by: one, prioritizing and sharpening the lens through which we view new investments to ensure that we are focused on the most strategic transactions that offer the highest potential risk-adjusted returns; two, by pressing our newly gained advantage on pricing and improving our internal growth profile and the longer-term durability of our cash flows; and three, by enhancing liquidity to ensure that we have the capital to meet the commitments that we have made to our customers while maintaining a comfortable cushion. With over 300 data centers around the world and a revenue base of over $4.5 billion, Digital Realty remains focused on how to best position ourselves for the long run. Our third quarter results were strong with a record $176 million of new bookings, making the third time in the past 4 quarters that our bookings have exceeded $150 million. Core FFO per share was $1.67 despite stiff FX and interest rate headwinds. On a constant currency basis, we see evidence of the turn that is starting to take shape in our core portfolio.  Digital Realty's global platform enables us to capture demand wherever it emerges. North America was the standout this quarter with our largest deals landing in the region. Multinational companies are using platform digital to enable digital transformation across multiple regions and metros globally. A good example of this is a large multisite enterprise build-to-suit transaction signed with a top 5 financial services company that was inked in the quarter. Looking ahead, sales activity remains healthy as the secular trends driving data center demand remain in place. Enterprises continue their digital transformation with a growing preference for hybrid cloud architecture while cloud and connectivity providers continue to expand their infrastructure to better serve their customers around the world. But the world is changing. We are seeing sales cycle lengthen and global uncertainty extends decision times. Importantly, we are pushing prices higher to reflect tightening supply and rising costs. Admittedly, some of the deals this quarter have been in process for many months and do not fully reflect today's environment. Today, new leases are being priced to reflect current market conditions. And while this will likely be in an iterative process, we expect the strong secular trends driving demand toward third-party data centers to continue for years to come. Andy will provide further color on our results and our outlook shortly. During the third quarter, we successfully completed the acquisition of a majority interest in Teraco, a leading carrier and cloud-neutral data center and interconnection services provider in South Africa. Teraco is a gem. With 7 data centers across 3 metros and robust interconnectivity including more than 22,000 cross connects, 7 cloud on-ramps and direct access to 7 subsea cables with more on the way. Teraco co has plenty of room to expand and is expected to generate some of the best growth within our portfolio. Teraco uniquely enhances our position in EMEA, complementing our existing operations in Eastern Africa through iColo, Western Africa through Medallion and in Europe and the Mediterranean with Interxion, Altus IT, Lamda Helix and our newest JV with Mine in Israel. These are all highly connected assets that leverage subsea cable landing and brings the world closer together, linking Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Consistent with that strategy, we recently acquired land on the Greek island of Crete to create an interconnection hub in the Eastern Mediterranean to complement our existing hub in Marseille, along with developing hubs in Barcelona and Israel, which will feed additional traffic into Greece, the Balkans, Turkey and Northern Africa. We expect that this highly differentiated project will generate strong double-digit returns while enhancing the value of our existing facilities in the region. Moving to our dispositions in the quarter. We sold a noncore mixed-use data center property in Dallas for $206 million and reached an agreement with digital core REIT to sell a 25% interest in our Frankfurt data center campus for $140 million with an option to acquire up to 90% of the same campus plus a 90% share of 1 of our Dallas data centers in a larger transaction valued at approximately $750 million. Both transactions are subject to unitholder approval with a vote expected for November. Funding organic new market entry through the disposition of stabilized facilities is our preferred source of capital. It enables us to leverage platform digital to capitalize on value creation opportunities and harvest capital once those facilities have stabilized. We also favor joint ventures like the one in Israel, where we leverage the local knowledge and expertise of our partner and pair that with PlatformDIGITAL to expand our global footprint and to better serve our customers. Before turning it over to Andy, I'd like to update you on our ESG success shown on Page 3 of our earnings presentation. We were honored to be recognized by GRESB as the sector leader for technology and science category in the Americas for the second consecutive year, maintaining our 5-star rating from this leading investor-driven ESG benchmarking organization. We are proud of our ESG-related efforts. And while the awards and recognition are nice, we are focused on ESG because our customers demand it, and because quite simply, it is the right thing to do. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.\nAndrew Power: Thank you, Bill. Turning to Page 5. As Bill noted, we signed record bookings of $176 million, with a $13 million contribution from interconnection during the third quarter, excluding the results from Teraco. The greater than a megawatt business in the Americas was the big driver of this quarter's record leasing at nearly $100 million signed. Sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection accounted for 24% of the record quarterly bookings while the shell portion of a large multisite enterprise build-to-suit deal fell into our other category. Importantly, as we've discussed, we have meaningfully shifted our cadence toward further insulating our portfolio from the effects of inflation through the addition of CPI-based escalators into our new leases. While more than 95% of our portfolio includes rent escalation causes, less than 20% are specifically tied to CPI, while the balance are fixed. And our highest leasing volume quarter ever, we were able to achieve CPI-based escalators on 40% of the leases signed in the quarter, which demonstrates our resolve and our customers' acknowledgment of this important factor. The balance of our leases signed in 3Q include fixed rent escalators. Moving on to markets. In North America, Portland and Dallas were particularly strong with large deals landing in each of those metros, while demand in Northern Virginia also remained high. In EMEA, totals were consistent with expectations with particular strength in Paris. While San Paolo led in LatAm, and Osaka led the APAC region. These deals drove additional starts within our development pipeline, which grew to over 400 megawatts, but is also now more than 60% pre-leased mitigating much of the risk related to this capital spend and providing significant visibility into future revenue. As Bill touched on in his remarks, we signed 4 leases in the quarter with a large multinational financial services customer that has fully embarked upon its digital transformation journey. This large multi-site, multi-market build-to-suit transaction drove the upside in our greater than 1 megawatt North America leasing and also served to increase our development pipeline sequentially while reducing our anticipated yields. Importantly, this deal is structured as a yield on cost development supported by a long-term triple net lease to a strong investment-grade credit with fixed escalators, which serves to insulate Digital Realty from construction costs, and operating expense volatility. Excluding this transaction, our development life cycle average yield will be closer to the yield we presented last quarter. During the third quarter, we added another 103 new customers, continuing the 100-plus new logos we've added each quarter since the closing of the Interxion transaction 2.5 years ago. Key customer wins in the quarter include a Global 2000 luxury goods maker is expanding its capabilities on PlatformDIGITAL to add data exchange with its strategic cloud providers to its existing capabilities. A Global 2000 multinational technology manufacturer is expanding its hybrid IT capability in multiple metros across 2 global regions with PlatformDIGITAL. A Global 2000 retailer is rationalizing its data centers and joining Platform Digital as part of its hybrid IT architecture to have greater proximity to a key cloud service provider while enhancing both performance and ecosystem benefits. A Global 100 top insurance company is rationalizing its data centers and moving to PlatformDIGITAL to gain strong access to 2 leading cloud service providers. Landing with us as a new logo in 4Q '21, a Global 2000 U.S. energy provider expanded into 2 more metros with Digital Realty as it continues to rearchitect its network as part of a long-term hybrid IT transformation. And a Global 2000 aerospace and defense contractor is rationalizing its data center portfolio while supporting the re-architecture of its network and interconnecting with cloud providers on PlatformDIGITAL.  Turning to our backlog on Page 7. The current backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases grew to $466 million by quarter end as our record signings were partially offset by $90 million of commencement. The lag between signings and commencements moved up to 17 months for the leases signed in the third quarter due to the large multisite enterprise build-to-suit deal discussed by Bill a moment ago. Excluding this deal, our sign to commence live was under 8 months, consistent with our historical average. Approximately 25% of our record backlog is slated to commence in the fourth quarter. While another 45% will commence in 2023, split fairly evenly throughout the first and second halfs of next year. Moving on to Page 8. We signed $154 million of renewal leases during the third quarter that rolled down 0.5% on a cash basis. Renewal rates for 01-megawatt renewals were positive across each region and up 3.1% overall, demonstrating the criticality of these deployments and the differentiation of our facilities. This product segment has historically experienced steadily positive renewal rates and cash renewal rates have steadily increased throughout this year. After two consecutive 3-plus percent bumps in 1Q and 2Q, the cash mark-to-market was weighed down by the greater than 1 megawatt segment in the third quarter. Despite this result, we are confident in a slightly positive cash releasing spread for the full year 2022. Importantly, we are encouraged by the general trajectory of market rents across our product line. We expect that the dislocation and volatility of capital markets coupled with rising costs and the reduced availability of power in several markets, including the world's largest market, Loudon County, Virginia, is constraining the ability to bring on new data center capacity despite the secular demand for data center infrastructure. With regard to power delivery in Northern Virginia, we are continuing to work with the primary power provider to ensure appropriate allocations with an acute focus on capacity needed to support our customers in this market. We have an incredibly unique footprint in Loudon and a set of capabilities that we are working to tap into in order to take advantage of this backdrop of continuing tightening market fundamentals. In terms of operating performance, total portfolio occupancy rebounded by 80 basis points sequentially, driven by the strong commencements. These improvements in our occupancy come despite our active intention to grow our global colocation inventory in order to meet the growing demand of our expanding customer base. Same capital cash NOI growth fell 7.3% in the third quarter, negatively impacted by another 480 basis point FX headwind. This is disappointing on the surface but once the noise is removed, the improving operating picture that we have been painting starts to emerge. On a constant currency basis, data center operating revenue, rental revenue interconnection was actually up 10 basis points year-over-year and improved by 120 basis points sequentially, demonstrating the turn that has started to take hold in our core operations. The sequential step-up was supported by a 50 basis point occupancy improvement over the second quarter, along with the benefits of the positive releasing spreads we've seen year-to-date. Turning to our risk mitigation strategies on Page 9. 56% of our third quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, with 21% in euros, 6% in Singapore dollars, 5% in British pounds and 2% in Japanese yen. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen over the last few months, negatively impacting same capital revenue growth by 530 basis points and NOI growth by 480 basis points year-over-year, as shown in our constant currency analysis on Page 10. This strong headwind contrasts with typical FX impacts of 50 to 100 basis points in either direction during the periods with more normal FX volatility. While the outsized depreciation of the euro this year has been a major driver of the headwinds for our P&L, it also represents the lion's share of our development pipeline. To be clear, we are operating and then investing locally rather than repatriating proceeds into U.S. dollars. Our operations, investment pipeline and funding in locally-denominated debt serve as a natural hedge. As we discussed on our call last quarter, given the growth of our global portfolio, along with heightened FX volatility, we took a closer look at our hedging strategy during the third quarter and executed additional swaps to mitigate our remaining FX exposure. In August, we executed a U.S. dollar to euro currency swap against an existing $1 billion tranche of 2027 notes outstanding. And in late September, alongside our USD 550 million bond, we swapped those borrowings in the euro and Japanese yen, which also reduced the effective interest rate on those 5-year notes to just 3% versus the 5.55% coupon achieved via the offering. In terms of earnings growth, we reported third quarter core FFO per share of $1.67, which is 1% higher on a year-over-year basis and 3% lower sequentially due to the negative impact of FX, higher interest and operating expenses and the initial dilution we incurred from the closure of Teraco, which is consistent with the forecast we provided last quarter. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was 6% higher year-over-year but down $0.01 sequentially. The reported core FFO underperformance versus our prior expectation for the quarter was purely a function of greater-than-expected FX headwinds. Looking forward, we expect core FFO per share will remain under pressure from stiff FX headwinds given the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, though this should be offset by core growth. As you can see from the bridge on Page 11, we expect FFO will remain flat sequentially in the fourth quarter as FX and interest expense headwinds are partly balanced by NOI growth. Accordingly, we've adjusted our underlying guidance assumptions to reflect the continued pressures of FX and interest rates. We are also updating our core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2022 to $6.70 to $6.75, reflecting a $0.075 per share adjustment at the midpoint of the range. Importantly, due to the sharper-than-expected move in interest rates since our last call, we are reducing our constant currency core FFO per share range by $0.025 at the midpoint to a new range of $6.95 to $7 for 2022, which represents approximately 7% growth over 2021. We expect currency headwinds could represent a 400 to 500 basis point drag on full year 2020 revenue and core FFO per share growth. A review of our leverage is on Page 12. Our reported leverage ratio at quarter end was 6.7x, while fixed charge coverage is at 5.5x. We drew $400 million down from last September's forward equity offering as part of our funding for Teraco. So pro forma for the remaining forward equity and adjusting for our full quarter's contribution from Teraco, our leverage ratio drops to 6.4x while pro forma fixed charge coverage is 5.7x. While leverage is above our historical average, we have bolstered our liquidity to ensure that we have the capital in hand to fund our committed development spend throughout the end of next year and maintain a comfortable cushion. Since our last earnings call, we have raised or received commitments for approximately $2 billion of debt capital at an effective blended average of just over 3%. These include more than $650 million of term loan commitments received subsequent to quarter end. With cash and forward equity outstanding totaling more than $700 million, we have increased our current available liquidity to approximately $3 billion. We expect to see leverage moderate back towards our longer-term target over time through a combination of noncore dispositions, joint ventures of core holdings, lease-up of available capacity and the retention of free cash flow. As Bill discussed, the current capital markets environment and increased cost of capital have led us to sharpen our lens and prioritize new investments to those that are the highest strategic merit and offer the best potential risk-adjusted returns. Our financial strategy includes a diverse menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost of our liabilities. The execution against this financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital and enables us to fund our strategic objectives. As you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is about 5.5 years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.4%. Approximately 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. More than 80% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have no meaningful near-term debt maturities and a well-laddered debt maturity schedule. We repaid the remainder of our 2022 debt earlier this month and have only a small Swiss bond maturing in 2023. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Jon Atkin of RBC.\nJonathan Atkin: I wondered if it's possible to kind of frame the magnitude and the timing of the CapEx associated with all the leasing that you did during the quarter. And then maybe to kind of bring it home to the $3 billion in liquidity that you talked about sources of funding that incremental CapEx.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Jon. So if you look at our development life cycle, it kind of lays it out region by region, and it has called, let's say, starts with a, call it, just $3.8 billion of, call it, approved projects. And that includes all the leases signed during the last quarter as well as some projects that are not leased because it's only 60% pre-leased, roughly. If you kind of break that down over the next, call it, 5 quarters, you're spending about $2.7 billion of that. Again, that is not all contractual spend. Only a portion of that is tied to customer contracts. So if you exclude the, call it, assumptive or speculative spend, you call it closer to $2 billion. The $3 billion of liquidity I mentioned, that includes, call it, really 2 parts, $1.7 billion of cash and revolver capacity and then $1.2 billion of the undrawn equity forward and new U.S. dollar term loan commitments in hand. So that total just about $3 billion of contractual committed committee liquidity right now. That is everything we have at this minute. We're also continuing with our normal game plan of noncore dispositions, call it $1.5 billion over several quarters as well as joint ventures on core holdings. So we feel pretty good about being able to fund this attractive growth for our customers.\nJonathan Atkin: And then secondly, on the 17 month metric that you mentioned in the earnings release and in the script about kind of essentially book-to-bill. And then putting that in the context of what Bill said about elongated sales cycles, how much of that is due to perhaps the lack of server availability on part of the customers or from your standpoint, delays in power procurement or ability to construct just given supply chain which is facing data center infrastructure?\nAndrew Power: I would parse those in 2 topics and, I'd say, coincidentally look like they're connected. What the long -- the extended book-to-bill really was our largest transaction was with a large multinational financial services customer. It's been in the works for -- really since the very beginning of this year. It's across 4 different locations. It's incredible. It's very flatter to be part of their digital transformation, which is really going to cloud in a hybrid IT fashion. And given those projects are literally at land stage, we're designing to their specifications. That is what's extending that out. And if you carve those 4 transactions with that customer out, you really had a normal book-to-bill cycle. I think I'll let Bill comment on what he referenced in terms of, call it, what we're seeing in terms of the business in terms of some elongated sales cycle though.\nArthur Stein: It's a little bit elongated, Jon. But as Andy said, if you were to strip out the 4 build-to-suits that are in this quarter, the effect on the book-to-bill this quarter would be minimal.\nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Have you guys increased pricing on cross-connects as well? And if so, what is sort of the -- how much have you raised that? And what percentage are on the new pricing? And then going forward, you're fairly creative as far as the getting the effective rate on your financing down close to 3%. Is that -- what sort of expectation do you have, what sort of financing you can get going forward? Do you think you can keep it around that level?\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Frank. Maybe Chris and I M&A cross-connect pricing and pricing dynamic overall. I would remind you, we are essentially have been putting together some critical puzzle pieces through our M&A and have been aligning our cross-connect pricing across various regions, including the latest and greatest addition to PlatformDIGITAL with Teraco, the leading platform across South Africa. So it's not necessarily a uniform step shift, but we have been investing in that platform, bringing more value to our customers and driving commensurate increases in prices. But Chris, anything you want to add on cross-connect prices or data points there?\nChristopher Sharp: Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question, Frank. A couple of points, right? We definitely take a customer-led approach on aligning value to the overall reach and overall offering they're able to provide them. I would echo Andy sentiment that like in the Westin Building, I think we've talked about it a couple of quarters ago, where we're driving that consistency of our overall interconnection products and capabilities in that market to really just delivering more value and you're going to start to see more revenue pick up in the next year on being able to uniformly bring that into the overall PlatformDIGITAL delivery capabilities. I'd say this next piece is more probably pointing to your question in EMEA, right, where we've been talking for some time now about increasing those prices and that's been performing great. And I think that's something that you'll continue to see growing, which is represented in the interconnection numbers that we put up this last quarter. So you'll see that performing I think, much better over the course of the next year here.\nAndrew Power: And just not to leave you without any numbers in terms of rate or growth increases. I mean the ranges are pretty wide, but it's anywhere from called low mid-single digits to some -- definitely some outliers that are in the teens at the very least. I think the overall pricing environment is probably even more relevant to the heart of your question, though. We are continuing to see improving pricing power across our platform, whether it's in our, let's call it, less than megawatt enterprise colocation footprint. We're, I'd say, call it, 10% to 15% sequential pricing changes in many markets and also seeing similar type of increases in the larger plus than a megawatt as well. In relation to your second question, I mean, big kudos to the Digital Realty Finance Capital Markets team, I mean, really call it staying nimble and acting fast in a volatile environment and really bringing together, call it, what is the $2 billion of capital in, call it, 60 days. We've also been tapping into call it incremental FX hedgings, given the more volatile FX world and a more global business. And we've been able to, call it, get our cost of capital, call it, roughly 3%. Let don't I'm not sure that's a permanent number where we go from here. We've had, call it, the most rapid increase in the U.S. Treasury in 40 years or Fed funds rates in 40 years. But we're definitely using all the tools in our toolkit to maximize those menu of options and drive down the cost of our capital.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dave Barden of Bank of America.\nDavid Barden: I guess first question would be, Andy, can you walk us through how this bubble of lease renewals in 2023 is going to work out? I guess, on supplement Page 23, 15% of annualized rent is coming due next year. You've had some success with positive lease renewing spreads year-to-date and be helpful to kind of get some comfort level there. And then I guess the follow-up would be, I think we were hoping to get some comfort on what your understanding with Dominion and Northern Virginia energy availability would be in the development pipeline on a go-forward basis? And if you could kind of share what your latest thinking is there.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Dave. Maybe I'll take them in reverse order because I think the second question ties a little bit into your first question. So as a broader reminder, literally, I think it was 90 days ago to the day, we got the, call it, the newer news from Dominion on the pinch point in Eastern Loudon County on power deliveries. I can tell you we're a regular dialogue with the power company on a path forward. But I would say also that the essence of the initial messaging remains intact that there's just going to be significantly less power provided to ongoing development in this region until 2026. The feedback we've received is that 2026, which should be back to more normal practices. So this is not a permanent thing. It's due to transmission not generation, and that's what they've expressed to us. But between now and then, it's going to be less supply in the biggest highest -- consistently high demand market. What that means and what we're seeing, and I alluded to it earlier is that the pricing power pendulum is shifting back towards us. And it's nice to be I believe, the largest incumbent, we call it, 500 megawatts of in-place capacity and just under, I think, 200 call it, coming due contractually expiration wise in the next 3 years. The -- we -- when it comes to available capacity, we're -- we've sold quite well in that market. We probably in hindsight, I wish we didn't do so well, but who knew this was going to come. I don't think any market participants really expected this. We do -- ourselves are not completely bearing and we do have a 200-megawatt parcel in Manassas that is to date in unaffected zone that -- which is really nice to have in times like this. And while I cannot guarantee it right now, I think we're optimistic that the responsible parties in Loudon will work with Digital to deliver on behalf of those customers that have signed contracts to grow with us and are sitting in our backlog. Turning to your second question. The pricing power pendulum again, I think, is continuing to move in the favor of the providers given that demand has been robust for so long, and the outlook is looking to be -- continue to be such and the supply has just been absorbed. You pointed out the 15%, which is like less than a megawatt piece of our exploration schedule. I mean that's -- in times like these, when prices are moving your friend, it's nice to have more bites at the apple to continue to ensure commensurate value is generated for our contracts. So I feel that is usually our most network dense sticky portion that consistently on the front end of our exploration schedules. I feel pretty darn good about that in terms of not only retention but price action. And I think even the PC didn't mention in the larger the megawatt, I think that my commentary around Northern Virginia and other tightening markets, I think, will also continue this trend of more positive cash releasing spreads, which were positive in the first 2 quarters this year and remain positive on a full year basis for 2022.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.\nMichael Rollins: So with some of the comments on demand but also a lengthening of the sales cycle, should investors look at Slide 5 a little differently in terms of the range of sales outcomes that you achieved over the last 6 to 8 quarters relative to what the next 6 quarters or 4 quarters might look like? And then secondly, just given some of the comments that you provided on currency and on interest rates. If everything stays where it is currently, can you share a sense of what the potential headwinds could be on 2023 financial performance, thinking of revenue and core FFO per share?\nAndrew Power: So we'll do a reverse and I'll hit the currency and interest rates and then we can talk to pitch over to Corey about, call it, expectations on signings for, call it, the next several quarters. The -- I mean, based on where we're seeing the currencies, I would say, especially precipitated by, I think, the activity in the sterling -- the British sterling pound over the last several, I still believe currencies will remain somewhat of a headwind in '23 relative to 2022. I don't think that's a permanent fixture. But based on the pace of, call it, governmental base rate increases and the currency differentials. So we haven't put that together nor the interest rate, call it, headwind. The interest rate one is -- excuse me, I should say, FX is going to be less of a headwind than my gut for 2023 than 2022. I mean we're just absorbing, call it, 400 basis points. So I would -- I don't have the exact number, but I don't see it being even half of that in the end of the day in the next year, unless you literally have the euro and the pound literally dropped another 30% over the next 12 months. Interest rates, we have called 80-plus percent of our debt is fixed rate. We obviously saw last quarter looking to access capital across various markets and various currencies that align with our asset and revenue base to essentially buck some of the interest rate trend. But I mean, I think a good proxy is if you look at, call it, the quantity of our floating rate debt and you apply what the expected software increases over the next 12 months, that's probably going to be a ballpark in terms of headwinds on a year-over-year basis, Mike. In terms of -- I'll turn it back to Corey to how we're thinking about the range of outcomes on new signings.\nCorey Dyer: Yes. So thanks, Mike, for the question, and Andy for the -- let me go second. The -- first off, I'll tell you that we don't forecast. I'm not going to try to play a game on what it's going to look like. But what I would tell you from a demand and a pipeline perspective, our multi-quarter pipeline is really robust, may not robust. I'll say resilient and very healthy. And that comes off of our quarter that was our top quarter ever. The demand is healthy across all regions. The one softness area would probably be in the small enterprises where they're having a little bit more -- I'd say they're more susceptible to the macro issues to the war in Europe. So all those different items. And so we saw those cycles lengthening, and that moderated some of our results in the somewhat megawatt. But broadly across the globe, we've got really strong hyperscale demand. We've got strong demand and increasing demand from, I'll call it, our large $1 billion-plus multinationals. Our channel business is going really well. We're seeing new logos uptick from that cohort as well as the possible demand from just new signings in that area. So positive from a broad space, it's resilient and really healthy after our best quarter ever.\nOperator: The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo.\nEric Luebchow: Great. As we think about your -- the impact of inflation on your development costs next year and beyond, just I believe you have some VMI contracts renewing in early 2023 for your equipment spend. Maybe you could talk about what your expectations are there in terms of cost inflation on development as we enter the new year? And then second, as we think about the better pricing power and perhaps some constraints on new development in markets like Ashburn, are you in a position to perhaps have declining capital intensity in the next few years, which would kind of help reduce your needs for capital? Or how should we think about that dynamic as well?\nAndrew Power: Sure. Thanks, Eric. So the -- so we have numerous risk mitigations when it comes to our development and construction, which includes our vendor management inventory program, you mentioned other supplier contracts. At a more local level, bundling our projects with GCs and subcontractors. So when you put that all together in the current backdrop environment and we look at, call it, the next batch, which will be projects probably more back half of '23 into '24. On a fully -- including all baked into the whole basis of the project, we're still estimating that our costs are, call it, in the mid- to high single-digit-ish type of potential increase. Based on current outlook, and you touched a little bit on the supply/demand dynamic, we believe that the rate of rate growth will outpace that or at least hold firm that our yields will hang in there and not be degradated by that inflationary impact. And that's something we're working day in and day out to keep focused on and working with our great vendors around the world on. When it comes to pricing power, when it comes to capital intensity, I would just echo really what Bill said at the outset of this call that in the last several months, the world has become more volatile. The capital markets have become more challenged. The talk of a looming recession, the war in Eastern Europe has continued, and we're raising the bar at Digital when it comes to focus on our strategic priorities. And we obviously have an incredible pipeline of projects. We have probably one of the most distinguished land banks and runways for our customers. But I think there is a scenario very likely where we could spend a little bit less on speculative development. And because we're focused on projects that are delivering on those strategic priorities and delivering the highest risk-adjusted returns.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Andy, I wonder if you could talk about the M&A market a little bit, both in terms of your ability to sell your assets, given the sort of the derating of the public company multiples. Have you seen any change in the market on the private side and how will that affect your fundraising? And you've obviously bought Teraco. How are you thinking about acquisitions in terms of market expansions or expanding in existing markets over the next year or 2?\nAndrew Power: We didn't share much on Teraco and I'll start with that, and then we hand it to Greg to talk about both of your questions. Having spent some time down in region with the Teraco team, I think we're even more pleased with the incredible addition to our global platform, not only in terms of the most highly connected destinations across South Africa but we're a really fantastic team delivering on behalf of their customers, our customers and really growing that platform. I apologize, we did -- we obviously consolidated Teraco into our financials, but we did not roll them out into all the stats given we just closed and call it the middle of August. That's coming in a quarter's time. So please be patient with us on that. But I'll give it to Greg to maybe speak to take your questions.\nGregory Wright: Yes. Thanks for the question, Simon. Look, I would say pricing on recent transactions in the private market have remained firm. We're fortunate to be in a sector that continues to experience growth and secular demand that really isn't common for other sectors, and we happen to have a product that's scarce in the market with growing demand. When you try to put some numbers to that, if you just look at the last 2 quarters in the second and third quarter, it's about $1.7 billion in transactions. And pricing has been very firm in terms of cap rate and per KW basis. So look, to date, look, the private capital, again, is looking to increase their exposure to the space where there's a limited amount of supply. So to date, it's remained firm.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew Niknam: Just first on macro, and I think there may have been a question alluding to this before, but I just want to get a better sense whether you're seeing tightening financial conditions maybe starting to have an impact on your customers' propensity or willingness to invest further in Digital's transformation as they think about 2023, and whether it's varied across hyperscale enterprise or whether it's varied by geography? And then I have one housekeeping follow-up on Teraco, maybe, Andy, if you can talk about any incremental color you can give on expected contributions from Teraco perhaps in fourth quarter or maybe on a more annualized basis heading into next year?\nAndrew Power: So I'll handle the more mundane question on Teraco, and I'll pass it to Corey a little bit on buyer behavior in the current environment. So Teraco, I believe, did for just about 1.5 months, about $28 million of revenue, $16 million of EBITDA. It -- I would say it's signings, we're call it -- and again, do not include any of our numbers. We call it just don't know the 6 megawatts plus a decent chunk of connectivity. It does have a very sizable backlog. Bit added, I think, a sizable amount to our construction called almost $0.5 billion of construction in progress. And based on what we're seeing, they're working on right now, feeling very good about the growth of that platform. Corey, do you want to handle on, call it, buyer behavior in the current part?\nCorey Dyer: Matt, thank you very much for the question. I would tell you that the financial situation changes, pricing rates that we've risen have all affected, as I mentioned earlier, kind of small enterprises the most in first. We haven't seen an effect our larger enterprises, the multinational $1 billion-plus companies or our channel partners that are really our path towards the enterprise more broadly. So I think on that, it's been moderated a little bit in the small enterprise. When you look at the hyperscale, we continue to see strong demand on the hyperscale across all regions. I think we mentioned Portland was our largest this past quarter. Paris, with significant in EMEA. Osaka was significant in AP. And so we're seeing that across the board. We had large scale deals, as mentioned earlier, with an enterprise customer in Texas and Virginia. And so we're seeing larger scale deals. We're seeing it continue. Just a little bit of moderation, I think, in the small enterprises, but our pipeline is strong, resilient across all the different regions as well for you. So I think that hits everything you asked, Matt.\nOperator: The next question comes from Aryeh Klein of BMO Capital Markets.\nAryeh Klein: Bill, you mentioned sharpening the lens for new investments. Can you talk about, practically speaking, what changes there? And then, Andy, just on the minus 8.8% renewal spreads for larger deals. You mentioned that negotiations there began months ago. What would those rates kind of look like if they were done today?\nArthur Stein: So sharpening the lens, I think practically, what you'll see is, over time, higher returns from the deals that we do and lower returning assets or investments dropping out of the mix. That's the practical implication. So obviously, it's more complicated than that because we look at risk-adjusted returns. We look at what return should be in any given market, what type of -- whether it's a build-to-suit or a speculative development, how much preleasing there is, whether there's any magnetic attributes to the customer. But in general, I think you'll see over time, higher yields.\nAndrew Power: And then, Aryeh, before I get to your question, I just want to apologize, I misspoke in answering Matt's question, we had 2 months, not 1.5 months of the Teraco. Those numbers I quoted you in our financials. So just want to clean that one up. So as I mentioned before, the cash mark to markets have been moving in our favor for, call it, since we turned into 2022. And I would say, been strengthening along the way, and you saw that in our numbers, and you saw that in our guidance. That being said, as I've said before, we're not going to be universally at this minute without any negative market across any different product in any given quarter. I think the driver of the negative $8.8 million actually was a data center -- a one-off data center we acquired a couple of years back in Chicago. That customer's contract was in place. It was above market at the time. The markets scribed not caught up to when it rolled. I think the more strategic and important story about that asset is that the -- we literally just greenlight the conversion of some of the shelf space into growing our colo footprint in the suburbs of Chicago, which has been a really great success more recently. To go on to your question on, call it, I think it's bigger deals, price action in just the past year, not our biggest deal that I mentioned, which is the called build-to-suit. But I think our second biggest deal, which was a sizable plus megawatt deal. That transaction in North America signed and caught almost 18% net effective rates higher than a similar size transaction did, call it, a year prior. And the remaining space in that actually facility is probably being marketed up another 10%, 15%. Now we have an in that remaining space. So you're seeing a quick reversal in some of these markets where, again, demand is continually is robust and diverse, and the supply is being windled down.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Guarino of Green Street.\nDavid Guarino: On the inclusion of the CPI linked to rent escalators, is that a trend you're seeing from hyperscale tenants? Or is that more heavily skewed towards the 0 to 1 megawatt bucket? And then the second question is, switching gears, just with the supply and power restrictions and a few of the top markets like Northern Virginia, do you think that's why you saw such strong demand in Dallas and Hillsboro this quarter? And are there any other spillover markets that you're seeing early signs of demand picking up that maybe they could have went to NOVA, if there was capacity there?\nAndrew Power: Thanks, David. So first off, CPI was a predominant term, I would say, mostly in our European footprint, even before inflation was such a buzzword. Hence -- and that's the majority of, call it, just under 20% of our in-place contracts that have CPI escalations. We've been, call it, in the face of the current environment, making this a priority in our customer discussions. And it's not -- we're seeking that on larger contracts as well as -- larger contracts as well as smaller contracts. I would tell you, on a smaller contract, that already likely had a shorter duration, i.e., 2 years, 3 years, it's probably a little bit less a priority because you get another bite at the apple depending on the market rates. But we're trying to push it into those contracts. But if you look at our signings, we had a record quarter, 176 and 40% had CPI escalation. Some of them had capped or, call it, 2% or 3% on the floor and call it, 5% or 6% on the cap. But we were able to include in a significant percentage of our greater than 1 megawatt signings this CPI escalation. And those look greater than 1 megawatt science are typically the longest conference call it, 10 years. Hence, where it's the most needed because we won't get another opportunity to reset to the appropriate market rates for a fair bit of time. When it goes to NOVA spillover Dallas, Portland, I don't think -- our activity -- I would not describe our activity as spillover activity. The Dallas activity, a good portion of that was this build-to-suit customer demand. That customer picked -- they wanted multiple cities, so they're always going to pick not just NOVA. And then the Portland demand was very, call it, locational sensitive. I do think you -- and this is a -- I mean you don't typically buy data centers like rushing to the grocery store and grab some of the shelf and run into the checkout. So in the last 90 days, when this NOVA power issues come on the scene, I think the spillover effects are still playing out as we speak. I would say we see more of the early interest of spillover effects to, call it, Atlanta where we have, call it, almost 30-megawatt shell capacity, Northern New Jersey, potentially Chicago. Dallas could be in the mix as well. But -- as well as -- I mean, nearby spillover tech in Manassas, we have 200 megawatts.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Elias of Cowen and Company.\nMichael Elias: Congrats on the leasing. Just two questions for me. First is, as you think of Northern Virginia and the power delays, you mentioned how the conversations are evolving with Dominion. But how are the conversations going with the customers themselves who pre-leased capacity. Is there any risk to those leases maybe being canceled or anything like that? And then second, your leverage is now running around 6.7x or 6.4x if we adjust for forward. Based on the conversations you've had with the rating agencies, what's the highest level of leverage that you can hold before you run the risk of maybe being downgraded or losing that investment-grade status?\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Michael. I think we saved the best for last. So happy to take through both these. So the -- I think the customers are obviously alarmed, right? Most of these customers probably never experienced anything like this. But at the same time, I think they're incredibly grateful that they're in our hands and not some upstart competitor. And I know I'm biased in saying that, but I really mean it when. We're the largest in the market with a diverse set of campuses, of, call it, 0.5 gig of IT load and a truly experienced team holding their hands through it. And I'll reiterate what I said before, while I cannot guarantee it right now, we are optimistic that the responsible parties in Loudon will work with Digital to deliver on behalf of all of these customers. As it relates to your second question, we are -- obviously, the leverage has ticked up a little bit here. We are -- this is not a new normal. This is not where we desire to be. We've had a lot of moving parts in our capital stack with asset sales, joint ventures, acquisition closings with partial periods. We still have, call it, $0.5 billion of equity forward, which we've not drawn down. And we see a path to return to target leverage through leasing up our vacant capacities. We had -- you saw the occupancy, which was a great stack, really moving the needle on a sequential basis. We are seeing a more friendly mark-to-market in our cash flows. And we're going to do what we've been doing for a long time, which is capital recycling and tapping into our private capital sources. We sold billions of dollars of noncore assets and joint ventures. And that's going to continue to be our playbook. And we think there's a great lineup of partners that want to work with us to call it, CR leverage to be a capital partner to Digital Realty. That will bring that leverage back down towards target levels.\nOperator: That ends our question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Bill, please go ahead.\nArthur Stein: Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the third quarter, as outlined on the last page of our presentation. First, digital transformation remains an important secular driver of our business and drove record quarterly bookings. These additional commitments are reflected in our growing development pipeline and the high level of preleasing. Second, we continue to enhance our global platform with the closing of Teraco, giving Digital Realty the leading position in South Africa and a critical complement to our existing capabilities elsewhere in EMEA. Third, we continue to execute with improving results in our core data center business, though these improvements are masked by foreign exchange headwinds. Finally, the capital markets are very -- were very volatile in the third quarter, and we've taken action by adding significant liquidity to our balance sheet and prioritizing our new investments. Before signing off, I'd like to thank our dedicated and exceptional team here at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world turning. I hope all of you will remain safe and healthy, and we look forward to seeing many of you at Nareit next month in San Francisco. Thank you.\nOperator: That does conclude the conference for today. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Yes. So thanks, Mike, for the question, and Andy for the -- let me go second. The -- first off, I'll tell you that we don't forecast. I'm not going to try to play a game on what it's going to look like. But what I would tell you from a demand and a pipeline perspective, our multi-quarter pipeline is really robust, may not robust. I'll say resilient and very healthy. And that comes off of our quarter that was our top quarter ever. The demand is healthy across all regions. The one softness area would probably be in the small enterprises where they're having a little bit more -- I'd say they're more susceptible to the macro issues to the war in Europe. So all those different items. And so we saw those cycles lengthening, and that moderated some of our results in the somewhat megawatt. But broadly across the globe, we've got really strong hyperscale demand. We've got strong demand and increasing demand from, I'll call it, our large $1 billion-plus multinationals. Our channel business is going really well. We're seeing new logos uptick from that cohort as well as the possible demand from just new signings in that area. So positive from a broad space, it's resilient and really healthy after our best quarter ever. Matt, thank you very much for the question. I would tell you that the financial situation changes, pricing rates that we've risen have all affected, as I mentioned earlier, kind of small enterprises the most in first. We haven't seen an effect our larger enterprises, the multinational $1 billion-plus companies or our channel partners that are really our path towards the enterprise more broadly.

We definitely take a customer-led approach on aligning value to the overall reach and overall offering they're able to provide them. I would echo Andy sentiment that like in the Westin Building, I think we've talked about it a couple of quarters ago, where we're driving that consistency of our overall interconnection products and capabilities in that market to really just delivering more value and you're going to start to see more revenue pick up in the next year on being able to uniformly bring that into the overall PlatformDIGITAL delivery capabilities. I'd say this next piece is more probably pointing to your question in EMEA, right, where we've been talking for some time now about increasing those prices and that's been performing great. And I think that's something that you'll continue to see growing, which is represented in the interconnection numbers that we put up this last quarter. So you'll see that performing I think, much better over the course of the next year here."

            "name": "Arthur Stein",
            "content": "Thank you, Jordan, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. The world has experienced significant change so far in 2022, and Digital Realty is adapting to that change. Our business continues to be levered to powerful long-term secular demand trends, broadly driven by ongoing digital transformation and the growth in IT and data as our record leasing results underscore. We also have an unmatched global operating footprint that is supported by a strong development pipeline that allows us to capture opportunities wherever they may emerge. As you all understand, global capital markets have become extraordinarily volatile and interest rates have risen sharply from historic lows to levels that we have not seen since 2008. At the same time, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against the euro to levels not seen in nearly 20 years. While you've had to look back over 30 years to find the last time the dollar was this elevated against the pound or the yen. This volatility is being driven by a number of factors from a global economy emerging from the pandemic to the war in Ukraine and of course, the heightened resolve of central bankers to tap down on elevated global inflation. And while the underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong and fortune can indeed favor the brave, experience has taught us that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. And we feel that it is most prudent today to adapt to the current environment by: one, prioritizing and sharpening the lens through which we view new investments to ensure that we are focused on the most strategic transactions that offer the highest potential risk-adjusted returns; two, by pressing our newly gained advantage on pricing and improving our internal growth profile and the longer-term durability of our cash flows; and three, by enhancing liquidity to ensure that we have the capital to meet the commitments that we have made to our customers while maintaining a comfortable cushion. With over 300 data centers around the world and a revenue base of over $4.5 billion, Digital Realty remains focused on how to best position ourselves for the long run. Our third quarter results were strong with a record $176 million of new bookings, making the third time in the past 4 quarters that our bookings have exceeded $150 million. Core FFO per share was $1.67 despite stiff FX and interest rate headwinds. On a constant currency basis, we see evidence of the turn that is starting to take shape in our core portfolio.  Digital Realty's global platform enables us to capture demand wherever it emerges. North America was the standout this quarter with our largest deals landing in the region. Multinational companies are using platform digital to enable digital transformation across multiple regions and metros globally. A good example of this is a large multisite enterprise build-to-suit transaction signed with a top 5 financial services company that was inked in the quarter. Looking ahead, sales activity remains healthy as the secular trends driving data center demand remain in place. Enterprises continue their digital transformation with a growing preference for hybrid cloud architecture while cloud and connectivity providers continue to expand their infrastructure to better serve their customers around the world. But the world is changing. We are seeing sales cycle lengthen and global uncertainty extends decision times. Importantly, we are pushing prices higher to reflect tightening supply and rising costs. Admittedly, some of the deals this quarter have been in process for many months and do not fully reflect today's environment. Today, new leases are being priced to reflect current market conditions. And while this will likely be in an iterative process, we expect the strong secular trends driving demand toward third-party data centers to continue for years to come. Andy will provide further color on our results and our outlook shortly. During the third quarter, we successfully completed the acquisition of a majority interest in Teraco, a leading carrier and cloud-neutral data center and interconnection services provider in South Africa. Teraco is a gem. With 7 data centers across 3 metros and robust interconnectivity including more than 22,000 cross connects, 7 cloud on-ramps and direct access to 7 subsea cables with more on the way. Teraco co has plenty of room to expand and is expected to generate some of the best growth within our portfolio. Teraco uniquely enhances our position in EMEA, complementing our existing operations in Eastern Africa through iColo, Western Africa through Medallion and in Europe and the Mediterranean with Interxion, Altus IT, Lamda Helix and our newest JV with Mine in Israel. These are all highly connected assets that leverage subsea cable landing and brings the world closer together, linking Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Consistent with that strategy, we recently acquired land on the Greek island of Crete to create an interconnection hub in the Eastern Mediterranean to complement our existing hub in Marseille, along with developing hubs in Barcelona and Israel, which will feed additional traffic into Greece, the Balkans, Turkey and Northern Africa. We expect that this highly differentiated project will generate strong double-digit returns while enhancing the value of our existing facilities in the region. Moving to our dispositions in the quarter. We sold a noncore mixed-use data center property in Dallas for $206 million and reached an agreement with digital core REIT to sell a 25% interest in our Frankfurt data center campus for $140 million with an option to acquire up to 90% of the same campus plus a 90% share of 1 of our Dallas data centers in a larger transaction valued at approximately $750 million. Both transactions are subject to unitholder approval with a vote expected for November. Funding organic new market entry through the disposition of stabilized facilities is our preferred source of capital. It enables us to leverage platform digital to capitalize on value creation opportunities and harvest capital once those facilities have stabilized. We also favor joint ventures like the one in Israel, where we leverage the local knowledge and expertise of our partner and pair that with PlatformDIGITAL to expand our global footprint and to better serve our customers. Before turning it over to Andy, I'd like to update you on our ESG success shown on Page 3 of our earnings presentation. We were honored to be recognized by GRESB as the sector leader for technology and science category in the Americas for the second consecutive year, maintaining our 5-star rating from this leading investor-driven ESG benchmarking organization. We are proud of our ESG-related efforts. And while the awards and recognition are nice, we are focused on ESG because our customers demand it, and because quite simply, it is the right thing to do. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. It's a little bit elongated, Jon. But as Andy said, if you were to strip out the 4 build-to-suits that are in this quarter, the effect on the book-to-bill this quarter would be minimal. So sharpening the lens, I think practically, what you'll see is, over time, higher returns from the deals that we do and lower returning assets or investments dropping out of the mix. That's the practical implication. So obviously, it's more complicated than that because we look at risk-adjusted returns. We look at what return should be in any given market, what type of -- whether it's a build-to-suit or a speculative development, how much preleasing there is, whether there's any magnetic attributes to the customer. But in general, I think you'll see over time, higher yields. Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the third quarter, as outlined on the last page of our presentation. First, digital transformation remains an important secular driver of our business and drove record quarterly bookings. These additional commitments are reflected in our growing development pipeline and the high level of preleasing.

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Andrew Power",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Turning to Page 5. As Bill noted, we signed record bookings of $176 million, with a $13 million contribution from interconnection during the third quarter, excluding the results from Teraco. The greater than a megawatt business in the Americas was the big driver of this quarter's record leasing at nearly $100 million signed. Sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection accounted for 24% of the record quarterly bookings while the shell portion of a large multisite enterprise build-to-suit deal fell into our other category. Importantly, as we've discussed, we have meaningfully shifted our cadence toward further insulating our portfolio from the effects of inflation through the addition of CPI-based escalators into our new leases. While more than 95% of our portfolio includes rent escalation causes, less than 20% are specifically tied to CPI, while the balance are fixed. And our highest leasing volume quarter ever, we were able to achieve CPI-based escalators on 40% of the leases signed in the quarter, which demonstrates our resolve and our customers' acknowledgment of this important factor. The balance of our leases signed in 3Q include fixed rent escalators. Moving on to markets. In North America, Portland and Dallas were particularly strong with large deals landing in each of those metros, while demand in Northern Virginia also remained high. In EMEA, totals were consistent with expectations with particular strength in Paris. While San Paolo led in LatAm, and Osaka led the APAC region. These deals drove additional starts within our development pipeline, which grew to over 400 megawatts, but is also now more than 60% pre-leased mitigating much of the risk related to this capital spend and providing significant visibility into future revenue. As Bill touched on in his remarks, we signed 4 leases in the quarter with a large multinational financial services customer that has fully embarked upon its digital transformation journey. This large multi-site, multi-market build-to-suit transaction drove the upside in our greater than 1 megawatt North America leasing and also served to increase our development pipeline sequentially while reducing our anticipated yields. Importantly, this deal is structured as a yield on cost development supported by a long-term triple net lease to a strong investment-grade credit with fixed escalators, which serves to insulate Digital Realty from construction costs, and operating expense volatility. Excluding this transaction, our development life cycle average yield will be closer to the yield we presented last quarter. During the third quarter, we added another 103 new customers, continuing the 100-plus new logos we've added each quarter since the closing of the Interxion transaction 2.5 years ago. Key customer wins in the quarter include a Global 2000 luxury goods maker is expanding its capabilities on PlatformDIGITAL to add data exchange with its strategic cloud providers to its existing capabilities. A Global 2000 multinational technology manufacturer is expanding its hybrid IT capability in multiple metros across 2 global regions with PlatformDIGITAL. A Global 2000 retailer is rationalizing its data centers and joining Platform Digital as part of its hybrid IT architecture to have greater proximity to a key cloud service provider while enhancing both performance and ecosystem benefits. A Global 100 top insurance company is rationalizing its data centers and moving to PlatformDIGITAL to gain strong access to 2 leading cloud service providers. Landing with us as a new logo in 4Q '21, a Global 2000 U.S. energy provider expanded into 2 more metros with Digital Realty as it continues to rearchitect its network as part of a long-term hybrid IT transformation. And a Global 2000 aerospace and defense contractor is rationalizing its data center portfolio while supporting the re-architecture of its network and interconnecting with cloud providers on PlatformDIGITAL.  Turning to our backlog on Page 7. The current backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases grew to $466 million by quarter end as our record signings were partially offset by $90 million of commencement. The lag between signings and commencements moved up to 17 months for the leases signed in the third quarter due to the large multisite enterprise build-to-suit deal discussed by Bill a moment ago. Excluding this deal, our sign to commence live was under 8 months, consistent with our historical average. Approximately 25% of our record backlog is slated to commence in the fourth quarter. While another 45% will commence in 2023, split fairly evenly throughout the first and second halfs of next year. Moving on to Page 8. We signed $154 million of renewal leases during the third quarter that rolled down 0.5% on a cash basis. Renewal rates for 01-megawatt renewals were positive across each region and up 3.1% overall, demonstrating the criticality of these deployments and the differentiation of our facilities. This product segment has historically experienced steadily positive renewal rates and cash renewal rates have steadily increased throughout this year. After two consecutive 3-plus percent bumps in 1Q and 2Q, the cash mark-to-market was weighed down by the greater than 1 megawatt segment in the third quarter. Despite this result, we are confident in a slightly positive cash releasing spread for the full year 2022. Importantly, we are encouraged by the general trajectory of market rents across our product line. We expect that the dislocation and volatility of capital markets coupled with rising costs and the reduced availability of power in several markets, including the world's largest market, Loudon County, Virginia, is constraining the ability to bring on new data center capacity despite the secular demand for data center infrastructure. With regard to power delivery in Northern Virginia, we are continuing to work with the primary power provider to ensure appropriate allocations with an acute focus on capacity needed to support our customers in this market. We have an incredibly unique footprint in Loudon and a set of capabilities that we are working to tap into in order to take advantage of this backdrop of continuing tightening market fundamentals. In terms of operating performance, total portfolio occupancy rebounded by 80 basis points sequentially, driven by the strong commencements. These improvements in our occupancy come despite our active intention to grow our global colocation inventory in order to meet the growing demand of our expanding customer base. Same capital cash NOI growth fell 7.3% in the third quarter, negatively impacted by another 480 basis point FX headwind. This is disappointing on the surface but once the noise is removed, the improving operating picture that we have been painting starts to emerge. On a constant currency basis, data center operating revenue, rental revenue interconnection was actually up 10 basis points year-over-year and improved by 120 basis points sequentially, demonstrating the turn that has started to take hold in our core operations. The sequential step-up was supported by a 50 basis point occupancy improvement over the second quarter, along with the benefits of the positive releasing spreads we've seen year-to-date. Turning to our risk mitigation strategies on Page 9. 56% of our third quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, with 21% in euros, 6% in Singapore dollars, 5% in British pounds and 2% in Japanese yen. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen over the last few months, negatively impacting same capital revenue growth by 530 basis points and NOI growth by 480 basis points year-over-year, as shown in our constant currency analysis on Page 10. This strong headwind contrasts with typical FX impacts of 50 to 100 basis points in either direction during the periods with more normal FX volatility. While the outsized depreciation of the euro this year has been a major driver of the headwinds for our P&L, it also represents the lion's share of our development pipeline. To be clear, we are operating and then investing locally rather than repatriating proceeds into U.S. dollars. Our operations, investment pipeline and funding in locally-denominated debt serve as a natural hedge. As we discussed on our call last quarter, given the growth of our global portfolio, along with heightened FX volatility, we took a closer look at our hedging strategy during the third quarter and executed additional swaps to mitigate our remaining FX exposure. In August, we executed a U.S. dollar to euro currency swap against an existing $1 billion tranche of 2027 notes outstanding. And in late September, alongside our USD 550 million bond, we swapped those borrowings in the euro and Japanese yen, which also reduced the effective interest rate on those 5-year notes to just 3% versus the 5.55% coupon achieved via the offering. In terms of earnings growth, we reported third quarter core FFO per share of $1.67, which is 1% higher on a year-over-year basis and 3% lower sequentially due to the negative impact of FX, higher interest and operating expenses and the initial dilution we incurred from the closure of Teraco, which is consistent with the forecast we provided last quarter. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was 6% higher year-over-year but down $0.01 sequentially. The reported core FFO underperformance versus our prior expectation for the quarter was purely a function of greater-than-expected FX headwinds. Looking forward, we expect core FFO per share will remain under pressure from stiff FX headwinds given the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, though this should be offset by core growth. As you can see from the bridge on Page 11, we expect FFO will remain flat sequentially in the fourth quarter as FX and interest expense headwinds are partly balanced by NOI growth. Accordingly, we've adjusted our underlying guidance assumptions to reflect the continued pressures of FX and interest rates. We are also updating our core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2022 to $6.70 to $6.75, reflecting a $0.075 per share adjustment at the midpoint of the range. Importantly, due to the sharper-than-expected move in interest rates since our last call, we are reducing our constant currency core FFO per share range by $0.025 at the midpoint to a new range of $6.95 to $7 for 2022, which represents approximately 7% growth over 2021. We expect currency headwinds could represent a 400 to 500 basis point drag on full year 2020 revenue and core FFO per share growth. A review of our leverage is on Page 12. Our reported leverage ratio at quarter end was 6.7x, while fixed charge coverage is at 5.5x. We drew $400 million down from last September's forward equity offering as part of our funding for Teraco. So pro forma for the remaining forward equity and adjusting for our full quarter's contribution from Teraco, our leverage ratio drops to 6.4x while pro forma fixed charge coverage is 5.7x. While leverage is above our historical average, we have bolstered our liquidity to ensure that we have the capital in hand to fund our committed development spend throughout the end of next year and maintain a comfortable cushion. Since our last earnings call, we have raised or received commitments for approximately $2 billion of debt capital at an effective blended average of just over 3%. These include more than $650 million of term loan commitments received subsequent to quarter end. With cash and forward equity outstanding totaling more than $700 million, we have increased our current available liquidity to approximately $3 billion. We expect to see leverage moderate back towards our longer-term target over time through a combination of noncore dispositions, joint ventures of core holdings, lease-up of available capacity and the retention of free cash flow. As Bill discussed, the current capital markets environment and increased cost of capital have led us to sharpen our lens and prioritize new investments to those that are the highest strategic merit and offer the best potential risk-adjusted returns. Our financial strategy includes a diverse menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost of our liabilities. The execution against this financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital and enables us to fund our strategic objectives. As you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is about 5.5 years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.4%. Approximately 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. More than 80% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have no meaningful near-term debt maturities and a well-laddered debt maturity schedule. We repaid the remainder of our 2022 debt earlier this month and have only a small Swiss bond maturing in 2023. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session. Thanks, Jon. So if you look at our development life cycle, it kind of lays it out region by region, and it has called, let's say, starts with a, call it, just $3.8 billion of, call it, approved projects. And that includes all the leases signed during the last quarter as well as some projects that are not leased because it's only 60% pre-leased, roughly. If you kind of break that down over the next, call it, 5 quarters, you're spending about $2.7 billion of that. Again, that is not all contractual spend. Only a portion of that is tied to customer contracts. So if you exclude the, call it, assumptive or speculative spend, you call it closer to $2 billion. The $3 billion of liquidity I mentioned, that includes, call it, really 2 parts, $1.7 billion of cash and revolver capacity and then $1.2 billion of the undrawn equity forward and new U.S. dollar term loan commitments in hand. So that total just about $3 billion of contractual committed committee liquidity right now. That is everything we have at this minute. We're also continuing with our normal game plan of noncore dispositions, call it $1.5 billion over several quarters as well as joint ventures on core holdings. So we feel pretty good about being able to fund this attractive growth for our customers. I would parse those in 2 topics and, I'd say, coincidentally look like they're connected. What the long -- the extended book-to-bill really was our largest transaction was with a large multinational financial services customer. It's been in the works for -- really since the very beginning of this year. It's across 4 different locations. It's incredible. It's very flatter to be part of their digital transformation, which is really going to cloud in a hybrid IT fashion. And given those projects are literally at land stage, we're designing to their specifications. That is what's extending that out. And if you carve those 4 transactions with that customer out, you really had a normal book-to-bill cycle. I think I'll let Bill comment on what he referenced in terms of, call it, what we're seeing in terms of the business in terms of some elongated sales cycle though. Thanks, Frank. Maybe Chris and I M&A cross-connect pricing and pricing dynamic overall. I would remind you, we are essentially have been putting together some critical puzzle pieces through our M&A and have been aligning our cross-connect pricing across various regions, including the latest and greatest addition to PlatformDIGITAL with Teraco, the leading platform across South Africa. So it's not necessarily a uniform step shift, but we have been investing in that platform, bringing more value to our customers and driving commensurate increases in prices. But Chris, anything you want to add on cross-connect prices or data points there? And just not to leave you without any numbers in terms of rate or growth increases. I mean the ranges are pretty wide, but it's anywhere from called low mid-single digits to some -- definitely some outliers that are in the teens at the very least. I think the overall pricing environment is probably even more relevant to the heart of your question, though. We are continuing to see improving pricing power across our platform, whether it's in our, let's call it, less than megawatt enterprise colocation footprint. We're, I'd say, call it, 10% to 15% sequential pricing changes in many markets and also seeing similar type of increases in the larger plus than a megawatt as well. In relation to your second question, I mean, big kudos to the Digital Realty Finance Capital Markets team, I mean, really call it staying nimble and acting fast in a volatile environment and really bringing together, call it, what is the $2 billion of capital in, call it, 60 days. We've also been tapping into call it incremental FX hedgings, given the more volatile FX world and a more global business. And we've been able to, call it, get our cost of capital, call it, roughly 3%. Let don't I'm not sure that's a permanent number where we go from here. We've had, call it, the most rapid increase in the U.S. Treasury in 40 years or Fed funds rates in 40 years. But we're definitely using all the tools in our toolkit to maximize those menu of options and drive down the cost of our capital. Thanks, Dave. Maybe I'll take them in reverse order because I think the second question ties a little bit into your first question. So as a broader reminder, literally, I think it was 90 days ago to the day, we got the, call it, the newer news from Dominion on the pinch point in Eastern Loudon County on power deliveries. I can tell you we're a regular dialogue with the power company on a path forward. But I would say also that the essence of the initial messaging remains intact that there's just going to be significantly less power provided to ongoing development in this region until 2026. The feedback we've received is that 2026, which should be back to more normal practices. So this is not a permanent thing. It's due to transmission not generation, and that's what they've expressed to us. But between now and then, it's going to be less supply in the biggest highest -- consistently high demand market. What that means and what we're seeing, and I alluded to it earlier is that the pricing power pendulum is shifting back towards us. And it's nice to be I believe, the largest incumbent, we call it, 500 megawatts of in-place capacity and just under, I think, 200 call it, coming due contractually expiration wise in the next 3 years. The -- we -- when it comes to available capacity, we're -- we've sold quite well in that market. We probably in hindsight, I wish we didn't do so well, but who knew this was going to come. I don't think any market participants really expected this. We do -- ourselves are not completely bearing and we do have a 200-megawatt parcel in Manassas that is to date in unaffected zone that -- which is really nice to have in times like this. And while I cannot guarantee it right now, I think we're optimistic that the responsible parties in Loudon will work with Digital to deliver on behalf of those customers that have signed contracts to grow with us and are sitting in our backlog. Turning to your second question. The pricing power pendulum again, I think, is continuing to move in the favor of the providers given that demand has been robust for so long, and the outlook is looking to be -- continue to be such and the supply has just been absorbed. You pointed out the 15%, which is like less than a megawatt piece of our exploration schedule. I mean that's -- in times like these, when prices are moving your friend, it's nice to have more bites at the apple to continue to ensure commensurate value is generated for our contracts. So I feel that is usually our most network dense sticky portion that consistently on the front end of our exploration schedules. I feel pretty darn good about that in terms of not only retention but price action. And I think even the PC didn't mention in the larger the megawatt, I think that my commentary around Northern Virginia and other tightening markets, I think, will also continue this trend of more positive cash releasing spreads, which were positive in the first 2 quarters this year and remain positive on a full year basis for 2022. So we'll do a reverse and I'll hit the currency and interest rates and then we can talk to pitch over to Corey about, call it, expectations on signings for, call it, the next several quarters. The -- I mean, based on where we're seeing the currencies, I would say, especially precipitated by, I think, the activity in the sterling -- the British sterling pound over the last several, I still believe currencies will remain somewhat of a headwind in '23 relative to 2022. I don't think that's a permanent fixture. But based on the pace of, call it, governmental base rate increases and the currency differentials. So we haven't put that together nor the interest rate, call it, headwind. The interest rate one is -- excuse me, I should say, FX is going to be less of a headwind than my gut for 2023 than 2022. I mean we're just absorbing, call it, 400 basis points. So I would -- I don't have the exact number, but I don't see it being even half of that in the end of the day in the next year, unless you literally have the euro and the pound literally dropped another 30% over the next 12 months. Interest rates, we have called 80-plus percent of our debt is fixed rate. We obviously saw last quarter looking to access capital across various markets and various currencies that align with our asset and revenue base to essentially buck some of the interest rate trend. But I mean, I think a good proxy is if you look at, call it, the quantity of our floating rate debt and you apply what the expected software increases over the next 12 months, that's probably going to be a ballpark in terms of headwinds on a year-over-year basis, Mike. In terms of -- I'll turn it back to Corey to how we're thinking about the range of outcomes on new signings. Sure. Thanks, Eric. So the -- so we have numerous risk mitigations when it comes to our development and construction, which includes our vendor management inventory program, you mentioned other supplier contracts. At a more local level, bundling our projects with GCs and subcontractors. So when you put that all together in the current backdrop environment and we look at, call it, the next batch, which will be projects probably more back half of '23 into '24. On a fully -- including all baked into the whole basis of the project, we're still estimating that our costs are, call it, in the mid- to high single-digit-ish type of potential increase. Based on current outlook, and you touched a little bit on the supply/demand dynamic, we believe that the rate of rate growth will outpace that or at least hold firm that our yields will hang in there and not be degradated by that inflationary impact. And that's something we're working day in and day out to keep focused on and working with our great vendors around the world on. When it comes to pricing power, when it comes to capital intensity, I would just echo really what Bill said at the outset of this call that in the last several months, the world has become more volatile. The capital markets have become more challenged. The talk of a looming recession, the war in Eastern Europe has continued, and we're raising the bar at Digital when it comes to focus on our strategic priorities. And we obviously have an incredible pipeline of projects. We have probably one of the most distinguished land banks and runways for our customers. But I think there is a scenario very likely where we could spend a little bit less on speculative development. And because we're focused on projects that are delivering on those strategic priorities and delivering the highest risk-adjusted returns. We didn't share much on Teraco and I'll start with that, and then we hand it to Greg to talk about both of your questions. Having spent some time down in region with the Teraco team, I think we're even more pleased with the incredible addition to our global platform, not only in terms of the most highly connected destinations across South Africa but we're a really fantastic team delivering on behalf of their customers, our customers and really growing that platform. I apologize, we did -- we obviously consolidated Teraco into our financials, but we did not roll them out into all the stats given we just closed and call it the middle of August. That's coming in a quarter's time. So please be patient with us on that. But I'll give it to Greg to maybe speak to take your questions. So I'll handle the more mundane question on Teraco, and I'll pass it to Corey a little bit on buyer behavior in the current environment. So Teraco, I believe, did for just about 1.5 months, about $28 million of revenue, $16 million of EBITDA. It -- I would say it's signings, we're call it -- and again, do not include any of our numbers. We call it just don't know the 6 megawatts plus a decent chunk of connectivity. It does have a very sizable backlog. Bit added, I think, a sizable amount to our construction called almost $0.5 billion of construction in progress. And based on what we're seeing, they're working on right now, feeling very good about the growth of that platform. Corey, do you want to handle on, call it, buyer behavior in the current part? And then, Aryeh, before I get to your question, I just want to apologize, I misspoke in answering Matt's question, we had 2 months, not 1.5 months of the Teraco. Those numbers I quoted you in our financials. So just want to clean that one up. So as I mentioned before, the cash mark to markets have been moving in our favor for, call it, since we turned into 2022. And I would say, been strengthening along the way, and you saw that in our numbers, and you saw that in our guidance. That being said, as I've said before, we're not going to be universally at this minute without any negative market across any different product in any given quarter. I think the driver of the negative $8.8 million actually was a data center -- a one-off data center we acquired a couple of years back in Chicago. That customer's contract was in place. It was above market at the time. The markets scribed not caught up to when it rolled. I think the more strategic and important story about that asset is that the -- we literally just greenlight the conversion of some of the shelf space into growing our colo footprint in the suburbs of Chicago, which has been a really great success more recently. To go on to your question on, call it, I think it's bigger deals, price action in just the past year, not our biggest deal that I mentioned, which is the called build-to-suit. But I think our second biggest deal, which was a sizable plus megawatt deal. That transaction in North America signed and caught almost 18% net effective rates higher than a similar size transaction did, call it, a year prior. And the remaining space in that actually facility is probably being marketed up another 10%, 15%. Now we have an in that remaining space. So you're seeing a quick reversal in some of these markets where, again, demand is continually is robust and diverse, and the supply is being windled down. Thanks, David. So first off, CPI was a predominant term, I would say, mostly in our European footprint, even before inflation was such a buzzword. Hence -- and that's the majority of, call it, just under 20% of our in-place contracts that have CPI escalations. We've been, call it, in the face of the current environment, making this a priority in our customer discussions. And it's not -- we're seeking that on larger contracts as well as -- larger contracts as well as smaller contracts. I would tell you, on a smaller contract, that already likely had a shorter duration, i.e., 2 years, 3 years, it's probably a little bit less a priority because you get another bite at the apple depending on the market rates. But we're trying to push it into those contracts. But if you look at our signings, we had a record quarter, 176 and 40% had CPI escalation. Some of them had capped or, call it, 2% or 3% on the floor and call it, 5% or 6% on the cap. But we were able to include in a significant percentage of our greater than 1 megawatt signings this CPI escalation. And those look greater than 1 megawatt science are typically the longest conference call it, 10 years. Hence, where it's the most needed because we won't get another opportunity to reset to the appropriate market rates for a fair bit of time. When it goes to NOVA spillover Dallas, Portland, I don't think -- our activity -- I would not describe our activity as spillover activity. The Dallas activity, a good portion of that was this build-to-suit customer demand. That customer picked -- they wanted multiple cities, so they're always going to pick not just NOVA. And then the Portland demand was very, call it, locational sensitive. I do think you -- and this is a -- I mean you don't typically buy data centers like rushing to the grocery store and grab some of the shelf and run into the checkout. So in the last 90 days, when this NOVA power issues come on the scene, I think the spillover effects are still playing out as we speak. I would say we see more of the early interest of spillover effects to, call it, Atlanta where we have, call it, almost 30-megawatt shell capacity, Northern New Jersey, potentially Chicago. Dallas could be in the mix as well. But -- as well as -- I mean, nearby spillover tech in Manassas, we have 200 megawatts. Thanks, Michael. I think we saved the best for last. So happy to take through both these. So the -- I think the customers are obviously alarmed, right? Most of these customers probably never experienced anything like this. But at the same time, I think they're incredibly grateful that they're in our hands and not some upstart competitor. And I know I'm biased in saying that, but I really mean it when. We're the largest in the market with a diverse set of campuses, of, call it, 0.5 gig of IT load and a truly experienced team holding their hands through it. And I'll reiterate what I said before, while I cannot guarantee it right now, we are optimistic that the responsible parties in Loudon will work with Digital to deliver on behalf of all of these customers. As it relates to your second question, we are -- obviously, the leverage has ticked up a little bit here. We are -- this is not a new normal. This is not where we desire to be. We've had a lot of moving parts in our capital stack with asset sales, joint ventures, acquisition closings with partial periods. We still have, call it, $0.5 billion of equity forward, which we've not drawn down. And we see a path to return to target leverage through leasing up our vacant capacities. We had -- you saw the occupancy, which was a great stack, really moving the needle on a sequential basis. We are seeing a more friendly mark-to-market in our cash flows. And we're going to do what we've been doing for a long time, which is capital recycling and tapping into our private capital sources. We sold billions of dollars of noncore assets and joint ventures. And that's going to continue to be our playbook. And we think there's a great lineup of partners that want to work with us to call it, CR leverage to be a capital partner to Digital Realty. That will bring that leverage back down towards target levels."

During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to Digital Realty's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and President and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, let me offer a few key takeaways from our second quarter. First, the overarching trend of digital transformation remains a secular driver for our business, which was highlighted by yet another quarter of greater than $110 million of bookings and over a 100 new logos added, which was well diversified in terms of product [and GO]. Second, the improved re-leasing spreads we saw last quarter continued in 2Q, and we remain focused on offsetting the impacts of rising costs throughout our pipeline of new opportunity and development; third, our transformation into a leading global data center solution provider remains on track with our investment in Teraco expected to close within the next two weeks; and finally, our core FFO per share results exceeded consensus for the quarter, though we tempered our expectations for the second half and full year 2022, principally due to continued FX headwinds as we reaffirmed our constant currency core FFO per share guidance for 2022. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein.\nBill Stein: Thank you, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Digital Realty is levered to powerful long-term secular demand trends, broadly driven by ongoing digital transformation and the growth in IT and data. We have an unmatched global operating footprint along with a strong development pipeline continue to deepen and expand that footprint to meet our customers' growing needs. Those customers are a growing community of more than 4,000 organizations across the globe, including the world's largest cloud service providers, communication providers that enable the global transport of data, Global 2000 enterprises as well as many multinational and industry-leading companies. Our second quarter results were strong with $113 million of new bookings and core FFO per share of $1.72, a 12% increase over the second quarter of last year and a 3% sequential increase, despite stiff FX headwinds. The dialogue with our customers surrounding the evolving supply-demand dynamic and our compelling value proposition has started to translate with price increases driving positive cash renewals, supporting our push for appropriate rent escalators and helping to maintain stable development returns. Despite generally higher prices, demand for data center solutions remains strong around the world with notable productivity in each of our regions. EMEA was a standout this quarter with all 5 of our largest deals landing in the region as the world's leading cloud service providers continued to utilize our platform to expand their infrastructure and support their growing needs. Looking forward, our pipeline remains robust as enterprises continue their digital transformation with a growing preference for hybrid cloud architecture, while cloud and connectivity providers continue to expand their infrastructure to better serve their customers around the world. Andy will provide more color on our results shortly. But first, I want to touch on the recent launch of ServiceFabric Connect, an open interconnection solution and orchestration platform designed to support the wider industry shift to a hybrid data-centric architecture. This product launch empowers our enterprise and service provider customers to connect to anyone, anywhere at any time through an open and neutral digital marketplace. ServiceFabric Connect is the first of several related interconnection-oriented products that we have on our roadmap and was launched with availability in over 30 markets around the world. We are excited to bring this product to life, and we look forward to delivering these enhanced connectivity benefits to our customers. Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform through a combination of organic new market entries that enhance our global productivity offerings as well as existing market expansions that are designed to meet our customers' longer-term capacity and connectivity solution requirements. Along these lines, in the second quarter, we acquired land in three European markets for ground-up development to support strong demand. In addition, we announced our entry into Israel with the formation of a joint venture with Mivne, a leading Israeli real estate group. Together, we plan to develop a data center campus in Petah Tikvah, the primary connectivity hub in Israel. Our presence in Israel will complement our facilities across the Mediterranean and will support the emergence of new connectivity routes that subsea cable operators are developing between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. Finally, we have received the necessary regulatory approval in South Africa to close on the acquisition of Teraco, a leading colocation and interconnection provider in South Africa. We now expect to close the transaction within the next two weeks. Our active development pipeline remains robust and grew by more than 10% sequentially with 41 projects underway, supporting over 360 megawatts of IT capacity in 18 strategically important metros around the world. More than half of this capacity is already presold, reflecting strong customer demand. Given the dynamism of the current environment, we know how important it is to make sure that we are being appropriately compensated for the elevated risk throughout the capital markets and the broader economy. We have sought to mitigate these risks through our VMI program, appropriate pricing adjustments and CPI-based rent escalators that help insulate us from the impact of higher operating costs throughout the life of our customer contracts. Finally, as we have discussed in the past, we remain focused on opportunistically culling our portfolio. Since the end of 2019, we have monetized over $4 billion of assets through a combination of outright sales, joint ventures, and more recently, through the contributions to our Singaporean Capital Partner Digital Core REIT. We view these sales and contributions as an important source of capital raising as we continue to expand our diverse global portfolio and accelerate our growth. Before turning it over to Andy, I'd like to highlight an important update to our Board and then discuss the success we\u2019re having with other ESG initiatives shown on Page 5 of our earnings presentation. In June, Mary Hogan Preusse, a 30-year REIT industry veteran was named Chairman of the Board, succeeding Laurence Chapman. Mary has served on our Board since 2017 and has played a critical role in driving Digital Realty's expansion and innovation as we have pursued our transformation to being a global full spectrum data center provider. We are fortunate that Laurence will continue to serve on our Board of Directors to provide his deep well of experience, understanding and leadership. Mary's appointment aligns with Digital Realty's commitment to strong governance, our focus on sustainability and the aim to balance fresh thinking with experience and continuity. I look forward to working with Mary in her new role. We also continue to advance the ball towards our sustainability goals in the second quarter. In addition to publishing our fourth annual ESG report, we became the first data center operator to achieve the milestone of 1 gigawatt of sustainably certified data center capacity. We also further expanded our renewable portfolio in the U.S. by contracting for 158 megawatts of new solar energy before the recent run-up in power prices, supporting our data centers in California and Georgia. Globally, 119 of our data centers are powered by 100% renewable energy. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.\nAndy Power : Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. As Bill noted, we signed total bookings of $113 million with a $12 million contribution from interconnection during the second quarter. New business was healthy across product types as sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection accounted for 42% of the quarter's bookings, while deals larger than a megawatt accounted for 57% of this quarter's bookings. The weighted average lease term on new leases was more than 7 years. EMEA accounted for well over half of this quarter's new business as Frankfurt continued to set the pace in the region, while Paris was also a meaningful contributor. Leasing was also geographically broad based during the quarter with significant contributions from Northern Virginia, Athens, Zurich, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, New York, Dublin and Amsterdam. Reflecting the strength of demand from our customers, we grew the size of our development pipeline to more than 360 megawatts under construction as we started over 100 megawatts of new projects in EMEA and North America, including 35 megawatts in Frankfurt and 38 megawatts in Paris. Nearly 1/3 of our sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection bookings were exported from one region to another, reflecting the value customers realize from our global platform. North America was the most common export region with most of those exports landing in EMEA, followed by Asia Pacific and Latin America. During the second quarter, we added another 108 new customers, bringing the total to more than 1,000 new logos since closing the Interxion transaction a little over two years ago. We see a growing trend of multinational companies deploying and connecting large private data infrastructure footprints on PlatformDIGITAL across multiple regions and metros globally. In terms of specific customer wins during the quarter, a leading IT service provider has experienced the full range of benefits of PlatformDIGITAL from greater performance and scalability to cost savings. These customers expanded their capabilities across three metros in two geographic regions, emphasizing hybrid IT by integrating bare metal and cloud storage. Two leading Global 2000 financial services firms chose PlatformDIGITAL for multi-set deployments in multiple metros across North America and Asia Pacific. One of the world's leading video game developers is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to access our global footprint, scalability and low latency performance. A Global 2000 reinsurer is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL with full-spectrum benefits from the strong community to top cloud providers and robust security being key drivers. And a life sciences organization is switching to PlatformDIGITAL in two markets across North America to reduce network costs while implementing artificial intelligence and high-performance computing applications. Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of signed, but not yet commenced leases, tapered $393 million by quarter end as record level of commenced leases outpaced new signings. A lag between signings and commencements moved up to 13 months due to one larger signing into a new campus development in Frankfurt. Excluding that lease, the sign of commencement period was more in line with our recent experience of about eight months. Moving on to Page 10. We signed $173 million of renewal leases during the second quarter at a positive 3.4% cash re-leasing spreads compared to 3.3% positive last quarter. Renewal rates were positive in each product segment and also in each of our three regions. The majority of total renewals were sub-1 megawatt deals, reflecting the higher unit price contracts that are characteristic of that segment. These renewals climbed by 3% during the second quarter. Among larger deals, rates increased by 1.1%. We are encouraged by the positive trajectory of renewal spreads as well as our constructive engagement with customers on the current inflationary environment and our highly compelling value proposition. In terms of operating performance, total portfolio occupancy rebounded by 60 basis points sequentially, driven by the strong commencements from our record backlog. These improvements in our occupancy come despite our active intention to grow our global colocation inventory in order to meet the growing demand of our expanding customer base who continue to solve for complex IT infrastructure, connectivity and data integration challenges. Same capital cash NOI growth fell 5.5% in the second quarter, primarily driven by a 400 basis point FX headwind in the last leg of a previously discussed sizable churn event. Most of this space has already been re-leased and will more fully commence over the next several quarters, which should drive an improved trend in revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Turning to our risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. 57% of our second quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars with 22% in euros, and 7% in Singapore dollars, 6% British pounds and 2% in Japanese yen. We have also actively mitigated interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt or longer-term fixed-rate financing. Turning back to currency. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen over the last several months, and FX represented a 400 basis point to 450 basis point drag on year-over-year growth in our second quarter reported results from a top to the bottom line, as shown in our constant currency analysis on Page 12. As we've highlighted in the past, currency fluctuations has more typically served as a 50 basis point to 100 basis point headwind or tailwind to earnings in periods of lower volatility. While the outsized depreciation of the euro this year has been a major driver of the headwinds for our P&L, it also represents the lion's share of our $4 billion-plus development pipeline. To be clear, we are operating and then investing locally rather than repatriating proceeds into U.S. dollars. Our operations and our investment pipeline along with our capital funding and locally denominated debt serve as a natural hedge. Of course, given the growth of our global portfolio, along with the heightened FX volatility, we will continue to evaluate our hedging strategy on an ongoing basis. In terms of earnings growth, second quarter core FFO per share of $1.72 was 12% higher on a year-over-year basis and 3% higher sequentially, despite increased FX headwinds. The outperformance versus our prior expectations for the quarter was principally a function of lower-than-expected OpEx spend and a short delay in the closing of the Teraco transaction. Looking forward, we expect core FFO per share will remain under pressure from stiffer than expected FX headwinds given the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. As you can see from the bridge chart on Page 13, we expect FFO will dip down a couple of pennies in the third quarter, principally due to FX, but also as a result of the delayed normalization of OpEx spend, near-term dilution from closing the Teraco transaction and higher interest rates. Accordingly, we have adjusted our underlying guidance assumptions that remain under pressure from foreign currency exchange and interest rates. We are also updating our core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2022 to $6.75 to $6.85, reflecting a $0.05 per share adjustment at the low and high end of the range. Importantly, we are reaffirming our constant currency core FFO per share range of $6.95 to $7.05 for 2022. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, we expect currency headwinds could represent a 300 basis point to 400 basis point drag on full year 2022 revenue and core FFO per share growth. Lastly, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 14. Our reported leverage ticked down to 6.2x as of June 30, while fixed charge coverage increased to 6.0x. Adjusting for the proceeds from the last September's forward equity offering, our pro forma leverage drops to 5.8x, while fixed charge coverage improved to 6.2x. We remain focused on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost of our liabilities. The execution against this financial strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from the pack and enables us to prudently fund our strategic objectives. As you can see from the chart on Page 15, our weighted average debt maturity is nearly six years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.2%. Approximately 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Nearly 90% of our debt is fixed rate and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 15, we have modest near-term debt maturities and a well-laddered maturity schedule for the foreseeable future. Our balance sheet is poised to weather the storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo.\nEric Luebchow: First of all, just curious on what your pipeline looks like in terms of hyperscale. I know you saw a tremendous amount of absorption in Q1. It was a little bit lighter, especially in the U.S. in Q2. Now any sense at all the large cloud operators are pulling back after a few record leasing quarters? Or is this just the natural ebbs and flows of the market maybe related to a slightly more limited inventory you had in some of your key markets?\nCorey Dyer: Yes. So Eric, this is Corey. Just responding to you. Thanks for the question. And I would tell you that our hyperscale demand and our bookings this quarter were really strong, especially across Europe. Really solid bookings across North America as well as Tokyo with hyperscale, and we haven't really seen a slowdown in it. Going forward, from our pipeline, our pipeline broadly is really strong. It's the highest we've ever had across all of our segments, including hyperscale. So we feel really good about where we are. They're continuing just to take advantage of the offering that we offer them. They're across -- they're with us across about 40 different markets, really utilizing us for the connectivity, the enterprise customers that we have and really taking advantage of our platform on an ongoing basis. So no real slowdown that I see so far. Andy?\nAndy Power: No...\nCorey Dyer : Sorry, Andy.\nAndy Power : Sorry, go ahead, please.\nEric Luebchow : I was just going to ask a separate question. So something that we heard about recently were some challenges about power supply for new construction at Ashburn. Some news reports that has been severely restricted by the local utility. So I'm just wondering if that's having any impact at all in your ability to build new capacity, particularly at the Western Lands campus in Ashburn or if you feel relatively insulated based on perhaps precommitments for power generation. And then separately, I think we've heard some comments from Bill that maybe you're working with some hyperscalers at that campus to plan some deals. So perhaps, an update as to what the sales funnel looks like in Northern Virginia specifically.\nAndy Power: Sure, Eric. So the only thing I was going to add on, and sorry for interruption. Corey's first piece is that the -- if you look at the plus the megawatt signings were most of the hyperscale larger deals land. We did north of 50 megawatts. I think our largest deal is 10 megawatts. We had two around 5 each. So then you had, call it, 30 megawatts of, call it, 1 to 4 megawatts in size, including new landings and expansions from a diverse group of those hyperscalers. So that was the only data point I was going to add to that first question. On your second question, Eric, I would say, you definitely got the scoop in terms of something that's certainly very recently breaking. So I'll try to provide a little context and as well to answer your question. Dominion Energy, which is the primary power provider in that market, informed its major customers very recently regarding the call a potential pinch point in Eastern Loudoun County that could delay deliveries until 2026. So a little fair bit out there. The cause has been described to me as transmission, not generation, i.e. the pipes or the power line infrastructure, not the actual power. The power company did not give definitive answers to most of the relevant questions we and I would think you and others on this call would probably have, but they have been transparent about the potential issue, and they're working very diligently to finalize their assessment and then ultimately communicate their findings. What this means -- I mean while we're still obviously handicapping the potential outcomes, but net-net, if this is to come to fruition as we recently learned, it will obviously likely be a slowdown in delivery of new supply in what is our largest and the largest and most consistently in demand data center market in the world. So I see two possible outcomes there: one being called just a sense of greater pricing power and higher rates tied to the sharp reduction of near-term availability, which should be favorable to Digital given our standing in market; and then also likely to be potentially some winners and losers as it relates to the various developers, including Digital seeking to bring new inventory online in that market. We have -- you kind of go through the rundown of our footprint, call it, 40 megawatts available. You can see in our 500 megawatts of IT load operational as of 2Q. We also then have, call it, 50 megawatts was our last building on that legacy Loudoun campus. I think it's building all in the alphabet that I would say feels like on the lower risk of having an issue. But again, this is very new and subject to change. We have another 200 megawatts on our Manassas campus, which given its position in that market seems on the lower risk side. And then we do have, call it, based on a substation that's already built about 200 megawatts on that Digital Dallas aka Western Lands, call it 1 plus gigawatt site that is called. We got to figure out how that's going to play out in terms of delivery and time line, but I do like our odds, if any, given that we have a sitting substation already there. The steel has been erected, the capital is deployed. Net-net, given our activity in that market, only 24 megawatts of what I just mentioned other than the 40 available would deliver by the fourth quarter of '23, just normal timeline. So I don't see this as a huge impact to '23. And then last but not least, I mean, given other than the tighter market fundamentals, I mean I do like our odds here relative to the competitive set in North Virginia. I mean we're the largest provider of consistently operating with Dominion. We have substations and power infrastructure already built on our campuses, as I mentioned. And I think we are a very important player in that market to help the power company address this problem given our strategically important land parcels and easement. So sorry for the long-winded response, but I didn't feel that, that top would need some clarity given you've kind of just broke that news just yesterday, the day before.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew Niknam : So first on pricing. It sounds like it's been an incrementally positive story just based on some of the recent commentary you've been hearing. So I'm just wondering if maybe you can elaborate on what you're seeing on the pricing front across regions. And then also on demand, I know -- I think Corey referenced very strong demand. I'm just wondering, in light of maybe some elevated concern around a potential macro downturn, any regions, any verticals where you may have seen or started to see any sort of moderation in terms of demand from your customers?\nAndy Power: Obviously, those things are linked, Matt. So maybe I'll have Corey speak to demand first, and then I can tackle the pricing topic.\nCorey Dyer : Yes, Matt, thanks. As far as demand, I mentioned hyperscaler demand earlier. Our demand across the board is really good. We've got it across all four -- all of our regions. I mentioned -- I think Andy mentioned in the prepared remarks, the demand across EMEA that was our largest landing spot for our business. Our pipeline is the highest pipeline I've ever had, and that's on top of a couple of years of huge growth in pipeline and in the business. So we feel really good about where the demand is and where the pipeline is. Enterprise customers are continuing to take advantage of PlatformDIGITAL, make use of the data gravity opportunity in front of them. And I feel like in a hybrid IT world, we're probably the best position to help them do that. And so we've seen our demand just grow across the board, enterprises across all regions and hyperscaler as well. If you look at the sub 1 megawatt, which is your colocation interconnection, that was our third highest quarter ever, right on the back of 2 of our highest quarters ever. So I feel really good about the demand.\nAndy Power: And then, Matt, on your second question as it relates to pricing, I mean I would say, the commentary is fairly consistent with what Bill and I shared at the NAREIT conference, call it, early June. 2022, on the backs of, call it, us executing on the business and strengthening our value proposition with pricing power accrued to for several years, 2022 has started off -- or the first half, it's certainly been a called pendulum shifting dynamic. The demand has remained robust. Our value proposition is certainly resonating with what you've seen in the results and the pace of inventories had a challenge keeping up with it. And -- but what I just relayed on Loudoun County is called just one of the examples, but there's been others throughout the year as well. And that has allowed us to essentially move our list rates up numerous times, starting at the very end of 2021 through 2022, executed at higher rates across both our larger footprint and small footprint. Push rates on our renewal contracts, which last quarter, we had positive cash mark-to-markets certainly inflection on our cash mark-to-markets. We raised our guidance for the full year, and we followed with a second quarter of cash mark-to-markets as well. And I would say, all these things kind of flow through the entire, call it, commercial engagement with the customers to escalators and other provisions. So pricing has been moving in our favor in the first half of 2022.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Bilerman of Citi.\nMichael Bilerman : Andy, I wanted to talk just a little bit about foreign exchange. As a U.S. dividend payer, obviously, you have to be mindful. And when I -- you're talking about obviously not repatriating a lot of income, not foreign income because you're reinvesting it. I guess just stepping back, how do you sort of think about being a U.S. dividend payer and being a global company with global flows? And you talked about other hedging techniques, and I want to know how much of that just simply borrowing more in foreign currency, putting more currency swap hedges in place versus thinking about other potential structures. And I recognize you did the REIT, but you did that with U.S. assets. I don't know if you're thinking about doing more localized. And so maybe if you can just expand a little bit more on that hedging comment.\nAndy Power : Sure. Thanks, Michael. So I mean -- and we touched a little bit on this in the script. We've followed this playbook that you've somewhat summarized to your -- I mean often when we go into more volatile parts of the world like Latin America, we do partnerships. So we're not -- our equity is not entirely at risk. We also -- I've put a disproportionate amount of our debt in non-U.S. dollar financings, hitting the Eurobond, Swiss bond, Sterling bond. We have now called close to $4 billion in multicurrency revolver commitments. And so given that -- with that mismatch, you said of having a U.S. stock price in U.S. listed or U.S. currency dividends put more and more, call it, accessing diverse sources of capital and creating natural FX hedges along the way. At the same time, given the rate of return that we're investing relative to at least in more recent history has been very low rates in a lot of these currencies. There has been called cash flow or CFFO leakage. The point I was trying to highlight in the script, and this year, the volatility is just off the charts. I mean the year ago, the parity with the dollar is the highest it's been in several years. And certainly, it's created a headwind to our P&L or core FFO per share. But those same euros that got deflated in our P&L in 2022. We're also going into the ground with Europe being our largest development as part of the portfolio with 221 of our megawatts under construction across the continent or in London. So that is typically in our playbook. We've not followed some others in terms of, call it, just P&L hedging, which is really transacting with foreign currency derivatives to call it take out volatility, and that's been what we've done to date. Now I've also said in the prepared remarks, we're becoming a much more global company. There's no question of that. Call it, 50-plus metros, 27 countries, six continents, and we're in a -- certainly, and not in a long time heightened volatility to currency situation. So I think we're always open to good new ideas and something we'll consider in terms of adding to that FX playbook with various types of derivatives. Am I going to go a lot the euro at this point right now? I'm not sure quite honestly. I mean there could be a chance where some of these non-U.S. currencies or countries start raising their rates, and you have some reversion on some of this at the same time. So -- but that's really been what the past practice is, and we're always looking at trying to figure out new ideas to continue to actively hedge the business and mitigate risk.\nMichael Bilerman: And then as a follow-up, as you think about the Singapore entity that you listed, and obviously, you put U.S. assets into a Singapore market, which at least driven that was what the market had sort of wanted. But is there an element that you look at that entity? Obvious, it's well off its IPO price. It has a cost of capital. It would need to transact on your U.S. assets at much higher valuations given how strong the U.S. dollar is. Does that -- so does that vehicle still work for you, number one? And then the second part of it is, would you consider vehicles that are local assets and local markets, which would accomplish -- you do it in private form, would you execute that in any public form as well?\nAndy Power: So the -- the DC REIT, Digital Core REIT, started out with the North America portfolio, but does have a global mandate. And really the selection of the initial assets was, we had the most to pick from in North America, given our history track record, stage of development of those assets. But we do very well expect to globalize it and diversify it with other types of assets in different parts of the world. The Singapore dollar is, I don't think it's 100% linked currency to the U.S. dollar, but there is, I believe, monetary policies or there is some governmental linkage where they try to track the U.S. dollar in terms of currency. So it's not usually a wildly divergent to the U.S. dollar type of currency. I mean, we view that vehicle as a, call it, the home for core assets with -- that are stabilized, fully operational, long-waited average lease terms, and again, will be a global basis. We also have ventures like Ascenty in Latin America, which today is held by our partners Brookfield or Mitsubishi or MC Digital Realty in Japan or our partners, Mitsubishi Corporation, that are certainly a private partner today, but those certainly could evolve into forms of public partnerships over time. So we're always looking at different ways to find the most appropriate both debt and equity capital, private and public, for partners to most efficiently and prudently scale and grow the platform.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.\nDavid Barden : I guess a couple. The first would be, Bill, you've talked about how steady kind of mid-single-digit inflation would be a useful tool for the pricing equation for the data center industry. I think in the script, you talked about resetting pricing on a CPI basis. I'm wondering if this is really -- is it CPI based? Is it supply-demand based? If you could kind of talk a little bit about your pricing strategy big picture there. And then back to the launch of the service platform, I was wondering if you could kind of talk about any expectations that investors should have for that being a contributor to the business or KPIs that we should look for on a go-forward basis?\nBill Stein : Sure. So just to be clear, the CPI-based returns are in the escalators. So we've gone from -- we're going from fixed annual increases to increases that are structured with the minimums with floors and then CPI Index increases above the floor and typically to some cap. So an example would be a 2% floor with a CPI-based increase above that to, say, 6% as a cap, and that's on an annual basis. And so we feel that, that provides some hedge for us for inflation. And then just keep in mind, relative to inflation that over 90% of our power costs are passed through, and that obviously, has been subject to a lot of inflationary pressure. In terms of the base rents, that's more a function of supply and demand in any given market. So -- and with supply chain challenges, I would say, supply is more challenged and demand continues at a very high pace. So that plus the increasing input costs on new builds not us so much because of our VMI program, but certainly, our competitors whether it's materials and/or labor. And our customers that are building their own are certainly experiencing these same pressures, it's pretty easy to justify higher base rates when you're talking to customers. Does that answer your question?\nAndy Power: And thanks, David, for the question around the ServiceFabric. Yes. So we're -- I've kind of talked about this before to provide a little bit of color and background. It's a purpose-built product, right? And it really enhances our customer experience where we're removing technical complexity. And so what that's going to translate to and what we're watching is driving more of that sub-1 megawatt deployments where enterprises are looking to leverage and deploy their hybrid IT or multi-cloud deployment into our facility. So you'll see a lot more of that driving into our portfolio. And also, I think we're going to see us continually extend the reach into deeper sets of assets within our facilities, set differently, both colo and scale, will start to get the true benefit of interconnection, which at the end of the day will allow us to drive more value and higher margins outside of that product. And so that's one of the things we've been tracking extensively. And that utilization, which is another key KPI for us is multi-site, right, where we're starting to sell a blended set of capabilities, both scale and colo all heavily interconnected because that's where the market is headed. And that's where we see a lot of these larger enterprises requiring multi-market access with a highly interconnected backbone with true SLAs, and that's what the ServiceFabric was able to deliver to market there.\nOperator: The next question comes Jon Atkin of RBC Capital Markets.\nJon Atkin : Maybe just a follow-up to the topic raised two or three questions ago about asset recycling and the SREIT . They have their earnings call, I guess, 12 hours ago and specifically mentioned Chicago, Dallas, Frankfurt. So I wondered if there's anything you wanted to add to those comments around timing, and are we going to see all 3 or a subset of those all three or what's kind of the general cadence to suggest? So that's kind of maybe the follow-up. And then the question I had was about book-to-bill. It seems to have lengthened this quarter. That's kind of a choppy metric because I guess it depends on just the nature of the deals that you haven't designed in any given quarter, but it did lengthen noticeably anything to kind of call out there that might relate to the velocity of repeat demand that you might be seeing from the cloud providers or whether they might go through a digestion period. Appreciate Corey's comments about the pipeline being really strong, but the lengthening book-to-bill, is that something that's going to maybe shorten? Or how you see that trending?\nAndy Power: Jon, I'll take them in reverse because second one is pretty clean. The -- so there's one specific transaction that we've signed that into one of our newest Frankfurt campuses that -- I mean that we're just getting off that plot, getting off the ground on. So that was really what lengthened that out. If you exclude that 1 transaction that I think the book-to-bill is, call it, eight months. So called in-line with our prior track record. And then on your -- on the first question, I mean, definitely, very pleased that the Digital Core REIT team down the gates with -- I think its official first earnings call. Not -- I don't think they have a lot -- too much to report other than the biggest news being making progress. We are making progress collectively on not -- really beyond asset selection to diligence to transactional docs and have really circled assets in three markets as prime candidates to act on for its first life of acquisition growth. And as a reminder, that vehicle, we took public last December with a called underlevered balance sheet. So it has embedded debt capacity called approaching $200 million. So it's not reliant on the equity capital markets out of the gates, but we do hope the equity capital markets respond favorably and continue to support that and because we want to see that vehicle grow, we think that's a great partner vehicle for these core parts of our campuses that fit that vehicle's mandate.\nJon Atkin: Slide 13, just looking at the FFO per share ramp and the seasonality through the year. And as we look at kind of -- you didn't put numbers on it, but the 3Q into 4Q ramp seems fairly modest compared to what you saw 1Q to 2Q as well as the NOI growth contribution in 2Q into the current quarter. So I'm just wondering, is there anything going on during the second half of the year that would moderate your sequential growth in the second half, specifically into the fourth quarter? And I read introduction to that slide or is there anything in particular that would cause the ramp to be so much less significant than what you've seen in the last couple of quarters?\nAndy Power: Jon, I think it really was just timing. We had a really large commencement quarter in 2Q, and in the back half, you do have a few things, call it, working against us, which are those orange bars. One is, we do -- some of our beat in the second quarter was delayed timing on OpEx spend, which we believe is going to get pushed to the back half of the year, not a new event at Digital. We do see a pickup in interest expense, which everyone can see. And then we are closing Teraco in the coming weeks. And then lastly, call it, 24-ish or 25-ish percent of our core FFO is from like the euro, the sterling, the yen. And on a quarter-over-quarter basis, you've seen degradation in those currencies about 5%, which is the FX headwinds. Hence, while we did change our as-reported guidance, we were able to maintain our constant currency guidance, which is about just north of 7% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.\nOperator: The next question comes from Aryeh Klein of BMO Capital Markets.\nAryeh Klein : Maybe following up on the power issue out in Ashburn. What does this mean, I guess, for leasing? In that market, does it put it on a pause, I guess, in the near term? And I think Corey mentioned kind of the record pipeline that's out there. What would that look like in Nova? And then just curious, how much you have in the way of expiring leases in that market over the next 12 or 24 months?\nBill Stein: Thanks, Aryeh. So I mean -- and then -- again, it's still subject to change because this is very new or late breaking, but it's going to paint a picture where we believe there's still going to be robust demand in a tightened or slowed supply environment. So -- and those economics mean rates typically rise and economics accrue to the providers. We -- I don't -- first and foremost, I don't see people leaving Ashburn for this delay. This isn't like a permanent feature of Ashburn, this is a, call it, bottleneck of a portion of Ashburn. And you've got an incredible amount of customers, infrastructures, network Ashburn grew to where it is for many reasons. And I don't see demand just running away from in the face of this. I think the available capacity is going to become more precious. Hence, that call it, 40 megawatts of operational that we have today is more precious. And if we're able to proceed and bringing on new capacity that I outlined, that becomes more precious. And if we look at our expirations, we've got about 18 or 17 megawatts respond in the back half of this year. Another 75 in '23. Another 58 in '24. Another 54 in '25, so call it north of 200 over the next through the end of '25, which is a normal amount of role for us, but Ashburn is our largest market. So we have a lot of microwatts rolling over the ensuing years.\nAryeh Klein: Got it. I guess in light of what's happening, those re-leasing spreads or the pricing around that, you would anticipate maybe being higher than you might have thought a couple of weeks ago.\nAndy Power: Correct. Yes. I mean, I think asking rates on any available capacity in Ashburn, I mean when we got won of this, we went out to our entire field. The dynamics are shifting in Ashburn, and they could shift quite dramatically. So asking rates as well as negotiations on renewal contracts.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery : Just following up on the comments on the strong cloud demand. Can you just update us on what your cloud customers are saying in terms of their desire to work with you versus building themselves? Is there any change in that one way or the other or from one location to another? And then given some of the issues we're just talking about in Ashburn, obviously, power issues are even greater in Europe, and your -- you've just committed to some major new builds in markets like Paris and Frankfurt. What is on the ground there in terms of ensuring that you're going to have the availability of that power supply over the next several years for these and other expansions?\nBill Stein: Simon, I'll speak to the self-build question. So frankly, we -- the pipe scalers have been building their own for a long time, I'd say, for the last 10 years. And they have pursued what we call a hybrid model. So they have self-build, and they have -- they lease from third parties. That -- how much they do at any given time varies, and they don't all do it at the same time. So party A might be doing 100% third-party leasing and no self-building while party B is relying mostly on self-build. In the next year, they could change it up. But I would say, in the current environment, so in the current environment meaning that an environment that's challenged by supply chain and inflation, I think we're seeing an increased reliance on third-party leasing, right? And that's because we are as good as anybody at managing in what is, I would characterize it as a more challenging environment. And do you want to handle the power question in Europe.\nAndy Power: Sure. So we have on-the-ground teams that speak the local language, worked in the municipalities, network to the business leaders. So in each of these jurisdictions that call it, you mentioned our top of list relationships to make sure that we're in constant communication. That doesn't mean something doesn't pop off like we're experiencing Ashburn episodically, but I would say, we have a very good hand on the pulse of what's going on there. I mean this -- we're supporting critical -- mission-critical infrastructure here for a host of applications that I would say, even in a rationing environment, we're very top of list in terms of access to resources, including power. And we're constantly monitoring the power sources or deliveries for new projects and preparing for even more draconian scenarios in terms of backup fuel sources that could play out given the fact that circumstances of what's going on in Eastern Europe. So -- and that's part of our business, and we have very high stakes customers that I view as partners kind of in line what Bill mentioned who are side-by-side with us on these issues, right? They're with us with, expressing the criticality of them getting live on certain dates. So I think that partnership is -- so we would mutually benefit in terms of being able to derisk our execution on their behalf.\nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James.\nFrank Louthan : What conversations have you had with folks kind of looking ahead to possibly shrinking economy and so forth? Are you seeing any proactive pull forward of digitization saving costs and so forth? And can you give us a little bit more color on sort of the verticals that you're seeing the strength in the bookings? Any shift there from your usual case characters, any new or different industries that you're seeing coming stronger.\nAndy Power: Thanks, Frank. Maybe I'll start it off, and then Corey can -- so we've -- I don't think we've seen to date economic softness in our demand. You heard from Corey's description on the forward pipeline and look at our results in terms of new bookings and new logo additions, and I think that's based into that we are really mission-critical priority. We're not a discretionary spend. We are -- we're facilitating performance enhancement. We're facilitating growth through digital transformation for our customers' businesses as well as efficiencies for our customers. So I think that's -- and we've also been through a few economic cycles as well, and the history would say that our trend is our friend on that topic. If you look at the sectors, I think some of the usual ones, in North America, we saw a good amount of financial services. Cybersecurity, in EMEA, we saw this quarter's media telecommunications, initiative cloud and Asia Pacific, similar to what we saw both America and EMEA. So pretty broad brush as well as call more general corporate enterprise across health care, manufacturing, retail, et cetera. So -- and I think that goes back to -- there's a common theme across almost all these industries about what our services are doing to enable their services.\nCorey Dyer: Yes, I would add to it, Frank, that we had 17 subsegments do more than $1 million in bookings this last quarter, which speaks to the breadth of the demand. We haven't seen a pullback. If you think about the secular trends around service providers driving revenue, enterprises saving money, adding features as far as efficiencies, taking advantage of a hybrid IT world that we're really well positioned for. We haven't seen that affect the demand in any way. Maybe pull forward a little bit, but I haven't seen it really affected because I've got a record pipeline in colo, record pipeline in interconnection, record pipeline in enterprise and just a record pipeline overall. So if there is an effect on inflation, then I would tell you that it's not enough that it keeps them from continuing to come to look to us to build out their infrastructure.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson.\nNicholas Del Deo : First, on the -- looking at your expected returns in the development pipeline, pricing is up. It looks like returns are consistent, maybe falling a little bit, particularly in Europe. Is that a function of mix shift with more large deals in the pipeline or other factors at play there?\nAndy Power: Thanks, Nick. The -- I think the returns went down 30 basis points to 40 basis points from 10.4 to about 10, which is really a mix shift. We've added to the base some larger-scale projects that already have or will have some anchor leases that are -- we're certainly on the lower end of our return spectrum. But I would say, the pricing is robust, particularly in Europe, which is one of our tightest regions and has got a numerous markets where we're serving both large and small customers. So I would attribute that's pretty much sole that quarter-over-quarter mix shift.\nNicholas Del Deo: Okay. Got it. And then maybe 1 more on the Ashburn power topic. I think you made a case that customers are not going to leave Ashburn because of this. If it does cause any customers to kind of reconsider their concentration in Ashburn and maybe you want to diversify a little bit, say, into adjacent markets like Richmond or Culpeper or Manassas. Do you think you can react quickly to capitalize on any sort of diversification trend?\nBill Stein: So I'm not sure I think diversification trend would likely have been outside of like that Northern Virginia part of the world, quite honestly. And we've got shells in Atlanta, we've got capacity in the call it the suburbs of New York City and Chicago and Dallas. So there's -- I think you could see a spillover effect on a temporary basis to other parts of the United States. But I don't think you're going to see a running to other cities in Virginia, quite honestly. And I don't -- I mean, the -- this is locationally sensitive workloads, right? The infrastructure and networking has been in the ground and been built upon and grown upon for years and years in Ashburn. The clouds have architected their networks with on-ramp locations that are locationally sensitive availability zones that have radius restrictions. And I don't -- the fact that this is a slowing of the Ashburn, not a halting of the Ashburn or a pocket of Ashburn to me says, I don't think that you're going to really be able to move this tremendous center of gravity for the data centers worldwide.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nBill Stein: Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the second quarter as outlined on the last page of our presentation. First, digital transformation remains an important secular driver of our business, which drove another strong quarter of bookings and new business additions to our global platform. The robust demand that we are seeing is reflected in our growing development pipeline. Second, we continue to press our advantage through tactical and organic new market entries as the additions of Israel and Barcelona this quarter will enhance our connectivity offering in the Mediterranean while our investment in a leading colocation and connectivity provider in South Africa is expected to close in short order. Third, we posted stronger-than-expected core FFO per share results, despite stiff FFX headwinds, and we maintained our constant currency core FFO per share forecast for the year, which represents more than 7% growth year-over-year. Last, we are very proud of our team's launch of ServiceFabric, an open and neutral digital marketplace, supporting our customers' digital transformation journey and enabling hybrid multi-cloud requirements. Before signing off, I'd like to thank our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world turning. I hope all of you will stay safe and healthy, and we look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks at upcoming events. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for joining today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Andy Power",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. As Bill noted, we signed total bookings of $113 million with a $12 million contribution from interconnection during the second quarter. New business was healthy across product types as sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection accounted for 42% of the quarter's bookings, while deals larger than a megawatt accounted for 57% of this quarter's bookings. The weighted average lease term on new leases was more than 7 years. EMEA accounted for well over half of this quarter's new business as Frankfurt continued to set the pace in the region, while Paris was also a meaningful contributor. Leasing was also geographically broad based during the quarter with significant contributions from Northern Virginia, Athens, Zurich, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, New York, Dublin and Amsterdam. Reflecting the strength of demand from our customers, we grew the size of our development pipeline to more than 360 megawatts under construction as we started over 100 megawatts of new projects in EMEA and North America, including 35 megawatts in Frankfurt and 38 megawatts in Paris. Nearly 1/3 of our sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection bookings were exported from one region to another, reflecting the value customers realize from our global platform. North America was the most common export region with most of those exports landing in EMEA, followed by Asia Pacific and Latin America. During the second quarter, we added another 108 new customers, bringing the total to more than 1,000 new logos since closing the Interxion transaction a little over two years ago. We see a growing trend of multinational companies deploying and connecting large private data infrastructure footprints on PlatformDIGITAL across multiple regions and metros globally. In terms of specific customer wins during the quarter, a leading IT service provider has experienced the full range of benefits of PlatformDIGITAL from greater performance and scalability to cost savings. These customers expanded their capabilities across three metros in two geographic regions, emphasizing hybrid IT by integrating bare metal and cloud storage. Two leading Global 2000 financial services firms chose PlatformDIGITAL for multi-set deployments in multiple metros across North America and Asia Pacific. One of the world's leading video game developers is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to access our global footprint, scalability and low latency performance. A Global 2000 reinsurer is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL with full-spectrum benefits from the strong community to top cloud providers and robust security being key drivers. And a life sciences organization is switching to PlatformDIGITAL in two markets across North America to reduce network costs while implementing artificial intelligence and high-performance computing applications. Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of signed, but not yet commenced leases, tapered $393 million by quarter end as record level of commenced leases outpaced new signings. A lag between signings and commencements moved up to 13 months due to one larger signing into a new campus development in Frankfurt. Excluding that lease, the sign of commencement period was more in line with our recent experience of about eight months. Moving on to Page 10. We signed $173 million of renewal leases during the second quarter at a positive 3.4% cash re-leasing spreads compared to 3.3% positive last quarter. Renewal rates were positive in each product segment and also in each of our three regions. The majority of total renewals were sub-1 megawatt deals, reflecting the higher unit price contracts that are characteristic of that segment. These renewals climbed by 3% during the second quarter. Among larger deals, rates increased by 1.1%. We are encouraged by the positive trajectory of renewal spreads as well as our constructive engagement with customers on the current inflationary environment and our highly compelling value proposition. In terms of operating performance, total portfolio occupancy rebounded by 60 basis points sequentially, driven by the strong commencements from our record backlog. These improvements in our occupancy come despite our active intention to grow our global colocation inventory in order to meet the growing demand of our expanding customer base who continue to solve for complex IT infrastructure, connectivity and data integration challenges. Same capital cash NOI growth fell 5.5% in the second quarter, primarily driven by a 400 basis point FX headwind in the last leg of a previously discussed sizable churn event. Most of this space has already been re-leased and will more fully commence over the next several quarters, which should drive an improved trend in revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Turning to our risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. 57% of our second quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars with 22% in euros, and 7% in Singapore dollars, 6% British pounds and 2% in Japanese yen. We have also actively mitigated interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt or longer-term fixed-rate financing. Turning back to currency. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen over the last several months, and FX represented a 400 basis point to 450 basis point drag on year-over-year growth in our second quarter reported results from a top to the bottom line, as shown in our constant currency analysis on Page 12. As we've highlighted in the past, currency fluctuations has more typically served as a 50 basis point to 100 basis point headwind or tailwind to earnings in periods of lower volatility. While the outsized depreciation of the euro this year has been a major driver of the headwinds for our P&L, it also represents the lion's share of our $4 billion-plus development pipeline. To be clear, we are operating and then investing locally rather than repatriating proceeds into U.S. dollars. Our operations and our investment pipeline along with our capital funding and locally denominated debt serve as a natural hedge. Of course, given the growth of our global portfolio, along with the heightened FX volatility, we will continue to evaluate our hedging strategy on an ongoing basis. In terms of earnings growth, second quarter core FFO per share of $1.72 was 12% higher on a year-over-year basis and 3% higher sequentially, despite increased FX headwinds. The outperformance versus our prior expectations for the quarter was principally a function of lower-than-expected OpEx spend and a short delay in the closing of the Teraco transaction. Looking forward, we expect core FFO per share will remain under pressure from stiffer than expected FX headwinds given the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. As you can see from the bridge chart on Page 13, we expect FFO will dip down a couple of pennies in the third quarter, principally due to FX, but also as a result of the delayed normalization of OpEx spend, near-term dilution from closing the Teraco transaction and higher interest rates. Accordingly, we have adjusted our underlying guidance assumptions that remain under pressure from foreign currency exchange and interest rates. We are also updating our core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2022 to $6.75 to $6.85, reflecting a $0.05 per share adjustment at the low and high end of the range. Importantly, we are reaffirming our constant currency core FFO per share range of $6.95 to $7.05 for 2022. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, we expect currency headwinds could represent a 300 basis point to 400 basis point drag on full year 2022 revenue and core FFO per share growth. Lastly, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 14. Our reported leverage ticked down to 6.2x as of June 30, while fixed charge coverage increased to 6.0x. Adjusting for the proceeds from the last September's forward equity offering, our pro forma leverage drops to 5.8x, while fixed charge coverage improved to 6.2x. We remain focused on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost of our liabilities. The execution against this financial strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from the pack and enables us to prudently fund our strategic objectives. As you can see from the chart on Page 15, our weighted average debt maturity is nearly six years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.2%. Approximately 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Nearly 90% of our debt is fixed rate and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 15, we have modest near-term debt maturities and a well-laddered maturity schedule for the foreseeable future. Our balance sheet is poised to weather the storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? No... Sorry, go ahead, please. Sure, Eric. So the only thing I was going to add on, and sorry for interruption. Corey's first piece is that the -- if you look at the plus the megawatt signings were most of the hyperscale larger deals land. We did north of 50 megawatts. I think our largest deal is 10 megawatts. We had two around 5 each. So then you had, call it, 30 megawatts of, call it, 1 to 4 megawatts in size, including new landings and expansions from a diverse group of those hyperscalers. So that was the only data point I was going to add to that first question. On your second question, Eric, I would say, you definitely got the scoop in terms of something that's certainly very recently breaking. So I'll try to provide a little context and as well to answer your question. Dominion Energy, which is the primary power provider in that market, informed its major customers very recently regarding the call a potential pinch point in Eastern Loudoun County that could delay deliveries until 2026. So a little fair bit out there. The cause has been described to me as transmission, not generation, i.e. the pipes or the power line infrastructure, not the actual power. The power company did not give definitive answers to most of the relevant questions we and I would think you and others on this call would probably have, but they have been transparent about the potential issue, and they're working very diligently to finalize their assessment and then ultimately communicate their findings. What this means -- I mean while we're still obviously handicapping the potential outcomes, but net-net, if this is to come to fruition as we recently learned, it will obviously likely be a slowdown in delivery of new supply in what is our largest and the largest and most consistently in demand data center market in the world. So I see two possible outcomes there: one being called just a sense of greater pricing power and higher rates tied to the sharp reduction of near-term availability, which should be favorable to Digital given our standing in market; and then also likely to be potentially some winners and losers as it relates to the various developers, including Digital seeking to bring new inventory online in that market. We have -- you kind of go through the rundown of our footprint, call it, 40 megawatts available. You can see in our 500 megawatts of IT load operational as of 2Q. We also then have, call it, 50 megawatts was our last building on that legacy Loudoun campus. I think it's building all in the alphabet that I would say feels like on the lower risk of having an issue. But again, this is very new and subject to change. We have another 200 megawatts on our Manassas campus, which given its position in that market seems on the lower risk side. And then we do have, call it, based on a substation that's already built about 200 megawatts on that Digital Dallas aka Western Lands, call it 1 plus gigawatt site that is called. We got to figure out how that's going to play out in terms of delivery and time line, but I do like our odds, if any, given that we have a sitting substation already there. The steel has been erected, the capital is deployed. Net-net, given our activity in that market, only 24 megawatts of what I just mentioned other than the 40 available would deliver by the fourth quarter of '23, just normal timeline. So I don't see this as a huge impact to '23. And then last but not least, I mean, given other than the tighter market fundamentals, I mean I do like our odds here relative to the competitive set in North Virginia. I mean we're the largest provider of consistently operating with Dominion. We have substations and power infrastructure already built on our campuses, as I mentioned. And I think we are a very important player in that market to help the power company address this problem given our strategically important land parcels and easement. So sorry for the long-winded response, but I didn't feel that, that top would need some clarity given you've kind of just broke that news just yesterday, the day before. Obviously, those things are linked, Matt. So maybe I'll have Corey speak to demand first, and then I can tackle the pricing topic. And then, Matt, on your second question as it relates to pricing, I mean I would say, the commentary is fairly consistent with what Bill and I shared at the NAREIT conference, call it, early June. 2022, on the backs of, call it, us executing on the business and strengthening our value proposition with pricing power accrued to for several years, 2022 has started off -- or the first half, it's certainly been a called pendulum shifting dynamic. The demand has remained robust. Our value proposition is certainly resonating with what you've seen in the results and the pace of inventories had a challenge keeping up with it. And -- but what I just relayed on Loudoun County is called just one of the examples, but there's been others throughout the year as well. And that has allowed us to essentially move our list rates up numerous times, starting at the very end of 2021 through 2022, executed at higher rates across both our larger footprint and small footprint. Push rates on our renewal contracts, which last quarter, we had positive cash mark-to-markets certainly inflection on our cash mark-to-markets. We raised our guidance for the full year, and we followed with a second quarter of cash mark-to-markets as well. And I would say, all these things kind of flow through the entire, call it, commercial engagement with the customers to escalators and other provisions. So pricing has been moving in our favor in the first half of 2022. Sure. Thanks, Michael. So I mean -- and we touched a little bit on this in the script. We've followed this playbook that you've somewhat summarized to your -- I mean often when we go into more volatile parts of the world like Latin America, we do partnerships. So we're not -- our equity is not entirely at risk. We also -- I've put a disproportionate amount of our debt in non-U.S. dollar financings, hitting the Eurobond, Swiss bond, Sterling bond. We have now called close to $4 billion in multicurrency revolver commitments. And so given that -- with that mismatch, you said of having a U.S. stock price in U.S. listed or U.S. currency dividends put more and more, call it, accessing diverse sources of capital and creating natural FX hedges along the way. At the same time, given the rate of return that we're investing relative to at least in more recent history has been very low rates in a lot of these currencies. There has been called cash flow or CFFO leakage. The point I was trying to highlight in the script, and this year, the volatility is just off the charts. I mean the year ago, the parity with the dollar is the highest it's been in several years. And certainly, it's created a headwind to our P&L or core FFO per share. But those same euros that got deflated in our P&L in 2022. We're also going into the ground with Europe being our largest development as part of the portfolio with 221 of our megawatts under construction across the continent or in London. So that is typically in our playbook. We've not followed some others in terms of, call it, just P&L hedging, which is really transacting with foreign currency derivatives to call it take out volatility, and that's been what we've done to date. Now I've also said in the prepared remarks, we're becoming a much more global company. There's no question of that. Call it, 50-plus metros, 27 countries, six continents, and we're in a -- certainly, and not in a long time heightened volatility to currency situation. So I think we're always open to good new ideas and something we'll consider in terms of adding to that FX playbook with various types of derivatives. Am I going to go a lot the euro at this point right now? I'm not sure quite honestly. I mean there could be a chance where some of these non-U.S. currencies or countries start raising their rates, and you have some reversion on some of this at the same time. So -- but that's really been what the past practice is, and we're always looking at trying to figure out new ideas to continue to actively hedge the business and mitigate risk. So the -- the DC REIT, Digital Core REIT, started out with the North America portfolio, but does have a global mandate. And really the selection of the initial assets was, we had the most to pick from in North America, given our history track record, stage of development of those assets. But we do very well expect to globalize it and diversify it with other types of assets in different parts of the world. The Singapore dollar is, I don't think it's 100% linked currency to the U.S. dollar, but there is, I believe, monetary policies or there is some governmental linkage where they try to track the U.S. dollar in terms of currency. So it's not usually a wildly divergent to the U.S. dollar type of currency. I mean, we view that vehicle as a, call it, the home for core assets with -- that are stabilized, fully operational, long-waited average lease terms, and again, will be a global basis. We also have ventures like Ascenty in Latin America, which today is held by our partners Brookfield or Mitsubishi or MC Digital Realty in Japan or our partners, Mitsubishi Corporation, that are certainly a private partner today, but those certainly could evolve into forms of public partnerships over time. So we're always looking at different ways to find the most appropriate both debt and equity capital, private and public, for partners to most efficiently and prudently scale and grow the platform. And thanks, David, for the question around the ServiceFabric. Yes. So we're -- I've kind of talked about this before to provide a little bit of color and background. It's a purpose-built product, right? And it really enhances our customer experience where we're removing technical complexity. And so what that's going to translate to and what we're watching is driving more of that sub-1 megawatt deployments where enterprises are looking to leverage and deploy their hybrid IT or multi-cloud deployment into our facility. So you'll see a lot more of that driving into our portfolio. And also, I think we're going to see us continually extend the reach into deeper sets of assets within our facilities, set differently, both colo and scale, will start to get the true benefit of interconnection, which at the end of the day will allow us to drive more value and higher margins outside of that product. And so that's one of the things we've been tracking extensively. And that utilization, which is another key KPI for us is multi-site, right, where we're starting to sell a blended set of capabilities, both scale and colo all heavily interconnected because that's where the market is headed. And that's where we see a lot of these larger enterprises requiring multi-market access with a highly interconnected backbone with true SLAs, and that's what the ServiceFabric was able to deliver to market there. Jon, I'll take them in reverse because second one is pretty clean. The -- so there's one specific transaction that we've signed that into one of our newest Frankfurt campuses that -- I mean that we're just getting off that plot, getting off the ground on. So that was really what lengthened that out. If you exclude that 1 transaction that I think the book-to-bill is, call it, eight months. So called in-line with our prior track record. And then on your -- on the first question, I mean, definitely, very pleased that the Digital Core REIT team down the gates with -- I think its official first earnings call. Not -- I don't think they have a lot -- too much to report other than the biggest news being making progress. We are making progress collectively on not -- really beyond asset selection to diligence to transactional docs and have really circled assets in three markets as prime candidates to act on for its first life of acquisition growth. And as a reminder, that vehicle, we took public last December with a called underlevered balance sheet. So it has embedded debt capacity called approaching $200 million. So it's not reliant on the equity capital markets out of the gates, but we do hope the equity capital markets respond favorably and continue to support that and because we want to see that vehicle grow, we think that's a great partner vehicle for these core parts of our campuses that fit that vehicle's mandate. Jon, I think it really was just timing. We had a really large commencement quarter in 2Q, and in the back half, you do have a few things, call it, working against us, which are those orange bars. One is, we do -- some of our beat in the second quarter was delayed timing on OpEx spend, which we believe is going to get pushed to the back half of the year, not a new event at Digital. We do see a pickup in interest expense, which everyone can see. And then we are closing Teraco in the coming weeks. And then lastly, call it, 24-ish or 25-ish percent of our core FFO is from like the euro, the sterling, the yen. And on a quarter-over-quarter basis, you've seen degradation in those currencies about 5%, which is the FX headwinds. Hence, while we did change our as-reported guidance, we were able to maintain our constant currency guidance, which is about just north of 7% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Correct. Yes. I mean, I think asking rates on any available capacity in Ashburn, I mean when we got won of this, we went out to our entire field. The dynamics are shifting in Ashburn, and they could shift quite dramatically. So asking rates as well as negotiations on renewal contracts. Sure. So we have on-the-ground teams that speak the local language, worked in the municipalities, network to the business leaders. So in each of these jurisdictions that call it, you mentioned our top of list relationships to make sure that we're in constant communication. That doesn't mean something doesn't pop off like we're experiencing Ashburn episodically, but I would say, we have a very good hand on the pulse of what's going on there. I mean this -- we're supporting critical -- mission-critical infrastructure here for a host of applications that I would say, even in a rationing environment, we're very top of list in terms of access to resources, including power. And we're constantly monitoring the power sources or deliveries for new projects and preparing for even more draconian scenarios in terms of backup fuel sources that could play out given the fact that circumstances of what's going on in Eastern Europe. So -- and that's part of our business, and we have very high stakes customers that I view as partners kind of in line what Bill mentioned who are side-by-side with us on these issues, right? They're with us with, expressing the criticality of them getting live on certain dates. So I think that partnership is -- so we would mutually benefit in terms of being able to derisk our execution on their behalf. Thanks, Frank. Maybe I'll start it off, and then Corey can -- so we've -- I don't think we've seen to date economic softness in our demand. You heard from Corey's description on the forward pipeline and look at our results in terms of new bookings and new logo additions, and I think that's based into that we are really mission-critical priority. We're not a discretionary spend. We are -- we're facilitating performance enhancement. We're facilitating growth through digital transformation for our customers' businesses as well as efficiencies for our customers. So I think that's -- and we've also been through a few economic cycles as well, and the history would say that our trend is our friend on that topic. If you look at the sectors, I think some of the usual ones, in North America, we saw a good amount of financial services. Cybersecurity, in EMEA, we saw this quarter's media telecommunications, initiative cloud and Asia Pacific, similar to what we saw both America and EMEA. So pretty broad brush as well as call more general corporate enterprise across health care, manufacturing, retail, et cetera. So -- and I think that goes back to -- there's a common theme across almost all these industries about what our services are doing to enable their services. Thanks, Nick. The -- I think the returns went down 30 basis points to 40 basis points from 10.4 to about 10, which is really a mix shift. We've added to the base some larger-scale projects that already have or will have some anchor leases that are -- we're certainly on the lower end of our return spectrum. But I would say, the pricing is robust, particularly in Europe, which is one of our tightest regions and has got a numerous markets where we're serving both large and small customers. So I would attribute that's pretty much sole that quarter-over-quarter mix shift."

            "name": "Corey Dyer",
            "content": "Yes. So Eric, this is Corey. Just responding to you. Thanks for the question. And I would tell you that our hyperscale demand and our bookings this quarter were really strong, especially across Europe. Really solid bookings across North America as well as Tokyo with hyperscale, and we haven't really seen a slowdown in it. Going forward, from our pipeline, our pipeline broadly is really strong. It's the highest we've ever had across all of our segments, including hyperscale. So we feel really good about where we are. They're continuing just to take advantage of the offering that we offer them. They're across -- they're with us across about 40 different markets, really utilizing us for the connectivity, the enterprise customers that we have and really taking advantage of our platform on an ongoing basis. So no real slowdown that I see so far. Andy? Sorry, Andy. Yes, Matt, thanks. As far as demand, I mentioned hyperscaler demand earlier. Our demand across the board is really good. We've got it across all four -- all of our regions. I mentioned -- I think Andy mentioned in the prepared remarks, the demand across EMEA that was our largest landing spot for our business. Our pipeline is the highest pipeline I've ever had, and that's on top of a couple of years of huge growth in pipeline and in the business. So we feel really good about where the demand is and where the pipeline is. Enterprise customers are continuing to take advantage of PlatformDIGITAL, make use of the data gravity opportunity in front of them. And I feel like in a hybrid IT world, we're probably the best position to help them do that. And so we've seen our demand just grow across the board, enterprises across all regions and hyperscaler as well. If you look at the sub 1 megawatt, which is your colocation interconnection, that was our third highest quarter ever, right on the back of 2 of our highest quarters ever. So I feel really good about the demand. Yes, I would add to it, Frank, that we had 17 subsegments do more than $1 million in bookings this last quarter, which speaks to the breadth of the demand. We haven't seen a pullback. If you think about the secular trends around service providers driving revenue, enterprises saving money, adding features as far as efficiencies, taking advantage of a hybrid IT world that we're really well positioned for. We haven't seen that affect the demand in any way. Maybe pull forward a little bit, but I haven't seen it really affected because I've got a record pipeline in colo, record pipeline in interconnection, record pipeline in enterprise and just a record pipeline overall. So if there is an effect on inflation, then I would tell you that it's not enough that it keeps them from continuing to come to look to us to build out their infrastructure."

            "content": "Thank you, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Digital Realty is levered to powerful long-term secular demand trends, broadly driven by ongoing digital transformation and the growth in IT and data. We have an unmatched global operating footprint along with a strong development pipeline continue to deepen and expand that footprint to meet our customers' growing needs. Those customers are a growing community of more than 4,000 organizations across the globe, including the world's largest cloud service providers, communication providers that enable the global transport of data, Global 2000 enterprises as well as many multinational and industry-leading companies. Our second quarter results were strong with $113 million of new bookings and core FFO per share of $1.72, a 12% increase over the second quarter of last year and a 3% sequential increase, despite stiff FX headwinds. The dialogue with our customers surrounding the evolving supply-demand dynamic and our compelling value proposition has started to translate with price increases driving positive cash renewals, supporting our push for appropriate rent escalators and helping to maintain stable development returns. Despite generally higher prices, demand for data center solutions remains strong around the world with notable productivity in each of our regions. EMEA was a standout this quarter with all 5 of our largest deals landing in the region as the world's leading cloud service providers continued to utilize our platform to expand their infrastructure and support their growing needs. Looking forward, our pipeline remains robust as enterprises continue their digital transformation with a growing preference for hybrid cloud architecture, while cloud and connectivity providers continue to expand their infrastructure to better serve their customers around the world. Andy will provide more color on our results shortly. But first, I want to touch on the recent launch of ServiceFabric Connect, an open interconnection solution and orchestration platform designed to support the wider industry shift to a hybrid data-centric architecture. This product launch empowers our enterprise and service provider customers to connect to anyone, anywhere at any time through an open and neutral digital marketplace. ServiceFabric Connect is the first of several related interconnection-oriented products that we have on our roadmap and was launched with availability in over 30 markets around the world. We are excited to bring this product to life, and we look forward to delivering these enhanced connectivity benefits to our customers. Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform through a combination of organic new market entries that enhance our global productivity offerings as well as existing market expansions that are designed to meet our customers' longer-term capacity and connectivity solution requirements. Along these lines, in the second quarter, we acquired land in three European markets for ground-up development to support strong demand. In addition, we announced our entry into Israel with the formation of a joint venture with Mivne, a leading Israeli real estate group. Together, we plan to develop a data center campus in Petah Tikvah, the primary connectivity hub in Israel. Our presence in Israel will complement our facilities across the Mediterranean and will support the emergence of new connectivity routes that subsea cable operators are developing between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. Finally, we have received the necessary regulatory approval in South Africa to close on the acquisition of Teraco, a leading colocation and interconnection provider in South Africa. We now expect to close the transaction within the next two weeks. Our active development pipeline remains robust and grew by more than 10% sequentially with 41 projects underway, supporting over 360 megawatts of IT capacity in 18 strategically important metros around the world. More than half of this capacity is already presold, reflecting strong customer demand. Given the dynamism of the current environment, we know how important it is to make sure that we are being appropriately compensated for the elevated risk throughout the capital markets and the broader economy. We have sought to mitigate these risks through our VMI program, appropriate pricing adjustments and CPI-based rent escalators that help insulate us from the impact of higher operating costs throughout the life of our customer contracts. Finally, as we have discussed in the past, we remain focused on opportunistically culling our portfolio. Since the end of 2019, we have monetized over $4 billion of assets through a combination of outright sales, joint ventures, and more recently, through the contributions to our Singaporean Capital Partner Digital Core REIT. We view these sales and contributions as an important source of capital raising as we continue to expand our diverse global portfolio and accelerate our growth. Before turning it over to Andy, I'd like to highlight an important update to our Board and then discuss the success we're having with other ESG initiatives shown on Page 5 of our earnings presentation. In June, Mary Hogan Preusse, a 30-year REIT industry veteran was named Chairman of the Board, succeeding Laurence Chapman. Mary has served on our Board since 2017 and has played a critical role in driving Digital Realty's expansion and innovation as we have pursued our transformation to being a global full spectrum data center provider. We are fortunate that Laurence will continue to serve on our Board of Directors to provide his deep well of experience, understanding and leadership. Mary's appointment aligns with Digital Realty's commitment to strong governance, our focus on sustainability and the aim to balance fresh thinking with experience and continuity. I look forward to working with Mary in her new role. We also continue to advance the ball towards our sustainability goals in the second quarter. In addition to publishing our fourth annual ESG report, we became the first data center operator to achieve the milestone of 1 gigawatt of sustainably certified data center capacity. We also further expanded our renewable portfolio in the U.S. by contracting for 158 megawatts of new solar energy before the recent run-up in power prices, supporting our data centers in California and Georgia. Globally, 119 of our data centers are powered by 100% renewable energy. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Sure. So just to be clear, the CPI-based returns are in the escalators. So we've gone from -- we're going from fixed annual increases to increases that are structured with the minimums with floors and then CPI Index increases above the floor and typically to some cap. So an example would be a 2% floor with a CPI-based increase above that to, say, 6% as a cap, and that's on an annual basis. And so we feel that, that provides some hedge for us for inflation. And then just keep in mind, relative to inflation that over 90% of our power costs are passed through, and that obviously, has been subject to a lot of inflationary pressure. In terms of the base rents, that's more a function of supply and demand in any given market. So -- and with supply chain challenges, I would say, supply is more challenged and demand continues at a very high pace. So that plus the increasing input costs on new builds not us so much because of our VMI program, but certainly, our competitors whether it's materials and/or labor. And our customers that are building their own are certainly experiencing these same pressures, it's pretty easy to justify higher base rates when you're talking to customers. Does that answer your question? Thanks, Aryeh. So I mean -- and then -- again, it's still subject to change because this is very new or late breaking, but it's going to paint a picture where we believe there's still going to be robust demand in a tightened or slowed supply environment. So -- and those economics mean rates typically rise and economics accrue to the providers. We -- I don't -- first and foremost, I don't see people leaving Ashburn for this delay. This isn't like a permanent feature of Ashburn, this is a, call it, bottleneck of a portion of Ashburn. And you've got an incredible amount of customers, infrastructures, network Ashburn grew to where it is for many reasons. And I don't see demand just running away from in the face of this. I think the available capacity is going to become more precious. Hence, that call it, 40 megawatts of operational that we have today is more precious. And if we're able to proceed and bringing on new capacity that I outlined, that becomes more precious. And if we look at our expirations, we've got about 18 or 17 megawatts respond in the back half of this year. Another 75 in '23. Another 58 in '24. Another 54 in '25, so call it north of 200 over the next through the end of '25, which is a normal amount of role for us, but Ashburn is our largest market. So we have a lot of microwatts rolling over the ensuing years. Simon, I'll speak to the self-build question. So frankly, we -- the pipe scalers have been building their own for a long time, I'd say, for the last 10 years. And they have pursued what we call a hybrid model. So they have self-build, and they have -- they lease from third parties. That -- how much they do at any given time varies, and they don't all do it at the same time. So party A might be doing 100% third-party leasing and no self-building while party B is relying mostly on self-build. In the next year, they could change it up. But I would say, in the current environment, so in the current environment meaning that an environment that's challenged by supply chain and inflation, I think we're seeing an increased reliance on third-party leasing, right? And that's because we are as good as anybody at managing in what is, I would characterize it as a more challenging environment. And do you want to handle the power question in Europe. So I'm not sure I think diversification trend would likely have been outside of like that Northern Virginia part of the world, quite honestly. And we've got shells in Atlanta, we've got capacity in the call it the suburbs of New York City and Chicago and Dallas. So there's -- I think you could see a spillover effect on a temporary basis to other parts of the United States. But I don't think you're going to see a running to other cities in Virginia, quite honestly. And I don't -- I mean, the -- this is locationally sensitive workloads, right? The infrastructure and networking has been in the ground and been built upon and grown upon for years and years in Ashburn. The clouds have architected their networks with on-ramp locations that are locationally sensitive availability zones that have radius restrictions. And I don't -- the fact that this is a slowing of the Ashburn, not a halting of the Ashburn or a pocket of Ashburn to me says, I don't think that you're going to really be able to move this tremendous center of gravity for the data centers worldwide. Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the second quarter as outlined on the last page of our presentation. First, digital transformation remains an important secular driver of our business, which drove another strong quarter of bookings and new business additions to our global platform. The robust demand that we are seeing is reflected in our growing development pipeline. Second, we continue to press our advantage through tactical and organic new market entries as the additions of Israel and Barcelona this quarter will enhance our connectivity offering in the Mediterranean while our investment in a leading colocation and connectivity provider in South Africa is expected to close in short order. Third, we posted stronger-than-expected core FFO per share results, despite stiff FFX headwinds, and we maintained our constant currency core FFO per share forecast for the year, which represents more than 7% growth year-over-year. Last, we are very proud of our team's launch of ServiceFabric, an open and neutral digital marketplace, supporting our customers' digital transformation journey and enabling hybrid multi-cloud requirements. Before signing off, I'd like to thank our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world turning. I hope all of you will stay safe and healthy, and we look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks at upcoming events. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you, operator and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and President and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, let me offer a few key takeaways from our first quarter. First, we kicked off the year on a high note with record bookings of $167 million, led by strength in the leases greater than 1 megawatt and supported by steady bookings in the 0 to 1 megawatt and interconnection category. Second, we saw a notable and broad-based improvement in our re-leasing spreads in the quarter, reflecting a healthier pricing environment but also the active engagement we are having with customers on the Digital Realty value proposition. Third, we remain poised to continue our expansion in Africa with plans to close our investment in Teraco later this quarter. And finally, our core FFO per share results exceeded consensus' expectations despite FX-related headwinds. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein.\nBill Stein: Thanks, Jordan and welcome to the Digital team. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework and we made further progress on each front during the first quarter. First, we continue to globalize our business with the announcement of our definitive agreement to acquire a majority stake in Teraco in early January. We also continue to grow our business organically around the world. We posted another record quarter of global bookings totaling $167 million of annualized rent, including our second highest quarter in each of the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, together with another solid quarter in EMEA. Bookings this quarter were led by strong results in the greater than 1 megawatt category, particularly in the Americas, while sub-1-megawatt bookings remain steady and in line with our 2021 average. Let's discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3 of our earnings presentation. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment and simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and broader society while advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders. During the first quarter, Digital Realty was named one of America's Most Just Companies and third overall in the real estate industry by Just Capital and CNBC. We also maintained our status as a member of the FTSE4Good Index which measures the performance of companies demonstrating strong ESG practices, continuing our record of recognition for our leading sustainability initiatives. During the first quarter of 2022, Digital Realty continued our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts through our employee-led DEI council which seeks to promote inclusion and create opportunities for each of our employee communities. Through the DEI council, Digital Realty has expanded its philanthropy and community engagement activities with strategic donations and partnerships with global charitable organizations. Digital Realty has also taken a stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and those impacted by the Russian vision. We do not have any data centers or operations in Russia or Ukraine and our company will abide by sanctions against Russia. Until the peaceful and legal resolution of this conflict, we will not invest in Russia. Furthermore, we are funding philanthropic organizations to support Ukrainian refugees, those displaced within Ukraine and the growing humanitarian crisis. Let's turn our investment activity to Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform. We acquired land in 3 markets for organic development, including the first location for our joint venture with Brookfield in India, along with 2 parcels in Europe to support the strong demand in that region. After the quarter, we purchased 3 additional land parcels in Europe, including a beachhead in Barcelona, marking our organic entry into this complementary Mediterranean metro. Our active development pipeline reached an all-time high in the quarter with 44 projects underway supporting over 300 megawatts in of IT capacity in 28 metros around the world. 58% of this capacity is already presold, reflecting strong customer demand. We've expanded our development in the Americas, adding further capacity in New York, Northern Virginia and Toronto. Demand remains very strong in EMEA and we are continuing to invest across this region with active development projects in 17 of our 18 markets. Frankfurt is still the most active development market in EMEA, followed by Paris. We continue to make good progress toward closing the Teraco transaction which we still expect to close in the first half of this year. Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. We are also proactively managing risks to help insulate Digital Realty against the impact of the current inflationary and rising interest rate environment. We are well protected against the impact of rising energy costs given the pass-through nature of substantially all of our customer contracts and we are effectively managing against rising input costs through our vendor-managed inventory program and the expansion of our prepurchase equipment pool. We are constructively engaging with new and existing customers on the impact of rising costs which is translating into better pricing. This is partly reflected in the broad-based and improved cash leasing spreads we experienced in the first quarter but is also showing up in new lease transactions across most of our markets. Our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on Platform Digital. Our customers continue to solve the most complex IT infrastructure in activity and data integration challenges. We see a growing trend of multinational companies across all segments deploying and connecting large private data infrastructure footprints on platform digital across multiple regions and metros globally. Recently, industry research firm, IDC, updated their global data sphere forecast for 2025, Predicting the annual data creation rate will exceed 180 zettabytes per year or roughly triple the '21 rate. IDC concludes that companies of all sizes will need to prioritize data sharing and security to improve business resiliency and create a differentiated experience for their customers. Earlier this week, we published our inaugural Global Data Insights survey with strategic insights from 7,200 companies across 23 countries and 9 industries about the role of data in their business agenda. According to the survey, 70% of these companies are prioritizing secure data exchange in their current plans. The global data survey will augment our Data Gravity Index to provide telemetry for our customers, partners and their respective industries as they evolve their business platforms to harness the power of data and co-located infrastructure to unlock a new era of growth through connected data communities. In addition, Digital Realty recently joined the iMasons Climate Accord as a founding member. This coalition of leading companies is united in their views on carbon reduction in digital infrastructure. The group will establish an independent governing body to define an open standard that provides transparency, traceability and measurement of progress toward reducing carbon from sourced power and embodied carbon found in materials, products and operations of digital infrastructure. This is another great example of our commitment to the continuous innovation and execution of our platform digital road map to provide a sustainable and differentiated value proposition for our customers, partners and the broader industry. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.\nAndy Power: Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. As Bill noted, we signed total bookings of $167 million with an $11 million contribution from interconnection during the first quarter. This is our second consecutive quarterly record and the seventh time in the last 8 quarters we have delivered bookings over $100 million. While our new business was healthy across product types, larger deals accounted for 70% of the quarter's bookings, while sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection accounted for 30% of the total. The weighted average lease term on new leases was more than 7 years. Demand was particularly strong in the Americas with Northern Virginia and Toronto leading the way. Fundamentals continue to tighten in both metros, as reflected by the high levels of pre-leasing on our development pipeline. In EMEA, Frankfurt remains the standout, while in APAC, demand remains robust in Singapore and Japan. Nearly 1/3 of our sub-1-megawatt plus interconnection bookings were exported from one region to another, reflecting the value customers realize from our global platform. North America was the most common export region, with most of those exports landing in EMEA followed by Asia Pacific and Latin America. We landed 128 new logos during the first quarter, maintaining the momentum we have built over the last several quarters which has been a strong validation of Platform Digital and our global strategy. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, Zenlayer, a global edge cloud provider, is expanding on Platform Digital across 3 continents to improve its geographic coverage, scale and access to customer communities across various industries. A Global 2000 consumer financial services firm continue to expand with Digital Realty, leveraging Platform Digital's full suite of capabilities, including rationalizing data centers, implementing IT controls and interconnecting with key business communities. Box Technologies, a leading innovator of high-performance desktop-as-a-service applications, is deploying on Platform Digital, supporting enterprise data architecture applications, serving the manufacturing, construction and engineering industries. A leading IT company is leveraging our full product spectrum by utilizing our connectivity offerings to support data exchange across 3 metros in North America and Lat Am to improve performance and scalability and reduce costs. Magnite, a global independent advertising platform is expanding our platform digital in multiple metros across EMEA to enable their hybrid IT transformation. And a Global 2000 reinsurer selected Platform Digital for mainframe migration with seamless connectivity to top cloud providers and robust security being key drivers. Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced grew by 15% and from $378 million to a record $436 million, driven by the strong first quarter signings which outpaced commencements. The lag between signings and commencements moderated to 7 months with nearly 2/3 of our $436 million backlog scheduled to commence later this year. Moving on to Page 10. We signed $177 million of renewal leases during the first quarter at a positive 3.3% cash re-leasing spread. Renewal rates were positive across the board, were spread in the black across product types in all 3 regions. 2/3 of total renewals were sub-1-megawatt deals, resulting in a smaller sample size for the 1-plus megawatt category in the quarter. Excluding one larger short-term extension, our cash renewal spread would have been positive 2.5%. We are encouraged by the positive trajectory on renewal spreads as well as constructive engagement with customers on the current inflationary environment and our highly compelling value proposition. In terms of operating performance, portfolio occupancy ticked down by 30 basis points sequentially, driven by previously reported churn events, most of which has already been re-leased. Consistent with our full year guidance, same capital cash NOI growth was negative 3.1% in the first quarter, primarily driven by 220 basis points of FX headwinds, the timing of no move-outs and a customer bankruptcy. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen over the last several months and FX represented a 200 to 250 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our first quarter reported results from the top to the bottom line, as shown on Page 11. Our operations, along with our capital funding and locally denominated debt act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. Turning to our risk mitigation strategies on Page 12. A little less than 60% of our first quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, followed by approximately 25% in euros and roughly 5% each in Singapore dollars and British pounds. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in SOFR would have roughly a 75 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, first quarter core FFO per share of $1.67 was flat on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Despite FX headwinds, a $0.01 impact related to a customer bankruptcy and a difficult comp due to the contribution of assets to digital core REIT. In terms of the quarterly run rate, we expect the split between the first half of the year and the second half of the year to be approximately $49.51. In other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page 13, we expect to dip down a couple of pennies in the second quarter due to normalized OpEx spending and near-term dilution from closing the Teraco transaction before bouncing back in the second half of the year as leases from a record backlog commenced. Most of the drivers underlying our guidance remain unchanged but given the improving pricing environment, we are bumping up our outlook for cash re-leasing spreads for the full year to slightly positive compared to flat last quarter. We are maintaining our existing core FFO per share range of $6.80 to $6.90 despite the customer bankruptcy and stiffer FX headwinds. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, we expect currency headwinds could represent a 250 to 300 basis point drag on full year 2022 revenue and core FFO per share growth. Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 14. We were active again in the capital markets during the first quarter. We took advantage of favorable OEM market conditions to lock in EUR 750 million at 1.375% for 10.5 years. And later in the quarter, we completed a dual tranche Swiss bond offering, raising a total of CHF 250 million at a blended coupon of approximately 1.25%. We used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem 450 million of bonds at 4.75%. Reported leverage ratio is 6.3x while fixed charge coverage is 5.5x. Adjusting for the proceeds from the forward equity offering last September, our pro forma leverage ratio drops to 5.9x, while fixed charge coverage improves to 5.7x. We continue to execute our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 15, our weighted average debt maturity is over 6 years and our weighted average coupon is 2.2%. A little over 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also acting as a natural FX hedge for investments outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate, guarding against a fixed a rising rate environment and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 15, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.\nJon Atkin: Two questions. I wanted to find out a little bit about the elevated demand and the record leasing. And I wondered how much of that you might attribute to in the greater than 1 megawatt category, any kind of a shift in the mix between building, self-building and leasing on the part of the hyperscalers. And then the second question around pricing, given higher costs and some of the developments that you mentioned, do you see this as really having the impact of protecting your target development yields given the higher cost or perhaps aiming to enhance your target yields?\nBill Stein: Well, Corey will start off. Jon, thanks for the question on the ad product demand. I'll pick up hyperscale and I think Bill will tackle the second part of your question.\nCorey Dyer: Yes. So we'll be pretty comprehensive here with our answer to you, Jonathan. Thanks for the question. I would tell you that with regard to the enterprise demand, we've got customers that are just being driven to the business needs and opportunities that are in front of us. Bill mentioned earlier we just published our Global Data Insights survey with data becoming a critical agenda topic for all the businesses and it raised really 5 key things. Data was pervasive, it's the business agenda, it requires aggregation and control and it's localizing and it's a data first strategy's win. And so we're seeing that is really what's driving a lot of the demand across the enterprise. As far as where is it happening from a regional perspective, if you even want to do a baseball analogy, sometimes you guys ask, I'd say North America is probably middle innings with a healthy bullpen that you ought to have in it. And then, I'd tell you that EMEA is probably third inning, maybe anything behind APAC, a little behind that as customers are still really waking to the data opportunity that's right above all of us and it was really highlighted in the index that we just did in that survey. I'd also tell you that we had really strong exports across all regions which was great. And then we're seeing an uptick in all the multi-market and multi-region wins. So really happy with the enterprise. I'll let Andy give you a little bit of perspective on the hyperscalers.\nAndy Power: Thanks again, Jon. The -- I mean I think we've now had a several -- I think in the prepared remarks, 7 or 8 quarters north of $100 million of gap which speaks to consistent demand in the hyperscale being a major component of that. You had a record, call it -- in the fourth quarter, you had another record and these records, I'll call it, demonstrably higher than the prior, call it, $100 million averages. If your question about the self-build versus procuring through Digital Realty or other providers, I don't think the pendulum has swung to a point where the cell builds off the table. But I would think in times like today, when there's increased volatility, supply chain issues, a war in Eastern Europe, having a global platform to support hyperscaler growth across now 50 metropolitan areas in 26 countries, it's a tremendous value-add to our hyperscale customers. And I think their demand has been consistent for the last several quarters, with some peaks along the way and we see the forecast remaining quite strong as well.\nBill Stein: Relative to pricing, Jon, pricing dynamics are clearly market specific and will depend on both supply and demand in each market. So when demand exceeds supply, we've been able to raise our prices. And this is reflected in our results. So for example, if you look at our first quarter leasing results in Northern Virginia, our average prices were about 6% higher than just last quarter in the fourth quarter. That market is increasingly tightening. We're also fortunate to be in a position where we're well insulated from the increased costs on our current development pipeline and that's because of our contracts with suppliers and our vendor managed inventory program. So -- and this has obviously helped us not just in terms of cost but to assure that we do have the supply to continue around the world.\nJon Atkin: And then lastly, just on the bankruptcy filing from earlier in April that had some implications for digital core REIT and then kind of a letter of guarantee from you. This has been kind of going on for a couple of years but any sort of an update with respect to that customer and your direct exposure? Are they current on payments, what are you sort of anticipating with respect to that tenant?\nAndy Power: Sure. we'll give you an extra question here. So that customer from a current -- on receivables, they had a very modest amount of called pre-petition outstanding receivables. They were regularly current paying customer, not a late paying customer and they're fairly pretty well up to date, a couple of million, I would say and really concentrated in the U.K. was outstanding when they entered bankruptcy. Obviously, they're going to go through a process under U.K. administration, in the U.S. and also Canada. That will play out over several months. The -- I think if you take a step back, really what -- I think what's more relevant is that customer obviously got, call it, sideswiped by 2 particular issues. One, obviously, a part of their business what's not common in our customer base was disaster recovery for office which has obviously got impacted by the Zoom-ification during the pandemic; and then secondly, the elevated power prices, especially in Europe at incremental liquidity constraints. I don't see that as a really recurring theme in our customer base, especially the first piece of what I described. And this customer is going to obviously work through with this bankruptcy process. And I think we've been taking active steps not just related to this customer but in general, to continue to streamline and focus our portfolio on core assets that we have -- we see robust and long-term demand, multicustomer facilities, less single stand-alone facilities. And quite frankly, why we entered the colocation interconnection business several years ago was not only was the growth to our business but also to be prepared in the event that some of our colocation resellers ran into financial times and we had to step in and support their end customers only in the event that leases are rejected, obviously.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMichael Rollins: So one follow-up and one question. So on the follow-up, when you're talking about leasing, can you unpack the opportunities to lease up the existing inventory? And how much of the bookings you're seeing go towards that and where occupancy on the existing portfolio can get over the next 12 to 24 months? And then just a second question, I think it's Page 20 in the supplemental, the same-store numbers. How does that look if you were to put that on a constant currency basis in terms of the rental performance on the revenue side? And how does that look over the next 12 months as you talked about the pricing opportunities and some of the positive renewals that you're seeing?\nAndy Power: Thanks, Michael. So let me try -- there's a couple of numbers questions in there. So let me start and try to get through some of those and then also hand off on the leasing question a little bit to Corey as well. So in reverse, in our earnings deck, we tried to provide both as reported and constant currency. And we also tried to show adjustments for apples and oranges in comparisons on a year-over-year basis. So you could see that the second set of bars on that chart has had our as reported same-store cash NOI down negative 3% which was in line with our guidance. On a constant currency basis, it's down 90 basis points. And the hit I just called out in terms of the bankruptcy customer, call it, $4 million, $5 million or whatever, that was -- I think it's about 60 -- almost 70 basis points of that negative 90. Those are all on an NOI basis. I apologize I don't have the revenue equivalent off the top of my head. That same pool is also getting impacted by a year-over-year elevated property taxes which we previously mentioned. And more importantly, we're re-leasing vacated capacity which I think dovetails with your first question. We've made a concerted effort to focus more and more of our leasing wherever possible and to already build infrastructure given the high flow-through of contribution of that revenue into that capacity and having an installed base that wants to expand with adjacency or grow in our campuses is always a little bit easier than going out and landing a new customer. In terms of the leasing into that capacity, if you basically just take the signed already in this quarter or last quarter or 2 that has not commenced to hit our occupancy and that would bring our same-store occupancy up about 80 basis points by itself, i.e., the leases are signed, they're just literally waiting for the customers to move in throughout the year. That obviously is going to flow through into our '22 results in a partial year period and then a full year period in '23. We are -- as I mentioned, we're very focused on re-leasing that vacant capacity. We're incentivizing wherever possible. And quite honestly, some of the supply-demand dynamics that are playing out industry-wide in addition to execution against our platform are really lending itself to fill that up at a more accelerated pace. I think we did about 20-plus megawatts into that type of vacated capacity, i.e., they weren't the first customer in that suite in the first quarter of this year. And that is a rapidly accelerated pace relative to, call it, prior year velocity.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew Niknam: Just two, if I could. First, on some of the strength in hyperscale, I'm just wondering, it's beyond just 1Q. Are you sort of sensing any pull forward of demand from customers given looming concerns around supply chain constraints? Or do you sense that the strength here is more sustainable? And then just to go back to Michael's question also on one of the slides, Slide 11, I think you outlined core FFO per share growth on a normalized sort of constant currency basis this year would be north of 7%. I know, Andy, I think in the past, you've talked about mid- to high single core FFO per share growth on a forward basis. Just wondering, all else equal, as we start thinking about 2023, without giving specific guidance, is that sort of 7-ish percent rate that's on the Slide 22, a good sort of framework or start point to think about as we think beyond this year?\nCorey Dyer: Matt, this is Corey. I'll take the first 2 questions, I think, that you had, one being around the supply chain impacts and then also the hyperscale demand. I'll take them in that order, if that helps you out. And as Andy mentioned kind of at the beginning of the commentary, our sales and marketing engine just continues to build up our demand and our pipeline growth, right? And I would tell you that the supply chain, inflation, energy costs has not really been a factor in that. Our customers really are thinking through what they do and how they source those materials so that they're setting up their commencement dates ahead of it with us. So they're just being really thoughtful about it and thinking through these concerns. And what I think it's done is actually had us create better dialogue with our customers to think through how we're going to solve this and create probably a little bit more demand for us as they think through it but it hasn't negatively impacted it at all. As far as the hyperscale demand, we're really still experiencing really strong demand from the hyperscalers across all regions, right? They work with us to help their speed to market. We're with them increasingly around their business impairs around this data opportunity the CSPs are helping all the enterprises with. We're seeing larger deal sizes at CSPs as they work to keep up with demand. So we have a really healthy pipeline for the remainder of the year. And I'd also say there's probably a dozen or so of these CSPs and more of them emerging in Asia and across the board. It's also helping us increase our demand on our pipeline for it. So really happy with both of those and where we're seeing the trajectory.\nAndy Power: And then, Matt, on your second question, I mean we just reported the first 1 quarter of 2022. So obviously, not prepared to put 2023 guidance out just yet. But obviously -- but you can see on a constant currency basis, we're now north of 7% on the bottom line core FFO per share that extraordinary FX headwinds this year, if you look back the last several years, you had, call it, currency fluctuations in the, call it, 2 to 5 or so percent. And this year, the year, call it, soon to be like 9% delta. The headwinds -- or could be a tailwind, usually we're in the 50 to 75 basis points range. And now we're, call it, north of 200 basis points of headwinds. I think -- look, the goal from the beginning of the year as well as last year is to continue to accelerate bottom line's earnings growth. Last year, we came out of the gate with guidance of 4%. We ended up with 5%. This year, we came out with guidance of 5% which we are affirming in this call, despite these FX headwinds as well despite a customer bankruptcy. And our goal is to kind of again keep consistently putting up mid- to high single digits bottom line growth.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: Andy, I wondered if you could just talk about the balance sheet a little bit. You talked about bringing the pro forma leverage down to 5.9x. How are you thinking about, given the sort of interest rate environment, the uncertainty? Where do you want to have that over the next few years? And I think you still have guidance for dispositions during the year. Again, how are you thinking about both the sizing of dispositions and what vehicles you might use for that?\nAndy Power: Thanks, Simon. So first and foremost, better to be lucky than smart. We are out of the gates with a sizable EUR 750 million bond literally the first, I think, business day of 2022 and priced 10.5-year paper in the 1-plus percent, call it, category. So pleased with that. Followed that up with even more volatile start of the year, a Swiss bond offering which, again, both of those, I think, diversifying our source of capital, increasing our FX hedge, locking in long-duration debt at attractive cost of capital. We also increased our revolving credit facility by an incremental $750-ish million during the quarter, just a full start of liquidity given the broader uncertainty in backdrop. We still have not drawn down or close to $1 billion equity forward just yet. We look to close on Teraco in the next couple of months or so, or actually probably a month or 2, I guess. And then back half of the year in terms of capital sources on the leverage side to again keep us in line in terms of our targeted net debt to EBITDA. We will obviously evaluate equity as an alternative but right now at these current levels, I think the continued disposition of noncore assets as well as incremental contributions of core assets from our portfolio to digital core REIT in the back half of the year are going to be our primary funding mechanisms. And we made some great progress, obviously getting Digital Realty through its first earnings season and also working on identifying that next leg of assets to continue to grow and diversify and strengthen Digital Realty.\nSimon Flannery: Great. And how do you -- how are you seeing these sort of M&A multiples given the interest rate environment? Any change there?\nGreg Wright: Yes. Simon, it's Greg. Look, to date, I'd say the private market seems to be lagging the public markets a little bit and I don't think that's uncommon. I think the public markets usually lead. But look, I think if rates stay up over time, you should start to see multiples come down. But right now, we see a lot of stuff out there but it feels as though the private market multiples have been a little sticky high at this point.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Eric Rasmussen with Stifel.\nErik Rasmussen: So we've heard some very large deals in the first quarter. What's changed in the market that would lead to these massive deals? And then maybe with that, how do you plan for this?\nAndy Power: Eric, I think -- I assume you're seeing large leases, large multiple megawatt leases. I mean -- I think the theme -- the growth in the sizing of customer requirements on the hyperscale front has been building for some time, not necessarily a completely overnight phenomenon. And I think you witnessed in the first quarter this year or the fourth quarter of last year, other quarters of last year and the year prior. I think you guys are seeing this continued cloud adoption broadly, continued opening of new regions, opening an offering of new services. And you're seeing this digital transformation wave in the cloud customers despite the volatility and the uncertainty of an economic backdrop or the war and the like leaning in and securing infrastructure to future-proof their runway for their end customers. So, it doesn't feel like the -- one record quarter after another is a little bit of an unusual outcome. But it doesn't feel like the pace of demand is really slowing on the hyperscale front. And I think what's also helped in that backdrop of this continuing steady demand, it's just become more challenging to be a provider. You have the inflationary pressures, you have supply chain challenges, you have labor challenges and you even have moratoriums in certain parts of the world see some demand. And I think going to the part of how do you get ahead of this is that you'd be in this business for the long run, with Digital Realty been in this business for almost 20 years. You build a scale and capital sources to support our customers through good times and bad. You make sure you have the runway to future-proof their growth. That's the acres and acres of often contiguous expansion capacity. You secure your supply chains so that you're on time and under budget, wherever possible and be that trusted infrastructure partner. I think those are the key ingredients to our recipe.\nErik Rasmussen: Great. And then maybe just my second question. As it relates to the development pipeline which is very active, besides the chip shortages, what's happening on the construction side, whether it's getting the right materials or having the proper staffing, especially considering the demand backdrop and maybe even increased competition in some markets that you might be seeing.\nChris Sharp: Yes. No. Thanks, Eric. This is Chris. Yes, it's something that we've been constantly looking at. And just to echo Andy's comments a little bit earlier, we've always looked at long-term engagements with our construction teams and with our suppliers. And so the continued development pipeline that we've been putting to market, it's really paid off, right, where we keep the same crews on the projects and we roll into new projects and just watching how that grows. I'd also say we have the gold standard in VMI, vendor-managed inventory, for building out a lot of this infrastructure. So even before some of the supply constraints hit us, we started ramping up the budgets for that. And I think one of the other great things with being with digital is we've been able to expand the program to be able to support our customer needs. And so now it's become a differentiator in the market where we're now able to provide customer -- some customer equipment to help them procure their infrastructure. And so it's just something that we've been able to plan ahead of and we're constantly looking at different routes to market with, particularly the chip shortages and things like that, looking at the secondary markets, where leveraging a lot of secondary equipment that's been refurbished and put a warranty against it. It's been able to allow a lot of customers to overcome some of those challenges. But it's something we're constantly watching and looking at and making sure that we have the best capabilities and, quite frankly, equipment infrastructure available to our customers and for our own builds on a global basis. So that's something that we're very proud about.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo.\nEric Luebchow: Curious about your development pipeline. It looks like you're almost 60% pre-leased across the entire globe and over 80% in North America. So are you fairly comfortable with your inventory position today? Or if we do see a continuation of this large hyperscale demand, might you end up toward the higher end or even above the development CapEx guide you laid out?\nAndy Power: Thanks, Eric. I mean that is obviously a constantly evolving schedule where we're adding projects in terms of new starts and we're subtracting projects that are delivering and being commissioned for customers and opening at high levels of pre-leasing. It's a combination of offices or colocation product as well as our scale and hyperscale dedicated data halls. We're trying to always stay ahead of the game, focusing on the longest lead time parts of development. Obviously, land procurement, hence the acreage I mentioned previously, followed by shelves. And then Chris just touched on our, call it, overall infrastructure and build-outs. I don't -- I think when you look at the combination of our current stabilized portfolio that has availability that we're actively leasing into our shelves and their delivery schedules and as well as our land, I feel good. There's always a market or 2 that will be a little tighter than I would like but I feel I think probably more in terms of the hyperscale front that these larger deals, you're often engaging in contracting at very early stages of those projects. So you don't need to necessarily have a finished data hall in order to sell that capacity, hence having that land bank and shelves coming online are very good selling tools by themselves.\nEric Luebchow: And just 1 follow-up on the renewal spreads on mark-to-market. Do you think we're at the point now where those should continue to only improve after this year? And how much of that might be due to just improving the broadly improving pricing environment or perhaps a kind of better mix of leases in the next couple of years, either more international, more enterprise and fewer above-market leases?\nAndy Power: Yes. So we've obviously been working through this for some time. I would say, over the last several quarters, the -- call it, the mix was certainly helping us as we've kind of chopped through some of our largest customers, major expirations, as we got through more of the North America and more -- onto more international mix, having the less than a megawatt more highly connected destinations, legacy interaction, Westin, Telx, etcetera, being more -- a bigger piece of the puzzle. And last year, we came in a little bit better than we had guidance but albeit negative. This year, we guided to flat which is a year-over-year sequential improvement. And I think what you're seeing in this quarter are a few things. On the one hand, I'm not -- I wouldn't say that I can rule out that we'll never have a negative cash mark-to-market on any given product for the next several quarters. I don't think we're at that level of positive yet. But you saw positive across the board in the plus less than a megawatt categories. It was -- in the less than a megawatt which is the largest piece of it, it was up versus the LTM, about 130 basis points, cut north of 2.5% which is a pretty sizable move. And we've guided now for the full portfolio for 2022, slightly positive. So again, not -- I can't tell you we're fully done with never having a negative cash mark-to-market but the trend is certainly playing out which I would say is a combination of mix and also the broader pricing ratch up where the pendulum of pricing is swinging slightly more and more back to Digital Realty.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond James.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Rob [ph] on for Frank. Where did you guys end the quarter on a quote of varying heads? And have you seen any hiring issues in sales or across any other parts of the business to help maintain growth?\nCorey Dyer: We've got about 130 quota-bearing head. If you think about all the sellers we really have, there's more than that after you get to it because we've got a whole team of SAs and SEs, all of our management team. I'm here looking at it. So it puts us closer to, I'd say, effectively more like 200 when you get to that point. But yes, we're seeing it do really well and we're excited about the team and how they're performing and how they're engaging with our customers. I'm sorry, was there another follow up?\nAndy Power: I think the hiring and ability to hire for that opportunity.\nCorey Dyer: Yes. And so we've been able to hire. And we've -- I think when you look at salespeople and they think about where they're going to come and can we hire them, they look at where are you going to have the most prospects going forward. And the differentiated value that we have with our global platform -- and I would tell you that we're really kind of pulling away from the competition. There's probably 2 of us out there. So, if you're in the data center business or if you're in the internet -- networking business and you want to be successful as a salesperson, this is a great place to be, right? Team's making more money. We're being successful. And I think they look forward in that kind of standpoint. Sorry, I didn't understand the rest of the question but that's about where we are on it and really happy with it. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Guarino with Green Street.\nDavid Guarino: Bill, maybe going back to that comment you made earlier, it was really helpful on Nova going up 6% on the rental rate. Did you clarify if that was on renewal or new leases? And assuming it is on new leasing, I just wanted to talk on that healthy pricing environment. Do you think it's just a temporary boost for the sector given we've got this lack of leasable capacity? Or would you say we've truly turned a corner and rental rates are going to start trending higher from here on out?\nAndy Power: David, maybe help just clarify numbers. That was not a cash mark-to-market. That was the like-for-like new rates. So showing progress in the overall market rates and trying to do it as best we could as apples-to-apples in terms of size of deal, all the nuances that go into the deal. I was little -- just down in the market a week ago. And that market is overall experience incredibly robust and continuous demand. And we've done quite well, I can tell you, more than our fair share in that market not just in the last quarter but over several quarters. And that, combined with just overall constraints on bringing on capacity in that market, running up on ability to get power, permitting and the like, I think it's all going to continue to trend in a more positive territory or in terms of healthier rates in that market. If you look at our just one last data point on that, our operating portfolio in that market is, call it, 91 something in the sub but that's missing some leases that have signed but not commenced. If you include that, we're like 94% leased on the operating portfolio. And then I think I have 16 out of 86 megawatts left in terms of -- that's not leased that's under construction. We're basically down to, I think, 1 or 2 more buildings in the legacy 3 digital DFT and lab campus and are already moving on to our, call it, Western lands or digital Dulles location for our next layer of growth.\nDavid Guarino: That's helpful. And I guess the kind of the gist of the question really is we've had these periods historically in the sector where demand goes lumpy for certain periods. And just kind of curious, if that happens again, if we kind of don't repeat this record new levels of industry-wide leasing activity, do you think we resume to downward pressure on asking rents, I guess? I just want to get your perspective on if this is a temporary phenomenon we're seeing this quarter and last quarter?\nAndy Power: It feels to me like the lumpiness has subsided. I mean you looked at our quarterly leasing stats for several quarters. It's just been more diverse and more consistent. And based on the last few quarters of demand kind of combined with the broader supply backdrop dynamic, it doesn't feel like there's a -- I feels like the rates are going to be nowhere near peak rates yet. So we got a long way to run back to peak rates but still, I think marching in a more positive trajectory for some time to come.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Alex [ph] on for Dave. Andy, maybe just my first one here. I think last quarter, you noted the Teraco acquisition was going to give around a partial year contribution of $100 million in revenues and $70 million in EBITDA. Just wanted to double-check to see if there are any updates there and just confirm that that's already baked in the guidance? And then secondly, I know we've kind of touched on global M&A before but just kind of thinking about the state of the market and any specific geographies of interest.\nAndy Power: On the Teraco, I don't think there's any updates. We're still in the same vicinity of closing time period and there's been no change to our underwriting numbers since we announced. I don't -- let us follow up online to triple-check confirm those numbers with you with your model just to make sure because I don't recall what I exactly said a call ago on those numbers in terms of a partial calendar year contribution. And then your second question, Alex, was that about leasing or M&A? I just want to make sure -- you said the geos. I just want to make sure...\nUnidentified Analyst: M&A.\nGreg Wright: Yes. Alex, it's Greg. Look, I think you asked what the state of the M&A, global M&A market is. And like, I would say, it remains robust right now. There's a lot of private capital chasing deals. We've read about them. You see deals still occurring. As I mentioned earlier, multiples are -- have been sticky high on these transactions. But with that said, there is a lot of private capital and I think you're starting to see these private investors, the infrastructure funds and the like and others starting to see the quality of the asset class, whether it's the credit readiness of the customer, the quality of the assets and the growth prospects of the business. It really feels like it's starting to become more of a core investment asset class relative to some others. There's actually been somewhat of a shift there. In terms of our strategy, our strategy, I would say, this quarter is probably best representative of how we're looking at it and where we see the best risk-adjusted returns. You heard Andy and Corey talked about supply proofing but we went into 2 new markets through land purchases, 1 in Chennai, 1 in Barcelona this quarter. And then we backfilled the supply proof markets in Zurich, in Paris, in Frankfurt and in Dublin. And if you look at all that together, you're talking about 385 megawatts of total developable capacity. So when we look at that and look at it on a risk-adjusted basis, we think that's the right place for us. But in terms of geographies, I mean, look, we're still looking to selectively backfill in certain areas of Eastern Europe. As we've said previously, we are still working to expand our footprint in APAC and selectively backfill in the Americas. So that's basically how we're thinking about it.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Aryeh Klein with BMO Capital Markets.\nAryeh Klein: Just going back to the same-store NOI growth, it was down 3% in the quarter end. It sounds like the trends are supportive of improvement. But the full year guidance suggests that it kind of remains in this down 3% range for the remainder of the year. Is that just FX? Or is there something else at play?\nAndy Power: Well, obviously the FX has gone against our favor for the year but we've had some success in the first quarter relative to our budget a little bit on the OpEx side but we are absorbing a customer -- a bankruptcy which is going to be in your headwind to that. Hence, we're holding our guidance for same-store cash NOI for the year.\nAryeh Klein: Got it. And maybe I missed it but the bankruptcy, is that in the FFO outlook? And what's the impact from that, if it is?\nAndy Power: Bankruptcy, aside from a, call it, noncore straight-line right add back that's not in core FFO, we basically already absorbed about almost $4 million of a hit for the first quarter due to, call it, pre-petition receivables which I mentioned earlier on the call. And then, we've made an assumption as to additional, call it, $6 million of headwind for the remainder of the year because quite honestly, we're kind of just handicapping the outcome of events because the customer is obviously going to go through the court process and either accept or reject leases. The last time this go around, I think almost all of the leases were accepted. I'm not sure or that will be the case this go around. And then there's the scenarios as to if a lease is rejected and their end customers could be essentially absorbed by Digital Realty. So $6 million of incremental and on top of the $4 million, taken in the first quarter is our essentially hit or adjustment due to the bankruptcy for the year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI.\nIrvin Liu: Just one for me. Maybe Andy can answer this. I wanted to ask about the FX spot rate movement. You mentioned that bonds denominated in local currencies act as a natural profit hedge. And we do see this reflected on Slide 11. There's a 3-point revenue headwind but only a 2.3-point FFO headwind. Historically, is there any way to think about how well local currency denominated bonds offset some of these FX headwinds for FFO? And would you consider any durative instruments looking ahead to help you smooth out some of these headwinds?\nAndy Power: Sure. Thanks, Irvin. So I mean -- and I'm sorry to play the record again because I wanted to touch on this and I think I hit it on one of the QA. If you look historically, the last 3 years, our business has been roughly 40% international. And prior to this year, the headwinds or tailwinds, because it doesn't always go against you or, call it, in the 50 to 75 basis points, call it, vicinity with much less volatility than we're seeing this year. Essentially, with these not -- by issuing non-U.S. dollar financings be it euro or Swiss francs or sterlings or our multicurrency revolver are going to natural lending sources, often the long durations and essentially creating asset liabilities through the bonds but also cash flow liabilities to offset the euros we received from revenue or the pounds we received from revenue. Given we invested development returns of 9 to 12 or so percent and the rates are so modest right now, there's a leakage. We've been migrating more and more of our debt to be non-U.S. dollars. I think 75% of it is non-U.S. dollars today because 100% of our equity is U.S. dollars and 100% of our common dividends are in U.S. dollars. So we have that natural match for our U.S. dollar hedge. I've always been a big fan of this approach because it allows to, call it, have multiple benefits to the strategy of tapping diverse capital sources at attractive rates and create a natural FX hedge. It obviously does not provide 100% P&L volatility elimination. We are continuing to become more international. We are continuing to, in smaller amounts, going to a slightly more volatile markets in terms of currencies, be it Latin America or Africa. So I would say we're not -- our ears are always open to good ideas and we'll continue to evolve our thinking if a time comes to look at incremental types of foreign currency derivatives to further eliminate any P&L volatility from the FX.\nOperator: That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Bill, please go ahead.\nBill Stein: Thank you, Matt. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. Our value proposition is clearly resonating with customers. We posted our second straight record bookings quarter with $167 million of annualized rent while attracting 128 new logos. Our sales momentum is exceedingly strong and the benefits of Platform Digital continue to grow. Digital Realty's operational excellence is second to none and customers are relying on us to solve their needs for data center solutions today while providing a clear path for their expanded needs tomorrow. Our customers trust us with their mission-critical application and digital delivers. We're continuing to extend our global platform. In early January, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire a majority stake in Teraco to establish Digital Realty as the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Africa by positioning ourselves at key points of interconnection and subsea cable landing locations. We are also expanding organically with over 300 megawatts of new capacity under development. We posted strong core FFO per share results exceeding consensus estimates despite foreign exchange and other headwinds against us. We maintained our core FFO per share guidance for the year and our constant currency core FFO per share forecast represents more than 7% year-over-year growth. Last but not least, we remain very adept at sourcing attractive capital, raising over $1 billion of European debt at a blended 1.3% coupon and weighted average term of 9 years while redeeming higher cost U.S. dollar-denominated debt during the quarter. I'd like to once again thank the Digital Realty frontline team members in critical data center facility roles who have kept the digital world turning. I hope you all are safe and healthy and we hope to see many of you again in NAREIT and other in-person events. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded.

            "name": "Corey Dyer",
            "content": "Yes. So we'll be pretty comprehensive here with our answer to you, Jonathan. Thanks for the question. I would tell you that with regard to the enterprise demand, we've got customers that are just being driven to the business needs and opportunities that are in front of us. Bill mentioned earlier we just published our Global Data Insights survey with data becoming a critical agenda topic for all the businesses and it raised really 5 key things. Data was pervasive, it's the business agenda, it requires aggregation and control and it's localizing and it's a data first strategy's win. And so we're seeing that is really what's driving a lot of the demand across the enterprise. As far as where is it happening from a regional perspective, if you even want to do a baseball analogy, sometimes you guys ask, I'd say North America is probably middle innings with a healthy bullpen that you ought to have in it. And then, I'd tell you that EMEA is probably third inning, maybe anything behind APAC, a little behind that as customers are still really waking to the data opportunity that's right above all of us and it was really highlighted in the index that we just did in that survey. I'd also tell you that we had really strong exports across all regions which was great. And then we're seeing an uptick in all the multi-market and multi-region wins. So really happy with the enterprise. I'll let Andy give you a little bit of perspective on the hyperscalers. Matt, this is Corey. I'll take the first 2 questions, I think, that you had, one being around the supply chain impacts and then also the hyperscale demand. I'll take them in that order, if that helps you out. And as Andy mentioned kind of at the beginning of the commentary, our sales and marketing engine just continues to build up our demand and our pipeline growth, right? And I would tell you that the supply chain, inflation, energy costs has not really been a factor in that. Our customers really are thinking through what they do and how they source those materials so that they're setting up their commencement dates ahead of it with us. So they're just being really thoughtful about it and thinking through these concerns. And what I think it's done is actually had us create better dialogue with our customers to think through how we're going to solve this and create probably a little bit more demand for us as they think through it but it hasn't negatively impacted it at all. As far as the hyperscale demand, we're really still experiencing really strong demand from the hyperscalers across all regions, right? They work with us to help their speed to market. We're with them increasingly around their business impairs around this data opportunity the CSPs are helping all the enterprises with. We're seeing larger deal sizes at CSPs as they work to keep up with demand. So we have a really healthy pipeline for the remainder of the year. And I'd also say there's probably a dozen or so of these CSPs and more of them emerging in Asia and across the board. It's also helping us increase our demand on our pipeline for it. So really happy with both of those and where we're seeing the trajectory. We've got about 130 quota-bearing head. If you think about all the sellers we really have, there's more than that after you get to it because we've got a whole team of SAs and SEs, all of our management team. I'm here looking at it. So it puts us closer to, I'd say, effectively more like 200 when you get to that point. But yes, we're seeing it do really well and we're excited about the team and how they're performing and how they're engaging with our customers. I'm sorry, was there another follow up? Yes. And so we've been able to hire. And we've -- I think when you look at salespeople and they think about where they're going to come and can we hire them, they look at where are you going to have the most prospects going forward. And the differentiated value that we have with our global platform -- and I would tell you that we're really kind of pulling away from the competition. There's probably 2 of us out there. So, if you're in the data center business or if you're in the internet -- networking business and you want to be successful as a salesperson, this is a great place to be, right? Team's making more money. We're being successful. And I think they look forward in that kind of standpoint. Sorry, I didn't understand the rest of the question but that's about where we are on it and really happy with it. Thanks."

            "content": "Thanks, Jordan and welcome to the Digital team. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework and we made further progress on each front during the first quarter. First, we continue to globalize our business with the announcement of our definitive agreement to acquire a majority stake in Teraco in early January. We also continue to grow our business organically around the world. We posted another record quarter of global bookings totaling $167 million of annualized rent, including our second highest quarter in each of the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, together with another solid quarter in EMEA. Bookings this quarter were led by strong results in the greater than 1 megawatt category, particularly in the Americas, while sub-1-megawatt bookings remain steady and in line with our 2021 average. Let's discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3 of our earnings presentation. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment and simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and broader society while advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders. During the first quarter, Digital Realty was named one of America's Most Just Companies and third overall in the real estate industry by Just Capital and CNBC. We also maintained our status as a member of the FTSE4Good Index which measures the performance of companies demonstrating strong ESG practices, continuing our record of recognition for our leading sustainability initiatives. During the first quarter of 2022, Digital Realty continued our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts through our employee-led DEI council which seeks to promote inclusion and create opportunities for each of our employee communities. Through the DEI council, Digital Realty has expanded its philanthropy and community engagement activities with strategic donations and partnerships with global charitable organizations. Digital Realty has also taken a stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and those impacted by the Russian vision. We do not have any data centers or operations in Russia or Ukraine and our company will abide by sanctions against Russia. Until the peaceful and legal resolution of this conflict, we will not invest in Russia. Furthermore, we are funding philanthropic organizations to support Ukrainian refugees, those displaced within Ukraine and the growing humanitarian crisis. Let's turn our investment activity to Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform. We acquired land in 3 markets for organic development, including the first location for our joint venture with Brookfield in India, along with 2 parcels in Europe to support the strong demand in that region. After the quarter, we purchased 3 additional land parcels in Europe, including a beachhead in Barcelona, marking our organic entry into this complementary Mediterranean metro. Our active development pipeline reached an all-time high in the quarter with 44 projects underway supporting over 300 megawatts in of IT capacity in 28 metros around the world. 58% of this capacity is already presold, reflecting strong customer demand. We've expanded our development in the Americas, adding further capacity in New York, Northern Virginia and Toronto. Demand remains very strong in EMEA and we are continuing to invest across this region with active development projects in 17 of our 18 markets. Frankfurt is still the most active development market in EMEA, followed by Paris. We continue to make good progress toward closing the Teraco transaction which we still expect to close in the first half of this year. Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. We are also proactively managing risks to help insulate Digital Realty against the impact of the current inflationary and rising interest rate environment. We are well protected against the impact of rising energy costs given the pass-through nature of substantially all of our customer contracts and we are effectively managing against rising input costs through our vendor-managed inventory program and the expansion of our prepurchase equipment pool. We are constructively engaging with new and existing customers on the impact of rising costs which is translating into better pricing. This is partly reflected in the broad-based and improved cash leasing spreads we experienced in the first quarter but is also showing up in new lease transactions across most of our markets. Our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on Platform Digital. Our customers continue to solve the most complex IT infrastructure in activity and data integration challenges. We see a growing trend of multinational companies across all segments deploying and connecting large private data infrastructure footprints on platform digital across multiple regions and metros globally. Recently, industry research firm, IDC, updated their global data sphere forecast for 2025, Predicting the annual data creation rate will exceed 180 zettabytes per year or roughly triple the '21 rate. IDC concludes that companies of all sizes will need to prioritize data sharing and security to improve business resiliency and create a differentiated experience for their customers. Earlier this week, we published our inaugural Global Data Insights survey with strategic insights from 7,200 companies across 23 countries and 9 industries about the role of data in their business agenda. According to the survey, 70% of these companies are prioritizing secure data exchange in their current plans. The global data survey will augment our Data Gravity Index to provide telemetry for our customers, partners and their respective industries as they evolve their business platforms to harness the power of data and co-located infrastructure to unlock a new era of growth through connected data communities. In addition, Digital Realty recently joined the iMasons Climate Accord as a founding member. This coalition of leading companies is united in their views on carbon reduction in digital infrastructure. The group will establish an independent governing body to define an open standard that provides transparency, traceability and measurement of progress toward reducing carbon from sourced power and embodied carbon found in materials, products and operations of digital infrastructure. This is another great example of our commitment to the continuous innovation and execution of our platform digital road map to provide a sustainable and differentiated value proposition for our customers, partners and the broader industry. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Well, Corey will start off. Jon, thanks for the question on the ad product demand. I'll pick up hyperscale and I think Bill will tackle the second part of your question. Relative to pricing, Jon, pricing dynamics are clearly market specific and will depend on both supply and demand in each market. So when demand exceeds supply, we've been able to raise our prices. And this is reflected in our results. So for example, if you look at our first quarter leasing results in Northern Virginia, our average prices were about 6% higher than just last quarter in the fourth quarter. That market is increasingly tightening. We're also fortunate to be in a position where we're well insulated from the increased costs on our current development pipeline and that's because of our contracts with suppliers and our vendor managed inventory program. So -- and this has obviously helped us not just in terms of cost but to assure that we do have the supply to continue around the world. Thank you, Matt. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. Our value proposition is clearly resonating with customers. We posted our second straight record bookings quarter with $167 million of annualized rent while attracting 128 new logos. Our sales momentum is exceedingly strong and the benefits of Platform Digital continue to grow. Digital Realty's operational excellence is second to none and customers are relying on us to solve their needs for data center solutions today while providing a clear path for their expanded needs tomorrow. Our customers trust us with their mission-critical application and digital delivers. We're continuing to extend our global platform. In early January, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire a majority stake in Teraco to establish Digital Realty as the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Africa by positioning ourselves at key points of interconnection and subsea cable landing locations. We are also expanding organically with over 300 megawatts of new capacity under development. We posted strong core FFO per share results exceeding consensus estimates despite foreign exchange and other headwinds against us. We maintained our core FFO per share guidance for the year and our constant currency core FFO per share forecast represents more than 7% year-over-year growth. Last but not least, we remain very adept at sourcing attractive capital, raising over $1 billion of European debt at a blended 1.3% coupon and weighted average term of 9 years while redeeming higher cost U.S. dollar-denominated debt during the quarter. I'd like to once again thank the Digital Realty frontline team members in critical data center facility roles who have kept the digital world turning. I hope you all are safe and healthy and we hope to see many of you again in NAREIT and other in-person events. Thank you."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Andy Power",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. As Bill noted, we signed total bookings of $167 million with an $11 million contribution from interconnection during the first quarter. This is our second consecutive quarterly record and the seventh time in the last 8 quarters we have delivered bookings over $100 million. While our new business was healthy across product types, larger deals accounted for 70% of the quarter's bookings, while sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection accounted for 30% of the total. The weighted average lease term on new leases was more than 7 years. Demand was particularly strong in the Americas with Northern Virginia and Toronto leading the way. Fundamentals continue to tighten in both metros, as reflected by the high levels of pre-leasing on our development pipeline. In EMEA, Frankfurt remains the standout, while in APAC, demand remains robust in Singapore and Japan. Nearly 1/3 of our sub-1-megawatt plus interconnection bookings were exported from one region to another, reflecting the value customers realize from our global platform. North America was the most common export region, with most of those exports landing in EMEA followed by Asia Pacific and Latin America. We landed 128 new logos during the first quarter, maintaining the momentum we have built over the last several quarters which has been a strong validation of Platform Digital and our global strategy. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, Zenlayer, a global edge cloud provider, is expanding on Platform Digital across 3 continents to improve its geographic coverage, scale and access to customer communities across various industries. A Global 2000 consumer financial services firm continue to expand with Digital Realty, leveraging Platform Digital's full suite of capabilities, including rationalizing data centers, implementing IT controls and interconnecting with key business communities. Box Technologies, a leading innovator of high-performance desktop-as-a-service applications, is deploying on Platform Digital, supporting enterprise data architecture applications, serving the manufacturing, construction and engineering industries. A leading IT company is leveraging our full product spectrum by utilizing our connectivity offerings to support data exchange across 3 metros in North America and Lat Am to improve performance and scalability and reduce costs. Magnite, a global independent advertising platform is expanding our platform digital in multiple metros across EMEA to enable their hybrid IT transformation. And a Global 2000 reinsurer selected Platform Digital for mainframe migration with seamless connectivity to top cloud providers and robust security being key drivers. Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced grew by 15% and from $378 million to a record $436 million, driven by the strong first quarter signings which outpaced commencements. The lag between signings and commencements moderated to 7 months with nearly 2/3 of our $436 million backlog scheduled to commence later this year. Moving on to Page 10. We signed $177 million of renewal leases during the first quarter at a positive 3.3% cash re-leasing spread. Renewal rates were positive across the board, were spread in the black across product types in all 3 regions. 2/3 of total renewals were sub-1-megawatt deals, resulting in a smaller sample size for the 1-plus megawatt category in the quarter. Excluding one larger short-term extension, our cash renewal spread would have been positive 2.5%. We are encouraged by the positive trajectory on renewal spreads as well as constructive engagement with customers on the current inflationary environment and our highly compelling value proposition. In terms of operating performance, portfolio occupancy ticked down by 30 basis points sequentially, driven by previously reported churn events, most of which has already been re-leased. Consistent with our full year guidance, same capital cash NOI growth was negative 3.1% in the first quarter, primarily driven by 220 basis points of FX headwinds, the timing of no move-outs and a customer bankruptcy. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen over the last several months and FX represented a 200 to 250 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our first quarter reported results from the top to the bottom line, as shown on Page 11. Our operations, along with our capital funding and locally denominated debt act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. Turning to our risk mitigation strategies on Page 12. A little less than 60% of our first quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, followed by approximately 25% in euros and roughly 5% each in Singapore dollars and British pounds. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in SOFR would have roughly a 75 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, first quarter core FFO per share of $1.67 was flat on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Despite FX headwinds, a $0.01 impact related to a customer bankruptcy and a difficult comp due to the contribution of assets to digital core REIT. In terms of the quarterly run rate, we expect the split between the first half of the year and the second half of the year to be approximately $49.51. In other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page 13, we expect to dip down a couple of pennies in the second quarter due to normalized OpEx spending and near-term dilution from closing the Teraco transaction before bouncing back in the second half of the year as leases from a record backlog commenced. Most of the drivers underlying our guidance remain unchanged but given the improving pricing environment, we are bumping up our outlook for cash re-leasing spreads for the full year to slightly positive compared to flat last quarter. We are maintaining our existing core FFO per share range of $6.80 to $6.90 despite the customer bankruptcy and stiffer FX headwinds. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, we expect currency headwinds could represent a 250 to 300 basis point drag on full year 2022 revenue and core FFO per share growth. Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 14. We were active again in the capital markets during the first quarter. We took advantage of favorable OEM market conditions to lock in EUR 750 million at 1.375% for 10.5 years. And later in the quarter, we completed a dual tranche Swiss bond offering, raising a total of CHF 250 million at a blended coupon of approximately 1.25%. We used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem 450 million of bonds at 4.75%. Reported leverage ratio is 6.3x while fixed charge coverage is 5.5x. Adjusting for the proceeds from the forward equity offering last September, our pro forma leverage ratio drops to 5.9x, while fixed charge coverage improves to 5.7x. We continue to execute our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 15, our weighted average debt maturity is over 6 years and our weighted average coupon is 2.2%. A little over 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also acting as a natural FX hedge for investments outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate, guarding against a fixed a rising rate environment and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 15, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? Thanks again, Jon. The -- I mean I think we've now had a several -- I think in the prepared remarks, 7 or 8 quarters north of $100 million of gap which speaks to consistent demand in the hyperscale being a major component of that. You had a record, call it -- in the fourth quarter, you had another record and these records, I'll call it, demonstrably higher than the prior, call it, $100 million averages. If your question about the self-build versus procuring through Digital Realty or other providers, I don't think the pendulum has swung to a point where the cell builds off the table. But I would think in times like today, when there's increased volatility, supply chain issues, a war in Eastern Europe, having a global platform to support hyperscaler growth across now 50 metropolitan areas in 26 countries, it's a tremendous value-add to our hyperscale customers. And I think their demand has been consistent for the last several quarters, with some peaks along the way and we see the forecast remaining quite strong as well. Sure. we'll give you an extra question here. So that customer from a current -- on receivables, they had a very modest amount of called pre-petition outstanding receivables. They were regularly current paying customer, not a late paying customer and they're fairly pretty well up to date, a couple of million, I would say and really concentrated in the U.K. was outstanding when they entered bankruptcy. Obviously, they're going to go through a process under U.K. administration, in the U.S. and also Canada. That will play out over several months. The -- I think if you take a step back, really what -- I think what's more relevant is that customer obviously got, call it, sideswiped by 2 particular issues. One, obviously, a part of their business what's not common in our customer base was disaster recovery for office which has obviously got impacted by the Zoom-ification during the pandemic; and then secondly, the elevated power prices, especially in Europe at incremental liquidity constraints. I don't see that as a really recurring theme in our customer base, especially the first piece of what I described. And this customer is going to obviously work through with this bankruptcy process. And I think we've been taking active steps not just related to this customer but in general, to continue to streamline and focus our portfolio on core assets that we have -- we see robust and long-term demand, multicustomer facilities, less single stand-alone facilities. And quite frankly, why we entered the colocation interconnection business several years ago was not only was the growth to our business but also to be prepared in the event that some of our colocation resellers ran into financial times and we had to step in and support their end customers only in the event that leases are rejected, obviously. Thanks, Michael. So let me try -- there's a couple of numbers questions in there. So let me start and try to get through some of those and then also hand off on the leasing question a little bit to Corey as well. So in reverse, in our earnings deck, we tried to provide both as reported and constant currency. And we also tried to show adjustments for apples and oranges in comparisons on a year-over-year basis. So you could see that the second set of bars on that chart has had our as reported same-store cash NOI down negative 3% which was in line with our guidance. On a constant currency basis, it's down 90 basis points. And the hit I just called out in terms of the bankruptcy customer, call it, $4 million, $5 million or whatever, that was -- I think it's about 60 -- almost 70 basis points of that negative 90. Those are all on an NOI basis. I apologize I don't have the revenue equivalent off the top of my head. That same pool is also getting impacted by a year-over-year elevated property taxes which we previously mentioned. And more importantly, we're re-leasing vacated capacity which I think dovetails with your first question. We've made a concerted effort to focus more and more of our leasing wherever possible and to already build infrastructure given the high flow-through of contribution of that revenue into that capacity and having an installed base that wants to expand with adjacency or grow in our campuses is always a little bit easier than going out and landing a new customer. In terms of the leasing into that capacity, if you basically just take the signed already in this quarter or last quarter or 2 that has not commenced to hit our occupancy and that would bring our same-store occupancy up about 80 basis points by itself, i.e., the leases are signed, they're just literally waiting for the customers to move in throughout the year. That obviously is going to flow through into our '22 results in a partial year period and then a full year period in '23. We are -- as I mentioned, we're very focused on re-leasing that vacant capacity. We're incentivizing wherever possible. And quite honestly, some of the supply-demand dynamics that are playing out industry-wide in addition to execution against our platform are really lending itself to fill that up at a more accelerated pace. I think we did about 20-plus megawatts into that type of vacated capacity, i.e., they weren't the first customer in that suite in the first quarter of this year. And that is a rapidly accelerated pace relative to, call it, prior year velocity. And then, Matt, on your second question, I mean we just reported the first 1 quarter of 2022. So obviously, not prepared to put 2023 guidance out just yet. But obviously -- but you can see on a constant currency basis, we're now north of 7% on the bottom line core FFO per share that extraordinary FX headwinds this year, if you look back the last several years, you had, call it, currency fluctuations in the, call it, 2 to 5 or so percent. And this year, the year, call it, soon to be like 9% delta. The headwinds -- or could be a tailwind, usually we're in the 50 to 75 basis points range. And now we're, call it, north of 200 basis points of headwinds. I think -- look, the goal from the beginning of the year as well as last year is to continue to accelerate bottom line's earnings growth. Last year, we came out of the gate with guidance of 4%. We ended up with 5%. This year, we came out with guidance of 5% which we are affirming in this call, despite these FX headwinds as well despite a customer bankruptcy. And our goal is to kind of again keep consistently putting up mid- to high single digits bottom line growth. Thanks, Simon. So first and foremost, better to be lucky than smart. We are out of the gates with a sizable EUR 750 million bond literally the first, I think, business day of 2022 and priced 10.5-year paper in the 1-plus percent, call it, category. So pleased with that. Followed that up with even more volatile start of the year, a Swiss bond offering which, again, both of those, I think, diversifying our source of capital, increasing our FX hedge, locking in long-duration debt at attractive cost of capital. We also increased our revolving credit facility by an incremental $750-ish million during the quarter, just a full start of liquidity given the broader uncertainty in backdrop. We still have not drawn down or close to $1 billion equity forward just yet. We look to close on Teraco in the next couple of months or so, or actually probably a month or 2, I guess. And then back half of the year in terms of capital sources on the leverage side to again keep us in line in terms of our targeted net debt to EBITDA. We will obviously evaluate equity as an alternative but right now at these current levels, I think the continued disposition of noncore assets as well as incremental contributions of core assets from our portfolio to digital core REIT in the back half of the year are going to be our primary funding mechanisms. And we made some great progress, obviously getting Digital Realty through its first earnings season and also working on identifying that next leg of assets to continue to grow and diversify and strengthen Digital Realty. Eric, I think -- I assume you're seeing large leases, large multiple megawatt leases. I mean -- I think the theme -- the growth in the sizing of customer requirements on the hyperscale front has been building for some time, not necessarily a completely overnight phenomenon. And I think you witnessed in the first quarter this year or the fourth quarter of last year, other quarters of last year and the year prior. I think you guys are seeing this continued cloud adoption broadly, continued opening of new regions, opening an offering of new services. And you're seeing this digital transformation wave in the cloud customers despite the volatility and the uncertainty of an economic backdrop or the war and the like leaning in and securing infrastructure to future-proof their runway for their end customers. So, it doesn't feel like the -- one record quarter after another is a little bit of an unusual outcome. But it doesn't feel like the pace of demand is really slowing on the hyperscale front. And I think what's also helped in that backdrop of this continuing steady demand, it's just become more challenging to be a provider. You have the inflationary pressures, you have supply chain challenges, you have labor challenges and you even have moratoriums in certain parts of the world see some demand. And I think going to the part of how do you get ahead of this is that you'd be in this business for the long run, with Digital Realty been in this business for almost 20 years. You build a scale and capital sources to support our customers through good times and bad. You make sure you have the runway to future-proof their growth. That's the acres and acres of often contiguous expansion capacity. You secure your supply chains so that you're on time and under budget, wherever possible and be that trusted infrastructure partner. I think those are the key ingredients to our recipe. Thanks, Eric. I mean that is obviously a constantly evolving schedule where we're adding projects in terms of new starts and we're subtracting projects that are delivering and being commissioned for customers and opening at high levels of pre-leasing. It's a combination of offices or colocation product as well as our scale and hyperscale dedicated data halls. We're trying to always stay ahead of the game, focusing on the longest lead time parts of development. Obviously, land procurement, hence the acreage I mentioned previously, followed by shelves. And then Chris just touched on our, call it, overall infrastructure and build-outs. I don't -- I think when you look at the combination of our current stabilized portfolio that has availability that we're actively leasing into our shelves and their delivery schedules and as well as our land, I feel good. There's always a market or 2 that will be a little tighter than I would like but I feel I think probably more in terms of the hyperscale front that these larger deals, you're often engaging in contracting at very early stages of those projects. So you don't need to necessarily have a finished data hall in order to sell that capacity, hence having that land bank and shelves coming online are very good selling tools by themselves. Yes. So we've obviously been working through this for some time. I would say, over the last several quarters, the -- call it, the mix was certainly helping us as we've kind of chopped through some of our largest customers, major expirations, as we got through more of the North America and more -- onto more international mix, having the less than a megawatt more highly connected destinations, legacy interaction, Westin, Telx, etcetera, being more -- a bigger piece of the puzzle. And last year, we came in a little bit better than we had guidance but albeit negative. This year, we guided to flat which is a year-over-year sequential improvement. And I think what you're seeing in this quarter are a few things. On the one hand, I'm not -- I wouldn't say that I can rule out that we'll never have a negative cash mark-to-market on any given product for the next several quarters. I don't think we're at that level of positive yet. But you saw positive across the board in the plus less than a megawatt categories. It was -- in the less than a megawatt which is the largest piece of it, it was up versus the LTM, about 130 basis points, cut north of 2.5% which is a pretty sizable move. And we've guided now for the full portfolio for 2022, slightly positive. So again, not -- I can't tell you we're fully done with never having a negative cash mark-to-market but the trend is certainly playing out which I would say is a combination of mix and also the broader pricing ratch up where the pendulum of pricing is swinging slightly more and more back to Digital Realty. I think the hiring and ability to hire for that opportunity. David, maybe help just clarify numbers. That was not a cash mark-to-market. That was the like-for-like new rates. So showing progress in the overall market rates and trying to do it as best we could as apples-to-apples in terms of size of deal, all the nuances that go into the deal. I was little -- just down in the market a week ago. And that market is overall experience incredibly robust and continuous demand. And we've done quite well, I can tell you, more than our fair share in that market not just in the last quarter but over several quarters. And that, combined with just overall constraints on bringing on capacity in that market, running up on ability to get power, permitting and the like, I think it's all going to continue to trend in a more positive territory or in terms of healthier rates in that market. If you look at our just one last data point on that, our operating portfolio in that market is, call it, 91 something in the sub but that's missing some leases that have signed but not commenced. If you include that, we're like 94% leased on the operating portfolio. And then I think I have 16 out of 86 megawatts left in terms of -- that's not leased that's under construction. We're basically down to, I think, 1 or 2 more buildings in the legacy 3 digital DFT and lab campus and are already moving on to our, call it, Western lands or digital Dulles location for our next layer of growth. It feels to me like the lumpiness has subsided. I mean you looked at our quarterly leasing stats for several quarters. It's just been more diverse and more consistent. And based on the last few quarters of demand kind of combined with the broader supply backdrop dynamic, it doesn't feel like there's a -- I feels like the rates are going to be nowhere near peak rates yet. So we got a long way to run back to peak rates but still, I think marching in a more positive trajectory for some time to come. On the Teraco, I don't think there's any updates. We're still in the same vicinity of closing time period and there's been no change to our underwriting numbers since we announced. I don't -- let us follow up online to triple-check confirm those numbers with you with your model just to make sure because I don't recall what I exactly said a call ago on those numbers in terms of a partial calendar year contribution. And then your second question, Alex, was that about leasing or M&A? I just want to make sure -- you said the geos. I just want to make sure... Well, obviously the FX has gone against our favor for the year but we've had some success in the first quarter relative to our budget a little bit on the OpEx side but we are absorbing a customer -- a bankruptcy which is going to be in your headwind to that. Hence, we're holding our guidance for same-store cash NOI for the year. Bankruptcy, aside from a, call it, noncore straight-line right add back that's not in core FFO, we basically already absorbed about almost $4 million of a hit for the first quarter due to, call it, pre-petition receivables which I mentioned earlier on the call. And then, we've made an assumption as to additional, call it, $6 million of headwind for the remainder of the year because quite honestly, we're kind of just handicapping the outcome of events because the customer is obviously going to go through the court process and either accept or reject leases. The last time this go around, I think almost all of the leases were accepted. I'm not sure or that will be the case this go around. And then there's the scenarios as to if a lease is rejected and their end customers could be essentially absorbed by Digital Realty. So $6 million of incremental and on top of the $4 million, taken in the first quarter is our essentially hit or adjustment due to the bankruptcy for the year. Sure. Thanks, Irvin. So I mean -- and I'm sorry to play the record again because I wanted to touch on this and I think I hit it on one of the QA. If you look historically, the last 3 years, our business has been roughly 40% international. And prior to this year, the headwinds or tailwinds, because it doesn't always go against you or, call it, in the 50 to 75 basis points, call it, vicinity with much less volatility than we're seeing this year. Essentially, with these not -- by issuing non-U.S. dollar financings be it euro or Swiss francs or sterlings or our multicurrency revolver are going to natural lending sources, often the long durations and essentially creating asset liabilities through the bonds but also cash flow liabilities to offset the euros we received from revenue or the pounds we received from revenue. Given we invested development returns of 9 to 12 or so percent and the rates are so modest right now, there's a leakage. We've been migrating more and more of our debt to be non-U.S. dollars. I think 75% of it is non-U.S. dollars today because 100% of our equity is U.S. dollars and 100% of our common dividends are in U.S. dollars. So we have that natural match for our U.S. dollar hedge. I've always been a big fan of this approach because it allows to, call it, have multiple benefits to the strategy of tapping diverse capital sources at attractive rates and create a natural FX hedge. It obviously does not provide 100% P&L volatility elimination. We are continuing to become more international. We are continuing to, in smaller amounts, going to a slightly more volatile markets in terms of currencies, be it Latin America or Africa. So I would say we're not -- our ears are always open to good ideas and we'll continue to evolve our thinking if a time comes to look at incremental types of foreign currency derivatives to further eliminate any P&L volatility from the FX."

            "content": "Yes. No. Thanks, Eric. This is Chris. Yes, it's something that we've been constantly looking at. And just to echo Andy's comments a little bit earlier, we've always looked at long-term engagements with our construction teams and with our suppliers. And so the continued development pipeline that we've been putting to market, it's really paid off, right, where we keep the same crews on the projects and we roll into new projects and just watching how that grows. I'd also say we have the gold standard in VMI, vendor-managed inventory, for building out a lot of this infrastructure. So even before some of the supply constraints hit us, we started ramping up the budgets for that. And I think one of the other great things with being with digital is we've been able to expand the program to be able to support our customer needs. And so now it's become a differentiator in the market where we're now able to provide customer -- some customer equipment to help them procure their infrastructure. And so it's just something that we've been able to plan ahead of and we're constantly looking at different routes to market with, particularly the chip shortages and things like that, looking at the secondary markets, where leveraging a lot of secondary equipment that's been refurbished and put a warranty against it. It's been able to allow a lot of customers to overcome some of those challenges. But it's something we're constantly watching and looking at and making sure that we have the best capabilities and, quite frankly, equipment infrastructure available to our customers and for our own builds on a global basis. So that's something that we're very proud about."

            "name": "Greg Wright",
            "content": "Yes. Simon, it's Greg. Look, to date, I'd say the private market seems to be lagging the public markets a little bit and I don't think that's uncommon. I think the public markets usually lead. But look, I think if rates stay up over time, you should start to see multiples come down. But right now, we see a lot of stuff out there but it feels as though the private market multiples have been a little sticky high at this point. Yes. Alex, it's Greg. Look, I think you asked what the state of the M&A, global M&A market is. And like, I would say, it remains robust right now. There's a lot of private capital chasing deals. We've read about them. You see deals still occurring. As I mentioned earlier, multiples are -- have been sticky high on these transactions. But with that said, there is a lot of private capital and I think you're starting to see these private investors, the infrastructure funds and the like and others starting to see the quality of the asset class, whether it's the credit readiness of the customer, the quality of the assets and the growth prospects of the business. It really feels like it's starting to become more of a core investment asset class relative to some others. There's actually been somewhat of a shift there. In terms of our strategy, our strategy, I would say, this quarter is probably best representative of how we're looking at it and where we see the best risk-adjusted returns. You heard Andy and Corey talked about supply proofing but we went into 2 new markets through land purchases, 1 in Chennai, 1 in Barcelona this quarter. And then we backfilled the supply proof markets in Zurich, in Paris, in Frankfurt and in Dublin. And if you look at all that together, you're talking about 385 megawatts of total developable capacity. So when we look at that and look at it on a risk-adjusted basis, we think that's the right place for us. But in terms of geographies, I mean, look, we're still looking to selectively backfill in certain areas of Eastern Europe. As we've said previously, we are still working to expand our footprint in APAC and selectively backfill in the Americas. So that's basically how we're thinking about it."

During today's presentation, all parties will be placed in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Callers will be limited to one question and we will aim to conclude at the bottom of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone to Digital Realty's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will also contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our fourth quarter and our full year. First, we are seeing a robust wave of demand across our platform, and we are optimistic about our ability to execute. Leasing in the quarter was healthy, highlighted by strong volume in the 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment, record pricing in the greater than megawatt category and the second highest quarter ever of new logos added. Second, our fundamental metrics capped off the year on a high note with the strongest cash re-leasing spreads and same capital cash NOI growth we've seen in years as our unique and differentiated value proposition continued to resonate. And lastly, in the fourth quarter alone, we announced nearly $8 billion of new development joint ventures and completed over $1 billion of equity issuance under our ATM bringing total capital sources raised during the year to more than $12 billion and reducing pro forma leverage below our year-end 2023 target. The execution on our funding and capital plan in 2023 has positioned Digital Realty to be able to support our customers' data center infrastructure needs as the next generation technology unfolds. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. 2023 was a milestone year for Digital Realty, as we made strong progress toward our strategic objectives despite significant volatility in financial conditions and broader uncertainty around the world. For me, 2023 will be revered as the year of AI's arrival to the data center forefront, ushering in an unprecedented new wave of data center demand, driving a step function of change across the industry's landscape. The year that Digital Realty enhanced its customer value proposition by adding connectivity-rich solutions while also scaling our capacity for hyperscale and AI workloads. We expanded our footprint with new connectivity-oriented locations around the Mediterranean and elsewhere. Enhanced our joint venture in India with the addition of Reliance Jio and increased the number of direct access points on our campuses to the leading cloud and service providers. We accelerated the growth of service fabric with more than 70 discrete services added to the platform and over 100 unique services available by year-end and enhance its capabilities with new composes like service directory. We also added 9,000 new cross connects in the year, indicative of our growing connected data communities. 2023 was a year that we integrated and innovated at a faster pace than ever before. We strengthened our leadership team and aligned our platform to three regions to be consistently structured around the world. We adapted our product portfolio to meet market demand, evolving our offering to efficiently support next-generation chips like the NVIDIA H-100 in numerous data centers. Our high-density colo capability deployed across 32 markets spending all three regions is equipped to handle three times the H-100 requirements. And we continue to add green energy solutions to power many of these power dense applications. Like our large solar PPA in Germany and our agreement supporting 100% renewable power in Texas, San Francisco, New Jersey and Sydney. And 2023 was the year that Digital Realty took decisive action to strengthen our balance sheet by developing a portfolio of private capital partnerships and vehicles that diversified our capital sources while enabling us to support our customers' fast-growing requirements. And we did all of that while continuing to provide the operational excellence that is expected of a global data center leader and that our customers rightfully demand. On this call a year ago, I outlined a plan to bolster and diversify our capital sources. Our goals were to reduce our leverage towards six times by the end of the year. Increase our liquidity to fund our development program and diversify our capital sources to limit our reliance on the capital markets, increasing our ability to meet the accelerating demand for data center capacity and to enhance our returns on invested capital. We outperformed on each of these goals, sourcing over $12 billion of new capital and commitments for new investment and debt repayment, reducing pro forma leverage to just 5.8 times when adjusted for transactions that have been announced or closed since year-end. We also ended the year with five new JV partners and expanded some of our existing relationships. To round out the year, we announced three significant transactions in the fourth quarter, including two development joint ventures and the successful resolution to our relationship with Cyxtera, we also raised $1.2 billion of equity under our ATM since the end of September. I will quickly run through the highlights of these transactions. In early January, Greg completed his famed Triple Lindy with the Cyxtera transaction by selling $275 million of assets to Brookfield along with the purchase of Cyxtera's leasehold positions in Singapore and Frankfurt for $55 million, yielding net cash of $220 million to Digital Realty. In addition, Brookfield assumed three existing leases and amended three others in our portfolio to accelerate their expiration to the end of September 2024. Finally, Digital Realty obtained and exercised an option to purchase a Cyxtera data center and the Slough Trading Estate adding one of London's highly sought-after submarkets to Platform Digital's connectivity and enterprise colo offering. This transaction remains subject to customer closing conditions and is expected to close towards the end of the first quarter. In November, Realty Income purchased an 80% interest in 400 million data centers that are under development and leased to an investment-grade financial services company. The tenant has the option to expand the facility up to an estimated potential cost of $800 million. We received $200 million upon closing and reduced our funding obligations for the remainder of this project to just 20% of the total capital, enabling us to reinvest the capital in higher-return projects. Finally, the $7 billion development joint venture with Blackstone is our largest and most forward-looking transaction and accelerates the monetization of nearly 20% of our three-plus gigawatt land bank. This JV involves the sale of an 80% interest in nearly 500 megawatts of capacity across four campuses in Paris, Frankfurt and Northern Virginia and enables us to better support our hyperscale customers' needs. Approximately 20% of ventures total potential data center capacity is expected to be delivered through 2025. We will retain a 20% interest in the developments and earn fees for developing, leasing, operating and managing these facilities. All told, in 2023, we announced or completed joint ventures and asset sales driving leverage down roughly 1.3 turns from the first quarter peak accelerating our ability to deliver needed capacity to our customers and enhancing our returns on invested capital. I would also be remiss if I did not mention Digital Core REIT's successful $120 million follow-on equity offering last week which will support the REIT's planned acquisition of an incremental 24.9% interest in our jointly owned asset in Frankfurt for $125 million. Let's shift to a brief recap of our results and offer some insights into the trends we are seeing across our business. I'm pleased with our results for 2023, which helped to lay the foundation for an acceleration in long-term sustainable growth in earnings and free cash flow that should take shape as we head into 2025. Our fourth quarter results were broadly consistent with the first three quarters of 2023 with continued strength in our operating performance KPIs and an incremental improvement in our financial position as we continue to execute on our value proposition with the goal to support the increased demand for data center capacity. Leasing remained healthy, especially in our targeted 0 to 1 plus interconnection segment with 134 new logos, bringing our total new logos for 2023 to a new annual record of more than 500. Renewal spreads were strong for the fifth consecutive quarter, remaining positive across product types and regions. Same capital cash NOI growth continue to demonstrate the underlying strength of our business with 9.9% year-over-year growth in the quarter. And churn remained low and well controlled at 1%, while occupancy was impacted by the delivery of significant vacant development capacity. The combination of cloud and AI is driving unprecedented demand for scale and hyperscale capacity alongside the steady enterprise and connectivity-oriented demand we're experiencing within our 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment. Supply constraints driven by limited availability of power and global supply chain delays have continued to drive the pricing pendulum in our favor or our growing value proposition is increasing interest in our existing inventory and the new development that we have underway. Ongoing conversations with customers pretend a significant potential acceleration of leasing and development and we believe we are well positioned. The demand seems to be spilling across most markets, particularly for larger capacity blocks, though there are a few pockets of strength worth noting, including Northern Virginia, Santa Clara, New Jersey, Paris, Frankfurt, Singapore and Seoul. Our new capacity is concentrated in core markets aligned with our global meeting place strategy. While the scale of data center infrastructure opportunities has increased alongside AI's arrival, we remain disciplined and thoughtful prioritizing locations that enhance Platform Digital connectivity and our connected campus communities. During the fourth quarter, Digital demonstrated the benefits of collaborating with our partners with the signing of an Oracle Cloud infrastructure dedicated region deployment by a financial services customer, showcasing the potential of the collaboration between Oracle and Digital Realty to fulfill enterprise customers' hybrid cloud requirements. Other customers are recognizing the growing value of Platform Digital's broad and open structure. An AI service provider leveraged Platform Digital's pre-provisioned high-density colo offering to improve their time to market in order to extend our North America and AI cloud offering that provides managed AI as a service for a global manufacturing client. A global service provider and partner targeting enterprises and customers added more connectivity for their hybrid offerings on Platform Digital, enabling them to upgrade their IT environments to a consumption-based IT infrastructure and managed services model. A Global 2000 leader in material sciences for industrial and scientific applications needed a data center provider with global interconnectivity and access to cloud providers in Seoul and shows Platform Digital to enable them to deploy and interconnect a private AI node. A Global 50 financial services company is migrating from an on-prem data center to Platform Digital and utilizing service fabric to improve sustainability, resiliency, scalability, security and carrier diversity. And a leading Global 2000 consumer goods manufacturer grew their presence on Platform Digital by adding two additional metros to support their IT workloads and cloud connectivity. Moving over to a quick update on our largest market, Northern Virginia. We have over 100 megawatts available for lease today in Loudon County and nearly 200 megawatts of capacity available for lease in Manassas. We are currently in active negotiations with a handful of customers for substantially all of our capacity in Loudon, though in contrast with the rumor mill, nothing has been finalized just yet. Beyond this capacity, we have another 900 megawatts of buildable capacity at DigitalDose, which we are cautiously optimistic will gain access to power in 2026 and beyond. We also expect to benefit from the active and ongoing management of our existing 500-megawatt portfolio in this market over time. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the fourth quarter. We continue to be recognized for our strong ESG performance in the fourth quarter and in 2024. We placed second on Sustainability Magazine's List of top 10 sustainable data center providers. We improved to number eight on the US EPA's Green Power partnership National Top 100 for renewable energy use and we were named as a top rated regional performer in North America by a leading global ESG ratings provider. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn over the call to our CFO, Matt Mercier.\nMatthew Mercier: Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our fourth quarter results. We signed a total of $110 million of new leases in the fourth quarter with $53 million of 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection leasing, led by strength in the EMEA region. Interconnection bookings rebounded sequentially to $13.5 million, and we finished the year with 220,000 cross-connects despite continued network grooming. Turning to our backlog slide. The current backlog of signed by [Technical Difficulty] commenced leases increased to a new record of $495 million at quarter end as new leasing outran $84 million of commencements in the quarter. We expect commencements to pick up as nearly two-thirds of the backlog is scheduled to commence in 2024, with the majority coming in the second half of the year. During the fourth quarter, we signed $210 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 8.2% on a cash basis, setting the high watermark for the year, though this was skewed over 100 basis points by shorter-term renewals in one market. For the full year, cash renewal spreads were up 6.8% and or 5.5% when normalizing for short-term extensions. Re-leasing spreads were positive across product, market and region in 2023, setting the foundation for an acceleration in long-term sustainable growth. In 2024, we expect the pricing environment to remain firm and renewal spreads to remain positive, principally reflecting the near 80% weighting of lease expirations in the 0 to 1 megawatt segment. In terms of earnings growth, we reported fourth quarter Core FFO of $1.63 per share and $6.59 for the full year within our guidance range. Earnings reflect the continued strong organic results, together with the impact from capital recycling, deleveraging and increased development spending throughout the year, as discussed on our third quarter call. Total revenue was up 11% year-over-year despite the incremental drag from the stabilized JV contributions and the noncore asset sales that closed in the third quarter. As we also noted last quarter, year-over-year revenue growth continued to be positively impacted by the significant volatility in utility costs and reimbursements, particularly in Europe. Energy dynamics proved to be a tailwind for our results in 2023. Assuming more normalized energy prices, we expect the related upside impact will moderate in 2024. Interconnection revenue was $106 million, up 9% year-over-year, reflecting continued unit growth and price increases. Moving over to the expense side. Utilities were 5% lower sequentially, reflecting the joint venture contributions over the summer, combined with seasonal impacts. Operating expenses increased due to seasonally elevated maintenance spending in the fourth quarter. Property taxes fell back toward normalized levels, reflecting the onetime property tax reassessment experienced in the third quarter. Net of this movement, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% year-over-year. Improvement in our stabilized same capital operating performance continued in the fourth quarter with a year-over-year cash NOI up a strong 9.9% and up 7.7% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, results were also strong with cash NOI growth of 7.5% and 6.5% on a constant currency basis. Focusing on investment activity, we spent $3 billion on development in 2023, net of the proceeds received from our first development JV closing in November, and we delivered over 230 megawatts of new capacity across the globe. Turning to the balance sheet. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet since the end of the third quarter. With the sale of $1.2 billion of equity through the ATM at an average price of $133 per share, achieving our goal of lowering our leverage towards six times and finishing the year at 6.2 times. After year-end, we made further progress on the balance sheet with the closings of the Cyxtera transactions in the first phase of the Blackstone joint venture. GI Partners also exercised their option and closed on an additional 15% share of the two stabilized assets in our Chicago JV, bringing their stake to 80%. Pro forma for these activities, year-end leverage was 5.8 times. S&P recognized our progress in December and upgraded our outlook. Early in the fourth quarter, we paid off our $100 million Swiss Franc notes and closed the Realty Income joint venture, which generated $200 million of gross proceeds and reduced our CapEx commitments for the remainder of the project's development. We continue to keep significant cash on the balance sheet with over $1.6 billion at year-end as we continue to prioritize liquidity and to support ongoing development spend. Moving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is nearly 4.5 years, and our weighted average interest rate is 2.9%. Approximately 84% of our debt is non-US dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 85% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have less than $1 billion of debt maturing in 2024 and beyond that, our maturities remained well laddered through 2032. I'll finish with guidance. We are providing an initial Core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2024 of $6.60 to $6.75. Reflecting the underlying growth of our business, offset by the impact of the deleveraging activities we completed or announced in 2023. As a reminder, over the course of 2024 and 2025, we expect that our $6 billion development pipeline will become increasingly accretive as higher-yielding projects deliver. For 2024, we expect total revenue to grow by 2% and adjusted EBITDA to grow by 4% at the midpoint of our guidance ranges. When normalizing this growth for the impact of capital recycling, total revenue and adjusted EBITDA are anticipated to grow by 7% and 10%, respectively, in 2024. We expect both our cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads, along with same capital cash NOI growth to remain solidly positive. While occupancy is expected to improve steadily throughout the year as our record backlog commences and available capacity is leased. Specifically, cash re-leasing spreads are expected to increase by 4% to 6% in 2024. Same capital cash NOI is expected to grow by 2% to 3%, and given the tougher base year comparison versus last year's 7.5% growth and our expectations for FX and energy pricing in our colo segment. Total portfolio occupancy is expected to improve by 100 to 200 basis points by the end of 2024 while total occupancy slipped to 81.7% in the fourth quarter of 2023. This was predominantly driven by the delivery of substantial vacant development capacity that is slated to be occupied as same capital occupancy was stable quarter-over-quarter. We also expect to continue to recycle capital in 2024 with noncore asset sales and stabilized joint ventures raising $1.25 billion at the midpoint of our guidance range. Nearly one-third of this activity was completed in early January, while the balance should close throughout this year. Along with cash on hand and retained cash flow from operations, this capital is expected to be the primary funding source of our $2 billion to $2.5 billion net development CapEx program for 2024. To be clear, this approximately 25% reduction in development spend year-over-year represents Digital Realty's share of CapEx spend. The total development spend on these projects will be higher when including our partners pro rata share. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?\nOperator: We will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. A couple of questions. First, in terms of, you were just describing the shift in same capital cash NOI growth from 7.5% to 2% to 3%. Can you unpack more of what you're seeing in '24 relative to '23? And how pricing kind of comes into the expectation for 2024?\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Mike. So we'll try to weave that into one answer, so trying to stick to one question and get through the whole roster and maybe loop back. But I'll turn it to Matt to give you the bridge on a same-store basis.\nMatthew Mercier: Sure. Thanks, Mike. So a couple of things that I would call out. First, in terms of, call it, the re-leasing spreads and their influence. First off, I think as we know, not all of our leases roll within the calendar year. So we roll roughly, call it, 20% to 25% of our portfolio in the year. And of that, 80% is in the 0 to 1 megawatt category, which is influenced by inflation or CPI, which we've seen come down over the course of the year, and therefore, part of the mark-to-market pricing within that segment. Then when you flip over the other 20%, which is in the greater than a megawatt category, we're seeing in '24 expiring rents that are higher than what we saw in '23, which creates a tougher comp in terms of the role despite strong market rents and overall growth. So that's on the spread side. The other part that I would call out is in '23, we saw benefits or tailwinds from FX as well as power pricing, which we're not seeing in '24, and lastly, in '24, we are expecting higher property tax expense. So putting all those together kind of is why you're seeing sort of the still positive, but not as positive as '23 results for same-store portfolio in '24.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe first, last night, we heard from one of your peers that the higher power prices in 2023 have created some sort of lagged crowding out effect in terms of budgeting and decision-making. And I was wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about that, kind of something like maybe you're hearing or seeing some of that in your colo business, but it wasn't crystal. And then just as a follow-up, if I could. Matt, can you break down that $1.25 billion in kind of -- or the rest of the $1.25 billion that's closing this year? What is -- how is it all breakdown and the cadence of that? Thank you.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Dave. This is Andy. I don't think we're experiencing the same exact dynamics on power as what you heard last night, quite honestly. I think what Matt, you just heard from Matt is the comps on a growth basis in the same-store pool are not as -- we benefited in '23 from power, and we're not going to have that kind of benefit repeat itself in 2024, assume it and I think this all is going to be washed out once we say by the '25, assuming we don't go back into this another, call it, very volatile power environment. So it's almost one-time in nature. I don't I don't believe that is impacted buyer behavior. And I don't believe we're suffering or benefiting depending on the period to the same degree of what was described. Maybe that's due to the market mix, overall business mix in our hedging strategy, which are not identical. I can tell you from a business standpoint, and you can see this in the results, we capped off a very strong year, let's call it, focused on the enterprise colo connectivity segment. Record overall new logos, North of 500. Strong quarters of new signings. You had a very strong interconnection quarter, both in new signings and also a flow through the P&L, which has been accelerating and net absorption certainly in that category that was strong in the fourth quarter and through the year. So I don't see the power flowing through. I know we're trying to get to one question per se and then rotate back well moved there, Greg, why don't you just touch on the components of the $1.25 billion in our guidance for data?\nGregory Wright: Sure. Thanks, Andy. Hey, David. How are you? Look, I think, again, there's two components there. It's really -- it's a stabilized joint ventures, and it's our sort of noncore asset disposition. And when you look at that, call it, $1.250 billion or a range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion, call it, I think it's important to note that over one-third of that has already been announced and is either closed or is pending close. So obviously we feel good about that number. And it's clearly much less in the context of last year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Elias with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMichael Elias: Great. Thanks for taking the question. So Andy, we're in the middle of one of the strongest hyperscale demand environment that we've seen in recent history. I was wondering, can you talk about the go-forward demand pipeline and the relative strength of the pipeline versus last year. And as part of that, can you talk about the opportunity set for the pricing for new leasing, specifically, is -- do you see there being a governor on pricing given the supply-demand backdrop that we're seeing? Thank you.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Michael. So I would say on a year-over-year basis, we are -- the dynamics has changed tremendously on so many fronts. Overall, the pipeline for hyperscale has continued to grow to new heights. I view the AI demand is a new wave of demand, incremental call enterprise, hybrid IT is certainly an incremental to hyperscale cloud compute. And this has all played out in the backdrop of tightening supply-demand dynamics that has called -- as we've described, over several quarters now, moved the pendulum on pricing more and more in the favor of providers like Digital Realty. Is there a ceiling? Listen, I think we've seen rates run tremendously. We just, this quarter, reported in that segment North of a megawatt, call it, our highest GAAP rate ever at $145 million we are continuing to see -- it's almost like some of these customers who are often on calendar fiscal years, just like Digital Realty, wrapped up one budget cycle and got a budget refresh and came back in 2024 with the incremental appetite for demand. These customers are seeking some of the same things. When we intersect with that demand is in our large-scale hyperscale campuses that are in our major markets and especially with larger capacity blocks that have contiguous capacity or the most sought after. And those rates continue to run in terms of what we've signed and where we put up quotes and I think we're very well positioned. If you look at our footprint, you can see a lot of it on development capacity life cycle, which is just a portion of what we activate in Northern Virginia right now, but some of the other major markets as well to capture a good -- more than our fair share of that demand. And lastly, I think there's a -- I think there's a broader acknowledgment whether it is hyperscale compute or AI workloads that these customers our time to market, many of them are trying to land precious GPUs that are just enormous business opportunities for these customers. And our rent even historically, but certainly today, plays a very small economic piece in that equation relative to their ability to launch their services and be first to market many times.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Atkin: Yeah, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about where we might end the year kind of in terms of leverage, where do some of the outcomes there and the role of ATM issuances, equity issuance is as part of that? Thanks.\nMatthew Mercier: Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. So look, I think, you've seen the results of the work we've done in '23, where we talked about getting down to the six times area. And the execution that not only Greg's team on did with the transaction that we closed, but also sales on the ATM that we did early in the year and then more recently, getting to that point and actually breaking through that when you look at it on a pro forma basis, we're at 5.8 times. And we -- and so we continue to want to get down towards that 5.5 times area, which is the same messaging we've had since the start of '23, and we've executed on that path. And we think that the plan that we've laid out here in terms of our guidance will enable us to get us there where we're continuing some level of capital recycling given the broad and diverse sources of capital that we've got available to us. And that's the plan we're going to continue to go down in terms of marching towards that 5.5% area, which is a smaller task than what we did in '23.\nOperator: The next question comes from Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nIrvin Liu: Hi. Thank you for the question. I'll stick to one. Andy, you mentioned demand for large blocks of capacity in several key markets such as Nova and Silicon Valley among some of the other major markets. At an aggregate level, I think, overall supply remains very low in some of these markets. But specifically for you, has lower available capacity been a gating factor for your greater than one megawatt signings performance?\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Irvin. We certainly have a really great opportunity to intersect with these large capacity block needs of our customers, be it for AI or hyperscale. It is, I would say, maybe potentially unparalleled in what we can offer in Northern Virginia today in terms of available capacity in a market that's shut down in terms of new power until 2026. But the list goes beyond that, whether it's Dallas, Santa Clara, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Seoul or parts of Japan, not to mention some of our joint ventures in Latin America and South Africa. We've taken our approach quite honestly where many of these capacity blocks for ourselves and many providers were at the early stages of development. They were at land, went pad-ready. Shelves are coming online and just the first suites were coming online. And throughout 2023, we took a more, call it, approach whereby we didn't go run after the first deal out of the gate for some of these customers because we knew we weren't losing a revenue opportunity because the capacity wasn't even being able to be moved into or at least commenced. And in hindsight, that's proven fortuitous because as the year has played out, and certainly as 2024 has gotten off out of those gates, we've continue to see what we're offering is becoming much more and more attractive to an even broader and diverse set of customers. So I don't think we'll be able to be late too long in 2024. We obviously now have some capacity blocks that are actually live and we can commence rent on. So we do have some urgency to get that going. But I think our patients and prudence here and approach allowed us to prove right. sometimes better to be lucky than smart. If I would have known Ashford would have run out of power years ago, I would have -- we wouldn't have sold all that capacity we had to release at the time. But this time, we -- the luck was our side.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nDavid Guarino: Thanks. Hey, Andy, on your comments, at least how I heard on a potentially very high ceiling for rental rates. As I kind of take that into consideration and look across the lease expiration table in the greater than one megawatt category it appears you guys have a pretty favorable mark-to-market rent opportunity over the next few years. Am I fair to make that assumption? Or is there a chance that some of your leases might have clauses that could limit how much you're able to participate in the upside?\nAndrew Power: Thanks, David. So the -- I think you heard me loud and clear on where rates have come from and where they've gone and where they're likely to continue to move and some of these markets haven't even hit peak historical rates, if you look at the whole span of data center capacity. So I don't think we're at a rent bubble or near that necessarily and it's been on the back of real constraints and build costs that have inflated and issues. So they are -- I believe these rental moves are justified. I think you will continue to see the cash mark-to-markets flow through in our favor. We did call out in -- throughout last year and in the script for this quarter that we had some episodic short-term renewals inflated our cash mark-to-market, but we think being, call it, 4% to 6% in that category overall is pretty in our favor. And to your question on the bigger deals where you're going to have these potential roll-ups, yes, we do have subsections of our contracts that have clauses that are certainly in the favor of our customer. When the market was quite the opposite of what it was today and it was filling baking capacity, we certainly had to succumb to some of those clauses that our customers. But they all often are very narrowly defined in terms of fixed duration of renewal time period and other bells and whistles. And when a customer, which they often do wants to negotiate outside of that box that opens up the contract renegotiations. And we try to collaborate with our customers to come into a mutually agreeable outcome. So that's a long-winded way of saying, I don't think we'll be able to roll every one of those, call it, sub 100-plus megawatts directly up to the 140 or 150 or 160 or whatever we're going in the market. But I think we'll -- I do think there is going to be a positive mark-to-market in that category for some years to come.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAri Klein: Thanks. Andy, there's a lot of moving parts that are impacting the 2024 guidance that I think Matt mentioned 10% EBITDA growth normalized for the deleveraging activity I guess as you move past some of the headwinds creating dilution, and as you noted, it seems like pricing and mark-to-market tailwinds should be here for a while. What kind of growth do you think you can deliver beyond 2024 on the bottom line from a longer-term standpoint?\nAndrew Power: Matt, do you want to start us off on that one?\nMatthew Mercier: Sure. Yes. So a couple of things. So Ari, thanks as we did mention, on a normalized basis in '24 or a lot of -- for the transactional activity that hit in '23 and some -- and what we expect in '24. I do want to reiterate, we're looking at normalized growth at 7% on revenue and 10% on EBITDA as you noted. And so '24 is seeing the impact from the timing of those transactions and close where in '23, there in the second half of the year, and '24, we're expecting them, as Greg noted earlier, where we've already got a decent portion of that under contract, those are closed in the first part of '24. So creating some of that impacting on '24 bottom line. And we did all that at the same time, again, just as a reminder, that we're delevering over a turn. If you look through all that, what we would expect is that we look at it in sort of two buckets in terms of cost of growth algorithm. First one being, we would expect on our stabilized same-store pool to have seen growth in that 3% to 4% area. On top of that, looking at our development pipeline, the favorable pricing, better yields and as those start to deliver in '24 and '25, we would expect to see another 1% to 2% on top of that too. Together, that gets us to kind of the mid- to high single digits that we should expect to see in '25 and beyond.\nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank, your line is open.\nFrank Louthan: Sorry about that. I heard from several of your peers and some equipment companies and so forth about some macro issues that they're seeing with elongated sales cycles and squeezing some IT budgets. You mentioned some cross-connect grooming you've seen. Are you seeing anything like that from your enterprise business or elsewhere from any sort of macro pressures in part of your business?\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Frank. I want to have Colin tackle what we're seeing in the, I'll call it, enterprise sales cycle.\nColin McLean: Yes. Thanks, Frank, for the question. Appreciate it. As Andy highlighted, the pipeline across the board is robust and that's both above and below one megawatt. And we certainly see our customers engaging consistently with this related to growing their platform globally. So that $53 million back-to-back strong quarters, I think the testimony to how we're supporting their needs pretty well. In fact, 1,000-plus companies landed with us in Q4, which, again, I think it's a strong growth testimony. In terms of time to close overall, I think we had highlighted previously a couple of hiccups, maybe early in the year, Q1, Q2 in terms of expanded time to close. We haven't really seen that, honestly to date. It's really flattened out. And so I really think it's a by-product of us engaging showing up differently. The new logo engagement, I think, overall has been particularly strong we did 134 new logos last quarter. So on the enterprise side, on the whole, I think we've seen pretty strong interest pipeline and then execution on the whole.\nChristopher Sharp: Right. And one thing I'd like to spread a bit more detail on the equipment. With the offering that we launched last year around the high-density colo in anticipation of a lot of private AI type of deployment coming to market. A part of that program is not only that the 32 markets and three regions being able to do 70 kilowatts a rack. What we're really doing is pre-buying a lot of the technology to support that power density to allow our customers to deploy in a very timely fashion, but also expedites a bit of that higher end kind of new AI capability coming to market.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Niknam: Hey, thank you for taking the question. Financial question. So with leverage now back under six turns on a pro forma basis, how do you now think about the dividend and potential forward growth relative to incremental investments in the business and/or potential M&A? Thanks.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Matt. So multi fast, I'm going to hand to Matt to explain how the dividend call works in terms of taxable income and distribution and why the dividend is set where it is set. Because I think the topic of M&A, I mean, you could look at the linear press releases or just recent events we've done in just the last several months through resolving our relationship to Cyxtera to growing our platform in India with the addition of Reliance Jio. We also just had a big announcement with the leader in the GPU space recently to disposing of some noncore assets, JVs stabilized assets and adding strategically to our landholdings across key markets. So we've been incredibly active on pieces of that. I think the broader context of M&A, I think the most critical puzzle pieces have kind of been picked over. And most of our activity from here are really, call it, extending our strategic advantages and bolt-on in nature to what we have. I don't see any like key gems out there that would be really additive to our global platform at peak. Matt, why don't you hit on the dividend, Matt, if you want that.\nMatthew Mercier: Sure. I mean, similar to what we've talked about in '23, I mean, there's two major components in terms of the dividend and related to taxable income. There's our ordinary income that we get from operations, and then there's also the income that's generated from transactions and the related gains that we have from executing those, which we had a sizable amount of the '23. Now we're looking at less transaction size in '24, but as you saw in the guidance, you talked about $1 billion to $1.5 billion. So we expect that there'll still be related income from that, and we still have cash flow even after dividend and we think we'll be able to support where we are. And ultimately, our goal and target is that we grow the dividend as AFFO and as our cash flow grows, which we expect we'll start to see over the long term related to the growth algorithm that I talked about earlier.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks very much. Good evening. I wanted to just talk about the mix between the 0 to 1 and the greater than 1 megawatt. It looks like you had almost 50% coming from 0 to 1 plus interconnection. That's been gradually rising over the last few quarters. So how do we think about this going forward? Your focus on -- should that mix trend higher than the 50-50? Or is it going to be jumping around as it has done in the past? Thanks.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Simon. So one of our top, top, top priorities is to continue to focus on delivering acceleration in that 0 to 1 megawatt interconnection cohort, enterprise connectivity in order to customers, the most granular and the largest volume of over 5,000 customers as well as our new logos. So by and large, the more quarters where that represents a larger and increasing piece of the mix and continues to accelerate like it has done recently, that is filling our existing baking capacity. It's wins at our highest rates, it's multi-market, multi-geo enterprise customers and is the place where we believe we can deliver the greatest value to our customers, most consistently and long-term and durable there will be episodic quarters where that will be a lower percentage. But that's likely enough because we've filtered our execution. That's likely because we also are supporting some of the largest hyperscalers around the world. We're bringing our capacity in over half of our 50-plus metropolitan areas, places where we can really add value to those customers where they've already landed their compute or AZs where they want to grow at our continuous capacity with operational excellence, where we have that long runway of growth that they can get from no one else. And those are we quarters where we saw larger lumpier deals, obviously, into those capacity blocks. So we think both of these are large addressable markets where we have a distinct value proposition and a competitive moat that we'll continue to focus on executing each and every day.\nOperator: The next question comes from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nErik Rasmussen: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just on AI. It seems most of the demand in the early stages is expected to come from training versus inferencing. But we heard from Microsoft on their earnings call, and they said that most of the AI strength that they were seeing for Azure was, in fact, from inferencing workloads. Are you seeing the same as it relates to sort of the demand patterns from your customers? And then maybe any way to quantify how much AI has contributed or the size of the opportunity. Thanks.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Erik. Let me just touch on this a little bit and then hand it to Chris to walk you through chapter and verse. I look at where our heritage is as a company, this AI opportunity is tremendously in our wheelhouse. We came with this from a hyperscale piece of the business and build the colo connectivity capabilities organically and inorganically. We are often taking larger halls that are at higher power densities and using our engineering prowess to work for enterprise customers and pushing their boundaries on power densities. I can tell you, AI workloads were at digital before I joined over nine years ago. We've done retrofits on existing deployments just to fit up for customers needing AI just this year. At the end of last year, I was to one of our Paris facilities. We're one of our partner customers have fitted out of liquid cooling for a multinational financial services company, live environments which meant that they had to get going on that years ago to be live at the end of last year. So this is right in our wheelhouse, and we've been winning in that category in the last year in the, call it, several hundred kilowatt domain to the 30-plus megawatt piece of this, and you've seen some testimonials on that. Chris, why don't you give a little bit of color as to some of the verticals we've been winning and where do you see this going as well?\nChristopher Sharp: Yes. It's a great question and appreciate it, Eric. I think there's a couple of dynamics that you touched on. The training to inference. That's something that we've been watching for some time. And we're selective with some of the training environments just because we're looking for a long-term durable workload being deployed into the asset. And so a lot of the customers we see today are actually doing training or inference inside of their training just because of sheer availability of the GPUs and time to market, but we definitely see the long tail of that value happening in inference and then also kind of another section of private AI and so we're seeing customers come to market with these types of requirements where Andy alluded to this at a high level coming from our heritage of scale and then being able to evolve and support a colo type of capability, if you will, allows us to support a higher power density need with our versatile designs. And so being highly focused on that with a lot of the hyperscale customers and being foundational for their cloud services has been top of mind. And then I think another element that may be overlooked is a lot of this inference is embedded in a lot of our top customers today as capabilities. So when you read about, and I think you referenced Microsoft and the work that they've been doing with CoPilot, a lot of that AI is embedded in enhancing their current product capabilities. And so we're constantly watching how that evolves, but being proximate to the AI being proximate to the existing infrastructure and workload is absolutely something that we're very excited about because that inference benefits from the data oceans that exist within Digital Realty, their current infrastructure and how all that culminates together. So it's something you'll see play out over this year. I think we just had a really good case study with KakaoBank where that's highlighted private AI deployment where they're able to generate and do a little bit of R&D around new product offerings for a financial vertical. So these are the things you're going to see play out in 2024 that we're very excited about.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nNick Del Deo: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on the assumptions you're making about the broader lease environment and the pricing environment to get to the 4% to 6% range for cash renewal spreads. Are you just basically taking current prices as a given? Or are you kind of assuming further increases or other changes? And can you share anything about how the expected renewal spreads look for zero to one versus greater one categories? Thanks.\nAndrew Power: Sure, Matt. Why don't you take that?\nMatthew Mercier: Yes. So thanks, Nick. With regard to -- I think I'll go back to some of the comments I had, I think, from one of the first questions. So with regard to 0 to 1 megawatt, that's on both the escalation and renewals tend to be influenced by inflation where CPI is coming in. So that's going to be spread across the leases that are rolling, whether they be in North America versus EMEA. And those have come down since last year and more in that 3% to 4%, 3% to 4% range. And now on the greater than 1 megawatt, as I mentioned, we're assuming, call it, current market pricing and that's more heavily influenced by where the expiring rates are versus that. So that's within the greater than the megawatt segment, which we're assuming still positive and resulting in the 4% to 6% total that we've guided towards.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Nispel: Hey, thanks. Just a quick question. I think in the guidance for development capital, this is the first time it's actually been guided to net of capital contributions. Can you maybe talk about what your total capital outlay will look like in '24 versus '23 on a like-for-like basis? Thanks.\nMatthew Mercier: Sure. Yes. So I mean, obviously, the net is given the development joint ventures that we've established over '23 and that will also close that are under contract in throughout '24 in particular with the one we announced with Blackstone. Phase I is already closed and Phase II is later in the year. And if you're looking at it from a gross basis in comparison, we're expecting in '24 on a gross basis, we'd be spending north of $3.5 billion in terms of total CapEx and it would be -- which would be roughly 15% higher than the amount that we spent in 2023.\nOperator: That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power, for his closing remarks.\nAndrew Power: Thank you, Betsy. Digital Realty capped off a transformative 2023 with a strong fourth quarter that was highlighted by three key elements. First, we sourced over $12 billion of new capital and commitments from an array of hyperscale private capital partners, deleveraging our balance sheet and positioning the company for the future. Second, we posted another quarter of improving organic operating results with the best same-capital cash NOI growth in nearly a decade, and we are just on the cusp of the AI wave of demand. Third, we continue to grow our footprint and capacity around the world with record deliveries in 2023 to meet the accelerating needs of our growing customer base. These customers look to us to help enable their IT solutions, whether that is AI, cloud or even enterprises along their digital transformation journeys, our value proposition is resonating, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today with a special thank you to our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keeps the digital world turning. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

It's really -- it's a stabilized joint ventures, and it's our sort of noncore asset disposition. And when you look at that, call it, $1.250 billion or a range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion, call it, I think it's important to note that over one-third of that has already been announced and is either closed or is pending close.

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Matthew Mercier",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our fourth quarter results. We signed a total of $110 million of new leases in the fourth quarter with $53 million of 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection leasing, led by strength in the EMEA region. Interconnection bookings rebounded sequentially to $13.5 million, and we finished the year with 220,000 cross-connects despite continued network grooming. Turning to our backlog slide. The current backlog of signed by [Technical Difficulty] commenced leases increased to a new record of $495 million at quarter end as new leasing outran $84 million of commencements in the quarter. We expect commencements to pick up as nearly two-thirds of the backlog is scheduled to commence in 2024, with the majority coming in the second half of the year. During the fourth quarter, we signed $210 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 8.2% on a cash basis, setting the high watermark for the year, though this was skewed over 100 basis points by shorter-term renewals in one market. For the full year, cash renewal spreads were up 6.8% and or 5.5% when normalizing for short-term extensions. Re-leasing spreads were positive across product, market and region in 2023, setting the foundation for an acceleration in long-term sustainable growth. In 2024, we expect the pricing environment to remain firm and renewal spreads to remain positive, principally reflecting the near 80% weighting of lease expirations in the 0 to 1 megawatt segment. In terms of earnings growth, we reported fourth quarter Core FFO of $1.63 per share and $6.59 for the full year within our guidance range. Earnings reflect the continued strong organic results, together with the impact from capital recycling, deleveraging and increased development spending throughout the year, as discussed on our third quarter call. Total revenue was up 11% year-over-year despite the incremental drag from the stabilized JV contributions and the noncore asset sales that closed in the third quarter. As we also noted last quarter, year-over-year revenue growth continued to be positively impacted by the significant volatility in utility costs and reimbursements, particularly in Europe. Energy dynamics proved to be a tailwind for our results in 2023. Assuming more normalized energy prices, we expect the related upside impact will moderate in 2024. Interconnection revenue was $106 million, up 9% year-over-year, reflecting continued unit growth and price increases. Moving over to the expense side. Utilities were 5% lower sequentially, reflecting the joint venture contributions over the summer, combined with seasonal impacts. Operating expenses increased due to seasonally elevated maintenance spending in the fourth quarter. Property taxes fell back toward normalized levels, reflecting the onetime property tax reassessment experienced in the third quarter. Net of this movement, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% year-over-year. Improvement in our stabilized same capital operating performance continued in the fourth quarter with a year-over-year cash NOI up a strong 9.9% and up 7.7% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, results were also strong with cash NOI growth of 7.5% and 6.5% on a constant currency basis. Focusing on investment activity, we spent $3 billion on development in 2023, net of the proceeds received from our first development JV closing in November, and we delivered over 230 megawatts of new capacity across the globe. Turning to the balance sheet. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet since the end of the third quarter. With the sale of $1.2 billion of equity through the ATM at an average price of $133 per share, achieving our goal of lowering our leverage towards six times and finishing the year at 6.2 times. After year-end, we made further progress on the balance sheet with the closings of the Cyxtera transactions in the first phase of the Blackstone joint venture. GI Partners also exercised their option and closed on an additional 15% share of the two stabilized assets in our Chicago JV, bringing their stake to 80%. Pro forma for these activities, year-end leverage was 5.8 times. S&P recognized our progress in December and upgraded our outlook. Early in the fourth quarter, we paid off our $100 million Swiss Franc notes and closed the Realty Income joint venture, which generated $200 million of gross proceeds and reduced our CapEx commitments for the remainder of the project's development. We continue to keep significant cash on the balance sheet with over $1.6 billion at year-end as we continue to prioritize liquidity and to support ongoing development spend. Moving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is nearly 4.5 years, and our weighted average interest rate is 2.9%. Approximately 84% of our debt is non-US dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 85% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have less than $1 billion of debt maturing in 2024 and beyond that, our maturities remained well laddered through 2032. I'll finish with guidance. We are providing an initial Core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2024 of $6.60 to $6.75. Reflecting the underlying growth of our business, offset by the impact of the deleveraging activities we completed or announced in 2023. As a reminder, over the course of 2024 and 2025, we expect that our $6 billion development pipeline will become increasingly accretive as higher-yielding projects deliver. For 2024, we expect total revenue to grow by 2% and adjusted EBITDA to grow by 4% at the midpoint of our guidance ranges. When normalizing this growth for the impact of capital recycling, total revenue and adjusted EBITDA are anticipated to grow by 7% and 10%, respectively, in 2024. We expect both our cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads, along with same capital cash NOI growth to remain solidly positive. While occupancy is expected to improve steadily throughout the year as our record backlog commences and available capacity is leased. Specifically, cash re-leasing spreads are expected to increase by 4% to 6% in 2024. Same capital cash NOI is expected to grow by 2% to 3%, and given the tougher base year comparison versus last year's 7.5% growth and our expectations for FX and energy pricing in our colo segment. Total portfolio occupancy is expected to improve by 100 to 200 basis points by the end of 2024 while total occupancy slipped to 81.7% in the fourth quarter of 2023. This was predominantly driven by the delivery of substantial vacant development capacity that is slated to be occupied as same capital occupancy was stable quarter-over-quarter. We also expect to continue to recycle capital in 2024 with noncore asset sales and stabilized joint ventures raising $1.25 billion at the midpoint of our guidance range. Nearly one-third of this activity was completed in early January, while the balance should close throughout this year. Along with cash on hand and retained cash flow from operations, this capital is expected to be the primary funding source of our $2 billion to $2.5 billion net development CapEx program for 2024. To be clear, this approximately 25% reduction in development spend year-over-year represents Digital Realty's share of CapEx spend. The total development spend on these projects will be higher when including our partners pro rata share. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? Sure. Thanks, Mike. So a couple of things that I would call out. First, in terms of, call it, the re-leasing spreads and their influence. First off, I think as we know, not all of our leases roll within the calendar year. So we roll roughly, call it, 20% to 25% of our portfolio in the year. And of that, 80% is in the 0 to 1 megawatt category, which is influenced by inflation or CPI, which we've seen come down over the course of the year, and therefore, part of the mark-to-market pricing within that segment. Then when you flip over the other 20%, which is in the greater than a megawatt category, we're seeing in '24 expiring rents that are higher than what we saw in '23, which creates a tougher comp in terms of the role despite strong market rents and overall growth. So that's on the spread side. The other part that I would call out is in '23, we saw benefits or tailwinds from FX as well as power pricing, which we're not seeing in '24, and lastly, in '24, we are expecting higher property tax expense. So putting all those together kind of is why you're seeing sort of the still positive, but not as positive as '23 results for same-store portfolio in '24. Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. So look, I think, you've seen the results of the work we've done in '23, where we talked about getting down to the six times area. And the execution that not only Greg's team on did with the transaction that we closed, but also sales on the ATM that we did early in the year and then more recently, getting to that point and actually breaking through that when you look at it on a pro forma basis, we're at 5.8 times. And we -- and so we continue to want to get down towards that 5.5 times area, which is the same messaging we've had since the start of '23, and we've executed on that path. And we think that the plan that we've laid out here in terms of our guidance will enable us to get us there where we're continuing some level of capital recycling given the broad and diverse sources of capital that we've got available to us. And that's the plan we're going to continue to go down in terms of marching towards that 5.5% area, which is a smaller task than what we did in '23. Sure. Yes. So a couple of things. So Ari, thanks as we did mention, on a normalized basis in '24 or a lot of -- for the transactional activity that hit in '23 and some -- and what we expect in '24. I do want to reiterate, we're looking at normalized growth at 7% on revenue and 10% on EBITDA as you noted. And so '24 is seeing the impact from the timing of those transactions and close where in '23, there in the second half of the year, and '24, we're expecting them, as Greg noted earlier, where we've already got a decent portion of that under contract, those are closed in the first part of '24. So creating some of that impacting on '24 bottom line. And we did all that at the same time, again, just as a reminder, that we're delevering over a turn. If you look through all that, what we would expect is that we look at it in sort of two buckets in terms of cost of growth algorithm. First one being, we would expect on our stabilized same-store pool to have seen growth in that 3% to 4% area. On top of that, looking at our development pipeline, the favorable pricing, better yields and as those start to deliver in '24 and '25, we would expect to see another 1% to 2% on top of that too. Together, that gets us to kind of the mid- to high single digits that we should expect to see in '25 and beyond. Sure. I mean, similar to what we've talked about in '23, I mean, there's two major components in terms of the dividend and related to taxable income. There's our ordinary income that we get from operations, and then there's also the income that's generated from transactions and the related gains that we have from executing those, which we had a sizable amount of the '23. Now we're looking at less transaction size in '24, but as you saw in the guidance, you talked about $1 billion to $1.5 billion. So we expect that there'll still be related income from that, and we still have cash flow even after dividend and we think we'll be able to support where we are. And ultimately, our goal and target is that we grow the dividend as AFFO and as our cash flow grows, which we expect we'll start to see over the long term related to the growth algorithm that I talked about earlier. Yes. So thanks, Nick. With regard to -- I think I'll go back to some of the comments I had, I think, from one of the first questions. So with regard to 0 to 1 megawatt, that's on both the escalation and renewals tend to be influenced by inflation where CPI is coming in. So that's going to be spread across the leases that are rolling, whether they be in North America versus EMEA. And those have come down since last year and more in that 3% to 4%, 3% to 4% range. And now on the greater than 1 megawatt, as I mentioned, we're assuming, call it, current market pricing and that's more heavily influenced by where the expiring rates are versus that. So that's within the greater than the megawatt segment, which we're assuming still positive and resulting in the 4% to 6% total that we've guided towards. Sure. Yes. So I mean, obviously, the net is given the development joint ventures that we've established over '23 and that will also close that are under contract in throughout '24 in particular with the one we announced with Blackstone. Phase I is already closed and Phase II is later in the year. And if you're looking at it from a gross basis in comparison, we're expecting in '24 on a gross basis, we'd be spending north of $3.5 billion in terms of total CapEx and it would be -- which would be roughly 15% higher than the amount that we spent in 2023."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Frank, for the question. Appreciate it. As Andy highlighted, the pipeline across the board is robust and that's both above and below one megawatt. And we certainly see our customers engaging consistently with this related to growing their platform globally. So that $53 million back-to-back strong quarters, I think the testimony to how we're supporting their needs pretty well. In fact, 1,000-plus companies landed with us in Q4, which, again, I think it's a strong growth testimony. In terms of time to close overall, I think we had highlighted previously a couple of hiccups, maybe early in the year, Q1, Q2 in terms of expanded time to close. We haven't really seen that, honestly to date. It's really flattened out. And so I really think it's a by-product of us engaging showing up differently. The new logo engagement, I think, overall has been particularly strong we did 134 new logos last quarter. So on the enterprise side, on the whole, I think we've seen pretty strong interest pipeline and then execution on the whole."

For me, 2023 will be revered as the year of AI's arrival to the data center forefront, ushering in an unprecedented new wave of data center demand, driving a step function of change across the industry's landscape. The year that Digital Realty enhanced its customer value proposition by adding connectivity-rich solutions while also scaling our capacity for hyperscale and AI workloads. We expanded our footprint with new connectivity-oriented locations around the Mediterranean and elsewhere. Enhanced our joint venture in India with the addition of Reliance Jio and increased the number of direct access points on our campuses to the leading cloud and service providers. We accelerated the growth of service fabric with more than 70 discrete services added to the platform and over 100 unique services available by year-end and enhance its capabilities with new composes like service directory. We also added 9,000 new cross connects in the year, indicative of our growing connected data communities. 2023 was a year that we integrated and innovated at a faster pace than ever before. We strengthened our leadership team and aligned our platform to three regions to be consistently structured around the world. We adapted our product portfolio to meet market demand, evolving our offering to efficiently support next-generation chips like the NVIDIA H-100 in numerous data centers. Our high-density colo capability deployed across 32 markets spending all three regions is equipped to handle three times the H-100 requirements. And we continue to add green energy solutions to power many of these power dense applications. Like our large solar PPA in Germany and our agreement supporting 100% renewable power in Texas, San Francisco, New Jersey and Sydney. And 2023 was the year that Digital Realty took decisive action to strengthen our balance sheet by developing a portfolio of private capital partnerships and vehicles that diversified our capital sources while enabling us to support our customers' fast-growing requirements. And we did all of that while continuing to provide the operational excellence that is expected of a global data center leader and that our customers rightfully demand. On this call a year ago, I outlined a plan to bolster and diversify our capital sources. Our goals were to reduce our leverage towards six times by the end of the year. Increase our liquidity to fund our development program and diversify our capital sources to limit our reliance on the capital markets, increasing our ability to meet the accelerating demand for data center capacity and to enhance our returns on invested capital. We outperformed on each of these goals, sourcing over $12 billion of new capital and commitments for new investment and debt repayment, reducing pro forma leverage to just 5.8 times when adjusted for transactions that have been announced or closed since year-end. We also ended the year with five new JV partners and expanded some of our existing relationships. To round out the year, we announced three significant transactions in the fourth quarter, including two development joint ventures and the successful resolution to our relationship with Cyxtera, we also raised $1.2 billion of equity under our ATM since the end of September. I will quickly run through the highlights of these transactions. In early January, Greg completed his famed Triple Lindy with the Cyxtera transaction by selling $275 million of assets to Brookfield along with the purchase of Cyxtera's leasehold positions in Singapore and Frankfurt for $55 million, yielding net cash of $220 million to Digital Realty. In addition, Brookfield assumed three existing leases and amended three others in our portfolio to accelerate their expiration to the end of September 2024. Finally, Digital Realty obtained and exercised an option to purchase a Cyxtera data center and the Slough Trading Estate adding one of London's highly sought-after submarkets to Platform Digital's connectivity and enterprise colo offering. This transaction remains subject to customer closing conditions and is expected to close towards the end of the first quarter. In November, Realty Income purchased an 80% interest in 400 million data centers that are under development and leased to an investment-grade financial services company. The tenant has the option to expand the facility up to an estimated potential cost of $800 million. We received $200 million upon closing and reduced our funding obligations for the remainder of this project to just 20% of the total capital, enabling us to reinvest the capital in higher-return projects. Finally, the $7 billion development joint venture with Blackstone is our largest and most forward-looking transaction and accelerates the monetization of nearly 20% of our three-plus gigawatt land bank. This JV involves the sale of an 80% interest in nearly 500 megawatts of capacity across four campuses in Paris, Frankfurt and Northern Virginia and enables us to better support our hyperscale customers' needs. Approximately 20% of ventures total potential data center capacity is expected to be delivered through 2025. We will retain a 20% interest in the developments and earn fees for developing, leasing, operating and managing these facilities. All told, in 2023, we announced or completed joint ventures and asset sales driving leverage down roughly 1.3 turns from the first quarter peak accelerating our ability to deliver needed capacity to our customers and enhancing our returns on invested capital. I would also be remiss if I did not mention Digital Core REIT's successful $120 million follow-on equity offering last week which will support the REIT's planned acquisition of an incremental 24.9% interest in our jointly owned asset in Frankfurt for $125 million. Let's shift to a brief recap of our results and offer some insights into the trends we are seeing across our business. I'm pleased with our results for 2023, which helped to lay the foundation for an acceleration in long-term sustainable growth in earnings and free cash flow that should take shape as we head into 2025. Our fourth quarter results were broadly consistent with the first three quarters of 2023 with continued strength in our operating performance KPIs and an incremental improvement in our financial position as we continue to execute on our value proposition with the goal to support the increased demand for data center capacity. Leasing remained healthy, especially in our targeted 0 to 1 plus interconnection segment with 134 new logos, bringing our total new logos for 2023 to a new annual record of more than 500. Renewal spreads were strong for the fifth consecutive quarter, remaining positive across product types and regions. Same capital cash NOI growth continue to demonstrate the underlying strength of our business with 9.9% year-over-year growth in the quarter. And churn remained low and well controlled at 1%, while occupancy was impacted by the delivery of significant vacant development capacity. The combination of cloud and AI is driving unprecedented demand for scale and hyperscale capacity alongside the steady enterprise and connectivity-oriented demand we're experiencing within our 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment. Supply constraints driven by limited availability of power and global supply chain delays have continued to drive the pricing pendulum in our favor or our growing value proposition is increasing interest in our existing inventory and the new development that we have underway. Ongoing conversations with customers pretend a significant potential acceleration of leasing and development and we believe we are well positioned. The demand seems to be spilling across most markets, particularly for larger capacity blocks, though there are a few pockets of strength worth noting, including Northern Virginia, Santa Clara, New Jersey, Paris, Frankfurt, Singapore and Seoul. Our new capacity is concentrated in core markets aligned with our global meeting place strategy. While the scale of data center infrastructure opportunities has increased alongside AI's arrival, we remain disciplined and thoughtful prioritizing locations that enhance Platform Digital connectivity and our connected campus communities. During the fourth quarter, Digital demonstrated the benefits of collaborating with our partners with the signing of an Oracle Cloud infrastructure dedicated region deployment by a financial services customer, showcasing the potential of the collaboration between Oracle and Digital Realty to fulfill enterprise customers' hybrid cloud requirements. Other customers are recognizing the growing value of Platform Digital's broad and open structure. An AI service provider leveraged Platform Digital's pre-provisioned high-density colo offering to improve their time to market in order to extend our North America and AI cloud offering that provides managed AI as a service for a global manufacturing client. A global service provider and partner targeting enterprises and customers added more connectivity for their hybrid offerings on Platform Digital, enabling them to upgrade their IT environments to a consumption-based IT infrastructure and managed services model. A Global 2000 leader in material sciences for industrial and scientific applications needed a data center provider with global interconnectivity and access to cloud providers in Seoul and shows Platform Digital to enable them to deploy and interconnect a private AI node. A Global 50 financial services company is migrating from an on-prem data center to Platform Digital and utilizing service fabric to improve sustainability, resiliency, scalability, security and carrier diversity. And a leading Global 2000 consumer goods manufacturer grew their presence on Platform Digital by adding two additional metros to support their IT workloads and cloud connectivity. Moving over to a quick update on our largest market, Northern Virginia. We have over 100 megawatts available for lease today in Loudon County and nearly 200 megawatts of capacity available for lease in Manassas. We are currently in active negotiations with a handful of customers for substantially all of our capacity in Loudon, though in contrast with the rumor mill, nothing has been finalized just yet. Beyond this capacity, we have another 900 megawatts of buildable capacity at DigitalDose, which we are cautiously optimistic will gain access to power in 2026 and beyond. We also expect to benefit from the active and ongoing management of our existing 500-megawatt portfolio in this market over time. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the fourth quarter. We continue to be recognized for our strong ESG performance in the fourth quarter and in 2024. We placed second on Sustainability Magazine's List of top 10 sustainable data center providers. We improved to number eight on the US EPA's Green Power partnership National Top 100 for renewable energy use and we were named as a top rated regional performer in North America by a leading global ESG ratings provider. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn over the call to our CFO, Matt Mercier. Thanks, Mike. So we'll try to weave that into one answer, so trying to stick to one question and get through the whole roster and maybe loop back. But I'll turn it to Matt to give you the bridge on a same-store basis. Thanks, Dave. This is Andy. I don't think we're experiencing the same exact dynamics on power as what you heard last night, quite honestly. I think what Matt, you just heard from Matt is the comps on a growth basis in the same-store pool are not as -- we benefited in '23 from power, and we're not going to have that kind of benefit repeat itself in 2024, assume it and I think this all is going to be washed out once we say by the '25, assuming we don't go back into this another, call it, very volatile power environment. So it's almost one-time in nature. I don't I don't believe that is impacted buyer behavior. And I don't believe we're suffering or benefiting depending on the period to the same degree of what was described. Maybe that's due to the market mix, overall business mix in our hedging strategy, which are not identical. I can tell you from a business standpoint, and you can see this in the results, we capped off a very strong year, let's call it, focused on the enterprise colo connectivity segment. Record overall new logos, North of 500. Strong quarters of new signings. You had a very strong interconnection quarter, both in new signings and also a flow through the P&L, which has been accelerating and net absorption certainly in that category that was strong in the fourth quarter and through the year. So I don't see the power flowing through. I know we're trying to get to one question per se and then rotate back well moved there, Greg, why don't you just touch on the components of the $1.25 billion in our guidance for data? Thanks, Michael. So I would say on a year-over-year basis, we are -- the dynamics has changed tremendously on so many fronts. Overall, the pipeline for hyperscale has continued to grow to new heights. I view the AI demand is a new wave of demand, incremental call enterprise, hybrid IT is certainly an incremental to hyperscale cloud compute. And this has all played out in the backdrop of tightening supply-demand dynamics that has called -- as we've described, over several quarters now, moved the pendulum on pricing more and more in the favor of providers like Digital Realty. Is there a ceiling? Listen, I think we've seen rates run tremendously. We just, this quarter, reported in that segment North of a megawatt, call it, our highest GAAP rate ever at $145 million we are continuing to see -- it's almost like some of these customers who are often on calendar fiscal years, just like Digital Realty, wrapped up one budget cycle and got a budget refresh and came back in 2024 with the incremental appetite for demand. These customers are seeking some of the same things. When we intersect with that demand is in our large-scale hyperscale campuses that are in our major markets and especially with larger capacity blocks that have contiguous capacity or the most sought after. And those rates continue to run in terms of what we've signed and where we put up quotes and I think we're very well positioned. If you look at our footprint, you can see a lot of it on development capacity life cycle, which is just a portion of what we activate in Northern Virginia right now, but some of the other major markets as well to capture a good -- more than our fair share of that demand. And lastly, I think there's a -- I think there's a broader acknowledgment whether it is hyperscale compute or AI workloads that these customers our time to market, many of them are trying to land precious GPUs that are just enormous business opportunities for these customers. And our rent even historically, but certainly today, plays a very small economic piece in that equation relative to their ability to launch their services and be first to market many times. Thanks, Irvin. We certainly have a really great opportunity to intersect with these large capacity block needs of our customers, be it for AI or hyperscale. It is, I would say, maybe potentially unparalleled in what we can offer in Northern Virginia today in terms of available capacity in a market that's shut down in terms of new power until 2026. But the list goes beyond that, whether it's Dallas, Santa Clara, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Seoul or parts of Japan, not to mention some of our joint ventures in Latin America and South Africa. We've taken our approach quite honestly where many of these capacity blocks for ourselves and many providers were at the early stages of development. They were at land, went pad-ready. Shelves are coming online and just the first suites were coming online. And throughout 2023, we took a more, call it, approach whereby we didn't go run after the first deal out of the gate for some of these customers because we knew we weren't losing a revenue opportunity because the capacity wasn't even being able to be moved into or at least commenced. And in hindsight, that's proven fortuitous because as the year has played out, and certainly as 2024 has gotten off out of those gates, we've continue to see what we're offering is becoming much more and more attractive to an even broader and diverse set of customers. So I don't think we'll be able to be late too long in 2024. We obviously now have some capacity blocks that are actually live and we can commence rent on. So we do have some urgency to get that going. But I think our patients and prudence here and approach allowed us to prove right. sometimes better to be lucky than smart. If I would have known Ashford would have run out of power years ago, I would have -- we wouldn't have sold all that capacity we had to release at the time. But this time, we -- the luck was our side. Thanks, David. So the -- I think you heard me loud and clear on where rates have come from and where they've gone and where they're likely to continue to move and some of these markets haven't even hit peak historical rates, if you look at the whole span of data center capacity. So I don't think we're at a rent bubble or near that necessarily and it's been on the back of real constraints and build costs that have inflated and issues. So they are -- I believe these rental moves are justified. I think you will continue to see the cash mark-to-markets flow through in our favor. We did call out in -- throughout last year and in the script for this quarter that we had some episodic short-term renewals inflated our cash mark-to-market, but we think being, call it, 4% to 6% in that category overall is pretty in our favor. And to your question on the bigger deals where you're going to have these potential roll-ups, yes, we do have subsections of our contracts that have clauses that are certainly in the favor of our customer. When the market was quite the opposite of what it was today and it was filling baking capacity, we certainly had to succumb to some of those clauses that our customers. But they all often are very narrowly defined in terms of fixed duration of renewal time period and other bells and whistles. And when a customer, which they often do wants to negotiate outside of that box that opens up the contract renegotiations. And we try to collaborate with our customers to come into a mutually agreeable outcome. So that's a long-winded way of saying, I don't think we'll be able to roll every one of those, call it, sub 100-plus megawatts directly up to the 140 or 150 or 160 or whatever we're going in the market. But I think we'll -- I do think there is going to be a positive mark-to-market in that category for some years to come. Matt, do you want to start us off on that one? Thanks, Frank. I want to have Colin tackle what we're seeing in the, I'll call it, enterprise sales cycle. Thanks, Matt. So multi fast, I'm going to hand to Matt to explain how the dividend call works in terms of taxable income and distribution and why the dividend is set where it is set. Because I think the topic of M&A, I mean, you could look at the linear press releases or just recent events we've done in just the last several months through resolving our relationship to Cyxtera to growing our platform in India with the addition of Reliance Jio. We also just had a big announcement with the leader in the GPU space recently to disposing of some noncore assets, JVs stabilized assets and adding strategically to our landholdings across key markets. So we've been incredibly active on pieces of that. I think the broader context of M&A, I think the most critical puzzle pieces have kind of been picked over. And most of our activity from here are really, call it, extending our strategic advantages and bolt-on in nature to what we have. I don't see any like key gems out there that would be really additive to our global platform at peak. Matt, why don't you hit on the dividend, Matt, if you want that. Thanks, Simon. So one of our top, top, top priorities is to continue to focus on delivering acceleration in that 0 to 1 megawatt interconnection cohort, enterprise connectivity in order to customers, the most granular and the largest volume of over 5,000 customers as well as our new logos. So by and large, the more quarters where that represents a larger and increasing piece of the mix and continues to accelerate like it has done recently, that is filling our existing baking capacity. It's wins at our highest rates, it's multi-market, multi-geo enterprise customers and is the place where we believe we can deliver the greatest value to our customers, most consistently and long-term and durable there will be episodic quarters where that will be a lower percentage. But that's likely enough because we've filtered our execution. That's likely because we also are supporting some of the largest hyperscalers around the world. We're bringing our capacity in over half of our 50-plus metropolitan areas, places where we can really add value to those customers where they've already landed their compute or AZs where they want to grow at our continuous capacity with operational excellence, where we have that long runway of growth that they can get from no one else. And those are we quarters where we saw larger lumpier deals, obviously, into those capacity blocks. So we think both of these are large addressable markets where we have a distinct value proposition and a competitive moat that we'll continue to focus on executing each and every day. Thanks, Erik. Let me just touch on this a little bit and then hand it to Chris to walk you through chapter and verse. I look at where our heritage is as a company, this AI opportunity is tremendously in our wheelhouse. We came with this from a hyperscale piece of the business and build the colo connectivity capabilities organically and inorganically. We are often taking larger halls that are at higher power densities and using our engineering prowess to work for enterprise customers and pushing their boundaries on power densities. I can tell you, AI workloads were at digital before I joined over nine years ago. We've done retrofits on existing deployments just to fit up for customers needing AI just this year. At the end of last year, I was to one of our Paris facilities. We're one of our partner customers have fitted out of liquid cooling for a multinational financial services company, live environments which meant that they had to get going on that years ago to be live at the end of last year. So this is right in our wheelhouse, and we've been winning in that category in the last year in the, call it, several hundred kilowatt domain to the 30-plus megawatt piece of this, and you've seen some testimonials on that. Chris, why don't you give a little bit of color as to some of the verticals we've been winning and where do you see this going as well? Sure, Matt. Why don't you take that? Thank you, Betsy. Digital Realty capped off a transformative 2023 with a strong fourth quarter that was highlighted by three key elements. First, we sourced over $12 billion of new capital and commitments from an array of hyperscale private capital partners, deleveraging our balance sheet and positioning the company for the future. Second, we posted another quarter of improving organic operating results with the best same-capital cash NOI growth in nearly a decade, and we are just on the cusp of the AI wave of demand. Third, we continue to grow our footprint and capacity around the world with record deliveries in 2023 to meet the accelerating needs of our growing customer base. These customers look to us to help enable their IT solutions, whether that is AI, cloud or even enterprises along their digital transformation journeys, our value proposition is resonating, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today with a special thank you to our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keeps the digital world turning.

[Operator Instructions] And we'll aim to conclude at the bottom of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our third quarter. First, our customer value proposition continues to resonate. Leasing was strong across both our primary product category with record overall bookings in the 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment, and an acceleration in our greater than megawatt segment. Second, we saw a further continuation of the improvements in our fundamental metrics. Strong demand and tight supply remains supportive of pricing, and this is evident in our results. Same capital cash NOI growth was the best in more than a decade at 9.4%, while cash releasing spreads eclipsed 7% in the quarter, which caused us to raise full year guidance for these metrics for the second consecutive quarter. Third, we continue to diversify and bolster our balance sheet with almost $4 billion of capital raised to date, including two hyperscale core joint ventures announced in July, and another almost $200 million of noncore sales, bringing total dispositions to $2.5 billion year-to-date. The capital that we've raised this year has enabled us to increase our liquidity and delever while expanding our investment in development that we expect to generate double-digit unlevered returns. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. The third quarter marks nine months since being appointed to my current role as CEO, and this marks the fourth official earnings call. While there has been about as much volatility in a single year as I can recall from my 20-plus-year career, it has been a privilege and an honor to have the opportunity to visit and work with and to watch my Digital Realty colleagues across the globe execute on behalf of our customers and stakeholders during these extraordinary times. At the outset of this year, I highlighted three key priorities for our company. While we've got two months left in the year, I am very excited about our progress to date and look forward to finishing strong. As you recall, our key strategic priorities are: first, to demonstrably strengthen our customer value proposition, which means that we are adding connectivity-rich solutions and scale capacity to drive our global meeting place strategy. We are executing this through the addition and launch of new on-ramps, the expansion of our colo capacity end markets and also by providing visibility into longer-term hyperscale capacity in our largest core markets. We are making strides and our customers are recognizing this by landing and expanding their IT infrastructure within our facilities. For example, over the past few months, we've added on ramps from a number of the largest cloud service providers, including AWS and Oracle. Our second priority is to integrate and innovate. For the first time, we created an Americas region and formally organized the company into three regions to improve overall management and accountability. In addition, we moved global operations under an experienced Digital Realty leader, bringing the standardization and consistency across our global platform. We also reorganized all things technology under our CTO organization. Consistent with our aim to bring innovation to our customers end market, in the third quarter, we announced the launch of our first Nvidia DGX H100-Ready data center in Osaka, Japan. We also rolled out our new high-density colo offering across 28 global metros to support high-performance compute infrastructure, addressing data and AI-related growth challenges. We are also partnering with other leaders around the world to enhance our open platform. In this vein, we recently added BT and Lumin to our Service Fabric platform, which connects our data centers globally extending the reach of our customers and partners. And we made some nice progress on the sustainability front in the quarter, which I'll circle back to in a moment. Finally, we set out to bolster and diversify our capital sources. And to date, we've reduced leverage by 0.8 turns of EBITDA from the 1Q peak and increased liquidity to $3-plus billion, including $1 billion of cash on hand. We executed on our funding plan that included the completion of two stabilized hyperscale JVs this quarter, tapping into some of the deepest pools of private capital, and we remain confident in our ability to add to this progress with development JVs in the near future. If we deliver on our key strategic priorities, we expect that this will translate into better long-term sustainable growth for our customers, team members and in turn, our shareholders. Digital Realty continues to make progress in the third quarter with further improvement in our operational results highlighted by 9-plus percent same capital cash NOI growth strong leasing results with record 0 to 1-megawatt signings, the highest greater than megawatt pricing since 2016, record leasing in APAC with broad strength in the Americas, and record interconnection revenue with the strongest growth since 2018. The momentum across the data center infrastructure landscape is strong. Demand for our data center capacity remains broad-based both geographically and by product, as reflected in our leasing results. New supply in our top markets remains constrained and is likely to remain so due to limited availability of power, growing supply chain challenges and tighter financial conditions. While the demand drivers we have enjoyed for the last several years, including cloud, digital transformation and hybrid IT remain largely intact, AI applications have added a meaningful new layer, which is just beginning to materialize in our leasing results this quarter, and we are ready for it. When Chris first started speaking publicly about AI and high-performance compute at our Investor Day in December 2017, we are already in the process of architecting and designing our facilities to support the evolving densities and our most innovative and leading-edge customers. While there are multiple high-density workloads running in our portfolio since at least that time, in the last quarter alone we were able to accommodate a handful of high-density compute deployments from one of our service provider customers in a 10-plus year old data center in one of our smallest markets. And we are currently supporting one of our customers' AI infrastructure deployments that will incorporate 32,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. This doesn't mean that Digital Realty will be chasing large AI deployments far and wide, as we will continue to assess the longer-term opportunity set of remotely located single-tenant non-differentiated data centers. But it does mean that there has been an increase in demand for our highly connected campuses in core markets. We're being thoughtful in how we approach these opportunities. As we consider leasing our capacity, I expect that we will seek to support our long-term engaged partners that have become embedded within our meeting place community that value our strategic locations and the connectivity across platform digital. At the same time, in certain markets, we will selectively support customers that have a differentiated product offering as we've always been at the forefront supporting leading technology companies as they push their infrastructure capabilities. Let's move to our third quarter results. This quarter continued to demonstrate the fundamental recovery that we've been highlighting throughout this year. Leasing activity was strong and broad-based across product types and reflected the pricing recovery we have seen throughout our portfolio. While we routinely lead with our headline leasing figures, it is important to point out the record posted in the 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection segment in the quarter, which increased by more than 9% sequentially and nearly 28% over the prior year period. Total new leasing during the quarter was $152 million with record 0-1 megawatt signings representing just over one-third of total signings. Greater than a megawatt science moved higher for the second consecutive quarter led by the Americas region, while our team also put up a record quarter in APAC. Pricing remains firm with notable highs achieved across the greater than one megawatt segment with strength in the 0-1 megawatt category. Growing recognition of our value proposition, including our comprehensive product offering, along with strong demand trends and reduced availability are supportive of pricing and are helping to drive better core growth and higher returns on investment. In the third quarter, we saw re-leasing spreads climbed to 7.4% on a cash basis contributing to the strongest same capital cash NOI growth in more than a decade. During the third quarter, churn remained low at 1.1% and we added 117 new customers extending our string of 100-plus new logos per quarter to 3.5 years. Another strong validation of the value that enterprise customers around the world recognize in platform digital. Our focus on deepening the value of our campus has resulted in enhanced cloud access for Digital Realty. Recently, 4 out of 5 top B2B cloud providers complete multisite on-ramp and edge expansions to serve data-intensive workloads on two continents via Platform Digital. In addition, AWS announced a direct connect location in Seoul, the first carrier-neutral facility in the market, while we announced the Oracle FastConnect availability in Madrid to their EU sovereign cloud. Other key wins during the quarter included a speech-to-text AI provider completed their second HD colo deployment in six months on Platform Digital, multiple new logos in the health care vertical in the quarter, two Global 2000 health care companies deployed on Platform Digital, one supportive data-intensive AI workloads and the other implementing a 2-site data compliance solution. An international Tier 1 telco added a multi-metro expansion across two continents of Platform Digital to support their retail enterprise customers. A Global 2000 Bank is implementing multi-site, multi-region network hub deployments now totaling 15 metros and a Global 2000 insurance company is expanding a distributed data hub on Platform Digital to support M&A data compliance. Moving over to our largest market, Northern Virginia. More than a year since we learned the power constraints in this market, we have continued to work constructively with the power providers to confirm the commitments that we made to our customers and to provide growth capacity for our customers through new development and select churn opportunities. As discussed on our last earnings call, we identified almost 100 megawatts of development capacity in Loudoun County that we expect to be able to bring to market prior to 2026. This includes 56 megawatts of available capacity underway within the current development pipeline and the potential to move forward on another 40 megawatts. In addition to this Ashburn-focused capacity, we continue to advance the ball on our 192-megawatt development in site in Manassas, and we are now officially underway and will soon be patent ready to support construction of the first of two buildings on the site in early 2024. We are very excited to be able to offer this availability to our customers. Moving on to our investment activity. Digital Realty investment team has already had an extraordinarily productive year, including the $2.3 billion of JVs and noncore asset sales completed in the third quarter. Within the noncore bucket, we sold two facilities during the quarter, including one in the U.K. and the other in Chantilly, Virginia, totaling almost $200 million, including the $150 million noncore disposition in Texas that we completed last quarter, we're tracking well towards our $500 million target for the noncore asset sales in 2023. We closed two separate stabilized hyperscale joint ventures in July with the contribution of two assets in Chicago and three in Northern Virginia, raising $2.1 billion of proceeds. We've also made substantial progress on the third bucket of our funding plan, the development joint ventures, and we expect to have more to say about this in the fourth quarter. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the third quarter. We've continued to make progress on our water conservation initiatives, including a water saving initiative for cooling towers and our SIN10 facility in Singapore. The project won the inaugural Green Innovations, Water Solutions Award at the Singapore Environment Council's Environmental Achievement Awards. The project is expected to save over 1.2 million liters of water each month and improved water usage efficiency by 15%. The solution has now been evaluated for wider rollout across our portfolio. In the third quarter, we also announced that we are ranked in the top 10 on a U.S. EPA's National Top 100 list of the large green power users from the Green Power partnership. The company also ranked seventh on the EPA's list across technology and telecommunication providers. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.\nMatthew Mercier: Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our third quarter results. We signed a total of $152 million of new leases in the third quarter with broad-based strength across each of our two primary product groups and geographic strength in the Americas and APAC. We leased a record $54 million in the 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection category, accounting for 35% of total bookings. This product segment remains a consistent and steady source of growth as we continue to execute on our global meeting place strategy. Interconnection bookings were strong once again at over $12 million as we added another 2,000 cross connects in the quarter, finishing with 218,000 total cross-connects, greater than a megawatt bookings totaled $97 million in the quarter with outsized contributions from Portland and Hong Kong. This was our highest greater than a megawatt signings quarter since we discussed sharpening the lens with regard to capital allocation decisions one year ago. Our greater focus and increased threshold have resulted in higher average returns in the greater than a megawatt category as implied by the growing expected stabilized returns in the Americas that we present on the development life cycle schedule in our supplemental. Pricing continues to improve across most markets globally with outsized pricing power experienced within the greater than the megawatt segment, which saw pricing on signed leases at the highest level since the first half of 2016. Turning to our backlog slide. The current backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases increased to a new record of $482 million at quarter end. As commencements of $110 million were more than offset by elevated new leasing volume in the quarter. We expect nearly 15% of the backlog to commence in the fourth quarter with a little over 50% commencing throughout 2024. The lag between signings and commencements in the quarter ticked up to 12 months, driven by new development and build-outs to support larger scale leases. During the third quarter, we signed $156 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 7.4% on a cash basis, the strongest re-leasing spreads achieved since 2015. While renewal pricing was strong across product segments and across our three regions, the overall result was upwardly skewed by a single transaction within our other category. Excluding this outlier, renewal, releasing spreads in the quarter would have been up 4.5% on a cash basis and 6.4% on a GAAP basis. We feel that this is a more representative picture of the renewal spreads that we are seeing throughout the portfolio, which is consistent with the broad-based improvement we've seen throughout this year. With renewal rates trending higher over the first 9 months of the year, we are raising our full year guidance for renewal spreads to reflect the success year-to-date and today's improved fundamental environment. Renewal spreads in the 0-1 megawatt category continued their steady climb with 4.4% growth on a cash basis in the third quarter on $125 million of volume. Greater than a megawatt renewals continued to post strong results, with cash renewals higher by 5.6%, albeit on lighter volume of $19 million in the third quarter. In terms of earnings growth, we reported third quarter core FFO of $1.62 per share, broadly consistent with consensus expectations, but down $0.06 per share versus the second quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of the asset sales and the equity raised in the quarter and the redeployment of capital into accelerated and increased development. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was $1.60 per share relative to the $1.67 we reported in the third quarter of 2022. Total revenue was up 18% year-over-year and 3% sequentially despite the impact of the more than $2 billion of asset sales completed early in the quarter as the benefits of improved pricing are starting to take hold. Importantly, year-over-year revenue growth also continues to be impacted by the significant volatility in utility costs and reimbursements, particularly in Europe. Most of these energy costs are directly passed through to customers. Excluding the impact of utility and other reimbursements, total revenue was up 13% year-over-year. Interconnection revenue of $107 million marked another quarterly record and was 12% higher than the year ago period. Excluding Teraco, interconnection revenue was up 11% year-over-year, the highest interconnection growth since 2018 and reflects the ongoing organic strength in our core footprint. Quarter-over-quarter interconnection revenue was up almost 3% and as 2,000 new cross connects were added, increasing the total global installed base to 218,000. Moving over to the expense side, utilities were seasonally high given the warmer summer months and off an already elevated 2023 base. Rental property operating expenses remained essentially flat for the second consecutive quarter, partly reflecting the benefit of the removal of expenses related to the dispositions and joint ventures. However, on the noncontrollable expense front, property taxes spiked higher quarter-over-quarter to $72 million, driven by an elevated reassessment on some of our properties in Chicago. While these expenses will be largely passed on to our underlying customers, it will also be disputed over the coming years. Net of this movement, adjusted EBITDA increased 10% year-over-year. One nonrecurring item worth noting in the quarter was the $113 million noncash impairment charge related to the lower value of our holdings in digital core REIT stock. The Singapore REIT IPO-ed in December 2021 at $0.88 per share, but was valued at $0.53 per share at the end of September, driving the noncash adjustment in our carrying value of the investment. Improvement in our stabilized same capital operating performance continued in the third quarter, with year-over-year cash NOI up a strong 9.4% but moderating by 1.5% sequentially due to the expected increase in utility bleed during the seasonally warmer months. Even on a constant currency basis, year-over-year cash NOI growth was strong at 6.6%. These results demonstrate the strongest period of organic growth in our same capital pool since 2014, and extends the turning fundamentals that we have been highlighting throughout this year. Turning to the balance sheet. We meaningfully strengthened our balance sheet during the third quarter, driven by the success that we've had on our funding plan. This progress continues today, and as a result, we have raised our full year capital raising target for the second consecutive quarter. In the third quarter, we generated over $2.6 billion proceeds from JV closings, noncore asset sales and settlement of the equity forward. Roughly $1 billion was redeployed into our development program and a little over $500 million was used to repay higher cost USD borrowings on our credit facility. The remaining amount was kept in cash, earning interest at a rate in excess of the remaining borrowings under our credit facility. As a result, at quarter end, we had over $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet and our leverage fell to 6.3x net debt to EBITDA, down from 6.8x at the end of the second quarter and we are now within spitting distance of our near 6x leverage goal that we set out to achieve by year-end. Since the end of the quarter, we paid off CHF 100 million notes that matured in October and are confident in our ability to execute on additional asset sales and development joint ventures that are left in our upwardly revised funding plan. Moving to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is over 4.5 years, and our weighted average interest rate is 2.9%. Approximately 84% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 86% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have less than $1 billion of debt maturing in 2024 and beyond that our maturities remain well laddered through 2032. Lastly, let's turn to our guidance. We are tightening our core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2023 by $0.03 at the high and low ends to a new range of $6.58 to $6.62 per share, maintaining the midpoint of $6.60 per share. We are also tightening the range for full year adjusted EBITDA, affirming our full year guidance midpoint of $2.7 billion. Our full year revenue guidance range is being adjusted down by about 1% at the midpoint to a new range of $5.475 billion to $5.525 billion to reflect the impact of lower pass-through oriented tenant utility reimbursements given the moderation in electricity pricing in EMEA. Importantly, you'll recall that last quarter's core FFO per share guidance reflected a $0.05 to $0.07 per share impact from a bankrupt customer, including $0.02 that was realized in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we received all of the rent due from this customer across our portfolio, but we did incur a $0.01 write-off related to unpaid utility expenses and we expect that we could see up to another $0.02 of dilution related to this customer in the fourth quarter. In addition, we could see up to $0.01 of drag related to the carryforward of increased Chicago property tax assessment and $0.01 of drag related to the acceleration and increase of development spend as we capitalize on the opportunities we are seeing in front of us. With the continued improvement in our fundamentals during the quarter, we are also updating the organic operating metrics supporting our full year guidance, including cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads of over 5%, up from 4%. Same capital cash NOI growth of 6% to 7%, representing a 200 basis points increase versus prior guidance and a reduction in year-end portfolio occupancy to between 83% and 84%, reflecting the delayed timing of the sale of a vacant nondata center asset in our portfolio. Given the successful leasing executed in the third quarter and the increased level of demand embedded within our pipeline, we are increasing our full year development spend guidance to $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion for 2023, representing the $400 million increase at the midpoint. Similarly, reflecting the continued execution on our funding plan to date, we have also updated our guidance for dispositions and JV capital to $2.7 million to $3.2 billion, representing a $350 million increase at the midpoint, which is in line with the increase in our expected development spend for this year. While development has been an important driver of our growth for the last decade, in the short term, we are experiencing the headwinds from the sharp regime change in interest rates. This year, we've sold assets at 6 caps, and new borrowings on our liner at similar levels, whereas GAAP requires us to capitalize interest at our weighted average borrowing cost of less than 3%. In other words, increasing our development spend today, to capitalize on the growing opportunities we are seeing is dilutive to near-term earnings. These projects underway are completed at incrementally higher yields and the relatively low rate of capitalized interest burns off, we expect development completions will become increasingly accretive to core FFO per share. The good news is that fundamentals are helping to mitigate a portion of this dilution. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, please begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Atkin: Thanks. So I was interested in the development JVs that you alluded to. It sounds like there's something relatively imminent or maybe a couple of transactions. Can you point to the leverage reduction benefit that we should expect? And then related to that, give us a sense of the tailwinds and the headwinds that might affect core FFO per share for next year? Thank you.\nAndrew Power: Thanks Jon. Why don't you let Greg touch on his activity, it's been the tip of the spear on our development JVs, which unfortunately, we couldn't time not just one but two announcements like last quarter, but we haven't been idle and they're making some great progress. But Greg, why don't you give us a color?\nGregory Wright: Yes. Thanks, Jon. Look, I think as Andy mentioned, look, last quarter, which we already announced, we were - we had our two stabilized joint ventures with TPG in Northern Virginia and obviously, GI and Chicago, which generated about $2.2 billion of proceeds. And we -- what we found in that process was demand was very robust to invest in data center assets in the private market, and the same holds true. We're continuing to see even more demand for stabilized assets. And I would go as far as to say it's even greater investor demand, when you look at the development potential development JVs. All I can tell you is we're working hard, and we hope we have something here in relatively short order to report. But right now, no more guidance than that. Other than that, demand remains strong, and we remain encouraged.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I want to follow-up a little bit on the second part of Jonathan's question, which was thinking about 2024. When we began 2023, we were looking at same-store cash NOI growth in the mid-3s and now it's pushing towards 7%. We're talking about a decade level improvements in interconnection and sub-megawatt leasing and greater than one megawatt leasing. Andy, you frequently talked over the year about how re-leasing and greater than one megawatt, you couldn't confidently say would be greater than zero and here we are. And then we've lapped the first year of the Teraco acquisition, which was supposed to be dilutive in year one, neutral in year two, accretive in year three. So outside of some accounting issues, it kind of feels like all the needles are pointing up into 2024. And before I get too excited, tell me where I'm wrong?\nAndrew Power: Thanks, David. We appreciate the kudos there. Before I hand off to Matt to give you a 2024 guidance on this call, which I can tell you we weren't prepared for. I'll just chime in with just some color. So you're right, with the - the trend has been our friend on multiple fronts. And I think we tried to signal this at the outset of the year, and we were a bit of a show-me story, but we saw our value proposition resonating. We saw the pricing environment firming and continue that momentum, whether it's asking rates, ROIs on our development pipeline at cash mark-to-market in both product sets, and I would say that environment is continuing. But before Matt take the air out of the balloon with no early guidance, I mean there are obviously headwinds that Matt can talk to that we're still working through. But Matt, why don't you give some of your thoughts?\nMatthew Mercier: Yes, sure. Thanks, David. I mean I think we - and we kind of talked about this a little bit towards the end of my prepared remarks, but I think, as we've been - one, we've been pretty clear about a desire to deleverage, which we've made substantial progress on. We started the year close to $7 billion, we're at $6.3 billion. We're making progress on that like, I stated at the start of the year. And we're doing that through level of capital recycling asset sales that are going to have an impact not only on this year, but we'll have some follow-through into next year. And we're doing it at a time also where we're looking to take advantage of what we see is a great opportunity in the market, where supply-demand fundamentals are about as strong as they've been. And we see opportunities to deploy capital, but that capital is coming at a higher cost today than it was. And therefore, it's dilutive near term, until that capacity comes online. And we think it's the prudent thing to do, but that's part of the dynamic that we're dealing with.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Elias of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMichael Elias: Right. Thanks for taking my questions. First, could you help us think about the sources of funding? And really what I mean by that is you raised equity at $97 a share, but you didn't raise equity when your stock was at $130. Presumably, the cost of that equity would have been lower than selling assets at, call it, a 9% cap rate. Just wondering how you're thinking about the use of equity as you march towards that, call it, 5.5 times leverage target next year? And then I have a follow-up? Thank you.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Michael. So Jordan's got us playing by new rules to make sure everyone get at least one question on the call. So, we've got one question, but we'll try to get you on the next round for your follow-up. I think our actions are speaking louder than our words hopefully here, whereby we had tremendous success in the first half of the year or dribbling into the month of July on both non-core dispose followed by major hyperscale stabilized assets. And the fact that we haven't moved forward with any additional equity issuance of common stock, I think this speaks to our conviction on the next leg of private capital raisings with the development joint venture or joint ventures being the next leg of the stool. So - and I think those are things that will - are strategic and different for our company in relative to prior experience. Where we're going to share the non-cash flow period of these projects that are large, massive capital-intensive and long-term projects and allow some of these great fundamentals we've seen flow through to the bottom line. That doesn't mean we're 100% averse to ever issuing equity at the right time in the right quorum at the right price. But I think we believe we've got some incremental milestones or wins to put on the board here that are in the not-so-distant future, before we be ready. And this is on the back of tremendous progress. We've taken the balance sheet down, what 0.8 turns of EBITDA, literally in two quarters worth of reporting. So - and so I'm pleased with the progress, and I would say that we have more good news to come. Before - one last thing. I want to hand over to Greg because you made a comment on the non-core dispos, just - I think that we should clarify what that really means to us.\nGregory Wright: Yes. Thanks, Andy. Hi Michael, Look, I don't think it's right to say a 9% - you're selling an asset at a 9% cap rate versus what your implied multiple is on your company. In our minds, from a capital allocation perspective, those are two very different things. One is the assets we sold, they're noncore assets, right? One's in Watford, ones in Chantilly. Anyhow what does that mean to us? I mean these are non-campus assets with limited connectivity, right? And when you look at Chantilly, Wilson Nova, it's neither of the major markets of Loudon and Manassas, right? And so when you look at these assets, they're older, they're stand-alone assets. Now this is a very, very small portion of our business. But we call these assets out. So I don't think we can sit here and assess a cap rate on one or two non-core assets versus selling equity in the business. These are assets that are not part of our core business going forward and non-strategic to us, that's a very different analysis. So, I would just caution folks to say, Hey, here's a couple of assets that were non-core that were signed as a nine, therefore, that's not the right cost of capital play or the right capital allocation, because I think it is.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Guarino of Green Street. Please go ahead.\nDavid Guarino: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. On Page 9 of your presentation you put out today, it feels like those new leasing bars, they just keep reaching to the sky. You think there's a sustainable pace of activity for Digital Realty and maybe even broadly, is it a sustainable pace for the industry as a whole? Or is there a risk maybe that the dirty word digestion phase starts to come back into our vocabulary again?\nAndrew Power: Hi, thanks, David. So I mean, what's great about this quarter is not just the size of that bar, but just what really went into it. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we usually call it historically led off with the top line number, but I think it was even more important to start with a tremendous foundation. Less than a megawatt interconnection signing it was a granular of quantity of customers, broad-based across the regions, including interconnection was at a record. It was up dramatically, not just year-over-year, close to 28%, but 9% quarter-over-quarter and that is that flywheel success that we've been investing in and starting to see more and more harvesting the fruits of our labor. On the bigger portion of that, it was not one single deal, is our largest deal not even a third of the total signings. It was broad-based across the geos as well. And these are playing to a continuation of demand trends that have been here for a little while, but certainly not exhausted. When you look at the pace of how fast the cloud is growing, digital transformation, hybrid IT. You look at our new logo contribution largely enterprise base 117 from around the globe and artificial intelligence, which is something we've had a hand in supporting for many years in high-performance compute power densities. That is just starting to blossom in our numbers. And I think that is just an incremental tailwind of demand where it doesn't feel like the digestion period is anywhere near coming to the amount of capacity demands we're seeing for the industry overall.\nOperator: The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Great. Thanks for the questions. So I wanted to touch on kind of your outlook for renewal spreads, which have been pretty strong the last couple of quarters. So, if I look at your expiration schedule, it looks like your in-place rents really start to look even more attractive the further out you look. So maybe you can talk about kind of the near-term outlook. Is it going to be a little more subdued as you work through some of these higher in-place rents? And then maybe are there any of your larger footprint contracts that have any contractual terms that may limit your ability to push rents as high as you would like? Thank you.\nMatthew Mercier: Sure. Thanks. So I think, first off, I think as a note, we feel pretty confident about the pricing environment right now and - that I think we demonstrated that with the continued increase in releasing spreads that we put into our guidance, where we said greater than 5%. And we've had - we called out some items this year that have been, we'll call it, slight outliers, but we'll - we still see a strong pricing environment that were. And we expect that to continue into the fourth quarter where, we expect positive renewal spreads across all of our product types. I think going into next year, again, not giving guidance, what I would say is come back to the environment that we're in. I mean, there's nothing that suggests that pricing won't continue to be robust and strong across all of our major markets, where things might be different. Again, that you were alluding to is the basis against which those strong pricings are compared against. We are not seeing the same, I still expect that we'll have positive renewal spreads next year, but we'll be able to provide more granularity in terms of the level that, that is once we give guidance next quarter.\nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you. So when you guys are having conversations with a customer that's primarily looking at an AI deal when you win an AI deal, what is it that they're coming to you for versus maybe some of the less expensive campuses kind of the middle of nowhere that we've heard about and that sort of thing. So how are you winning in AI? And what is it they're looking to get from digital versus some of your peers or some of the private players?\nAndrew Power: Hi, thanks Frank. I'm going to toss just a column in a second. But I just - there's many shapes and forms of AI, and I reiterate, this is still early innings of what's going to be a vast build-out of required infrastructure. So our intersection of supporting AI is called in the single megawatt or two for enterprise adjacent to the existing workloads expansion into multiple - many, many megawatts of contiguous capacity and everything in between. And we're in a world right now where it's about large language model training, obviously, the inference - the dawn of inference and the implications will hopefully point to incremental location latency-sensitive needs. The private consumption of AI or the public consumption - consumer consumption as well outweighing the enterprise, that's going to change. So I think this is - this demand case, I think, is going to grow and change and it feels like come in our favor. But Colin, why don't you speak to some of your experience front line with the customers?\nColin McLean: Sure. Thanks, Andy. Frank. I appreciate the question. I would just amplify what Andy is saying is the demand principles are not monolithic. I mean you're talking about a wide gamut of requirements across the customer platform, which really plays well to our broad-based portfolio. So I think we do as good a job as any to support broad-based requirements and Catechist's capacity. But also having mixed dynamic requirements in terms of densities. And so what we try to do is to map that right customer to right market to right workload. And again, across 300-plus data centers, I think we can serve that pretty well. We also feel pretty strongly that core market orientation, i.e., proximity to eyeballs and GDP is still going to remain a core requirement for much of this AI workload. So, we feel like that maps really well to our course of assets across the globe.\nOperator: The next question comes from Irvin Liu of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nIrvin Liu: Hi. Thank you for the question. So Greg mentioned the strength in demand for both stabilized and development JVs, but in light of a more volatile rate environment, especially in recent weeks, have you sensed any meaningful shifts in the appetite for JVs when you're discussing with potential partners?\nJordan Sadler: Greg, has your phone been ringing any louder?\nGregory Wright: I mean no. Look, it's a good question, but the answer is no. Remember, when investors are out there making investments in different sectors, right? Everything is on a relative basis. And I think when investors look at data centers today, and they look at the quality of the facility, the quality of the customer base, the term of the lease, the strong organic growth in the business today. It's the best place for them to invest. In fact, I would argue that over time, you're going to continue to see data centers becoming more mainstream investing rather than a niche play investing when you look at the level of demand out there, whether it's through pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds and the like. So no, I mean, it's also an interesting as there's pockets of capital that are driven - we'll do this unlevered. So they're willing to be patient and wait for leverage and wait for rates to come back down. And I think that also, to your point, Ivan, and I think that's what I mentioned earlier, there's even an outsized demand on the development side. I think the fact that we're in a higher rate environment is driving more demand, if you will, towards development. So - but no, we have not. In fact, I would go the other way. I would say that we've seen an acceleration in the demand for development JVs.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. When you take the demand that you're seeing, the backlog and the target for the development joint ventures, can you give us a bit of a preview on the range of development capital that digital will place on balance sheet in 2024?\nAndrew Power: Thanks Michael. So I mean - this isn't new news. And I think I framed this at some of the investor meetings we've had through the fall or even on back to NAREIT. Listen, we are a large - the largest global player in the space here and we are taking a strategic change to how we're funding the business was one of my three top priorities. And what we're not going to do is tie ourselves to a partner for all time and reduce our flexibility. But we're going to be looking at targeted large-scale projects. These are projects that are supporting will support customers, we believe in their growth campuses multiple megawatts. So not non-core at all like things that we would invest 100% if we weren't looking to change our funding strategy to drive more bottom line growth. And I think you can think the concentration of those type of projects to-date are mostly in North America and Europe. Given our business is already in a shared in a venture in Latin America and was a little bit smaller in APAC. And I think it's going to be very targeted trying to find the right capital source that is like-minded in terms of their vision for the asset class and looking for a partner that wants to really invest alongside we think is the best-in-class in this industry.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt Niknam: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just one on cash flow. So the accounts receivable looks like it increased another $167 million sequentially, and it's been a drag of over $400 million year-to-date. Just wondering if there's any color you can share on what's driving this? And then maybe how to think about the prospects for any sort of reversal in upcoming quarters? Thanks.\nMatthew Mercier: Yes. Thanks, Matt. This is Matt as well. So yes, we've had what - I think the important points that I'd call out here are two things. One, the majority of the increase that we've seen over the last couple of quarters in our accounts receivable has been tied to actually VAT receivables as a result of the increased construction that we've had, particularly over internationally in EMEA. When you look at our trade payables, which are really only actually roughly half or a little over half of that balance, we have increased trade payables over the period, but it's also been fairly much in line with our increase in revenue as well. And we've actually been able to bring down our amount of trade payables in the last couple of quarters as well. But again, it doesn't appear that way when the total receivables balance has increased. But again, I think the two sailing points are only - roughly only half of our - that balance is tied to what I call trade receivables, which are actual rent and other billings that are sent to customers. A good chunk is related to VAT receivables tied to our construction, which has been the part that's been growing more substantially, which also has, a liability offset as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ari Klein of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAri Klein: Thanks. Maybe following up on the JV question. Fundamentals are really strong. It feels like you believe there's a lot of runway there. Obviously, there are funding considerations. But have you rethought perhaps pursuing a JV versus going at it on your own and essentially keeping the upside to yourself?\nAndrew Power: Hi, thanks Ari. So I don't - I think consistent with what I just shared reiterated on this call, we believe that this opportunity when it comes to our space, digital transformation, cloud computing, hybrid IT and now the advent of artificial intelligence really coming to fruition is so large, long-term, capital-intensive that really tapping into both private and public capital in different measures is the right way to maximize value for our shareholders. And we are certainly experiencing an inflection in our operating fundamentals that has built upon good results throughout the year. We've been doing a tremendous amount of deleveraging this year. We'll be, call it, rounding third base on the deleveraging next year, getting back to the targets Matt's laid out. And we also have headwinds when it comes to, call it, some - a modest amount of debt coming due in terms of refinancing. But we view that the development joint venture remains to be the right move to drive more to the bottom line. And again, as I said in a question or two ago, we are not tying ourselves to this strategy and partner for all time, right? This has allowed us to accelerate those earnings and then have be able to throttle the levers here as to how much we share in terms of development joint ventures with partners down the road.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks a lot. Good evening. If I could just check in on the development CapEx point. Again, you raised the guidance $400 million at the midpoint for this year. We've obviously just got a couple of months left here. Could you just go through a little bit what we're seeing that increase being spent on? Is that higher cost per megawatt coming through on some of your existing projects you're pulling stuff forward from - next year, what else might be contributing to the increase? Thanks.\nAndrew Power: It's not budget overruns or anything like that, it is called conviction in the demand landscape. And I mean we can - Matt can run through it. But I think the biggest piece is Northern Virginia, which goes back to our success in freeing up, call it, 100-plus megawatts in the Loudoun County pinch point and now activating that. But Matt, anything else I'm missing there?\nMatthew Mercier: No. I think, Andy, you hit it. I mean the majority of our development pipeline increased the call roughly 60 megawatts. We had 100 megawatts of new starts vast majority of that was in North America and in Northern Virginia specifically. If you look at our supplemental quarter-over-quarter, our cost per megawatt, I think broadly globally has been roughly flat. So it's just a view of new development starts looking to get those completed as quickly as possible. So, if we can deliver on time for our customers and take advantage of the market that we're in.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nNick Del Deo: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Andy, you've talked about being more disciplined about returns and the sort of deals you accept. Do you feel like you're successfully winning your targeted share of higher value or more strategic deals at your desired returns for each product? And kind of along those lines, do you feel like customers' perceptions of what you have to offer and where you add value is consistent with how you're trying to reposition the company's assets?\nAndrew Power: Hi. Thanks, Nick. So, I could tell you just yesterday, my team and I were on a called recurring check in with one of our top cloud customers. And that dialogue was multifaceted. It was obviously concentrated on how we can support their growth in their availability zones, how we can commence faster. There's operational elements, it ranges across all the theaters and it also had how we can drive greater consumption to their cloud. And their services from our 5,000 existing customers from the 100 plus we added this quarter and the next quarter, how we're integrating them onto our service fabric natively. And so, I think we are - and I think you're seeing those results paying dividends in that customer appreciation. And you're seeing that in the litany of, call it, magnetic destinations, be it the on-ramps we announced around the world as well as the pickup in the demand that we characterize as less than megawatt interconnection accelerating. So, I do see a connection there. I think we've delivered a tremendous amount of value to our customers, improving their top line and their bottom lines in a safe, secure fashion. And when obviously, I think some of your question was dovetailed also to some of the larger customers, I think that we're just being transparent and honest with these customers that we're really trying to build a durable business to stand the test of time. And that doesn't mean we try to win 100% of a hyperscales market share, but if we're in 50 metropolitan areas, there's probably 25 or 30 where we have something that they really need, and we can really help them like no other. And that's through our supply chain, our large campuses that future-proof their growth, operational excellence and other value adds and just being a one-stop shop for all their needs. So, I think that's a long, long-winded answer to yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nErik Rasmussen: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Just getting back to the development JV. This is obviously the missing piece in the capital recycling efforts. But - and I saw that you raised the disposition guidance for the year. Is $750 still a good range for this? And I guess, from your commentary, it seems like there's more than one deal that this can represent?\nGregory Wright: Hi Eric, this is Greg. The answer is yes, $750 is still a good deal. And yes, we are working on more than one.\nOperator: The next question is a follow-up from Michael Elias of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMichael Elias: Great. So I wanted to ask about the unlevered return environment, particularly for hyperscale. I think earlier in the call, you mentioned something to the effect of double-digit unlevered yields. When you're thinking about doing some of these larger footprint deals with your top customers, just curious where you're seeing those deals clear? And as part of that, where do you think that this could evolve to over, call it, the next year? Thanks.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Michael. So I think, I'd point you to our development schedule, which has now been in the double-digits category across the board for the whole portfolio, including an increase in, call it, 65 megawatts quarter-over-quarter. North America, where, I would say, is the current home to the largest deals is in double-digit by itself and has moved up dramatically. I don't - when we look at the risk award, there's obviously episodic scenarios where returns for big deals with hyperscalers couldn't go higher. But I think that the - once you kind of ascend into the double-digits, given the current state of, call it, cost of capital in general, I think you're in the proverbial end zone in terms of creating value on many ways. So I wouldn't bank on incremental stair stiffs of shifts beyond that. But I think, we're in a time in the world where the demand remains robust and diverse, outpacing supply. That dynamic does not feel to be abating. And I think we've got a great hand to support tremendous customers' growth around the globe and create a lot of value for a lot of stakeholders.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power, for his closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Power: Thank you, Andrea. Digital Realty had a strong third quarter. Our results demonstrate that our value proposition is resonating with our customers. We posted another quarter of strengthening organic operating results with record 0-1 megawatt bookings, strong re-leasing spreads and our best same-capital cash and ROI growth in over a decade. During the first nine months of the year, we've raised over $3.5 billion of new capital, enabling us to meaningfully delever while reinvesting to support our customers' growing needs, and we are not done yet. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and express my personal gratitude to our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty to keep the digital world spinning. We look forward to updating you on our progress and meeting with many of you at NAREIT in L.A. in a few weeks. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matthew Mercier",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our third quarter results. We signed a total of $152 million of new leases in the third quarter with broad-based strength across each of our two primary product groups and geographic strength in the Americas and APAC. We leased a record $54 million in the 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection category, accounting for 35% of total bookings. This product segment remains a consistent and steady source of growth as we continue to execute on our global meeting place strategy. Interconnection bookings were strong once again at over $12 million as we added another 2,000 cross connects in the quarter, finishing with 218,000 total cross-connects, greater than a megawatt bookings totaled $97 million in the quarter with outsized contributions from Portland and Hong Kong. This was our highest greater than a megawatt signings quarter since we discussed sharpening the lens with regard to capital allocation decisions one year ago. Our greater focus and increased threshold have resulted in higher average returns in the greater than a megawatt category as implied by the growing expected stabilized returns in the Americas that we present on the development life cycle schedule in our supplemental. Pricing continues to improve across most markets globally with outsized pricing power experienced within the greater than the megawatt segment, which saw pricing on signed leases at the highest level since the first half of 2016. Turning to our backlog slide. The current backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases increased to a new record of $482 million at quarter end. As commencements of $110 million were more than offset by elevated new leasing volume in the quarter. We expect nearly 15% of the backlog to commence in the fourth quarter with a little over 50% commencing throughout 2024. The lag between signings and commencements in the quarter ticked up to 12 months, driven by new development and build-outs to support larger scale leases. During the third quarter, we signed $156 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 7.4% on a cash basis, the strongest re-leasing spreads achieved since 2015. While renewal pricing was strong across product segments and across our three regions, the overall result was upwardly skewed by a single transaction within our other category. Excluding this outlier, renewal, releasing spreads in the quarter would have been up 4.5% on a cash basis and 6.4% on a GAAP basis. We feel that this is a more representative picture of the renewal spreads that we are seeing throughout the portfolio, which is consistent with the broad-based improvement we've seen throughout this year. With renewal rates trending higher over the first 9 months of the year, we are raising our full year guidance for renewal spreads to reflect the success year-to-date and today's improved fundamental environment. Renewal spreads in the 0-1 megawatt category continued their steady climb with 4.4% growth on a cash basis in the third quarter on $125 million of volume. Greater than a megawatt renewals continued to post strong results, with cash renewals higher by 5.6%, albeit on lighter volume of $19 million in the third quarter. In terms of earnings growth, we reported third quarter core FFO of $1.62 per share, broadly consistent with consensus expectations, but down $0.06 per share versus the second quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of the asset sales and the equity raised in the quarter and the redeployment of capital into accelerated and increased development. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was $1.60 per share relative to the $1.67 we reported in the third quarter of 2022. Total revenue was up 18% year-over-year and 3% sequentially despite the impact of the more than $2 billion of asset sales completed early in the quarter as the benefits of improved pricing are starting to take hold. Importantly, year-over-year revenue growth also continues to be impacted by the significant volatility in utility costs and reimbursements, particularly in Europe. Most of these energy costs are directly passed through to customers. Excluding the impact of utility and other reimbursements, total revenue was up 13% year-over-year. Interconnection revenue of $107 million marked another quarterly record and was 12% higher than the year ago period. Excluding Teraco, interconnection revenue was up 11% year-over-year, the highest interconnection growth since 2018 and reflects the ongoing organic strength in our core footprint. Quarter-over-quarter interconnection revenue was up almost 3% and as 2,000 new cross connects were added, increasing the total global installed base to 218,000. Moving over to the expense side, utilities were seasonally high given the warmer summer months and off an already elevated 2023 base. Rental property operating expenses remained essentially flat for the second consecutive quarter, partly reflecting the benefit of the removal of expenses related to the dispositions and joint ventures. However, on the noncontrollable expense front, property taxes spiked higher quarter-over-quarter to $72 million, driven by an elevated reassessment on some of our properties in Chicago. While these expenses will be largely passed on to our underlying customers, it will also be disputed over the coming years. Net of this movement, adjusted EBITDA increased 10% year-over-year. One nonrecurring item worth noting in the quarter was the $113 million noncash impairment charge related to the lower value of our holdings in digital core REIT stock. The Singapore REIT IPO-ed in December 2021 at $0.88 per share, but was valued at $0.53 per share at the end of September, driving the noncash adjustment in our carrying value of the investment. Improvement in our stabilized same capital operating performance continued in the third quarter, with year-over-year cash NOI up a strong 9.4% but moderating by 1.5% sequentially due to the expected increase in utility bleed during the seasonally warmer months. Even on a constant currency basis, year-over-year cash NOI growth was strong at 6.6%. These results demonstrate the strongest period of organic growth in our same capital pool since 2014, and extends the turning fundamentals that we have been highlighting throughout this year. Turning to the balance sheet. We meaningfully strengthened our balance sheet during the third quarter, driven by the success that we've had on our funding plan. This progress continues today, and as a result, we have raised our full year capital raising target for the second consecutive quarter. In the third quarter, we generated over $2.6 billion proceeds from JV closings, noncore asset sales and settlement of the equity forward. Roughly $1 billion was redeployed into our development program and a little over $500 million was used to repay higher cost USD borrowings on our credit facility. The remaining amount was kept in cash, earning interest at a rate in excess of the remaining borrowings under our credit facility. As a result, at quarter end, we had over $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet and our leverage fell to 6.3x net debt to EBITDA, down from 6.8x at the end of the second quarter and we are now within spitting distance of our near 6x leverage goal that we set out to achieve by year-end. Since the end of the quarter, we paid off CHF 100 million notes that matured in October and are confident in our ability to execute on additional asset sales and development joint ventures that are left in our upwardly revised funding plan. Moving to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is over 4.5 years, and our weighted average interest rate is 2.9%. Approximately 84% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 86% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have less than $1 billion of debt maturing in 2024 and beyond that our maturities remain well laddered through 2032. Lastly, let's turn to our guidance. We are tightening our core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2023 by $0.03 at the high and low ends to a new range of $6.58 to $6.62 per share, maintaining the midpoint of $6.60 per share. We are also tightening the range for full year adjusted EBITDA, affirming our full year guidance midpoint of $2.7 billion. Our full year revenue guidance range is being adjusted down by about 1% at the midpoint to a new range of $5.475 billion to $5.525 billion to reflect the impact of lower pass-through oriented tenant utility reimbursements given the moderation in electricity pricing in EMEA. Importantly, you'll recall that last quarter's core FFO per share guidance reflected a $0.05 to $0.07 per share impact from a bankrupt customer, including $0.02 that was realized in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we received all of the rent due from this customer across our portfolio, but we did incur a $0.01 write-off related to unpaid utility expenses and we expect that we could see up to another $0.02 of dilution related to this customer in the fourth quarter. In addition, we could see up to $0.01 of drag related to the carryforward of increased Chicago property tax assessment and $0.01 of drag related to the acceleration and increase of development spend as we capitalize on the opportunities we are seeing in front of us. With the continued improvement in our fundamentals during the quarter, we are also updating the organic operating metrics supporting our full year guidance, including cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads of over 5%, up from 4%. Same capital cash NOI growth of 6% to 7%, representing a 200 basis points increase versus prior guidance and a reduction in year-end portfolio occupancy to between 83% and 84%, reflecting the delayed timing of the sale of a vacant nondata center asset in our portfolio. Given the successful leasing executed in the third quarter and the increased level of demand embedded within our pipeline, we are increasing our full year development spend guidance to $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion for 2023, representing the $400 million increase at the midpoint. Similarly, reflecting the continued execution on our funding plan to date, we have also updated our guidance for dispositions and JV capital to $2.7 million to $3.2 billion, representing a $350 million increase at the midpoint, which is in line with the increase in our expected development spend for this year. While development has been an important driver of our growth for the last decade, in the short term, we are experiencing the headwinds from the sharp regime change in interest rates. This year, we've sold assets at 6 caps, and new borrowings on our liner at similar levels, whereas GAAP requires us to capitalize interest at our weighted average borrowing cost of less than 3%. In other words, increasing our development spend today, to capitalize on the growing opportunities we are seeing is dilutive to near-term earnings. These projects underway are completed at incrementally higher yields and the relatively low rate of capitalized interest burns off, we expect development completions will become increasingly accretive to core FFO per share. The good news is that fundamentals are helping to mitigate a portion of this dilution. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, please begin the Q&A session. Yes, sure. Thanks, David. I mean I think we - and we kind of talked about this a little bit towards the end of my prepared remarks, but I think, as we've been - one, we've been pretty clear about a desire to deleverage, which we've made substantial progress on. We started the year close to $7 billion, we're at $6.3 billion. We're making progress on that like, I stated at the start of the year. And we're doing that through level of capital recycling asset sales that are going to have an impact not only on this year, but we'll have some follow-through into next year. And we're doing it at a time also where we're looking to take advantage of what we see is a great opportunity in the market, where supply-demand fundamentals are about as strong as they've been. And we see opportunities to deploy capital, but that capital is coming at a higher cost today than it was. And therefore, it's dilutive near term, until that capacity comes online. And we think it's the prudent thing to do, but that's part of the dynamic that we're dealing with. Sure. Thanks. So I think, first off, I think as a note, we feel pretty confident about the pricing environment right now and - that I think we demonstrated that with the continued increase in releasing spreads that we put into our guidance, where we said greater than 5%. And we've had - we called out some items this year that have been, we'll call it, slight outliers, but we'll - we still see a strong pricing environment that were. And we expect that to continue into the fourth quarter where, we expect positive renewal spreads across all of our product types. I think going into next year, again, not giving guidance, what I would say is come back to the environment that we're in. I mean, there's nothing that suggests that pricing won't continue to be robust and strong across all of our major markets, where things might be different. Again, that you were alluding to is the basis against which those strong pricings are compared against. We are not seeing the same, I still expect that we'll have positive renewal spreads next year, but we'll be able to provide more granularity in terms of the level that, that is once we give guidance next quarter. Yes. Thanks, Matt. This is Matt as well. So yes, we've had what - I think the important points that I'd call out here are two things. One, the majority of the increase that we've seen over the last couple of quarters in our accounts receivable has been tied to actually VAT receivables as a result of the increased construction that we've had, particularly over internationally in EMEA. When you look at our trade payables, which are really only actually roughly half or a little over half of that balance, we have increased trade payables over the period, but it's also been fairly much in line with our increase in revenue as well. And we've actually been able to bring down our amount of trade payables in the last couple of quarters as well. But again, it doesn't appear that way when the total receivables balance has increased. But again, I think the two sailing points are only - roughly only half of our - that balance is tied to what I call trade receivables, which are actual rent and other billings that are sent to customers. A good chunk is related to VAT receivables tied to our construction, which has been the part that's been growing more substantially, which also has, a liability offset as well. No. I think, Andy, you hit it. I mean the majority of our development pipeline increased the call roughly 60 megawatts. We had 100 megawatts of new starts vast majority of that was in North America and in Northern Virginia specifically. If you look at our supplemental quarter-over-quarter, our cost per megawatt, I think broadly globally has been roughly flat. So it's just a view of new development starts looking to get those completed as quickly as possible. So, if we can deliver on time for our customers and take advantage of the market that we're in."

The third quarter marks nine months since being appointed to my current role as CEO, and this marks the fourth official earnings call. While there has been about as much volatility in a single year as I can recall from my 20-plus-year career, it has been a privilege and an honor to have the opportunity to visit and work with and to watch my Digital Realty colleagues across the globe execute on behalf of our customers and stakeholders during these extraordinary times. At the outset of this year, I highlighted three key priorities for our company. While we've got two months left in the year, I am very excited about our progress to date and look forward to finishing strong. As you recall, our key strategic priorities are: first, to demonstrably strengthen our customer value proposition, which means that we are adding connectivity-rich solutions and scale capacity to drive our global meeting place strategy. We are executing this through the addition and launch of new on-ramps, the expansion of our colo capacity end markets and also by providing visibility into longer-term hyperscale capacity in our largest core markets. We are making strides and our customers are recognizing this by landing and expanding their IT infrastructure within our facilities. For example, over the past few months, we've added on ramps from a number of the largest cloud service providers, including AWS and Oracle. Our second priority is to integrate and innovate. For the first time, we created an Americas region and formally organized the company into three regions to improve overall management and accountability. In addition, we moved global operations under an experienced Digital Realty leader, bringing the standardization and consistency across our global platform. We also reorganized all things technology under our CTO organization. Consistent with our aim to bring innovation to our customers end market, in the third quarter, we announced the launch of our first Nvidia DGX H100-Ready data center in Osaka, Japan. We also rolled out our new high-density colo offering across 28 global metros to support high-performance compute infrastructure, addressing data and AI-related growth challenges. We are also partnering with other leaders around the world to enhance our open platform. In this vein, we recently added BT and Lumin to our Service Fabric platform, which connects our data centers globally extending the reach of our customers and partners. And we made some nice progress on the sustainability front in the quarter, which I'll circle back to in a moment. Finally, we set out to bolster and diversify our capital sources. And to date, we've reduced leverage by 0.8 turns of EBITDA from the 1Q peak and increased liquidity to $3-plus billion, including $1 billion of cash on hand. We executed on our funding plan that included the completion of two stabilized hyperscale JVs this quarter, tapping into some of the deepest pools of private capital, and we remain confident in our ability to add to this progress with development JVs in the near future. If we deliver on our key strategic priorities, we expect that this will translate into better long-term sustainable growth for our customers, team members and in turn, our shareholders. Digital Realty continues to make progress in the third quarter with further improvement in our operational results highlighted by 9-plus percent same capital cash NOI growth strong leasing results with record 0 to 1-megawatt signings, the highest greater than megawatt pricing since 2016, record leasing in APAC with broad strength in the Americas, and record interconnection revenue with the strongest growth since 2018. The momentum across the data center infrastructure landscape is strong. Demand for our data center capacity remains broad-based both geographically and by product, as reflected in our leasing results. New supply in our top markets remains constrained and is likely to remain so due to limited availability of power, growing supply chain challenges and tighter financial conditions. While the demand drivers we have enjoyed for the last several years, including cloud, digital transformation and hybrid IT remain largely intact, AI applications have added a meaningful new layer, which is just beginning to materialize in our leasing results this quarter, and we are ready for it. When Chris first started speaking publicly about AI and high-performance compute at our Investor Day in December 2017, we are already in the process of architecting and designing our facilities to support the evolving densities and our most innovative and leading-edge customers. While there are multiple high-density workloads running in our portfolio since at least that time, in the last quarter alone we were able to accommodate a handful of high-density compute deployments from one of our service provider customers in a 10-plus year old data center in one of our smallest markets. And we are currently supporting one of our customers' AI infrastructure deployments that will incorporate 32,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. This doesn't mean that Digital Realty will be chasing large AI deployments far and wide, as we will continue to assess the longer-term opportunity set of remotely located single-tenant non-differentiated data centers. But it does mean that there has been an increase in demand for our highly connected campuses in core markets. We're being thoughtful in how we approach these opportunities. As we consider leasing our capacity, I expect that we will seek to support our long-term engaged partners that have become embedded within our meeting place community that value our strategic locations and the connectivity across platform digital. At the same time, in certain markets, we will selectively support customers that have a differentiated product offering as we've always been at the forefront supporting leading technology companies as they push their infrastructure capabilities. Let's move to our third quarter results. This quarter continued to demonstrate the fundamental recovery that we've been highlighting throughout this year. Leasing activity was strong and broad-based across product types and reflected the pricing recovery we have seen throughout our portfolio. While we routinely lead with our headline leasing figures, it is important to point out the record posted in the 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection segment in the quarter, which increased by more than 9% sequentially and nearly 28% over the prior year period. Total new leasing during the quarter was $152 million with record 0-1 megawatt signings representing just over one-third of total signings. Greater than a megawatt science moved higher for the second consecutive quarter led by the Americas region, while our team also put up a record quarter in APAC. Pricing remains firm with notable highs achieved across the greater than one megawatt segment with strength in the 0-1 megawatt category. Growing recognition of our value proposition, including our comprehensive product offering, along with strong demand trends and reduced availability are supportive of pricing and are helping to drive better core growth and higher returns on investment. In the third quarter, we saw re-leasing spreads climbed to 7.4% on a cash basis contributing to the strongest same capital cash NOI growth in more than a decade. During the third quarter, churn remained low at 1.1% and we added 117 new customers extending our string of 100-plus new logos per quarter to 3.5 years. Another strong validation of the value that enterprise customers around the world recognize in platform digital. Our focus on deepening the value of our campus has resulted in enhanced cloud access for Digital Realty. Recently, 4 out of 5 top B2B cloud providers complete multisite on-ramp and edge expansions to serve data-intensive workloads on two continents via Platform Digital. In addition, AWS announced a direct connect location in Seoul, the first carrier-neutral facility in the market, while we announced the Oracle FastConnect availability in Madrid to their EU sovereign cloud. Other key wins during the quarter included a speech-to-text AI provider completed their second HD colo deployment in six months on Platform Digital, multiple new logos in the health care vertical in the quarter, two Global 2000 health care companies deployed on Platform Digital, one supportive data-intensive AI workloads and the other implementing a 2-site data compliance solution. An international Tier 1 telco added a multi-metro expansion across two continents of Platform Digital to support their retail enterprise customers. A Global 2000 Bank is implementing multi-site, multi-region network hub deployments now totaling 15 metros and a Global 2000 insurance company is expanding a distributed data hub on Platform Digital to support M&A data compliance. Moving over to our largest market, Northern Virginia. More than a year since we learned the power constraints in this market, we have continued to work constructively with the power providers to confirm the commitments that we made to our customers and to provide growth capacity for our customers through new development and select churn opportunities. As discussed on our last earnings call, we identified almost 100 megawatts of development capacity in Loudoun County that we expect to be able to bring to market prior to 2026. This includes 56 megawatts of available capacity underway within the current development pipeline and the potential to move forward on another 40 megawatts. In addition to this Ashburn-focused capacity, we continue to advance the ball on our 192-megawatt development in site in Manassas, and we are now officially underway and will soon be patent ready to support construction of the first of two buildings on the site in early 2024. We are very excited to be able to offer this availability to our customers. Moving on to our investment activity. Digital Realty investment team has already had an extraordinarily productive year, including the $2.3 billion of JVs and noncore asset sales completed in the third quarter. Within the noncore bucket, we sold two facilities during the quarter, including one in the U.K. and the other in Chantilly, Virginia, totaling almost $200 million, including the $150 million noncore disposition in Texas that we completed last quarter, we're tracking well towards our $500 million target for the noncore asset sales in 2023. We closed two separate stabilized hyperscale joint ventures in July with the contribution of two assets in Chicago and three in Northern Virginia, raising $2.1 billion of proceeds. We've also made substantial progress on the third bucket of our funding plan, the development joint ventures, and we expect to have more to say about this in the fourth quarter. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the third quarter. We've continued to make progress on our water conservation initiatives, including a water saving initiative for cooling towers and our SIN10 facility in Singapore. The project won the inaugural Green Innovations, Water Solutions Award at the Singapore Environment Council's Environmental Achievement Awards. The project is expected to save over 1.2 million liters of water each month and improved water usage efficiency by 15%. The solution has now been evaluated for wider rollout across our portfolio. In the third quarter, we also announced that we are ranked in the top 10 on a U.S. EPA's National Top 100 list of the large green power users from the Green Power partnership. The company also ranked seventh on the EPA's list across technology and telecommunication providers. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier. Thanks Jon. Why don't you let Greg touch on his activity, it's been the tip of the spear on our development JVs, which unfortunately, we couldn't time not just one but two announcements like last quarter, but we haven't been idle and they're making some great progress. But Greg, why don't you give us a color? Thanks, David. We appreciate the kudos there. Before I hand off to Matt to give you a 2024 guidance on this call, which I can tell you we weren't prepared for. I'll just chime in with just some color. So you're right, with the - the trend has been our friend on multiple fronts. And I think we tried to signal this at the outset of the year, and we were a bit of a show-me story, but we saw our value proposition resonating. We saw the pricing environment firming and continue that momentum, whether it's asking rates, ROIs on our development pipeline at cash mark-to-market in both product sets, and I would say that environment is continuing. But before Matt take the air out of the balloon with no early guidance, I mean there are obviously headwinds that Matt can talk to that we're still working through. But Matt, why don't you give some of your thoughts? Thanks, Michael. So Jordan's got us playing by new rules to make sure everyone get at least one question on the call. So, we've got one question, but we'll try to get you on the next round for your follow-up. I think our actions are speaking louder than our words hopefully here, whereby we had tremendous success in the first half of the year or dribbling into the month of July on both non-core dispose followed by major hyperscale stabilized assets. And the fact that we haven't moved forward with any additional equity issuance of common stock, I think this speaks to our conviction on the next leg of private capital raisings with the development joint venture or joint ventures being the next leg of the stool. So - and I think those are things that will - are strategic and different for our company in relative to prior experience. Where we're going to share the non-cash flow period of these projects that are large, massive capital-intensive and long-term projects and allow some of these great fundamentals we've seen flow through to the bottom line. That doesn't mean we're 100% averse to ever issuing equity at the right time in the right quorum at the right price. But I think we believe we've got some incremental milestones or wins to put on the board here that are in the not-so-distant future, before we be ready. And this is on the back of tremendous progress. We've taken the balance sheet down, what 0.8 turns of EBITDA, literally in two quarters worth of reporting. So - and so I'm pleased with the progress, and I would say that we have more good news to come. Before - one last thing. I want to hand over to Greg because you made a comment on the non-core dispos, just - I think that we should clarify what that really means to us. Hi, thanks, David. So I mean, what's great about this quarter is not just the size of that bar, but just what really went into it. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we usually call it historically led off with the top line number, but I think it was even more important to start with a tremendous foundation. Less than a megawatt interconnection signing it was a granular of quantity of customers, broad-based across the regions, including interconnection was at a record. It was up dramatically, not just year-over-year, close to 28%, but 9% quarter-over-quarter and that is that flywheel success that we've been investing in and starting to see more and more harvesting the fruits of our labor. On the bigger portion of that, it was not one single deal, is our largest deal not even a third of the total signings. It was broad-based across the geos as well. And these are playing to a continuation of demand trends that have been here for a little while, but certainly not exhausted. When you look at the pace of how fast the cloud is growing, digital transformation, hybrid IT. You look at our new logo contribution largely enterprise base 117 from around the globe and artificial intelligence, which is something we've had a hand in supporting for many years in high-performance compute power densities. That is just starting to blossom in our numbers. And I think that is just an incremental tailwind of demand where it doesn't feel like the digestion period is anywhere near coming to the amount of capacity demands we're seeing for the industry overall. Hi, thanks Frank. I'm going to toss just a column in a second. But I just - there's many shapes and forms of AI, and I reiterate, this is still early innings of what's going to be a vast build-out of required infrastructure. So our intersection of supporting AI is called in the single megawatt or two for enterprise adjacent to the existing workloads expansion into multiple - many, many megawatts of contiguous capacity and everything in between. And we're in a world right now where it's about large language model training, obviously, the inference - the dawn of inference and the implications will hopefully point to incremental location latency-sensitive needs. The private consumption of AI or the public consumption - consumer consumption as well outweighing the enterprise, that's going to change. So I think this is - this demand case, I think, is going to grow and change and it feels like come in our favor. But Colin, why don't you speak to some of your experience front line with the customers? Thanks Michael. So I mean - this isn't new news. And I think I framed this at some of the investor meetings we've had through the fall or even on back to NAREIT. Listen, we are a large - the largest global player in the space here and we are taking a strategic change to how we're funding the business was one of my three top priorities. And what we're not going to do is tie ourselves to a partner for all time and reduce our flexibility. But we're going to be looking at targeted large-scale projects. These are projects that are supporting will support customers, we believe in their growth campuses multiple megawatts. So not non-core at all like things that we would invest 100% if we weren't looking to change our funding strategy to drive more bottom line growth. And I think you can think the concentration of those type of projects to-date are mostly in North America and Europe. Given our business is already in a shared in a venture in Latin America and was a little bit smaller in APAC. And I think it's going to be very targeted trying to find the right capital source that is like-minded in terms of their vision for the asset class and looking for a partner that wants to really invest alongside we think is the best-in-class in this industry. Hi, thanks Ari. So I don't - I think consistent with what I just shared reiterated on this call, we believe that this opportunity when it comes to our space, digital transformation, cloud computing, hybrid IT and now the advent of artificial intelligence really coming to fruition is so large, long-term, capital-intensive that really tapping into both private and public capital in different measures is the right way to maximize value for our shareholders. And we are certainly experiencing an inflection in our operating fundamentals that has built upon good results throughout the year. We've been doing a tremendous amount of deleveraging this year. We'll be, call it, rounding third base on the deleveraging next year, getting back to the targets Matt's laid out. And we also have headwinds when it comes to, call it, some - a modest amount of debt coming due in terms of refinancing. But we view that the development joint venture remains to be the right move to drive more to the bottom line. And again, as I said in a question or two ago, we are not tying ourselves to this strategy and partner for all time, right? This has allowed us to accelerate those earnings and then have be able to throttle the levers here as to how much we share in terms of development joint ventures with partners down the road. It's not budget overruns or anything like that, it is called conviction in the demand landscape. And I mean we can - Matt can run through it. But I think the biggest piece is Northern Virginia, which goes back to our success in freeing up, call it, 100-plus megawatts in the Loudoun County pinch point and now activating that. But Matt, anything else I'm missing there? Hi. Thanks, Nick. So, I could tell you just yesterday, my team and I were on a called recurring check in with one of our top cloud customers. And that dialogue was multifaceted. It was obviously concentrated on how we can support their growth in their availability zones, how we can commence faster. There's operational elements, it ranges across all the theaters and it also had how we can drive greater consumption to their cloud. And their services from our 5,000 existing customers from the 100 plus we added this quarter and the next quarter, how we're integrating them onto our service fabric natively. And so, I think we are - and I think you're seeing those results paying dividends in that customer appreciation. And you're seeing that in the litany of, call it, magnetic destinations, be it the on-ramps we announced around the world as well as the pickup in the demand that we characterize as less than megawatt interconnection accelerating. So, I do see a connection there. I think we've delivered a tremendous amount of value to our customers, improving their top line and their bottom lines in a safe, secure fashion. And when obviously, I think some of your question was dovetailed also to some of the larger customers, I think that we're just being transparent and honest with these customers that we're really trying to build a durable business to stand the test of time. And that doesn't mean we try to win 100% of a hyperscales market share, but if we're in 50 metropolitan areas, there's probably 25 or 30 where we have something that they really need, and we can really help them like no other. And that's through our supply chain, our large campuses that future-proof their growth, operational excellence and other value adds and just being a one-stop shop for all their needs. So, I think that's a long, long-winded answer to yes. Thanks, Michael. So I think, I'd point you to our development schedule, which has now been in the double-digits category across the board for the whole portfolio, including an increase in, call it, 65 megawatts quarter-over-quarter. North America, where, I would say, is the current home to the largest deals is in double-digit by itself and has moved up dramatically. I don't - when we look at the risk award, there's obviously episodic scenarios where returns for big deals with hyperscalers couldn't go higher. But I think that the - once you kind of ascend into the double-digits, given the current state of, call it, cost of capital in general, I think you're in the proverbial end zone in terms of creating value on many ways. So I wouldn't bank on incremental stair stiffs of shifts beyond that. But I think, we're in a time in the world where the demand remains robust and diverse, outpacing supply. That dynamic does not feel to be abating. And I think we've got a great hand to support tremendous customers' growth around the globe and create a lot of value for a lot of stakeholders. Thank you, Andrea. Digital Realty had a strong third quarter. Our results demonstrate that our value proposition is resonating with our customers. We posted another quarter of strengthening organic operating results with record 0-1 megawatt bookings, strong re-leasing spreads and our best same-capital cash and ROI growth in over a decade. During the first nine months of the year, we've raised over $3.5 billion of new capital, enabling us to meaningfully delever while reinvesting to support our customers' growing needs, and we are not done yet. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and express my personal gratitude to our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty to keep the digital world spinning. We look forward to updating you on our progress and meeting with many of you at NAREIT in L.A. in a few weeks. Thank you."

            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Andy. Frank. I appreciate the question. I would just amplify what Andy is saying is the demand principles are not monolithic. I mean you're talking about a wide gamut of requirements across the customer platform, which really plays well to our broad-based portfolio. So I think we do as good a job as any to support broad-based requirements and Catechist's capacity. But also having mixed dynamic requirements in terms of densities. And so what we try to do is to map that right customer to right market to right workload. And again, across 300-plus data centers, I think we can serve that pretty well. We also feel pretty strongly that core market orientation, i.e., proximity to eyeballs and GDP is still going to remain a core requirement for much of this AI workload. So, we feel like that maps really well to our course of assets across the globe."

            "name": "Gregory Wright",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Jon. Look, I think as Andy mentioned, look, last quarter, which we already announced, we were - we had our two stabilized joint ventures with TPG in Northern Virginia and obviously, GI and Chicago, which generated about $2.2 billion of proceeds. And we -- what we found in that process was demand was very robust to invest in data center assets in the private market, and the same holds true. We're continuing to see even more demand for stabilized assets. And I would go as far as to say it's even greater investor demand, when you look at the development potential development JVs. All I can tell you is we're working hard, and we hope we have something here in relatively short order to report. But right now, no more guidance than that. Other than that, demand remains strong, and we remain encouraged. Yes. Thanks, Andy. Hi Michael, Look, I don't think it's right to say a 9% - you're selling an asset at a 9% cap rate versus what your implied multiple is on your company. In our minds, from a capital allocation perspective, those are two very different things. One is the assets we sold, they're noncore assets, right? One's in Watford, ones in Chantilly. Anyhow what does that mean to us? I mean these are non-campus assets with limited connectivity, right? And when you look at Chantilly, Wilson Nova, it's neither of the major markets of Loudon and Manassas, right? And so when you look at these assets, they're older, they're stand-alone assets. Now this is a very, very small portion of our business. But we call these assets out. So I don't think we can sit here and assess a cap rate on one or two non-core assets versus selling equity in the business. These are assets that are not part of our core business going forward and non-strategic to us, that's a very different analysis. So, I would just caution folks to say, Hey, here's a couple of assets that were non-core that were signed as a nine, therefore, that's not the right cost of capital play or the right capital allocation, because I think it is. I mean no. Look, it's a good question, but the answer is no. Remember, when investors are out there making investments in different sectors, right? Everything is on a relative basis. And I think when investors look at data centers today, and they look at the quality of the facility, the quality of the customer base, the term of the lease, the strong organic growth in the business today. It's the best place for them to invest. In fact, I would argue that over time, you're going to continue to see data centers becoming more mainstream investing rather than a niche play investing when you look at the level of demand out there, whether it's through pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds and the like. So no, I mean, it's also an interesting as there's pockets of capital that are driven - we'll do this unlevered. So they're willing to be patient and wait for leverage and wait for rates to come back down. And I think that also, to your point, Ivan, and I think that's what I mentioned earlier, there's even an outsized demand on the development side. I think the fact that we're in a higher rate environment is driving more demand, if you will, towards development. So - but no, we have not. In fact, I would go the other way. I would say that we've seen an acceleration in the demand for development JVs. Hi Eric, this is Greg. The answer is yes, $750 is still a good deal. And yes, we are working on more than one."

During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Callers will be limited to one question, plus a follow-up, and we'll aim to conclude at the bottom of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to Digital Realty's second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today\u2019s call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain certain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our second quarter. First, our customer value proposition continues to resonate. We delivered yet another strong quarter of leasing in our zero to one megawatt plus interconnection segment and saw a healthy rebound in greater than a megawatt leasing. And second, this past quarter confirmed the continued inflection of fundamentals we have been speaking about for much of the past year, supported by a strong pricing environment. Releasing spreads were the strongest in three years and stabilized same cash NOI grew by 5.6% marking the second consecutive quarter with positive growth and the best growth in almost nine years. And third, we bolstered our total liquidity, which now stands at more than $4 billion and further diversified our capital sources and reduced our leverage well off of peak levels through more than $2 billion of dispositions and JVs and over $1 billion of equity issued under our ATM. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Against the backdrop of an extraordinarily dynamic first half of the year, we have remained focused on advancing our strategic priorities and delivering on behalf of our 5,000 plus customers. Digital Realty made strong progress in the second quarter with improved operational results, progress on our funding plan and increased liquidity, continued organizational improvements, an increasing recognition of the critical role that data centers will play in support of both digital transformation and artificial intelligence. We posted sequential growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and CFFO per share, while improving development returns, bolstering liquidity and delevering the balance sheet. During the quarter, we made progress on each of the three key strategic priorities that I laid out earlier this year. First, we strengthened our customer value proposition by enhancing our communities of interest with more connectivity options, posting record double digit interconnection revenue growth and the second highest quarter of new logo additions in company history. Second, we innovated and integrated, delivering enhancements designed to support high performance compute, including AI by enabling data centers to support liquid cooling solutions, while also broadening our existing partnership with NVIDIA with the certification of our first DGx H100 ready data center and integrating with additional organizational enhancements design, deliver a consistent structure and experience, while leveraging data to improve our effectiveness and efficiency. Third, we access diverse capital sources during the quarter including the sale of a non-core asset in Texas at an attractive 4.4% cap rate and equity raised under our ATM. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we formed a stabilized hyperscale data center joint venture with a new private capital partner that acquired an interest in two facilities in Chicago. And today, we announced a similar joint venture transaction alongside a second new private capital partner for three stabilized hyperscale data centers in Northern Virginia. Just a little more than halfway through the year, we are now well ahead of the midpoint of our original funding plan for 2023 and we remain focused on putting Digital Realty's balance sheet into position to support the growing opportunity that lies ahead. The current state of the data center infrastructure landscape is very healthy. There is widespread demand for our data center capacity across various regions and products. However, there is limited new supply due to decreased power availability and tight financial conditions. The global expansion of Cloud Computing paired with continuous digital transformation of enterprises underscores the escalating importance of both data and AI in shaping demand. Presently, we are collaborating with numerous clients on AI focused requests for proposals and implementations. The initial surge is anticipated in power intensive training applications followed by a rise in inferencing applications including access to private data sets, which are expected to necessitate enhanced performance and reduce latency. Additionally, the integral nature of these models is necessitating larger capacity blocks which align seamlessly with our extensive product suite. As the global meeting place for data exchange and a full spectrum provider of data center solutions, Digital Realty stands at a strategic vantage point. This allows us to cater to the needs of enterprises, facilitating their efficient integration of AI applications within their digital transformation journeys. In the second quarter, we unveiled Data Gravity Index 2.0, which represents our extended commitment to data science. This tool is designed to access the effects of enterprise data generation and consumption in both public clouds and private data centers, offering enterprises a framework to manage and drive insights from their data. Moreover, our innovative approaches in Data Gravity and comprehensive data center architecture were recognized as we secured a patent for these. Our patent further offers enterprises a roadmap to ensure their architectures remain relevant in the future. The evidence is clear, we have shifted from a physical economy to a digital economy, which now is entering a new form, the data economy. Our research shows that the surge in server demand can be attributed to the rising needs of both public and private cloud infrastructure, further augmented by AI training and inference processes. At the same time, demand for storage devices is poised to grow due to data regulation. Let's move to our second quarter results. This quarter continued the inflection in the fundamental recovery we've been highlighting in our core portfolio over the past several quarters. Our pipeline remains strong during the quarter, helping to drive a sequential rebound in leasing volume but also supporting strong pricing with releasing spreads positive again across all product types and in all regions. New leasing during the quarter was $114 million with continued strength in the zero to one megawatt plus interconnection leasing, which represented 43% of total signings. Greater than a megawatt increased by over 60% sequentially, led by one of our strongest quarters ever in EMEA. Strong demand trends and reduced availability along with growing recognition of our value proposition continue to be supportive of pricing, and are enhancing our expected returns. In the second quarter, we saw releasing spreads climbed to nearly 7% on a cash basis, helping to drive the best same capital cash NOI growth that we've seen since I joined Digital Realty in 2015. During the second quarter, churn remained low at 1.5% and we added 133 new customers, our second best quarter ever and a nice continuation of the 100 plus new logo streak we have going. This is a strong validation of the stability of enterprise IT spend and digital transformation that we are seeing and of the value that customers recognize in platform digital. Our key wins included an innovative sustainability oriented infrastructure provider that tasked into stranded energy to support module edge compute sites chose Digital Realty for AI applications, utilizing Platform Digital's network control and data hub solutions. Data intensive workloads are being deployed on Platform Digital by a major US federal agency to reduce costs and improve sustainability, while interconnecting with their key ecosystem partners. A leading European bank chose Platform Digital to help simplify and secure their hybrid IT strategy in compliance with data sovereignty regulations, while leveraging the available cloud connectivity. A Fortune 500 quick serve restaurant chain is updating their internal infrastructure on Platform Digital to improve reliability and security, support existing systems and connect with [P Cloud] (ph) to support the strong growth of their e-commerce business. A global 2000 Pharmaceuticals sourcing and distribution services company is expanding to a new [indiscernible] Platform Digital to ensure global data governance compliance. And a global 2000 Auto Manufacture chose Platform Digital to upgrade their network architecture in Central Europe by adding key points of presence for the largest and most important production centers. Moving over to our largest market, Northern Virginia. In the years since we learned that the power constraints in this market will continue to work constructively with the power provider to confirm the commitments that we've made to our customers and to provide growth capacity for our customers through new development and select churn opportunities. Over the course of last several months with the support of our local utility partners, we've been able to identify nearly 100 megawatts of incremental billable capacity that we expect to be able to bring to market prior to 2026. This includes 40 megawatts of available capacity underway within the current development pipeline and the potential to move forward on almost another 60 megawatts. In addition to this Ashburn focus capacity, we've made meaningful progress on our 192 megawatt development site in Manassas which is now nearly in position to begin development. We are optimistic about the near term potential to offer this availability to our customers. Moving on to our investment activity. As we outlined in February, 2023 was poised to be an active year for our investments team and some of the fruit of their labor has been harvested since our last call. During the second quarter, we acquired the land and shell associated with the previously leased data center in Amsterdam, where we previously held a lease hold interest for $18 million. In a separate future proofing transaction, we purchased additional land adjacent to our highly connected Schiphol campus in Amsterdam, which could support another 40 megawatts of potential IT load providing ample runway for both enterprise and service provider growth. We also closed on first non-core disposition of the year in mid-May at a 4.4% cap rate resulting in $150 million of net proceeds to Digital Realty. This facility was previously leased as a power to shell and was sold to one of its primary occupants. In July, we saw a significant acceleration in our capital recycling initiatives, closing on two separate stabilized hyperscale joint ventures in Chicago and Ashburn. These deals were executed at just over 6% cash cap rate on average and raised more than $2 billion of net proceeds for Digital Realty. These transactions are an important validation of our current strategy as we remain focused on delivering shareholder value through the development of new data centers at double digit unlevered returns and the monetization of stabilized hyperscale assets at a premium. But equally as important, we've substantially bolstered and diversified our sources of private capital so that we can execute on the opportunity that lies ahead without being overly reliant on any individual avenue of capital while also increasing the efficiency of our balance sheet. While we've had remarkable traction on these transactions and all due credit goes to Greg Wright, his top-notch team and the rest of our platform for executing through a tumultuous capital markets environment, we are not resting on our laurels. We are well ahead of our plan on our stabilized hyper sale joint venture plan, but we see ample demand for the hyperscale development joint venture bucket that we have previously discussed and we'll provide updates as appropriate. Before moving on, I'm also delighted to welcome [indiscernible] Reliance Industries Company as our newest partner to our joint venture in India. The expanded partnership builds on the strong foundation laid by [BAM] (ph) Digital Realty, through the addition of Jio's massive digital connectivity ecosystem and strong enterprise relationships with 80% of large private enterprises in India. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the quarter. During the second quarter, we issued our fifth annual ESG report outlining our initiatives for 2022. The report highlights the progress we have made toward our science-based targets, commitment to reduce our global carbon emission by 68% by 2030. We've enabled our success by contracting for renewable energy wherever possible so that we have 1 gigawatt of solar and wind energy under contract in the US. This has enabled us to match 126 of our data centers with 100% renewable energy. In the second quarter, we also received a certificate of adherence from the climate neutral data center pack. As a founding member of the pack, Digital Realty worked with independent auditors to certify that we are on track to meet the overarching goal of the pack for the industry to become climate neutral by 2030. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment, while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.\nMatthew Mercier: Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our second quarter results. We signed $114 million of new leases in the second quarter, with broad-based strength across the zero to one megawatt plus interconnection segment in each region. We leased approximately $50 million in the zero to one megawatt plus interconnection category, accounting for 43% of total bookings and becoming a larger part of our overall bookings since last year. . Interconnection bookings were strong once again at over $12 million, concluding a record 12-month period. Zero to one megawatt bookings, excluding interconnection, were among our strongest ever at $37 million. Digital Realty has come a long way over the past four years, more than tripling our bookings in the zero to one megawatt plus interconnection segment through a combination of organic and inorganic growth. These results demonstrate that our full spectrum strategy is working. Greater than a megawatt bookings totaled $61 million in the quarter, a meaningful bounce back from last quarter's timing-oriented pause. EMEA was the standout, including strong contributions from Johannesburg, Paris and [indiscernible] while we also saw notable strength in Northern Virginia and Tokyo. We also continue to overindex towards CPI-based escalators within our new leases with 35% of the newly signed leases in the quarter contained inflation-linked increases with fixed rate escalators on the balance. Pricing has improved in many markets. With our largest market, Northern Virginia, seen nearly a doubling of rates over the past year in response to supply constraints. Illustrating the changing tide in Ashburn, during the quarter, we opportunistically took back 8 megawatts of lease capacity from an existing customer and released it to another customer at a substantial premium. The original lease was signed in the first quarter of last year. Accordingly, our new leasing for the quarter only represents the uplift in rent achieved versus the prior lease rather than the full annualized value of the new lease. While we have previously tempered enthusiasm around the potential mark-to-market opportunity in Northern Virginia, we are encouraged by this recent transaction and our increased development potential and growing colocation and connectivity offering in this market. Aside from the shift seen in Northern Virginia, we have also seen an improvement in rates across the Americas as well as in EMEA and APAC. Looking forward, our demand funnel remains healthy with strength across product types and geographies. We expect ongoing and newly approved development capacity to be an important contributor to our growth through next year. Turning to our backlog slide. The current backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases was $437 million at quarter end as commencements were once again well over $100 million, balanced by new leasing. We expect the remaining $150 million of commencements in the second half of 2023 to be somewhat evenly weighted between the third and fourth quarters. The lag between signings and commencements in the quarter was 11 months as certain hyperscale customers await build-out completions. During the second quarter, we signed $211 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 6.9% on a cash basis, our strongest renewal pricing in three years. This strength was shared across both product segments and across our three regions, continuing the broad-based improvement we saw last quarter with renewal rates trending over 5% during the first half combined, we are raising our full year guidance for renewal spreads to better reflect the success year-to-date in today's improved fundamental environment. Renewal spreads in the zero to one megawatt category continued to climb for the sixth consecutive quarter to an increase of 4.8% in the second quarter on $133 million of volume. Greater than 1 megawatt renewals were even stronger in the second quarter as cash releasing spreads increased by considerable 8.7% on $73 million of renewals, the largest increase within this category since the third quarter of 2019. Turning to our operating results. Our operating and financial performance in the second quarter was a bit better than our expectations highlighted by many of the same factors we highlighted last quarter. The continued improvement in our core operating performance, another record quarter of interconnection revenue and well-controlled expenses. In terms of earnings growth, we reported second quarter core FFO of $1.68 per share, 2% better versus the prior quarter and consensus expectations. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was $1.69 per share relative to the $1.72 we reported in the second quarter of 2022. Total revenue was up 20% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year revenue growth was impacted by both the inclusion of Teraco this year and the significant volatility in utility costs and reimbursements, particularly in Europe over the past 12 months. Most of these energy costs are directly passed through to our customers. Excluding utility reimbursements, total revenue was up 12% year-over-year. Critically, our rental revenues in the second quarter included a $25 million onetime write-off of noncash straight-line rent and the $6 million bad debt reserve related to a tenant that declared bankruptcy during the quarter. We also wrote off $3 million of noncash straight line rent related to the re-leasing opportunity we executed in Northern Virginia. These write-offs of noncash straight-line rent of approximately $28 million combined are excluded from core FFO per share. Interconnection revenue was at a record level in the quarter, increasing by 12% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Excluding Teraco, interconnection revenue was up 8% year-over-year, reflecting the ongoing organic strength in our core footprint. Bookings were higher in all three regions and ServiceFabric activations doubled in the quarter. Other than utility costs, expenses were well contained as rental property operating expenses and insurance were both flat sequentially, resulting in adjusted EBITDA growth of 14% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Improvement in our stabilized same capital operating performance continued in the second quarter, with year-over-year cash NOI up 5.6% and 1.7% sequentially. This marked the strongest year-over-year growth in our same capital pool since 2014, demonstrating the turn and fundamentals that we have been highlighting. The improvement was driven by an 80 basis point increase in occupancy as commencements outpace churn with upside from rent escalators and stronger-than-expected releasing spreads. While we're very encouraged by the improvement we've seen to date in this metric and the trend does indeed appear to be our friend, our enthusiasm for the second half of 2023 is tempered by the uncertainty related to a recent customer bankruptcy filing. We expect to know more about the potential impact by the time we report third quarter results. Turning to the balance sheet. As Andy outlined in his remarks, as of this week, we are meaningfully ahead of the funding plan that we laid out for you in February. We have already closed an approximately $2.2 billion of asset sales and stabilized joint ventures and expect to make additional progress on development joint ventures in the second half of this year. Specifically, earlier in July, we closed on the sale of a 65% interest in two stabilized hyperscale data centers on our Chicago campus, raising $743 million of gross proceeds. And as announced this afternoon, we sold an 80% interest in three stabilized hyperscale data centers on our Ashburn campus, raising another $1.3 billion of gross proceeds. Including proceeds from the sale of the noncore asset in Texas, we announced last month, we've raised over $2 billion in capital at a blended average cap rate of just over 6% so far this year. In addition to this capital recycling activity, during the second quarter we raised $1.1 billion of proceeds from the sale of 11 million shares of equity under our ATM. Included in this total was approximately 3.5 million shares or $335 million that was structured as forward equity issuance. These shares were settled earlier this week. Our reported leverage ratio at the quarter end was 6.8 times, while fixed charge coverage was 4.2 times. Pro forma for the JV transactions and the settlement of the forward equity outstanding at quarter end leverage was 6.3 times, putting us on track toward our near 6 time target by year-end. Moving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is nearly five years and our weighted average interest rate is 2.7%. Approximately 84% of our debt is non-US dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Approximately 83% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have minimal near-term debt maturities with only $100 million maturing during the rest of this year and a well-laddered maturity schedule throughout the out years. Lastly, let's turn to our guidance. We are affirming our full year revenue guidance range of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.7 billion at the midpoint as the recent acceleration in capital recycling has been balanced by better-than-expected releasing spreads and same capital cash NOI. We are, however, adjusting our core FFO and constant currency core FFO per share guidance ranges for the full year 2023 by $0.10 per share to a new range of [6.55 to 6.65] (ph) to reflect the following: $0.03 per share tied to the acceleration of our funding plan, including greater-than-expected stabilized joint venture sales and over $1 billion of equity issuance. $0.05 to $0.07 per share for the write-off of unpaid rent and additional near-term uncertainty related to recent customer bankruptcy and about $0.01 per share of lower noncash straight-line rent tied to the opportunistic termination and releasing in Northern Virginia. Given the continued progress on the turn in our fundamentals during the quarter, we are also updating the organic operating metrics supporting our full year guidance, including cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads moving up to greater than 4% and greater than 8%, respectively. An increase in our same capital cash NOI growth guidance by 100 basis points to a revised range of 4% to 5% despite the potential impact of the customer bankruptcy this quarter, partly balanced by a reduction in our year-end portfolio occupancy assumption to 84% to 85%, largely reflecting the greater than anticipated sales of stabilized hyperscale assets into joint ventures. Given the better-than-expected execution on our funding plan to date, we have also updated our guidance for dispositions in JV capital. We now expect total disposition in JV capital raised to fall within the range of our current $2.2 billion, up to $3 billion. We've also reduced the amount of long-term debt financing needed to support our full year funding plan, given the nearly $4 billion of liquidity currently available as a result of asset sales, JVs and ATM equity raised. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?\nOperator: We will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Participant: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. You have [Alex Waters] (ph) on for Dave. Congrats on the new JV deal. Just wanted to know if you could walk us through kind of what line of sight you have for the development JV pipeline. And then looking into 2024, can you speak to how comfortable you are with the funding pipeline? And then secondly, on the core business, you've had strong releasing spreads on the greater than 1 megawatt side. Just curious on what your expectations are for this bucket heading into the second half of the year and into 2024. Thanks.\nAndrew Power: Hey thanks, Alex. Appreciate the kind words. I'm going to turn it to Greg to call speak to where we're going next in terms of capital raising on development JVs, maybe tie in what's happened back half of this year into 2024. And I can pick up on the core portfolio.\nGregory Wright: Sounds good. Thanks, Alex. Look, with respect to the development JV guidance, we're still comfortable with our full year development JV guidance that we provided previously. That's roughly [750] (ph), give or take. And that's obviously the plug, if you will, between the $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion last time, which now becomes $2.2 billion to $3 billion. Look, we remain engaged on these transactions over the second half of the year. And what we're seeing out there just as with the stabilized joint ventures, there's strong demand for the development joint ventures, particularly given that these JVs offer the highest returns and they have a lot of moving parts, though. So given the strategic considerations here, these tend to take a little longer. So, I'd say we remain optimistic and on track for those. With that, I'll turn it back over to Matt and Andy.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Alex. I think for your second question was about, call it, the core operating results we saw in the quarter year-to-date and how -- what we see in the back of the year, if I'm correct. We're certainly pleased on multiple fronts on the value proposition and pricing power coming through. We saw that in our new lease signings and ROIs as well as our cash mark-to-market and which flow through to our same-store growth. We had a quite strong quarter on those stats, and you saw that we updated our guidance for the full year. So as of right now, we think that these trends on the cash mark-to-markets and pricing power will continue into the back half of 2023.\nMatthew Mercier: Yeah, I might just add that, again this quarter we saw all of our greater than megawatt renewals were in positive territory, and that includes across all regions as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJon Petersen: Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Good job on the execution on the JV deal. I wanted to ask about the 8 megawatts where you had an uplift in rents. I know you talked about it, but I'm sorry, can you maybe break down like what kind of drove your ability to push those rents higher? And if you were to take that out, what were the rents per kilowatt hour in the greater than 1 megawatts in America?\nAndrew Power: Thanks, John. So, I'll walk through the dynamics, I'll let Matt quote that -- the actual rate on the new deal to give you a sense of the market. I mean this is obviously a market that is very tight on supply and we we\u2019ve been working with our installed customer base, if anyone had capacity that was idle or they didn't see -- have near-term need for. So hence, we were able to take back capacity from a customer since we let them out of a contract and that contract was signed, call it, a year ago at a much lower rate. And we were able to help a different customer that had immediate needs and we're able to sign that at a much higher rate. But Matt, why don't you walk through the stats?\nMatthew Mercier: Yes, sure. So just to be clear, the deal that you're -- that we're talking about here is not included in our renewal stats. What we are doing is showing just the net incremental revenue that we expect to recognize within our signing stats. And you'll see that more clearly when you look at Page 8 of our supplemental, in particular, in North America, the greater than a megawatt, you're going to see a deal -- you're going to see the 300 KW rate, and that's because we're only showing the incremental revenue and not the associated megawatts attached to it. If you put that deal in at, call it, 100%, you got 300 KW that would come down to 148KW. But again, it was a substantial uplift from the in-place lease. It was over 50% higher than what we had currently.\nJon Petersen: I'm sorry, that's 148 KW on the 8-megawatt deal or 148KW excluding the 8-megawatt deal?\nMatthew Mercier: Including, that would be our blended rate, if you look at Page 8 in our supplemental versus the 300KW, okay.\nJon Petersen: Okay. Okay. And then just one follow-up, just to stick with NOVA. So, with the power constraints there as long as nothing has changed, it seems like nothing new could really come online until 2026. Are you already seeing leasing demand for people that are wanting to sign leases and commit that far in advance?\nAndrew Power: So, John, the NOVA market, the facts, I would say, remain the same in terms of transmission lines and arrival of utility power, which has really created an environment of demand well outpacing supply. We are, I'd say, less right now focused on signings that don't commence until 2026 based on the uncertainty of when in 2026 exactly that power rise. And quite honestly, making sure that we're maximizing the opportunity at hand for us. That market has seen dramatic price improvement. We've signed deals in the larger categories, call it, 140 or north of that per kilowatt. Again, that market was in the 70s, not so long ago. And the good news, as we reported, given our breadth and history in that market, we've been able to work with our utility provider and really cobble together incremental growth capacity for our customers across our campuses. If you add them all up, prior to the 2026 arrival, call it, by 2025, if not sooner, you're approaching, call it, 100 megawatts of growth capacity in Ashburn, which is in addition to our growth capacity that we have in Manassas.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Elias of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMichael Elias: Great, thanks for taking the question guys. To start, in recent months we've seen the volume and size of deals increase. And to that point, there are many requirements on the market right now that are over 100 megawatts. As you considered the strategy moving forward, is it your intention to compete for these deals? And if so, are you willing to pursue these deals with or without a development JV lined up with the understanding that these projects will drive long-term shareholder value? And then I have a follow-up.\nAndrew Power: So, I can tell you, we didn't sign any 100 megawatt deals in this quarter. We are certainly around some of these opportunities. We're very focused on, call it, maximizing our footprint for its highest and best use in helping our customers the best way we can. Some of those deals obviously have led itself towards the AI domain for trading models, the need that large scales of contiguous capacity. I can tell you look at our footprint. We have extensive locations around the globe that we can help those types of customers. We are -- we've made great progress both in our capital sources, as you saw just in literally the month of July, really got back into firmer footing to support our customers' growth. Adding to that a development partner, I think we'll put even more fuel on fire to support that growth. So, I think when it comes to bigger and bigger deals, we got to make sure that they land in the right locations for Digital Realty and make sure we're maximizing the opportunity in terms of our -- what I call is really precious capacity in our land bank, in our sales and in our inventory runway.\nMichael Elias: Great. And then just to piggyback on that point about maximizing the opportunity. If I go back to the third quarter of 2022, you guys were clear that you were sharpening the lens to which you looked at investments with the intention of driving higher risk-adjusted return. As we think about hyperscale deals in which you would lease an entire into a single hyperscaler on a turnkey basis. Could you give us a framework for thinking about what the appropriate spread between your unlevered development yield and your cost of capital should be to make it worth it to lease it to the hyperscaler? Thank you.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Michael. I think Jordan is -- can see the future because, we thought he was going to ask this question. But honestly, we haven't been thinking about that because we've been raising the bar and demand has been outpacing the supply where anything that even kind of feels skinny or close to not just reaching our cost of capital is not made it on to where we're investing our dollars. And you can see that in our development life cycle where you have the whole schedule of the 377 plus megawatts underway, north of 10% ROI. That includes the Americas region, North America that, call it, 9% and still weighted down by projects that were, call it, open book yield on cost projects, almost legacy in vain that is weighting down those averages. I can tell you these opportunities we're seeing even for larger capacity blocks in these tight markets, be it Northern Virginia, be it Singapore, be it Frankfurt or elsewhere, we're certainly into the double digits unlevered ROIs, which I think that well exceeds the risk-adjusted of deploying capital and it really is coming down more to supply/demand dynamics than just, call it, premiums. And I think if you look at the great work our investments team did on transacting on some of these JVs and the new partners we brought in the fold and called the six-ish cap area I think you're seeing a lot of value creation in our model.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Atkin: Thanks. A couple of questions. I wondered what -- how to kind of think -- you said you're not going to issue any more debt this year. But given some of the other moving parts around possible asset sales and so forth, are there any more of those to come? And how can we think about the leverage trajectory of getting perhaps into the high fives or whatnot? And then secondly, I was curious just about India. Is your partner contributing any assets prospectively going forward? Thanks.\nAndrew Power: Matt can speak to the funding in our sources and uses in the guidance and leverage, and then Chris and I can [indiscernible] the India piece?\nMatthew Mercier: Yes, so thanks Jon. There's a couple of aspects here, I think, are important. One to reiterate, as of today, we've got $4 billion of liquidity, thanks to the execution of the broader team. If you look at where our funding needs are going forward, this year based on looking at our life cycle, what's remaining to be spent, our guidance in terms of what's left to be spent, we're talking about somewhere in the [1.2 to 1.3] (ph) left to spend this year. So that gives us a pretty significant runway into 2024 to be able to fund the continued growth and opportunities that we see going forward. On top of that, as we also noted, we're not stopping in terms of the execution on asset sales as well as the potential that we're continuing to seek for development joint venture partners that will give us an even broader access to capital and be able to help us to fund not only some of that capital need into 2024, but also potentially this year as well, which rounds out into your question on leverage. We've made considerable progress again on that front as well. As I noted in the prepared remarks, you look at us on a pro forma basis, we're at 6.3% now. So made considerable progress on that. You layer on top of that our expected view of continuing to grow our EBITDA as we've left that guidance line unchanged, again, as well as continue to seek development joint venture partners that will continue to help us on that deleveraging process. So, we feel pretty good about progress to date on both liquidity and leverage. And I'll turn it over to Greg on the India JV topic.\nGregory Wright: Just on India, just -- I mean, I think it\u2019s less about the assets. It's more -- obviously, they're going to be share in development opportunities in a huge market with a lot of growth, but it's really about a great, fantastic new partner to the partnership. And maybe Chris can touch on Jio and what we think they bring to the table here.\nChristopher Sharp: Absolutely. I appreciate the conversation, Jon. So, it's a culmination of expertise, right, where Brookfield brings local investing expertise digital really, we bring the data center expertise to that market. But I think what really Jio brings is that local operating expertise and maybe many of you already know, but Jio is one of the largest mobile media platforms throughout India. And I think their extensive reach and ability to interconnect critical enterprises or other destinations is something that's going to allow us not to deliver a like-for-like product. And I think Greg and I have been talking about this for many years and looking at the fact that we wanted to be able to differentiate our ability to be successful within India. And so that partnership with Reliance and Jio has really elevated our ability to service the broader enterprise customer base, which, quite frankly, is unique in the -- it's a lot of our large hyperscale customers as well. So the amalgamation of that trio coming to market is something that we're excited about. We're still in early innings. So, you'll see it evolve over time, but pretty excited about the opportunity in India.\nJonathan Atkin: If I could quickly add on interconnect trends and anything to expect going forward in terms of just the trajectory, any particular reason why it might see pressure because of grooming or acceleration because of new use cases and is AI play a role at all in the interconnect at this point? Thanks.\nAndrew Power : Sure. Appreciate it, Jon. Just to further jump into that. Yes, interconnection, I think, is something that's evolving rather quickly. I think artificial intelligence is definitely evolving, and it's in its early stages to date. I think where we've been watching and what I think has shown through and we referenced in the prepared remarks is the fact that it's the highest five year growth, two straight quarters surpassing $100 million. I think that's very unique to us and the platform that we represent in the market. I would also say that some of the activities that we've been doing around ServiceFabric, which quite frankly, is tailored to streamlining the technical kind of barriers that have been placed upon the customers to access all of these destinations where data resides, which at the core of artificial intelligence, where I think your question is at, you have to have access to data. And so, being able to be a part of one of the largest open platforms that quite frankly, allows customers to access these data oceans of both public and private deployments. I think the platform is starting to pay off. And I would say that, again, early innings with AI, but we're very excited about what that demand is going to represent inside of our portfolio. And as we evolved and we're stable stay of what we did in the foundation of cloud, you'll see us be able to be at a steady state with a lot of these customers evolving AI as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Guarino of Green Street. Please go ahead.\nDavid Guarino: Thanks. So looking at your development tables, you guys are developing assets at 10% stabilized yields and feels like if that stays, you can sell assets at fixed cap rates. That's a pretty healthy spread on the development profit margin. So, I guess I was just wondering, since you've already hit your initial disposition target that range you set out why do you see the need to do more JV development at this point? Why not just look to sell more stabilized assets?\nGregory Wright: David, it's Greg here. Look, I think when you take a look -- as we laid out, and Andy laid out at the beginning of the year, the reason for finding these development partners is, look, when you look at this opportunity in the hyperscale business today, it goes well beyond our balance sheet even at $55 billion. So when you look at that, what it tells you is you got to have third-party capital to meet the customers' needs within -- throughout the globe for that business. So as we sit here today, even though we have, as you said, we've exceeded our guidance on what we were going to do. [indiscernible] look at this strategically go forward, and we think that's the best way to fund that business to create value for our shareholders. So that's why we're going to continue to fund it through development. And we think that's the most prudent way to move forward with it.\nDavid Guarino: Okay. And then maybe switching topics on the tenant bankruptcy, Matt, you were talking about, which I think is a former public data center company. Can you walk us through what eventually happens to that space? Are you guys just waiting now to renegotiate with the tenants? And I guess, how soon if that's not the case, can you start releasing that space?\nAndrew Power: David, just to add on to the last question, and I could [indiscernible] the second part of your question. The -- I think there's been -- our balance sheet today has, call it, north of 3 gigawatts of growth capacity around the world. And we see that expanding and having the balance sheet to be help funded alongside some great partners is another part of becoming more efficient and more quickly driving returns and results to our bottom lines. In a market and an opportunity backdrop that keeps getting bigger, it was large to begin with, cloud computing accelerated that with hyperscale demand. And AI is just an incremental lift to this wave of demand. Hence, we believe the best way to tackle this opportunity and support our customers while driving results to the bottom line is in partnerships on the capital front. When it comes to the customer bankruptcy, obviously, this customer is in the middle of bankruptcies so can't share too much. The typical playbook is the creditors essentially have to run a process for the assets or the business. And as part of that, make decisions on either accepting or rejecting leases. We have not, to date, had any leases rejected so far. While they have rejected other providers or landlord leases, I don't think you can assume that every one of our leases despite that fact will be accepted. But from a strategic lens, this is why years ago we increased our capabilities and be able to expand in the colocation interconnection offering and support end customers. So when -- if and when we sell to customers would have issues, we can essentially step in and support the end customers and have adequate financial outcomes and the [indiscernible] capabilities. So that there's a little bit of wait and see as this customer works its way through bankruptcy, and I think we'll have more to report by the third quarter call.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. Just a couple of follow-ups. So first, as you're looking at the portfolio, what's the value of data center assets that you own that could be considered for future joint ventures? So what's left in terms of opportunity for recycling? And then also, can you just provide us an update on how you're doing and the opportunities to improve, whether it's overall occupancy or same capital occupancy within the portfolio? Thanks.\nAndrew Power: Sure. I mean hyperscale is still a large piece of our business in terms of our installed base and certainly a lot of what's going into our current development pipeline as it stands. I think in conjunction with the creation of Digital Core REIT, we came to an estimation of, call it, $15 billion of value as a round ballpark in terms of things that would fit the bill essentially -- similar to the transactions we just announced in the month of July, fully stabilized, hyperscale-oriented long-weighted average lease length. Honestly, core assets parts of our campus, but the slowest organic growers of our portfolio. Less interconnection-rich, less customer rich. I think the more recent portfolios. We've sold, call it, 10 plus or minus customers in them. We're supporting 5,000 customers here in Digital Realty. So we still think that there's an opportunity to continue to build on these partnerships like the great partnerships we just announced. And essentially, be able to maintain 100% ownership of the highest growing pieces of our puzzle. When it comes to the same-store growth, Matt, why don't you pick that up in terms of the levers that we've been pushing hard to drive that?\nMatthew Mercier : Yes. So I call out a couple of things. So first, I mean, we have been making what, I would say, is good to great progress so far. If you look at it versus last year, were up 80 basis points on our stabilized pool. We're going to continue, we think, to improve that over the course of this year into next year. And that's going to be a mix of essentially twofold, spaces where we believe that there's opportunity for larger customers. We're going to continue to target that given density requirements and the growing need for capacity across a global portfolio that we have, we're going to find opportunities to fill that in. But I think part of it and part of why it takes -- it's going to take a little bit more time to continue to improve the overall occupancy is that we're also looking where we can convert some of that space that we do have in the productized co-lo lease that over time because we see the growing need for enterprise demand and where we want to be able to capitalize that which is a higher return and a market that we want to be able to penetrate and grow even further from where we are today.\nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you. Can you comment on the situation in Singapore, I guess, with the government allowing a few new players coming in. How do you think that affects the pricing there? And then looking at the capital recycling, kind of where do you go from here? I know you are continuing to look at other diversification strategies. Is this kind of sort of finish this out? Or what are some other areas of capital sources that you can look at to reach that goal? Thanks.\nAndrew Power: So on the first one on Singapore, I mean, I think what you're seeing is, supply still to get metered out at very small and rational clips. When after the years of no supply, the big unveiling is literally four different players getting 20-megawatt increments is relatively modest. I mean our latest data center build in that market was, I think, almost double that size of a need. So -- and this is not only happening with Singapore. You're seeing power constraints, be it from transmission or generation, moratoriums, broader [indiscernible], environmental concerns, just ratcheting and making the supply constraints to be more rational. That's why we're quite pleased that we have on our balance sheet, a long runway of growth for our customers with our campuses across 50-plus metros on six continents and the supply chain to support their growth. And this is all against a backdrop where the demand is outpacing the supply. Greg, do you want to reiterate where we go next on the capital recycling?\nGregory Wright: Yes. Thanks. Look, I think as we said, we're going to continue to focus our efforts on the remainder of this year on our development joint ventures we talked about. But to answer your question specifically, you asked about other sources of capital, we're -- how we think about it. Look, I think as a whole, we've done a pretty good job so far. As we said, we have the dedicated core REIT in Singapore. So that's a public vehicle. We've obviously just announced two transactions what we would characterize as distinguished blue chip investment partners in both GI and TPG. And look, we continue to see strong interest across the board, so not just [indiscernible], but we see infrastructure funds, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, insurance companies and the like. So we're seeing a broad-based demand here, looking at transactions, both stabilized core assets and development assets. So look, we're bullish on that. And when we look at that again, we think that's the prudent way to fund our growth going forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo.\nEric Luebchow: Great. Thanks for taking the question. So Andy, I think you've talked about getting down to 5.5 times leverage longer term. So maybe you could just walk through the path to get there beyond this year. And how much incremental capital recycling or JVs or other forms of capital you think you might need if you look past this year? And is the goal here to ultimately becoming more self-funding so that you can share more of the economics yourself instead of using development partners?\nMichael Elias : Yes. So this is Matt. I'll take that. I mean we do have -- our longer-term plan is to get down closer to 5.5 times. Again, I think we've done a considerable amount of work. We said this year, we'd look to be closer to that 6 times. You look at us based on what we've achieved and executed so far with the $2 billion from the joint ventures that we've done on stabilized assets, the billion we've raised in equity so far to date, which has come in. We're at pro forma at 6.3%. And we see the path going forward to getting back even further down as we have backlog and continue to execute on leasing that comes online, our EBITDA continues to grow, and we execute on these development joint ventures. We believe those are going to be two of the major components, which are going to help us get down to that 5.5 times target as we start to look through 2024. But we're not in a position at this point in time to give 2024 guidance yet, but I think those are the 2 main levers that we're going to be looking at to continue to drive our -- and improve our balance sheet and our leverage position.\nEric Luebchow: Okay. Great. And then just one follow-up. I think you still had some noncore portfolios out in the market today. And I guess given how successful you've been with capital recycling so far, is that kind of becoming less of a priority as you look forward? Or do you still plan to transact on some of those markets that are out there today?\nGregory Wright: Look, Eric, we -- as you said, we've been fortunate we've had good demand and good execution this year. And look, we're already -- we're 30% of the way through, and we have other transactions we're working on. But as we always said in the past, the good news for us is these noncore assets are all a very, very, very small piece of our portfolio. So we have the benefit of being disciplined and making sure we get, we think is fair value. So we're going to continue with that approach like we have historically and continue to pursue them. But again, we're seeing demand for those assets as well. So we'll continue to work on it, and we'll continue to post you as we have things to talk about.\nOperator: The next question comes from Irvin Liu of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nIrvin Liu: Hi. Thank you for the question. I have one and a follow-up. So within your improved bookings this quarter, are you able to call out whether there was any sort of contribution from AI or any AI-related deployments from our customers?\nAndrew Power: Hi, Irvin, that's a great question. I'm going to turn it over to our CRO, who really grabbed the baton and ran through the finish line strong, Colin McLean, to talk to what we saw on the AI front and maybe just give a little bit more color on the quarter in terms of bookings and new customers.\nColin McLean: Yes. Thanks, Andy. Appreciate the question, Irvin. Yes, certainly, AI is becoming a growing part of our conversation in pipeline overall. Just to revert back a bit on the overall pipeline dynamics we're seeing, I would say, describe it overall, the pipeline is strong, healthy and diverse across the board, particularly strong in the zero to one megawatt side and growing part of that AI is definitely a part of not just the hyperscale piece of the business, but also the zero to one megawatt, and we've had some strong contributions on that front. So overall, we really feel like both the results in the pipeline itself, the demand to be a testimony and validation really of our pivot to serving the entirety of the client needs, network, enterprise and hyperscalers. So I would say both on the AI front and frankly, the cloud and hybrid IT, we're seeing some really growing success and growing conversations with clients. So we remain optimistic and serving both the pervasive needs of clients as well as AI. And I think that's going to be a growing part of our portfolio as we move forward.\nIrvin Liu: Got it. Thank you for the color there. So my second question is on the strong pricing that you saw over the past two quarters. Can you just share with us how pricing trended quarter-to-quarter and the overall linearity of pricing trends now that we're one month into Q3?\nAndrew Power: The -- I would, Irvin [indiscernible] continuation of the commentary that we've been saying now for several quarters and that the pendulum on supply-demand fundamentals has been, call it, winded our back and growing. Our value proposition with our customers has been more and more well received. That's from our installed base who's been growing with us. Majority of our signings were from the existing customer base. That's also from -- I think it was our second highest new logo quarter of 133 new logos or new customers. And that has been broad-based, as Matt mentioned, across regions and product types. In the less than a megawatt category, it's been more steady [indiscernible] but obviously inflecting, call it, like-for-like increases. And on the greater than megawatt, it's been a little bit more volatile but in a positive fashion. As demand has remained intact, if not further increased and precious large capacity blocks have become fewer far between and the future of that supply bottlenecks really changing course does not seem to be near term whatsoever.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power, for his closing remarks.\nAndrew Power: Thank you, Andrea. Digital Realty had a strong second quarter. Our results demonstrate that our meeting place value proposition is resonating with customers. Just since our last call, we raised over $3 billion of new capital, positioning the company for the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead. We posted strong organic operating results with the results confirming the continued inflection in our core data center business. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and recognize our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world turning. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. And you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Absolutely. I appreciate the conversation, Jon. So, it's a culmination of expertise, right, where Brookfield brings local investing expertise digital really, we bring the data center expertise to that market. But I think what really Jio brings is that local operating expertise and maybe many of you already know, but Jio is one of the largest mobile media platforms throughout India. And I think their extensive reach and ability to interconnect critical enterprises or other destinations is something that's going to allow us not to deliver a like-for-like product. And I think Greg and I have been talking about this for many years and looking at the fact that we wanted to be able to differentiate our ability to be successful within India. And so that partnership with Reliance and Jio has really elevated our ability to service the broader enterprise customer base, which, quite frankly, is unique in the -- it's a lot of our large hyperscale customers as well. So the amalgamation of that trio coming to market is something that we're excited about. We're still in early innings. So, you'll see it evolve over time, but pretty excited about the opportunity in India."

            "name": "Gregory Wright",
            "content": "Sounds good. Thanks, Alex. Look, with respect to the development JV guidance, we're still comfortable with our full year development JV guidance that we provided previously. That's roughly [750] (ph), give or take. And that's obviously the plug, if you will, between the $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion last time, which now becomes $2.2 billion to $3 billion. Look, we remain engaged on these transactions over the second half of the year. And what we're seeing out there just as with the stabilized joint ventures, there's strong demand for the development joint ventures, particularly given that these JVs offer the highest returns and they have a lot of moving parts, though. So given the strategic considerations here, these tend to take a little longer. So, I'd say we remain optimistic and on track for those. With that, I'll turn it back over to Matt and Andy. Just on India, just -- I mean, I think it's less about the assets. It's more -- obviously, they're going to be share in development opportunities in a huge market with a lot of growth, but it's really about a great, fantastic new partner to the partnership. And maybe Chris can touch on Jio and what we think they bring to the table here. David, it's Greg here. Look, I think when you take a look -- as we laid out, and Andy laid out at the beginning of the year, the reason for finding these development partners is, look, when you look at this opportunity in the hyperscale business today, it goes well beyond our balance sheet even at $55 billion. So when you look at that, what it tells you is you got to have third-party capital to meet the customers' needs within -- throughout the globe for that business. So as we sit here today, even though we have, as you said, we've exceeded our guidance on what we were going to do. [indiscernible] look at this strategically go forward, and we think that's the best way to fund that business to create value for our shareholders. So that's why we're going to continue to fund it through development. And we think that's the most prudent way to move forward with it. Yes. Thanks. Look, I think as we said, we're going to continue to focus our efforts on the remainder of this year on our development joint ventures we talked about. But to answer your question specifically, you asked about other sources of capital, we're -- how we think about it. Look, I think as a whole, we've done a pretty good job so far.

So we're seeing a broad-based demand here, looking at transactions, both stabilized core assets and development assets. So look, we're bullish on that. And when we look at that again, we think that's the prudent way to fund our growth going forward. Look, Eric, we -- as you said, we've been fortunate we've had good demand and good execution this year. And look, we're already -- we're 30% of the way through, and we have other transactions we're working on.

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Matthew Mercier",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our second quarter results. We signed $114 million of new leases in the second quarter, with broad-based strength across the zero to one megawatt plus interconnection segment in each region. We leased approximately $50 million in the zero to one megawatt plus interconnection category, accounting for 43% of total bookings and becoming a larger part of our overall bookings since last year. . Interconnection bookings were strong once again at over $12 million, concluding a record 12-month period. Zero to one megawatt bookings, excluding interconnection, were among our strongest ever at $37 million. Digital Realty has come a long way over the past four years, more than tripling our bookings in the zero to one megawatt plus interconnection segment through a combination of organic and inorganic growth. These results demonstrate that our full spectrum strategy is working. Greater than a megawatt bookings totaled $61 million in the quarter, a meaningful bounce back from last quarter's timing-oriented pause. EMEA was the standout, including strong contributions from Johannesburg, Paris and [indiscernible] while we also saw notable strength in Northern Virginia and Tokyo. We also continue to overindex towards CPI-based escalators within our new leases with 35% of the newly signed leases in the quarter contained inflation-linked increases with fixed rate escalators on the balance. Pricing has improved in many markets. With our largest market, Northern Virginia, seen nearly a doubling of rates over the past year in response to supply constraints. Illustrating the changing tide in Ashburn, during the quarter, we opportunistically took back 8 megawatts of lease capacity from an existing customer and released it to another customer at a substantial premium. The original lease was signed in the first quarter of last year. Accordingly, our new leasing for the quarter only represents the uplift in rent achieved versus the prior lease rather than the full annualized value of the new lease. While we have previously tempered enthusiasm around the potential mark-to-market opportunity in Northern Virginia, we are encouraged by this recent transaction and our increased development potential and growing colocation and connectivity offering in this market. Aside from the shift seen in Northern Virginia, we have also seen an improvement in rates across the Americas as well as in EMEA and APAC. Looking forward, our demand funnel remains healthy with strength across product types and geographies. We expect ongoing and newly approved development capacity to be an important contributor to our growth through next year. Turning to our backlog slide. The current backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases was $437 million at quarter end as commencements were once again well over $100 million, balanced by new leasing. We expect the remaining $150 million of commencements in the second half of 2023 to be somewhat evenly weighted between the third and fourth quarters. The lag between signings and commencements in the quarter was 11 months as certain hyperscale customers await build-out completions. During the second quarter, we signed $211 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 6.9% on a cash basis, our strongest renewal pricing in three years. This strength was shared across both product segments and across our three regions, continuing the broad-based improvement we saw last quarter with renewal rates trending over 5% during the first half combined, we are raising our full year guidance for renewal spreads to better reflect the success year-to-date in today's improved fundamental environment. Renewal spreads in the zero to one megawatt category continued to climb for the sixth consecutive quarter to an increase of 4.8% in the second quarter on $133 million of volume. Greater than 1 megawatt renewals were even stronger in the second quarter as cash releasing spreads increased by considerable 8.7% on $73 million of renewals, the largest increase within this category since the third quarter of 2019. Turning to our operating results. Our operating and financial performance in the second quarter was a bit better than our expectations highlighted by many of the same factors we highlighted last quarter. The continued improvement in our core operating performance, another record quarter of interconnection revenue and well-controlled expenses. In terms of earnings growth, we reported second quarter core FFO of $1.68 per share, 2% better versus the prior quarter and consensus expectations. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was $1.69 per share relative to the $1.72 we reported in the second quarter of 2022. Total revenue was up 20% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year revenue growth was impacted by both the inclusion of Teraco this year and the significant volatility in utility costs and reimbursements, particularly in Europe over the past 12 months. Most of these energy costs are directly passed through to our customers. Excluding utility reimbursements, total revenue was up 12% year-over-year. Critically, our rental revenues in the second quarter included a $25 million onetime write-off of noncash straight-line rent and the $6 million bad debt reserve related to a tenant that declared bankruptcy during the quarter. We also wrote off $3 million of noncash straight line rent related to the re-leasing opportunity we executed in Northern Virginia. These write-offs of noncash straight-line rent of approximately $28 million combined are excluded from core FFO per share. Interconnection revenue was at a record level in the quarter, increasing by 12% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Excluding Teraco, interconnection revenue was up 8% year-over-year, reflecting the ongoing organic strength in our core footprint. Bookings were higher in all three regions and ServiceFabric activations doubled in the quarter. Other than utility costs, expenses were well contained as rental property operating expenses and insurance were both flat sequentially, resulting in adjusted EBITDA growth of 14% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Improvement in our stabilized same capital operating performance continued in the second quarter, with year-over-year cash NOI up 5.6% and 1.7% sequentially. This marked the strongest year-over-year growth in our same capital pool since 2014, demonstrating the turn and fundamentals that we have been highlighting. The improvement was driven by an 80 basis point increase in occupancy as commencements outpace churn with upside from rent escalators and stronger-than-expected releasing spreads. While we're very encouraged by the improvement we've seen to date in this metric and the trend does indeed appear to be our friend, our enthusiasm for the second half of 2023 is tempered by the uncertainty related to a recent customer bankruptcy filing. We expect to know more about the potential impact by the time we report third quarter results. Turning to the balance sheet. As Andy outlined in his remarks, as of this week, we are meaningfully ahead of the funding plan that we laid out for you in February. We have already closed an approximately $2.2 billion of asset sales and stabilized joint ventures and expect to make additional progress on development joint ventures in the second half of this year. Specifically, earlier in July, we closed on the sale of a 65% interest in two stabilized hyperscale data centers on our Chicago campus, raising $743 million of gross proceeds. And as announced this afternoon, we sold an 80% interest in three stabilized hyperscale data centers on our Ashburn campus, raising another $1.3 billion of gross proceeds. Including proceeds from the sale of the noncore asset in Texas, we announced last month, we've raised over $2 billion in capital at a blended average cap rate of just over 6% so far this year. In addition to this capital recycling activity, during the second quarter we raised $1.1 billion of proceeds from the sale of 11 million shares of equity under our ATM. Included in this total was approximately 3.5 million shares or $335 million that was structured as forward equity issuance. These shares were settled earlier this week. Our reported leverage ratio at the quarter end was 6.8 times, while fixed charge coverage was 4.2 times. Pro forma for the JV transactions and the settlement of the forward equity outstanding at quarter end leverage was 6.3 times, putting us on track toward our near 6 time target by year-end. Moving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is nearly five years and our weighted average interest rate is 2.7%. Approximately 84% of our debt is non-US dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Approximately 83% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have minimal near-term debt maturities with only $100 million maturing during the rest of this year and a well-laddered maturity schedule throughout the out years. Lastly, let's turn to our guidance. We are affirming our full year revenue guidance range of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.7 billion at the midpoint as the recent acceleration in capital recycling has been balanced by better-than-expected releasing spreads and same capital cash NOI. We are, however, adjusting our core FFO and constant currency core FFO per share guidance ranges for the full year 2023 by $0.10 per share to a new range of [6.55 to 6.65] (ph) to reflect the following: $0.03 per share tied to the acceleration of our funding plan, including greater-than-expected stabilized joint venture sales and over $1 billion of equity issuance. $0.05 to $0.07 per share for the write-off of unpaid rent and additional near-term uncertainty related to recent customer bankruptcy and about $0.01 per share of lower noncash straight-line rent tied to the opportunistic termination and releasing in Northern Virginia. Given the continued progress on the turn in our fundamentals during the quarter, we are also updating the organic operating metrics supporting our full year guidance, including cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads moving up to greater than 4% and greater than 8%, respectively. An increase in our same capital cash NOI growth guidance by 100 basis points to a revised range of 4% to 5% despite the potential impact of the customer bankruptcy this quarter, partly balanced by a reduction in our year-end portfolio occupancy assumption to 84% to 85%, largely reflecting the greater than anticipated sales of stabilized hyperscale assets into joint ventures. Given the better-than-expected execution on our funding plan to date, we have also updated our guidance for dispositions in JV capital. We now expect total disposition in JV capital raised to fall within the range of our current $2.2 billion, up to $3 billion. We've also reduced the amount of long-term debt financing needed to support our full year funding plan, given the nearly $4 billion of liquidity currently available as a result of asset sales, JVs and ATM equity raised. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? Yeah, I might just add that, again this quarter we saw all of our greater than megawatt renewals were in positive territory, and that includes across all regions as well. Yes, sure. So just to be clear, the deal that you're -- that we're talking about here is not included in our renewal stats. What we are doing is showing just the net incremental revenue that we expect to recognize within our signing stats. And you'll see that more clearly when you look at Page 8 of our supplemental, in particular, in North America, the greater than a megawatt, you're going to see a deal -- you're going to see the 300 KW rate, and that's because we're only showing the incremental revenue and not the associated megawatts attached to it. If you put that deal in at, call it, 100%, you got 300 KW that would come down to 148KW. But again, it was a substantial uplift from the in-place lease. It was over 50% higher than what we had currently. Including, that would be our blended rate, if you look at Page 8 in our supplemental versus the 300KW, okay. Yes, so thanks Jon. There's a couple of aspects here, I think, are important. One to reiterate, as of today, we've got $4 billion of liquidity, thanks to the execution of the broader team. If you look at where our funding needs are going forward, this year based on looking at our life cycle, what's remaining to be spent, our guidance in terms of what's left to be spent, we're talking about somewhere in the [1.2 to 1.3] (ph) left to spend this year. So that gives us a pretty significant runway into 2024 to be able to fund the continued growth and opportunities that we see going forward. On top of that, as we also noted, we're not stopping in terms of the execution on asset sales as well as the potential that we're continuing to seek for development joint venture partners that will give us an even broader access to capital and be able to help us to fund not only some of that capital need into 2024, but also potentially this year as well, which rounds out into your question on leverage. We've made considerable progress again on that front as well. As I noted in the prepared remarks, you look at us on a pro forma basis, we're at 6.3% now. So made considerable progress on that. You layer on top of that our expected view of continuing to grow our EBITDA as we've left that guidance line unchanged, again, as well as continue to seek development joint venture partners that will continue to help us on that deleveraging process. So, we feel pretty good about progress to date on both liquidity and leverage. And I'll turn it over to Greg on the India JV topic. Yes. So I call out a couple of things. So first, I mean, we have been making what, I would say, is good to great progress so far. If you look at it versus last year, were up 80 basis points on our stabilized pool. We're going to continue, we think, to improve that over the course of this year into next year. And that's going to be a mix of essentially twofold, spaces where we believe that there's opportunity for larger customers. We're going to continue to target that given density requirements and the growing need for capacity across a global portfolio that we have, we're going to find opportunities to fill that in. But I think part of it and part of why it takes -- it's going to take a little bit more time to continue to improve the overall occupancy is that we're also looking where we can convert some of that space that we do have in the productized co-lo lease that over time because we see the growing need for enterprise demand and where we want to be able to capitalize that which is a higher return and a market that we want to be able to penetrate and grow even further from where we are today."

Just to revert back a bit on the overall pipeline dynamics we're seeing, I would say, describe it overall, the pipeline is strong, healthy and diverse across the board, particularly strong in the zero to one megawatt side and growing part of that AI is definitely a part of not just the hyperscale piece of the business, but also the zero to one megawatt, and we've had some strong contributions on that front. So overall, we really feel like both the results in the pipeline itself, the demand to be a testimony and validation really of our pivot to serving the entirety of the client needs, network, enterprise and hyperscalers. So I would say both on the AI front and frankly, the cloud and hybrid IT, we're seeing some really growing success and growing conversations with clients. So we remain optimistic and serving both the pervasive needs of clients as well as AI. And I think that's going to be a growing part of our portfolio as we move forward."

            "content": "Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Against the backdrop of an extraordinarily dynamic first half of the year, we have remained focused on advancing our strategic priorities and delivering on behalf of our 5,000 plus customers. Digital Realty made strong progress in the second quarter with improved operational results, progress on our funding plan and increased liquidity, continued organizational improvements, an increasing recognition of the critical role that data centers will play in support of both digital transformation and artificial intelligence. We posted sequential growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and CFFO per share, while improving development returns, bolstering liquidity and delevering the balance sheet. During the quarter, we made progress on each of the three key strategic priorities that I laid out earlier this year. First, we strengthened our customer value proposition by enhancing our communities of interest with more connectivity options, posting record double digit interconnection revenue growth and the second highest quarter of new logo additions in company history. Second, we innovated and integrated, delivering enhancements designed to support high performance compute, including AI by enabling data centers to support liquid cooling solutions, while also broadening our existing partnership with NVIDIA with the certification of our first DGx H100 ready data center and integrating with additional organizational enhancements design, deliver a consistent structure and experience, while leveraging data to improve our effectiveness and efficiency. Third, we access diverse capital sources during the quarter including the sale of a non-core asset in Texas at an attractive 4.4% cap rate and equity raised under our ATM. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we formed a stabilized hyperscale data center joint venture with a new private capital partner that acquired an interest in two facilities in Chicago. And today, we announced a similar joint venture transaction alongside a second new private capital partner for three stabilized hyperscale data centers in Northern Virginia. Just a little more than halfway through the year, we are now well ahead of the midpoint of our original funding plan for 2023 and we remain focused on putting Digital Realty's balance sheet into position to support the growing opportunity that lies ahead. The current state of the data center infrastructure landscape is very healthy. There is widespread demand for our data center capacity across various regions and products. However, there is limited new supply due to decreased power availability and tight financial conditions. The global expansion of Cloud Computing paired with continuous digital transformation of enterprises underscores the escalating importance of both data and AI in shaping demand. Presently, we are collaborating with numerous clients on AI focused requests for proposals and implementations. The initial surge is anticipated in power intensive training applications followed by a rise in inferencing applications including access to private data sets, which are expected to necessitate enhanced performance and reduce latency. Additionally, the integral nature of these models is necessitating larger capacity blocks which align seamlessly with our extensive product suite. As the global meeting place for data exchange and a full spectrum provider of data center solutions, Digital Realty stands at a strategic vantage point. This allows us to cater to the needs of enterprises, facilitating their efficient integration of AI applications within their digital transformation journeys. In the second quarter, we unveiled Data Gravity Index 2.0, which represents our extended commitment to data science. This tool is designed to access the effects of enterprise data generation and consumption in both public clouds and private data centers, offering enterprises a framework to manage and drive insights from their data. Moreover, our innovative approaches in Data Gravity and comprehensive data center architecture were recognized as we secured a patent for these. Our patent further offers enterprises a roadmap to ensure their architectures remain relevant in the future. The evidence is clear, we have shifted from a physical economy to a digital economy, which now is entering a new form, the data economy. Our research shows that the surge in server demand can be attributed to the rising needs of both public and private cloud infrastructure, further augmented by AI training and inference processes. At the same time, demand for storage devices is poised to grow due to data regulation. Let's move to our second quarter results. This quarter continued the inflection in the fundamental recovery we've been highlighting in our core portfolio over the past several quarters. Our pipeline remains strong during the quarter, helping to drive a sequential rebound in leasing volume but also supporting strong pricing with releasing spreads positive again across all product types and in all regions. New leasing during the quarter was $114 million with continued strength in the zero to one megawatt plus interconnection leasing, which represented 43% of total signings. Greater than a megawatt increased by over 60% sequentially, led by one of our strongest quarters ever in EMEA. Strong demand trends and reduced availability along with growing recognition of our value proposition continue to be supportive of pricing, and are enhancing our expected returns. In the second quarter, we saw releasing spreads climbed to nearly 7% on a cash basis, helping to drive the best same capital cash NOI growth that we've seen since I joined Digital Realty in 2015. During the second quarter, churn remained low at 1.5% and we added 133 new customers, our second best quarter ever and a nice continuation of the 100 plus new logo streak we have going. This is a strong validation of the stability of enterprise IT spend and digital transformation that we are seeing and of the value that customers recognize in platform digital. Our key wins included an innovative sustainability oriented infrastructure provider that tasked into stranded energy to support module edge compute sites chose Digital Realty for AI applications, utilizing Platform Digital's network control and data hub solutions. Data intensive workloads are being deployed on Platform Digital by a major US federal agency to reduce costs and improve sustainability, while interconnecting with their key ecosystem partners. A leading European bank chose Platform Digital to help simplify and secure their hybrid IT strategy in compliance with data sovereignty regulations, while leveraging the available cloud connectivity. A Fortune 500 quick serve restaurant chain is updating their internal infrastructure on Platform Digital to improve reliability and security, support existing systems and connect with [P Cloud] (ph) to support the strong growth of their e-commerce business. A global 2000 Pharmaceuticals sourcing and distribution services company is expanding to a new [indiscernible] Platform Digital to ensure global data governance compliance. And a global 2000 Auto Manufacture chose Platform Digital to upgrade their network architecture in Central Europe by adding key points of presence for the largest and most important production centers. Moving over to our largest market, Northern Virginia. In the years since we learned that the power constraints in this market will continue to work constructively with the power provider to confirm the commitments that we've made to our customers and to provide growth capacity for our customers through new development and select churn opportunities. Over the course of last several months with the support of our local utility partners, we've been able to identify nearly 100 megawatts of incremental billable capacity that we expect to be able to bring to market prior to 2026. This includes 40 megawatts of available capacity underway within the current development pipeline and the potential to move forward on almost another 60 megawatts. In addition to this Ashburn focus capacity, we've made meaningful progress on our 192 megawatt development site in Manassas which is now nearly in position to begin development. We are optimistic about the near term potential to offer this availability to our customers. Moving on to our investment activity. As we outlined in February, 2023 was poised to be an active year for our investments team and some of the fruit of their labor has been harvested since our last call. During the second quarter, we acquired the land and shell associated with the previously leased data center in Amsterdam, where we previously held a lease hold interest for $18 million. In a separate future proofing transaction, we purchased additional land adjacent to our highly connected Schiphol campus in Amsterdam, which could support another 40 megawatts of potential IT load providing ample runway for both enterprise and service provider growth. We also closed on first non-core disposition of the year in mid-May at a 4.4% cap rate resulting in $150 million of net proceeds to Digital Realty. This facility was previously leased as a power to shell and was sold to one of its primary occupants. In July, we saw a significant acceleration in our capital recycling initiatives, closing on two separate stabilized hyperscale joint ventures in Chicago and Ashburn. These deals were executed at just over 6% cash cap rate on average and raised more than $2 billion of net proceeds for Digital Realty. These transactions are an important validation of our current strategy as we remain focused on delivering shareholder value through the development of new data centers at double digit unlevered returns and the monetization of stabilized hyperscale assets at a premium. But equally as important, we've substantially bolstered and diversified our sources of private capital so that we can execute on the opportunity that lies ahead without being overly reliant on any individual avenue of capital while also increasing the efficiency of our balance sheet. While we've had remarkable traction on these transactions and all due credit goes to Greg Wright, his top-notch team and the rest of our platform for executing through a tumultuous capital markets environment, we are not resting on our laurels. We are well ahead of our plan on our stabilized hyper sale joint venture plan, but we see ample demand for the hyperscale development joint venture bucket that we have previously discussed and we'll provide updates as appropriate. Before moving on, I'm also delighted to welcome [indiscernible] Reliance Industries Company as our newest partner to our joint venture in India. The expanded partnership builds on the strong foundation laid by [BAM] (ph) Digital Realty, through the addition of Jio's massive digital connectivity ecosystem and strong enterprise relationships with 80% of large private enterprises in India. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the quarter. During the second quarter, we issued our fifth annual ESG report outlining our initiatives for 2022. The report highlights the progress we have made toward our science-based targets, commitment to reduce our global carbon emission by 68% by 2030. We've enabled our success by contracting for renewable energy wherever possible so that we have 1 gigawatt of solar and wind energy under contract in the US. This has enabled us to match 126 of our data centers with 100% renewable energy. In the second quarter, we also received a certificate of adherence from the climate neutral data center pack. As a founding member of the pack, Digital Realty worked with independent auditors to certify that we are on track to meet the overarching goal of the pack for the industry to become climate neutral by 2030. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment, while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier. Hey thanks, Alex. Appreciate the kind words. I'm going to turn it to Greg to call speak to where we're going next in terms of capital raising on development JVs, maybe tie in what's happened back half of this year into 2024. And I can pick up on the core portfolio. Thanks, Alex. I think for your second question was about, call it, the core operating results we saw in the quarter year-to-date and how -- what we see in the back of the year, if I'm correct. We're certainly pleased on multiple fronts on the value proposition and pricing power coming through. We saw that in our new lease signings and ROIs as well as our cash mark-to-market and which flow through to our same-store growth. We had a quite strong quarter on those stats, and you saw that we updated our guidance for the full year. So as of right now, we think that these trends on the cash mark-to-markets and pricing power will continue into the back half of 2023. Thanks, John. So, I'll walk through the dynamics, I'll let Matt quote that -- the actual rate on the new deal to give you a sense of the market. I mean this is obviously a market that is very tight on supply and we we've been working with our installed customer base, if anyone had capacity that was idle or they didn't see -- have near-term need for. So hence, we were able to take back capacity from a customer since we let them out of a contract and that contract was signed, call it, a year ago at a much lower rate. And we were able to help a different customer that had immediate needs and we're able to sign that at a much higher rate. But Matt, why don't you walk through the stats? So, John, the NOVA market, the facts, I would say, remain the same in terms of transmission lines and arrival of utility power, which has really created an environment of demand well outpacing supply. We are, I'd say, less right now focused on signings that don't commence until 2026 based on the uncertainty of when in 2026 exactly that power rise. And quite honestly, making sure that we're maximizing the opportunity at hand for us. That market has seen dramatic price improvement. We've signed deals in the larger categories, call it, 140 or north of that per kilowatt. Again, that market was in the 70s, not so long ago. And the good news, as we reported, given our breadth and history in that market, we've been able to work with our utility provider and really cobble together incremental growth capacity for our customers across our campuses. If you add them all up, prior to the 2026 arrival, call it, by 2025, if not sooner, you're approaching, call it, 100 megawatts of growth capacity in Ashburn, which is in addition to our growth capacity that we have in Manassas. So, I can tell you, we didn't sign any 100 megawatt deals in this quarter. We are certainly around some of these opportunities. We're very focused on, call it, maximizing our footprint for its highest and best use in helping our customers the best way we can. Some of those deals obviously have led itself towards the AI domain for trading models, the need that large scales of contiguous capacity. I can tell you look at our footprint. We have extensive locations around the globe that we can help those types of customers. We are -- we've made great progress both in our capital sources, as you saw just in literally the month of July, really got back into firmer footing to support our customers' growth. Adding to that a development partner, I think we'll put even more fuel on fire to support that growth. So, I think when it comes to bigger and bigger deals, we got to make sure that they land in the right locations for Digital Realty and make sure we're maximizing the opportunity in terms of our -- what I call is really precious capacity in our land bank, in our sales and in our inventory runway. Thanks, Michael. I think Jordan is -- can see the future because, we thought he was going to ask this question. But honestly, we haven't been thinking about that because we've been raising the bar and demand has been outpacing the supply where anything that even kind of feels skinny or close to not just reaching our cost of capital is not made it on to where we're investing our dollars. And you can see that in our development life cycle where you have the whole schedule of the 377 plus megawatts underway, north of 10% ROI. That includes the Americas region, North America that, call it, 9% and still weighted down by projects that were, call it, open book yield on cost projects, almost legacy in vain that is weighting down those averages. I can tell you these opportunities we're seeing even for larger capacity blocks in these tight markets, be it Northern Virginia, be it Singapore, be it Frankfurt or elsewhere, we're certainly into the double digits unlevered ROIs, which I think that well exceeds the risk-adjusted of deploying capital and it really is coming down more to supply/demand dynamics than just, call it, premiums. And I think if you look at the great work our investments team did on transacting on some of these JVs and the new partners we brought in the fold and called the six-ish cap area I think you're seeing a lot of value creation in our model. Matt can speak to the funding in our sources and uses in the guidance and leverage, and then Chris and I can [indiscernible] the India piece? Sure. Appreciate it, Jon. Just to further jump into that. Yes, interconnection, I think, is something that's evolving rather quickly. I think artificial intelligence is definitely evolving, and it's in its early stages to date. I think where we've been watching and what I think has shown through and we referenced in the prepared remarks is the fact that it's the highest five year growth, two straight quarters surpassing $100 million. I think that's very unique to us and the platform that we represent in the market. I would also say that some of the activities that we've been doing around ServiceFabric, which quite frankly, is tailored to streamlining the technical kind of barriers that have been placed upon the customers to access all of these destinations where data resides, which at the core of artificial intelligence, where I think your question is at, you have to have access to data. And so, being able to be a part of one of the largest open platforms that quite frankly, allows customers to access these data oceans of both public and private deployments. I think the platform is starting to pay off. And I would say that, again, early innings with AI, but we're very excited about what that demand is going to represent inside of our portfolio. And as we evolved and we're stable stay of what we did in the foundation of cloud, you'll see us be able to be at a steady state with a lot of these customers evolving AI as well. David, just to add on to the last question, and I could [indiscernible] the second part of your question. The -- I think there's been -- our balance sheet today has, call it, north of 3 gigawatts of growth capacity around the world. And we see that expanding and having the balance sheet to be help funded alongside some great partners is another part of becoming more efficient and more quickly driving returns and results to our bottom lines. In a market and an opportunity backdrop that keeps getting bigger, it was large to begin with, cloud computing accelerated that with hyperscale demand. And AI is just an incremental lift to this wave of demand. Hence, we believe the best way to tackle this opportunity and support our customers while driving results to the bottom line is in partnerships on the capital front. When it comes to the customer bankruptcy, obviously, this customer is in the middle of bankruptcies so can't share too much. The typical playbook is the creditors essentially have to run a process for the assets or the business. And as part of that, make decisions on either accepting or rejecting leases. We have not, to date, had any leases rejected so far. While they have rejected other providers or landlord leases, I don't think you can assume that every one of our leases despite that fact will be accepted. But from a strategic lens, this is why years ago we increased our capabilities and be able to expand in the colocation interconnection offering and support end customers. So when -- if and when we sell to customers would have issues, we can essentially step in and support the end customers and have adequate financial outcomes and the [indiscernible] capabilities. So that there's a little bit of wait and see as this customer works its way through bankruptcy, and I think we'll have more to report by the third quarter call. Sure. I mean hyperscale is still a large piece of our business in terms of our installed base and certainly a lot of what's going into our current development pipeline as it stands. I think in conjunction with the creation of Digital Core REIT, we came to an estimation of, call it, $15 billion of value as a round ballpark in terms of things that would fit the bill essentially -- similar to the transactions we just announced in the month of July, fully stabilized, hyperscale-oriented long-weighted average lease length. Honestly, core assets parts of our campus, but the slowest organic growers of our portfolio. Less interconnection-rich, less customer rich. I think the more recent portfolios. We've sold, call it, 10 plus or minus customers in them. We're supporting 5,000 customers here in Digital Realty. So we still think that there's an opportunity to continue to build on these partnerships like the great partnerships we just announced. And essentially, be able to maintain 100% ownership of the highest growing pieces of our puzzle. When it comes to the same-store growth, Matt, why don't you pick that up in terms of the levers that we've been pushing hard to drive that? So on the first one on Singapore, I mean, I think what you're seeing is, supply still to get metered out at very small and rational clips. When after the years of no supply, the big unveiling is literally four different players getting 20-megawatt increments is relatively modest. I mean our latest data center build in that market was, I think, almost double that size of a need. So -- and this is not only happening with Singapore. You're seeing power constraints, be it from transmission or generation, moratoriums, broader [indiscernible], environmental concerns, just ratcheting and making the supply constraints to be more rational. That's why we're quite pleased that we have on our balance sheet, a long runway of growth for our customers with our campuses across 50-plus metros on six continents and the supply chain to support their growth. And this is all against a backdrop where the demand is outpacing the supply. Greg, do you want to reiterate where we go next on the capital recycling? Hi, Irvin, that's a great question. I'm going to turn it over to our CRO, who really grabbed the baton and ran through the finish line strong, Colin McLean, to talk to what we saw on the AI front and maybe just give a little bit more color on the quarter in terms of bookings and new customers. The -- I would, Irvin [indiscernible] continuation of the commentary that we've been saying now for several quarters and that the pendulum on supply-demand fundamentals has been, call it, winded our back and growing. Our value proposition with our customers has been more and more well received. That's from our installed base who's been growing with us. Majority of our signings were from the existing customer base. That's also from -- I think it was our second highest new logo quarter of 133 new logos or new customers. And that has been broad-based, as Matt mentioned, across regions and product types. In the less than a megawatt category, it's been more steady [indiscernible] but obviously inflecting, call it, like-for-like increases. And on the greater than megawatt, it's been a little bit more volatile but in a positive fashion. As demand has remained intact, if not further increased and precious large capacity blocks have become fewer far between and the future of that supply bottlenecks really changing course does not seem to be near term whatsoever. Thank you, Andrea. Digital Realty had a strong second quarter. Our results demonstrate that our meeting place value proposition is resonating with customers. Just since our last call, we raised over $3 billion of new capital, positioning the company for the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead. We posted strong organic operating results with the results confirming the continued inflection in our core data center business. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and recognize our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world turning. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty\u2019s Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you, operator. And welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty\u2019s First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today\u2019s call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call, and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today\u2019s call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain certain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our first quarter. First, our customer value proposition is resonating as we delivered yet another strong quarter of nearly $50 million of leasing in our zero to one plus interconnection segment, including our second strongest quarter of bookings in EMEA and record interconnection bookings, helping to push interconnection revenue over $100 million in the quarter for the first time. Second, the first quarter delivered on the inflection and fundamentals we have guided to for 2023 as demonstrated by 4.5% re-leasing spreads on renewals and a 3.4% increase in stabilized portfolio cash NOI growth. And, third, we remain confident in our funding plan for 2023. We are deeply engaged in the process with multiple institutional buyers, including new and existing partners and we\u2019ll update you on specifics once we finalize the transactions. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.\nAndy Power: Thanks, Jordan. Thanks to everyone for joining our call. Digital Realty remained focused on our customers and executing our strategic plan while delivering a strong first quarter despite global uncertainty. This included reaching another major milestone with our platform now supporting 5,000 customers worldwide. We posted strong sequential growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, and remained focused on disciplined capital allocation, while benefiting from strong secular trends supporting the data center industry. Last quarter, I identified strengthening our customer value proposition as one of our key strategic priorities. Let me expand on this a bit. Digital Realty has been on a journey since 2015 when we acquired Telx to expand our product offering and global footprint in order to provide the full spectrum of data center solutions to our customers. At the time, we said that we were seeking to expand our product mix and presence in the attractive colocation and interconnection space. When we announced that deal, our annual colocation revenues were about $88 million, which is less than the bookings we posted in the last two quarters in the zero to one megawatt plus interconnection segment. Since 2015, we\u2019ve expanded our colocation and connectivity capabilities, both organically and through acquisitions, including the [indiscernible] portfolio, Interxion, the Westin Building, Altus IT, Lambda Helix, Medallion and Teraco. Today, our 0-1 megawatt segment revenues are well over $1 billion and represent 35% of total annualized rent, including a few colo and connectivity oriented organic new market additions that are currently underway and other important subsea cable landing station oriented to facilities, we expect to soon have a presence in more than 30 countries across six continents. Importantly, according to Cloudscene\u2019s H2, 2022 Data Center Ecosystem Leaderboard Results, which ranks operators based on their data center footprint and performance with a focus on service providers and cloud owners within their ecosystem, Digital Realty ranked in the top two slots within North America Europe and LATAM are taking the top spot in the Middle East and Africa region. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve also shed noncore assets, recycled capital out of stabilized core assets and created joint ventures with some of the leading institutions around the world to own, operate and develop data centers. Along the way, we\u2019ve added connectivity-related product capabilities, such as Service Exchange, Cloud Connect, and last summer, ServiceFabric, while targeting to the additions of cloud owners in our data centers around the world. These initiatives have meaningfully improved our customer value propositions and bolstered our results within the colo and connectivity segment. Since the end of 2015, our interconnection revenue has grown nearly 150%, while our colo and connectivity bookings have increased almost 400%. We now have 214,000 cross connects across our portfolio, an increase of over 250% over the same period. But there is more to do. Our vision is to serve our large and growing customer base that is focused on digital transformation and empowering their business through technological advancements at global scale today, tomorrow and for years to come. To do that, we serve as the meeting place offering the full spectrum of data center solutions globally, enabling our customers with a colo capacity and connectivity solutions needed to support their hybrid multi-cloud deployments and also providing line of sight to future availability of scale capacity and infrastructure advancements. Consistent with our strategic priority to strengthen our customer value proposition, we are pleased to announce the hiring of Steve Smith as Managing Director of our Americas region. Steve joins us following nearly eight years at CoreSite, where he most recently served as Chief Revenue Officer. Steve\u2019s experienced expertise within the colo and connectivity segment in the U.S. will be invaluable as we look to accelerate and enhance the offering in our largest market. We welcome Steve and the team, and look forward to an upcoming start in July. Let\u2019s move to our first quarter results. This quarter marks an important inflection in the fundamental recovery we have been anticipating in our core portfolio, as re-leasing spreads were positive across all products and in all regions, and scheduled price escalations translated into a positive inflection in our stabilized same capital portfolio growth year-over-year. New leasing during the quarter was $83 million, led by a strong 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection leasing, representing 57% of total signings, helped by the best quarter of interconnection science in company history. We continue to over-index towards CPI-based escalators within our new leases with over 40% of the new signed leases in the quarter containing inflation length increases with fixed rate escalators on the balance. During the first quarter, churn remained low at 1.1%, and we added 122 new customers, continuing with the strength of 100 plus new logos that we\u2019ve added each quarter since closing the Interxion transaction. Our key wins included a Global 500 pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services company, who are exiting their legacy data centers and expanding on platform digital to ensure European data governance and compliance; a Global 2000 insurance provider, doing a campus migration from a competing provider. A key differentiator for this new customer was improved resilience over the incumbent provider, together with robust multi-cloud connectivity and expansion capabilities. One of the largest public power companies in the U.S. and a new logo for Digital Realty is leveraging PlatformDIGITAL to modernize its infrastructure with network and control hubs. This company is modernizing its infrastructure to embrace AI, improve analytics, and provide data to its B2B customers. One of the largest financial services firms is building a new trading platform with Digital Realty, driving an entirely new ecosystem to capture global trading as it happens. Their requirements include low latency and high performance. One of the largest global retailers also joined PlatformDIGITAL to support its local business presence, diversified transit nodes and rearchitect their network topology. Moving over to the power transmission issue in our largest market, Northern Virginia. We\u2019ve continued to work constructively with the power divider in this market. And last quarter, we were pleased to be able to confirm the commitments that we have made to our customers. While the overarching conditions in this market have changed, we continue to work in partnership with the local providers to maximize potential availability within our 500-plus megawatt footprint. And we remain cautiously optimistic that we uniquely will be able to provide growth capacity for our customers in this market through new development and select churn opportunities. For now, Ashburn remains highly constrained and pricing is reflecting the decreased availability of data center capacity. Moving on to our investment activity. During the first quarter, we acquired a 3-acre parcel land in Osaka, Japan, through our MC Digital Realty joint venture to support future development. We also monetized the 10% interest in the data center in Ashburn, Virginia, in the quarter alongside our joint venture partner. While the transaction was driven by our partner and is not a meaningful component of our capital recycling plan for 2023, it did indeed demonstrate the appetite for well-located data centers and strong valuations. This asset was sold at a valuation of nearly $17 million per megawatt which represents a substantial premium to our development cost today for new data centers in this market and significant value creation. Given the ongoing process that we are undertaking to bolster our capital sources and increase the efficiency of our balance sheet, we remain confident in the institutional appetite to invest in data centers. Notably, over the course of the last few weeks, we have seen the announcement of the sale of a European hyperscale data center platform to a well-known global institutional investor on multiples that are consistent with where similar platforms have traded over the last few years. And we have witnessed the recapitalization of another data center platform by other institutional investors. We know that investors are eager to hear updates on our progress, and we will provide those once we have a transaction to announce. Since our IPO in 2004, concerns have been periodically raised about various potential risks to data centers, including technology, customers, demand, supply and obsolescence. This is somewhat par for the course for a relatively nascent and growing asset class. Over the last year or so, we have witnessed the latest misinformation campaign cast upon the data center sector by those interested in seeing the price of our stock goes down. I\u2019d like to clarify a few important points. First, we operate a global portfolio of carrier-neutral and cloud-neutral data centers to facilitate communication and the exchange of information and data among and between enterprises, service providers and individuals all over the world. While we are focused on building what we call the meeting place for service providers and enterprise customers who are in pursuit of hybrid multi-cloud end-state IT architectures. We are also facilitating the connectivity and communities of interest supporting latency-sensitive applications and platforms. These are things that cannot happen in a stand-alone on-prem data center and aren\u2019t serviceable by a single cloud service provider. Second, in contrast to the narrative that hyperscalers have forced prices lower, after a few years of negative same-store growth, the tide is turned. As the supply of data center capacity in the low-cost abundant capital environment that exists for much [indiscernible] 10 years, has slowed meaningfully now that rates are higher and capital is more precious. With continued robust demand, strong net absorption has driven vacancy lower, which has been supportive of data center rents. Accordingly, our releasing spreads have inflected positively as have our same capital core growth metrics. Our team delivered on our objectives in the first quarter, and we reiterate the recoveries we anticipate for these metrics for 2023. Lastly, despite claims almost a year ago that hyperscalers would soon resource their data center requirements, 2022 was a record leasing year for Digital Realty, partly driven by demand from hyperscale customers. We believe the demand from these and other customers within our pipeline, driven by digital transformation and soon artificial intelligence remains robust. Data center support the growth and evolution of technology that is improving our standard of living, productivity and the overall quality of our lives. We have now witnessed a meaningful and sustained pullback in demand in the nearly 20 years that we\u2019ve been in business, and we are not seeing a pullback today. While an economic recession could slow capital spending, third-party data centers also benefit from the trend towards outsourcing. Customers often make the decision to lease rather than build on the availability of capital titans [ph]. We saw the same thing during the great financial crisis. For many of our customers, data centers can also help drive revenue growth will facilitate lower costs or even enhance overall productivity. We are optimistic that our business will remain resilient in 2023 and for years to come. Before turning it over to Matt, I\u2019d like to touch on our ESG progress during the quarter. During the first quarter, a leading ESG ratings provider included Digital Realty in their 2023 top-rated ESG company list, noting that we are in the top 6.5% of companies in the U.S. and Canada region. In addition, Digital Realty continues its efforts to incorporate renewable energy resources. We were named by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as one of the EPA\u2019s Top 25 Green Power Partners. We furthered our commitment to sustainability by signing a 10-year power purchase agreement for 116-megawatt share of a new solar project in Germany to increase our total solar and wind power under contract to over 1 gigawatt of renewable capacity. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced additional renewable to support our portfolio in Australia, while our business in Japan also announced renewable procurement for a portion of its portfolio. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.\nMatt Mercier: Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our first quarter results. We signed a total of $83 million of new leases in the first quarter, highlighted by a second consecutive quarterly record in interconnection signings and continued strength in the 0-1 megawatt category, particularly in EMEA, which nearly matched the record level from last quarter. 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection accounted for a robust 57% of total bookings. Our greater than a megawatt bookings moderated to $35 million in the quarter. Though this activity was broadly dispersed throughout our global portfolio with leases signed in Toronto, the U.S., Mexico, Europe and South Africa, but nothing in Northern Virginia. These deals can be lumpy and the downtick in the greater than a megawatt leasing follows a record year in 2022, in which we signed more than $370 million and 288 megawatts of new leases. Importantly, our demand funnel remains quite strong as a number of our highly strategic customers remain actively engaged and are seeking to add capacity across our global portfolio. Of course, as we have discussed on the last few calls our largest scale market, Northern Virginia, is experiencing capacity constraints as a result of the power transmission issues that emerged last summer. Over the course of the last three years, including the second half of 2022 we signed approximately $20 million per quarter of new leases in Northern Virginia, versus $2.5 million of new leases signed in this market in 1Q 2023. As I\u2019ll expand on in a moment, we expect the ballast to lower new lease volume to show up in better pricing including renewal spreads. Turning to our backlog slide. The current backlog signed but not yet commenced leases was $434 million at quarter end, as commencements were once again well over $100 million, partly balanced by new leasing. We expect the remaining $200-plus million of commencements in 2023 to be somewhat evenly weighted throughout the balance of the year. The lag between signings and commencements in the quarter was 16 months, principally due to a few larger long-term leases that require buildouts. During the first quarter, we signed $155 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 4.5% on a cash basis, our strongest renewal pricing quarter since the early days of the pandemic. The strength was shared across both products and also across our three regions. So we\u2019re off to a good start relative to our full year 2023 guidance. Renewal spreads in the 0-1 megawatt category continued accelerating up 4.6% in the first quarter on $118 million of volume, nearly 400 basis points faster than it was in the final quarter of 2021, but also more than 100 basis points better than full year 2022. Greater than a megawatt renewals were similarly strong in the first quarter, as cash re-leasing spreads increased by 4.4% on $30 million of renewals. We were also pleased to see 100% of the leases signed in the quarter roll up in this category, and we remain optimistic about the potential for the rest of this year. Turning to our operating results. Our performance in the first quarter was a bit better than our expectations, highlighted by the continued improvement in our core operating performance, higher development returns and a record quarter in interconnection revenue. In terms of earnings growth, we reported first quarter core FFO of $1.66 per share, $0.01 better versus prior quarter and a $0.01 light relative to last year. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was $1.69 per share relative to the $1.67 we reported in the first quarter of 2022. Total revenue was up 19% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. As discussed on the last call, this revenue growth is somewhat distorted due to the significant increases in utility costs and reimbursements as the impact of last year\u2019s energy price increases went into full effect in January. As most of you understand, the large majority of energy costs are directly passed through to our customers. Excluding utility reimbursements, total revenue was up 13% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, while reimbursements remained a relatively consistent percentage of utility expenses at 92%. Due to a decline in spot energy prices between the fourth and first quarters, our top line revenue including utility reimbursements from our customers was more than $40 million below our original forecast, but this was directly mirrored by lower-than-expected utility expenses, since these expenses are directly borne by our customers. Interconnection revenue was up 5% sequentially, reflecting the ongoing improvement in our core operating performance. Other than utilities, expenses were well contained as NOI margins, excluding utilities, remained steady, resulting in adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. On our last two calls, we\u2019ve highlighted the improvement in operating performance that started to emerge with our stabilized same capital portfolio, but was largely masked by FX headwinds. These positive trends strengthened further in the first quarter despite continued year-over-year currency headwinds. Same-capital cash NOI grew 3.4% in the first quarter compared to 1Q 2022, demonstrating the turn in our core operations that we have been discussing. The step-up was driven by a 90 basis point improvement in same-store occupancy as commencements outpace churn, upside from annual rent escalators and the benefit of positive re-leasing spreads. Turning to our currency slide, 51% of our first quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, with 25% in euros, 6% in British pounds, 5% in Singapore dollars, 3% in South African rand and 2% in each of the Brazilian real and Japanese yen. The weakening of the U.S. dollar in the first quarter provided a slight sequential tailwind, but the dollar\u2019s strength through much of 2022 resulted in a continued headwind to year-over-year results. As a result, the dollar strength negatively impacted our reported revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth by about 300 basis points apiece on a year-over-year basis, whereas core FFO per share saw just under 200 basis points headwind. Turning to the balance sheet. Our reported leverage ratio at quarter end was 7.1 times, while fixed charge coverage was 4.4 times. In January, we completed a $740 million two year term loan with an initial maturity date at March 31, 2025, plus a one year extension option and an effective rate of 5.6%. Leverage remains above our historical average and our long-term target, and we intend to reduce our leverage toward our long-term target over the course of 2023. Our plan hasn\u2019t changed. We are in active discussions on our asset sale and joint venture plans and remain confident in our ability to execute on these plans over the course of the year so that our leverage moves back towards the six times area by year-end. Our weighted average debt maturity is at five years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.8%. Approximately 82% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar-denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Over 80% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have minimal near-term debt maturities with only $100 million maturing in 2023, together with a well-laddered maturity schedule. Lastly, let\u2019s turn to our guidance. We are maintaining our core FFO and constant currency core FFO per share guidance ranges for the full year 2023 of $6.65 to $6.75. And our first quarter results were consistent with this range. We are also affirming our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.7 billion [ph] at the midpoint as the downward adjustment in our overall revenue guidance is purely due to lower utility expenses driven by lower spot electricity rates that are passed on directly to our customers. We are also modestly tweaking our year to U.S. dollar exchange rate expectations for the year to reflect the relative appreciation of the euro year-to-date. We also made meaningful progress on the turn in our fundamentals during the quarter, providing strong support to the organic operating metrics supporting our full year guidance, including cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads over 3%, same-capital cash NOI growth of 3% to 4% and year-end portfolio occupancy between 85% and 86%. As I mentioned a few moments ago, we remain confident in our funding plan for the year. So we have reiterated our guidance for dispositions and JV capital. We have tweaked our debt financing cost expectation to be consistent with the move in rate seen since the banking sector fall out last month, which will be largely mitigated by the upside we saw versus our core FFO expectation the first quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. \nNick Del Deo: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I want to drill into the greater than 1-megawatt leasing a bit. Obviously, that\u2019s been a bit below history in Q1, and you called out Ashburn as a driver of that. I guess, just thinking about some of the other drivers there, maybe can you expand upon the degree to which that was the result of making conscious decisions to maybe dial back a bit given the change in the cost of capital versus market conditions or other factors?\nAndy Power: Hey, thanks Nick. So I\u2019ll kick it off and I\u2019ll hand it to Corey. I would say there\u2019s no conscious decisions in dialing back or waving off business necessarily. You could see from our development life cycle, we\u2019ve continued to raise the bar on our most strategic projects and fine-tuned capital allocations. The \u2013 I\u2019d say it was a bit \u2013 it was a little bit lower than prior run rates. But if you look at the prior year, which was a record and had a record quarter in there in the third quarter, I wouldn\u2019t say \u2013 I think I won\u2019t over-index to anything other than call it the typical lumpiness you may have in that category. It was healthy in terms of pricing. I don\u2019t think we had a single deal pricing below $100 per kilowatt. But Corey, do you want to expand?\nCorey Dyer: Yes, I would tell you that \u2013 thanks, Nick. Nothing\u2019s fundamentally really changed our relationship or our position with these hyperscalers in the greater than 1 megawatt category. Coming off, as Andy mentioned, I think, Matt, maybe did in the prepared remarks a record year, and so I\u2019d tell you, this is probably just a one-quarter timing issue, our hyperscale demand remains really healthy and varies a little bit by customer, but it\u2019s broad-based across the globe. Keep in mind, we didn\u2019t do Ashburn deals on that this last quarter. And I\u2019d say that they\u2019re going through some digestion of their demand signals and maybe a little bit more scrutiny with the macro environment but really confident in the macro demand, our relationships to execute. And keep in mind; we had our highest and our largest connectivity quarter with the hyperscalers this last quarter. And so I just say that one quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend. I\u2019d suggest you look at the multi-quarter trends as well as they expand in new markets, new products like the advent of AI and their edge nodes that we\u2019re winning and just new deployments across the globe. We\u2019re in a really good position with them from a pipeline perspective and demand. Thanks, Nick.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you guys. And I guess, more generally, obviously, the price environment is pretty favorable for you right now. I guess, I\u2019m interested in your thoughts on how you\u2019re balancing between raising prices on new space and renewal deals where market conditions allow it versus kind of thinking holistically about your relationships with your top 10 or 15 or 20 customers you do business with globally, and trying not to alienate them or put the relationships.\nAndy Power: Yes, Nick. So \u2013 I mean, we all \u2013 we\u2019re always trying to take a holistic approach to these relationships. And as you see from our top customer list, our largest customers can be with 20, 30, 40, 50 different locations. At the same time, the pricing is dynamic to overall supply/demand dynamics. And as inventory in various markets become more and more precious, we\u2019ve seen that pendulum pricing move in our favor. We try to be straight shooters with the customer. We try to bring all the \u2013 everything to the table in a holistic fashion. We\u2019ve done this before in terms of bringing renewals and new business, expansions, all-in-one holistic approach. And I think this is not new. These are \u2013 these big hyperscale customers are seeing cost of doing business going up. Many of them self build themselves and see inflation in construction costs or labor. So I think the understanding that the pricing dynamic is shifting a little bit towards the providers is playing out in a natural fashion.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead. \nJonathan Atkin: Thanks. So on Corey\u2019s response about kind of the leasing volumes telling us to look at kind of the prior multi-quarter trend, curious about interconnection and the trends going forward given kind of the strength there. And any kind of mix shift that you could kind of point to there may be more how you\u2019re targeting your customers is a lot of that coming from existing logos or deserting your sales format to focus on interconnect-rich opportunities? And then, secondly, I guess, on the competitive front, given so many privately-backed companies that are deploying a lot of capital into the sector. Does that affect your hyperscale sales pipeline at all?\nAndy Power: Sure. Thanks, Jon. On the first question, make Sharp and I\u2019ll tag team that. I mean \u2013 I think I look at a few things. One, it\u2019s a holistic approach to these customers. There\u2019s a lot of good results in this quarter, whether it\u2019s the new logos, inflecting up 15% quarter-over-quarter, which was a high for several quarters, whether it was the overall interconnection plus less than a megawatt signings, the regional contributions, including a standout interconnection quarter. And I\u2019d also mention that this is a building momentum. It\u2019s been building over time for several quarters now. I think it\u2019s the power of the platform coming together, servicing our customers across 50-plus metros on six continents. It\u2019s the great work Corey team has done with the go-to-market. And I still would say that we got even further progress and even better results to deliver over time. This particular quarter did have I\u2019d say, a lumpier win, let\u2019s call it, put it into the number one category interaction interconnection signings. So I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s necessarily repeatable next quarter with another record. But some of the work that we\u2019re doing with service providers, I think Chris can touch on, I think it\u2019s going to continue to build that momentum. But Chris, pick it up from that, please?\nChris Sharp: Yes. Appreciate it, Andy. And thanks for the question, Jon. A couple of dynamics here where I think we\u2019ve led by our core existing products. And I think your direct question to, is it new logos or its existing, it\u2019s both, right? I really want to emphasize the fact that the physical cross connects reaching 214,000 and growing, it\u2019s something that we constantly have looked at and Andy referenced this earlier, growing the platform, right, investing and making sure that customers know how to access one another to get further value out of the deployment is absolutely important to us. And so just really watching how that evolves over time. And with the advent of the ServiceFabric and bringing that to market and what that\u2019s being able to do for our customers, we\u2019re just starting to see \u2013 it\u2019s early innings, but future growth on virtual, right, where it\u2019s going to be married to where now they\u2019re going to be able to access multiple destinations in a more simplistic fashion, because of that product being purpose built in the way that we brought it to market, it really removes a lot of the technical complexity that has precluded other customers from getting the full value out of the deployment. But one of the things I\u2019m just very pleased about is this customer-led and balanced approach that we\u2019ve been doing on even new markets inside of Europe. We\u2019ve talked about in the past where just bringing the value or the pricing closer to parity in some of these markets \u2013 we see really strong growth within Germany and France, where making sure that we\u2019re delivering those capabilities to those customers in all these critical markets around the globe. And I would just say lastly, I\u2019m pleased with the fact that Digital has been able to provide one of the greatest quarters of interconnection signings in the company\u2019s history, and that\u2019s just really representative of the value we\u2019re bringing to the customers.\nAndy Power: And then, Jon, just around your second question about call it competition from private back, one, that\u2019s not a new phenomenon. We\u2019ve been competing against private players for some time now and the ones that have been taken private they\u2019ve been private for, call it, multiple years for some of them. I think what\u2019s changed is the ability to deliver this business for our customers has just gotten harder and harder, and at a global scale. And whether it\u2019s power, constraints, staffing, supply chains \u2013 and certainly, cost and access to capital has certainly not been a friend of some of our competitors. And I think our largest customers in the hyperscale arena turn to us given our permanence in our space. We\u2019re not here, gone tomorrow, we\u2019ve invested for the long run, we\u2019re future-proofing that growth, we\u2019re constantly building for that growth with our suppliers and I think all those things probably make it leave a little bit more advantageous versus some of those private bank names in an environment like today.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJon Petersen: Great. Thank you. I was hoping if we could talk about the leverage target. You guys reiterated getting down to six times leverage, and I know you\u2019re working through these various transactions. But I guess if you complete the $2 billion of transactions. I, mean, does that get you to six times? Like, can you just give us the moving pieces on getting to that target?\nMatt Mercier: Yes, thanks. So I mean, the simple answer is, yes. So our capital plan, I think, as we laid out last quarter, and it really hasn\u2019t changed coming into this quarter, is based on, call it, $2-plus billion of capital recycling from our joint venture opportunities as well as the potential for noncore dispositions. And as that capital comes in as well as our expected growth in EBITDA this year, which is a little shy of 10%, we believe that by the end of the year, largely those two items will get us back towards that six times area this year.\nJon Petersen: Okay, great. And then if I could just ask on development. I\u2019m curious, given the shift in cost of capital, like what\u2019s the minimum development yield? Or maybe you just talk broadly about how much those requirements for you guys have moved in the last year or so? Like, what does it take for you guys to start a development today in terms of return expectations?\nAndy Power: Thanks, Jon. I mean, we do an incredibly granular market-by-market assessment here. So, it really depends on the market and the relative risk fee rates and risk premiums. I would just by and large, and this is not something that just showed up in our approach this quarter, three quarters ago almost, we basically took a posture that we need to raise the bar on capital allocation and prioritize our most strategic projects, call it, highest return, not only highest return, but also projects to generate the high long-term growth as well. So I don\u2019t have a single number answer to get \u2013 to give you there, but I think you will see that come through our development returns at table as those numbers are inching into higher territory, and I can tell you more strategic long-term growth projects.\nJon Petersen: Great. Thank you.\nAndy Power: Okay.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins : Thanks, and good afternoon. I wanted to go back to the capital recycling topic. And just when we look at the guidance page, there is a wide range of outcomes. And what would be a good outcome for Digital in terms of the yield? And what would the scenario be in which you may just decide there is alternative forms of capital that are better than recycling? And then just a second topic but related, if I could take a step back. As I think about the comments you\u2019ve made about considering both stabilized assets and development for monetization, just curious if there is a more profound change in the business strategy and financial model that investors should be mindful of in terms of how this business, over the next couple of years, might look different in terms of the quantum of investment in a given year and the level of financial performance that you\u2019re driving off of those investments, just following on the comments you just made. Thanks.\nAndy Power: So Mike, a good outcome is we essentially get the, call it, $2 billion of funding completed and the range is wide, but the majority of that capital, the range is not that wide. The wide range is due to some of the noncore asset sales as well as the development, which is, call it, 25% of the $2 billion, right? But if you look at the majority, the 75%, which is stabilized joint ventures or development, development, those were zero yielding projects. On stabilized joint ventures, I think, the cap rates are in the low single-digit type category based on what we\u2019re seeing called six-ish type territory. And I think that\u2019s based on not what we see externally by third-party transactions. What we\u2019ve seen on recent transactions with partners that we can recapitalize with our portfolio and through our progress on these capital recycling and joint venture efforts. Holistically, more longer term here, we are looking to become more balance sheet efficient. What\u2019s not new is, call it, finishing out the noncore dispose, what\u2019s not new is joint venturing majority states in stabilized hyperscale-oriented projects that have lower long-term growth rates due to the credit quality and size of the customers, be it through rent bumps or pricing power. What is new is sharing a piece of both of our North America and EMEA development as it relates to hyperscale projects. And we\u2019re doing that with a view that these projects keep getting larger, and larger and larger. That non-income producing drag it remains a headwind, even though it is a significant long-term value creation. And we believe there is ample partners to work with us on those projects which will ultimately make our balance sheet more efficient and more rapidly accelerate revenue and EBITDA drop into our bottom line.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Elias of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMichael Elias: Great, thanks for taking the questions here. I guess first, just to double-click on what you said about balance sheet efficiency. As it relates to the development JV, aside from recouping the previously spent CapEx, is the intention of that JV to structurally reduce the on-balance sheet CapEx for digital? Or is the intention to keep CapEx more or less the same while being able to increase the set of opportunities you can pursue? And then I have a follow-up.\nAndy Power: The simple answer, Michael, is we\u2019re looking to partner around large-scale development projects where there will be incremental spend that we and our partner will jointly fund over time. So that it will \u2013 we\u2019re looking for \u2013 these are large projects, large swaths of acreage, large quantities and megawatts. Hence, the quality of capital or spend is not the entirety or near the entirety of where the project ultimately will be over time. So they would fund alongside us through the coming quarters.\nMichael Elias: Okay. Maybe just to shift gears a little bit. Earlier on the call today, you\u2019re really emphasizing the steps you\u2019ve made on the colo/enterprise side. Today, you also announced the appointment of Steve Smith. Clearly a focus on accelerating colo and connectivity, I mean, my question for you would be, as we consider the path ahead, what are the changes that you feel need to be made internally in order for you to really accelerate on that, call it, 0 to 1 megawatt side? Thanks.\nAndy Power: So Michael, I mean, again, I think this ties back to the first three strategic priorities I laid out in the prior call about really strengthening \u2013 demonstrably strengthening our customer value proposition. We took advantage of this call to remind folks that this is not something we started with me becoming the CEO four months ago. This is something that\u2019s been in the works for roughly eight years through both inorganic and organic measures, putting together critical puzzle pieces, expanding across the globe in terms of where the customers need our capacity, adding connectivity hubs and innovating and bringing more to our customers, adding \u2013 we\u2019ve changed up our go-to-market motion over time. What we go from here is, again, accelerating from that success. A piece of that \u2013 delighted to have Steve Smith on board to lead our essentially newly created Americas region. Steve comes with a tremendous background of really driving the \u2013 one of the only U.S.-only focused interconnection and colo platforms in a prior \u2013 previously a very formidable competitor. And I think he\u2019s going to be very added to that our team, our leadership table. The incremental things that we\u2019re doing in terms of continuing to innovate and bring more value to our customers. Chris touched upon ServiceFabric, which I still would characterize as just out of the bar in terms of where we\u2019re going in terms of bringing more partners onto that platform, and drilling more value to our customers. We are \u2013 there\u2019s a whole host of things that I\u2019d say we\u2019re doing behind the scenes to continue to accelerate our growth. And I think the fruits of our labor are continuing to build each and every quarter in terms of success. So I think there\u2019s multiple angles that we are moving towards in that endeavor to be one of a very short list of global interconnection colo providers. And I think the industry demands and the broader competitive backdrop are also our wins at our sales.\nCorey Dyer: And then Andy, just one thing to add from a go-to-market perspective. We\u2019ve had a ton of success around the channel. We\u2019re continuing to grow the channel. I think this last quarter, 38% of our new logos were from the channel. Prior years, it was 31%. We\u2019re continuing to build on that success. We see the channel as being a huge advocate and a partner through their lens with all the enterprises. So we\u2019re going to see that continue to build. So we\u2019re doing a lot of functional and strategic operational items that we need to do. We\u2019re also continuing to tweak and evolve our go-to-market, we think it\u2019s going to continue to add value.\nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you. On the re-leasing spreads, thinking about greater than a megawatt in particular, but kind of with all of them, is there anything you see coming up in the year that could possibly push those spreads back negative by any large renegotiations? And then what is sort of the longer-term outlook with the bookings down a little bit, but pricing doing better, what sort of yield are we looking at going forward per se, you\u2019ve got in the last couple of years when the bookings were higher?\nAndy Power: I\u2019ll let Matt, take it off in re-leasing spreads and we can tag some longer term outlook pieces.\nMatt Mercier: Yes. So thanks, Frank. I think, one, first, I\u2019d reiterate, we\u2019re obviously off to a great start here with positive re-leasing spreads, again, not only across all product types, but across all regions. I will say, we\u2019re \u2013 we feel confident that this positive pricing environment that we\u2019re in is sustainable and it\u2019s here to stay. I\u2019m not going to necessarily speak about every single quarter. But again, I\u2019d come back and reiterate that we\u2019re off to a great start. We see \u2013 and we see that come for full year that we expect to be positive for the full year, not only in the 0 to 1 megawatt category but also in the greater than a megawatt category, which I think is, again, something we haven\u2019t seen in a few years. And reflects the positive environment and turn in fundamentals that we\u2019re seeing not only from that, but then down into our stabilized portfolio as well.\nAndy Power: Frank, do you want \u2013 do you mind repeating that second part of your question just to make sure we hear it correctly?\nFrank Louthan: Yes. I mean, leasings are down a little bit, obviously better pricing. What does the yield look like now per se, the last couple of years ago when bookings were higher and so forth? And how long do you think this is sustainable? What sort of yields are you seeing coming in now even though the absolute bookings are a little bit lower?\nAndy Power: Yes. Frank, I\u2019d direct you to our development table to follow, see the progression of yields. There\u2019s \u2013 I would say the yields are improving in our favor. The pricing dynamic is outpacing the inflationary pressures. It\u2019s not an overnight phenomenon, but we are moving into a better territory. I mean, you can look at episodic things like Ashburn, Virginia, where quite frankly, the rates have pretty much doubled in a pretty short time from deals in the, call it, low $70s to now call it, market rates of, call it, $140, and that\u2019s flowing to the bottom line and enhancing those deals dramatically. So I think that table is a work in progress in our sub because it\u2019s got a lot of pre-leasing, some of which was signed prior to some of this price progression. But as we continue to add more projects to that, that they are not pre-leased or we fill out the leasing on the available capacity, I think there\u2019s ability to raise those yields. And I would also say the North America piece of that has a large project in it that is an open book build-to-suit to a very highly rated financial institution on a triple net lease basis. So it\u2019s an apple to the oranges there in a good way. It\u2019s been dramatically derisked in terms of its build and in terms of its ongoing revenue and EBITDA stream at the same time, lowering our Americas yields.\nFrank Louthan: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Guarino of Green Street. Please go ahead.\nDavid Guarino: Andy, in the press release, you were quoted as saying that you\u2019re seeing broad-based demand and reduced data center availability. I was just wondering, why do you think that isn\u2019t translating into outsized growth in rental rates like we\u2019ve seen across other commercial real estate sectors like industrial or self-storage? And it definitely feels like the pendulum has firmly swung back to landlords, but data center rents just aren\u2019t rising like we\u2019ve seen elsewhere.\nAndy Power: I would say, I mean, it\u2019s a new phenomenon in terms of recent history of the data centers, which is still, I\u2019d call a nascent asset class, but we are seeing it. If you look at, call it, our less than a megawatt signings, either the Americas region or EMEA region where there\u2019s critical consistent massive new signings, the rates have been up, call it, four quarters in a row. And that example I gave you, in Ashburn, Virginia, from rates going from $70 plus E [ph] to $140 plus E. That is quite a run. And I know I\u2019m picking out one particular market there, an example, but it is the largest and most diverse market out there, our largest market as well. And it\u2019s flanks the East Coast with a power constraint problem, but the West Coast is having the same low with Santa Clara now having power constraints to likely outpace when power comes online in Virginia. And I think this phenomenon is going to continue in other parts of the world, not just the U.S. And I think you\u2019re going to continue to see those rates move more and more favor. David, I know you\u2019re a student of the traditional real estate asset classes. I mean, it was a good 20 years where industrial had no rate growth before it\u2019s had the renaissance that\u2019s been experienced in the last few years. And I\u2019m not saying that that\u2019s going to happen to data centers, but it feels like we\u2019re teeing ourselves up way for a healthier pricing environment for the incumbents.\nDavid Guarino: That\u2019s encouraging to hear. And then maybe kind of sticking with that theme, you said we\u2019ve been hearing some similar chatter also about difficulty securing power in some other markets. I\u2019ve heard Chicago come on the radar and possibly even Hillsboro now. So given just \u2013 it feels like these are popping up everywhere across the industry, what do you think that means for your pace of new leasing activity going forward? I mean, are the things we saw in the years past probably unlikely to happen just given the power constraints?\nAndy Power: Yes, if you look at our financials, we\u2019ve got a sizable amount of contiguous land capacity and available power that\u2019s committed to us outside of these, call it, zones of disruption. But longer term, eventually we will exhaust that and you could have that phenomenon. At the same time, when you\u2019re doing business at twice the rates, you have to sell half the kilowatts in certain markets. So, I\u2019m not sure that the top-line pacing on our new signings will be all that disrupted near term based on what we have in this table in terms of capabilities and estimated power. But I agree with you this assessment and it\u2019s going to continue. The other thing I\u2019d emphasize is, we\u2019re actively managing our platform and our capabilities, and we\u2019re essentially always looking to reproductize for higher, better use when applicable. So if we have churn, which this is not a totally static business, it provides opportunity to release that capacity at higher rate opportunities and often higher better uses towards some granular enterprise colocation oriented customers. And on a big company like digital, you probably don\u2019t see that. It\u2019s not top of the waves, but that\u2019s happening in terms of how we manage our footprint.\nDavid Guarino: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt Niknam: Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just two, if I could. First, on the capital recycling, not to beat a dead horse, but you did talk about being deeply engaged in the process. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any more color you can share on the progress made thus far across the different buckets that you\u2019ve laid out? And then maybe switching gears. On AI, I mean, we\u2019ve heard so much about this over the last several months. I\u2019m just wondering how the increased focus on AI impacted your customer leasing plans and your conversations with them as they think about deployment plans over the next year? Thanks.\nAndy Power: Thanks, Matt. I\u2019m going to have Greg tackle the first one and then Sharp and I can both tackle the second one.\nGreg Wright: Thanks, Matt. Look, I\u2019d say, look, with respect to our capital initiatives, I\u2019d say we\u2019re still on track with the plan we outlined in our earnings call in early February. But you should recall that was the $500 million of the noncore dispositions, call it, roughly $750 million from core JVs and $750 from million development JVs. And I would characterize it without saying too much, is that we\u2019re making good progress in these transactions. And we\u2019ve received significant interest from multiple institutional partners, whether it\u2019s sovereign wealth funds, infrastructure funds, PE, real estate funds, pension funds, insurance companies and the like. So the way I\u2019d characterize it is we\u2019re executing on plan. And we feel good about where we are into these processes.\nAndy Power: And turning to your second question \u2013 just one quick thing for I turn over to Chris GBT [ph] to give his view on AI. The \u2013 I think a misnomer here is that, in my opinion, that everyone thinks every data center is going to turn into one that\u2019s going to be supporting artificial intelligence. The use cases, the applications, the workloads that exist today are still going to be thriving within the global data center footprint and digital. Yes, we have many data centers that lend themselves towards supporting the increasing power densities and cooling environments that will be required, and we\u2019re doing a lot of that as we speak. But I look at more \u2013 the bigger picture around AI is that this is an incremental major wave of long-term demand that will certainly need to have proximity to the major data that sits today. And the first two waves of demand of moving from on-prem locations to hybrid locations and the second wave of multi-cloud haven\u2019t even hit the shore yet while this next wave of demand, it is falling behind it. But Chris, why don\u2019t you speak a little your view on AI?\nChris Sharp: Yes. No, absolutely. I appreciate the question. A couple of pieces. Just to reiterate what Andy said, the existing cloud infrastructure we have today, AI is cloud adjacent because of a lot of the applications, it\u2019s empowering and the way the customers are bringing it to market it\u2019s something we\u2019ve been watching for many, many years. And I think one of the pieces I always try to emphasize is that a lot of the R&D from the hyperscalers and from the technological providers has been happening within digital, which has allowed us to evolve our infrastructure with this demand. And I would reiterate also that there are pockets of AI that we\u2019re able to support rather efficiently. And I think this is something that\u2019s unique to Digital\u2019s designs and the R&D work that we\u2019ve been doing with some of the cooling technologies. It\u2019s really important for us to continue to support the broader spectrum of the customer requirements, so not only their traditional type of digital transformation, but we are seeing more and more customers show up with AI specific requirements and association with that digital transformation. And then the last one is, really emphasizing that to the customer base to design early and understand the implications of not only the power, but the interconnectivity. And just to circle back to why we believe the value of from Digital is differentiated is the ability to interconnect in an open fashion with the right partners in a very simplistic manner is what\u2019s making a lot of these AI deployments successful. And so that\u2019s the core of how we continue to focus on AI and bringing that to market in a very repeatable fashion. And so you\u2019ll see some recent sales tools we\u2019ll start talking about publicly to visualize how you tie together this infrastructure on a global basis. So very exciting about this additive demand coming to market, and you\u2019ll see more and more of the use cases and case studies coming out on the success that our customers are having within Platform Digital.\nOperator: The last question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Hey. Thanks guys for squeezing me in. I wanted to touch base on Ashburn, it sounds like the transmission line has been approved to be in service by late 2025 year at Digital Dallas. So when do you think you might be able to start additional development in that market? And do you think you\u2019re seeing any spillover impacts in terms of other markets or submarkets where you\u2019re seeing additional activity levels because of the tightness in Ashburn? And I guess just related to that on the pricing front, I think you mentioned that you\u2019re seeing rents as high as $140. I think a lot of your rents in Ashburn are rolling at $80 or $90. So just wondering if you have any color on what you\u2019ve seen on the re-leasing spreads across that market and what you expect going forward? Thank you.\nAndy Power: Thanks Eric. And we touched a little bit on this in the prepared remarks. The good news is that the powers that be in the region are sorting out ways to bring incremental power to the region by 2026. I think the \u2013 from there, I think you\u2019ll see a much more rational providing power to that market. And I do think it\u2019s going to move ourselves to be our history and track record of working in that region is going to keep us top of queue when power becomes more freely. Between now and then we \u2013 last quarter, had a good fortune having worked with the local providers to be able to deliver on all of our customer commitments, which is fantastic. We do believe that we will be able to bring on incremental growth capacity in this market between now and 2026 through called some development as well as some churn. We are working through all the resources we have in terms of excess power at sites, customers that may not be using their suites and be able to go to spare some capacity. So I don\u2019t have a fine point of the quantity, but I don\u2019t believe our shelves at Digital will be bearing, and we will be able to support our customers. Certainly our colocation customers and some of our hyperscale customers we\u2019ll be able to grow with Digital in Ashburn in the coming years. And then as we get a finer point on the quantities probably in lockstep with leasing in that capacity, we\u2019ll certainly be happy to share. In terms of spillover effect, the spillover is real. Manassas, I think is front center of a spillover market to the Loudoun County pinch point. I would say that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the greatest spillover effect. But there\u2019s always potential some of the non-Northern Virginia markets will continue to but at auction. But I don\u2019t think \u2013 I don\u2019t see anyone packing their wagons and leaving Ashburn due to this. I think the momentum has been building for years, and it\u2019s called out escape velocity in terms of its criticality to the data center industry and its customers.\nEric Luebchow: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power for his closing remarks. Andy, please go ahead.\nAndy Power: Thank you, Andrea. Digital Realty is off to a strong start to the year. Our results demonstrate that our value proposition is resonating with customers which was confirmed by our record interconnection signings, continued strength in the 0-1 megawatt category and strong new logo additions. We expect that our operating momentum will continue through the year and the steps we are taking will further accelerate our progress. We also remain confident in our funding plan, and I look forward to updating you with further developments on this front at the appropriate time. We are very excited to bring together our customers and partners on May 24th and 25th at our Marketplace Live 2023 event. The theme this year is the crossroads of the digital world, the data meeting place. The entire digital realty community from around the world will come together virtually to network, gain inspiration and bring their digital strategies to life. Please join us, you can register at marketplacelive.com. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us today and say a special thank you to our hard working and exceptional team and Digital Realty to help keep the digital world running. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation and you may now all disconnect.",

            "name": "Andy Power",
            "content": "Thanks, Jordan. Thanks to everyone for joining our call. Digital Realty remained focused on our customers and executing our strategic plan while delivering a strong first quarter despite global uncertainty. This included reaching another major milestone with our platform now supporting 5,000 customers worldwide. We posted strong sequential growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, and remained focused on disciplined capital allocation, while benefiting from strong secular trends supporting the data center industry. Last quarter, I identified strengthening our customer value proposition as one of our key strategic priorities. Let me expand on this a bit. Digital Realty has been on a journey since 2015 when we acquired Telx to expand our product offering and global footprint in order to provide the full spectrum of data center solutions to our customers. At the time, we said that we were seeking to expand our product mix and presence in the attractive colocation and interconnection space. When we announced that deal, our annual colocation revenues were about $88 million, which is less than the bookings we posted in the last two quarters in the zero to one megawatt plus interconnection segment. Since 2015, we've expanded our colocation and connectivity capabilities, both organically and through acquisitions, including the [indiscernible] portfolio, Interxion, the Westin Building, Altus IT, Lambda Helix, Medallion and Teraco. Today, our 0-1 megawatt segment revenues are well over $1 billion and represent 35% of total annualized rent, including a few colo and connectivity oriented organic new market additions that are currently underway and other important subsea cable landing station oriented to facilities, we expect to soon have a presence in more than 30 countries across six continents. Importantly, according to Cloudscene's H2, 2022 Data Center Ecosystem Leaderboard Results, which ranks operators based on their data center footprint and performance with a focus on service providers and cloud owners within their ecosystem, Digital Realty ranked in the top two slots within North America Europe and LATAM are taking the top spot in the Middle East and Africa region. Meanwhile, we've also shed noncore assets, recycled capital out of stabilized core assets and created joint ventures with some of the leading institutions around the world to own, operate and develop data centers. Along the way, we've added connectivity-related product capabilities, such as Service Exchange, Cloud Connect, and last summer, ServiceFabric, while targeting to the additions of cloud owners in our data centers around the world. These initiatives have meaningfully improved our customer value propositions and bolstered our results within the colo and connectivity segment. Since the end of 2015, our interconnection revenue has grown nearly 150%, while our colo and connectivity bookings have increased almost 400%. We now have 214,000 cross connects across our portfolio, an increase of over 250% over the same period. But there is more to do. Our vision is to serve our large and growing customer base that is focused on digital transformation and empowering their business through technological advancements at global scale today, tomorrow and for years to come. To do that, we serve as the meeting place offering the full spectrum of data center solutions globally, enabling our customers with a colo capacity and connectivity solutions needed to support their hybrid multi-cloud deployments and also providing line of sight to future availability of scale capacity and infrastructure advancements. Consistent with our strategic priority to strengthen our customer value proposition, we are pleased to announce the hiring of Steve Smith as Managing Director of our Americas region. Steve joins us following nearly eight years at CoreSite, where he most recently served as Chief Revenue Officer. Steve's experienced expertise within the colo and connectivity segment in the U.S. will be invaluable as we look to accelerate and enhance the offering in our largest market. We welcome Steve and the team, and look forward to an upcoming start in July. Let's move to our first quarter results. This quarter marks an important inflection in the fundamental recovery we have been anticipating in our core portfolio, as re-leasing spreads were positive across all products and in all regions, and scheduled price escalations translated into a positive inflection in our stabilized same capital portfolio growth year-over-year. New leasing during the quarter was $83 million, led by a strong 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection leasing, representing 57% of total signings, helped by the best quarter of interconnection science in company history. We continue to over-index towards CPI-based escalators within our new leases with over 40% of the new signed leases in the quarter containing inflation length increases with fixed rate escalators on the balance. During the first quarter, churn remained low at 1.1%, and we added 122 new customers, continuing with the strength of 100 plus new logos that we've added each quarter since closing the Interxion transaction. Our key wins included a Global 500 pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services company, who are exiting their legacy data centers and expanding on platform digital to ensure European data governance and compliance; a Global 2000 insurance provider, doing a campus migration from a competing provider. A key differentiator for this new customer was improved resilience over the incumbent provider, together with robust multi-cloud connectivity and expansion capabilities. One of the largest public power companies in the U.S. and a new logo for Digital Realty is leveraging PlatformDIGITAL to modernize its infrastructure with network and control hubs. This company is modernizing its infrastructure to embrace AI, improve analytics, and provide data to its B2B customers. One of the largest financial services firms is building a new trading platform with Digital Realty, driving an entirely new ecosystem to capture global trading as it happens. Their requirements include low latency and high performance. One of the largest global retailers also joined PlatformDIGITAL to support its local business presence, diversified transit nodes and rearchitect their network topology. Moving over to the power transmission issue in our largest market, Northern Virginia. We've continued to work constructively with the power divider in this market. And last quarter, we were pleased to be able to confirm the commitments that we have made to our customers. While the overarching conditions in this market have changed, we continue to work in partnership with the local providers to maximize potential availability within our 500-plus megawatt footprint. And we remain cautiously optimistic that we uniquely will be able to provide growth capacity for our customers in this market through new development and select churn opportunities. For now, Ashburn remains highly constrained and pricing is reflecting the decreased availability of data center capacity. Moving on to our investment activity. During the first quarter, we acquired a 3-acre parcel land in Osaka, Japan, through our MC Digital Realty joint venture to support future development. We also monetized the 10% interest in the data center in Ashburn, Virginia, in the quarter alongside our joint venture partner. While the transaction was driven by our partner and is not a meaningful component of our capital recycling plan for 2023, it did indeed demonstrate the appetite for well-located data centers and strong valuations. This asset was sold at a valuation of nearly $17 million per megawatt which represents a substantial premium to our development cost today for new data centers in this market and significant value creation. Given the ongoing process that we are undertaking to bolster our capital sources and increase the efficiency of our balance sheet, we remain confident in the institutional appetite to invest in data centers. Notably, over the course of the last few weeks, we have seen the announcement of the sale of a European hyperscale data center platform to a well-known global institutional investor on multiples that are consistent with where similar platforms have traded over the last few years. And we have witnessed the recapitalization of another data center platform by other institutional investors. We know that investors are eager to hear updates on our progress, and we will provide those once we have a transaction to announce. Since our IPO in 2004, concerns have been periodically raised about various potential risks to data centers, including technology, customers, demand, supply and obsolescence. This is somewhat par for the course for a relatively nascent and growing asset class. Over the last year or so, we have witnessed the latest misinformation campaign cast upon the data center sector by those interested in seeing the price of our stock goes down. I'd like to clarify a few important points. First, we operate a global portfolio of carrier-neutral and cloud-neutral data centers to facilitate communication and the exchange of information and data among and between enterprises, service providers and individuals all over the world. While we are focused on building what we call the meeting place for service providers and enterprise customers who are in pursuit of hybrid multi-cloud end-state IT architectures. We are also facilitating the connectivity and communities of interest supporting latency-sensitive applications and platforms. These are things that cannot happen in a stand-alone on-prem data center and aren't serviceable by a single cloud service provider. Second, in contrast to the narrative that hyperscalers have forced prices lower, after a few years of negative same-store growth, the tide is turned. As the supply of data center capacity in the low-cost abundant capital environment that exists for much [indiscernible] 10 years, has slowed meaningfully now that rates are higher and capital is more precious. With continued robust demand, strong net absorption has driven vacancy lower, which has been supportive of data center rents. Accordingly, our releasing spreads have inflected positively as have our same capital core growth metrics. Our team delivered on our objectives in the first quarter, and we reiterate the recoveries we anticipate for these metrics for 2023. Lastly, despite claims almost a year ago that hyperscalers would soon resource their data center requirements, 2022 was a record leasing year for Digital Realty, partly driven by demand from hyperscale customers. We believe the demand from these and other customers within our pipeline, driven by digital transformation and soon artificial intelligence remains robust. Data center support the growth and evolution of technology that is improving our standard of living, productivity and the overall quality of our lives. We have now witnessed a meaningful and sustained pullback in demand in the nearly 20 years that we've been in business, and we are not seeing a pullback today. While an economic recession could slow capital spending, third-party data centers also benefit from the trend towards outsourcing. Customers often make the decision to lease rather than build on the availability of capital titans [ph]. We saw the same thing during the great financial crisis. For many of our customers, data centers can also help drive revenue growth will facilitate lower costs or even enhance overall productivity. We are optimistic that our business will remain resilient in 2023 and for years to come. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the quarter. During the first quarter, a leading ESG ratings provider included Digital Realty in their 2023 top-rated ESG company list, noting that we are in the top 6.5% of companies in the U.S. and Canada region. In addition, Digital Realty continues its efforts to incorporate renewable energy resources. We were named by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as one of the EPA's Top 25 Green Power Partners. We furthered our commitment to sustainability by signing a 10-year power purchase agreement for 116-megawatt share of a new solar project in Germany to increase our total solar and wind power under contract to over 1 gigawatt of renewable capacity. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced additional renewable to support our portfolio in Australia, while our business in Japan also announced renewable procurement for a portion of its portfolio. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier. Hey, thanks Nick. So I'll kick it off and I'll hand it to Corey. I would say there's no conscious decisions in dialing back or waving off business necessarily. You could see from our development life cycle, we've continued to raise the bar on our most strategic projects and fine-tuned capital allocations. The \u2013 I'd say it was a bit \u2013 it was a little bit lower than prior run rates. But if you look at the prior year, which was a record and had a record quarter in there in the third quarter, I wouldn't say \u2013 I think I won't over-index to anything other than call it the typical lumpiness you may have in that category. It was healthy in terms of pricing. I don't think we had a single deal pricing below $100 per kilowatt. But Corey, do you want to expand? Yes, Nick. So \u2013 I mean, we all \u2013 we're always trying to take a holistic approach to these relationships. And as you see from our top customer list, our largest customers can be with 20, 30, 40, 50 different locations. At the same time, the pricing is dynamic to overall supply/demand dynamics. And as inventory in various markets become more and more precious, we've seen that pendulum pricing move in our favor. We try to be straight shooters with the customer. We try to bring all the \u2013 everything to the table in a holistic fashion. We've done this before in terms of bringing renewals and new business, expansions, all-in-one holistic approach. And I think this is not new. These are \u2013 these big hyperscale customers are seeing cost of doing business going up. Many of them self build themselves and see inflation in construction costs or labor. So I think the understanding that the pricing dynamic is shifting a little bit towards the providers is playing out in a natural fashion. Sure. Thanks, Jon. On the first question, make Sharp and I'll tag team that. I mean \u2013 I think I look at a few things. One, it's a holistic approach to these customers. There's a lot of good results in this quarter, whether it's the new logos, inflecting up 15% quarter-over-quarter, which was a high for several quarters, whether it was the overall interconnection plus less than a megawatt signings, the regional contributions, including a standout interconnection quarter. And I'd also mention that this is a building momentum. It's been building over time for several quarters now. I think it's the power of the platform coming together, servicing our customers across 50-plus metros on six continents. It's the great work Corey team has done with the go-to-market. And I still would say that we got even further progress and even better results to deliver over time. This particular quarter did have I'd say, a lumpier win, let's call it, put it into the number one category interaction interconnection signings. So I'm not sure that's necessarily repeatable next quarter with another record. But some of the work that we're doing with service providers, I think Chris can touch on, I think it's going to continue to build that momentum. But Chris, pick it up from that, please? And then, Jon, just around your second question about call it competition from private back, one, that's not a new phenomenon. We've been competing against private players for some time now and the ones that have been taken private they've been private for, call it, multiple years for some of them. I think what's changed is the ability to deliver this business for our customers has just gotten harder and harder, and at a global scale. And whether it's power, constraints, staffing, supply chains \u2013 and certainly, cost and access to capital has certainly not been a friend of some of our competitors. And I think our largest customers in the hyperscale arena turn to us given our permanence in our space. We're not here, gone tomorrow, we've invested for the long run, we're future-proofing that growth, we're constantly building for that growth with our suppliers and I think all those things probably make it leave a little bit more advantageous versus some of those private bank names in an environment like today. Thanks, Jon. I mean, we do an incredibly granular market-by-market assessment here. So, it really depends on the market and the relative risk fee rates and risk premiums. I would just by and large, and this is not something that just showed up in our approach this quarter, three quarters ago almost, we basically took a posture that we need to raise the bar on capital allocation and prioritize our most strategic projects, call it, highest return, not only highest return, but also projects to generate the high long-term growth as well. So I don't have a single number answer to get \u2013 to give you there, but I think you will see that come through our development returns at table as those numbers are inching into higher territory, and I can tell you more strategic long-term growth projects. Okay. So Mike, a good outcome is we essentially get the, call it, $2 billion of funding completed and the range is wide, but the majority of that capital, the range is not that wide. The wide range is due to some of the noncore asset sales as well as the development, which is, call it, 25% of the $2 billion, right? But if you look at the majority, the 75%, which is stabilized joint ventures or development, development, those were zero yielding projects. On stabilized joint ventures, I think, the cap rates are in the low single-digit type category based on what we're seeing called six-ish type territory. And I think that's based on not what we see externally by third-party transactions. What we've seen on recent transactions with partners that we can recapitalize with our portfolio and through our progress on these capital recycling and joint venture efforts. Holistically, more longer term here, we are looking to become more balance sheet efficient. What's not new is, call it, finishing out the noncore dispose, what's not new is joint venturing majority states in stabilized hyperscale-oriented projects that have lower long-term growth rates due to the credit quality and size of the customers, be it through rent bumps or pricing power. What is new is sharing a piece of both of our North America and EMEA development as it relates to hyperscale projects. And we're doing that with a view that these projects keep getting larger, and larger and larger. That non-income producing drag it remains a headwind, even though it is a significant long-term value creation. And we believe there is ample partners to work with us on those projects which will ultimately make our balance sheet more efficient and more rapidly accelerate revenue and EBITDA drop into our bottom line. The simple answer, Michael, is we're looking to partner around large-scale development projects where there will be incremental spend that we and our partner will jointly fund over time. So that it will \u2013 we're looking for \u2013 these are large projects, large swaths of acreage, large quantities and megawatts. Hence, the quality of capital or spend is not the entirety or near the entirety of where the project ultimately will be over time. So they would fund alongside us through the coming quarters. So Michael, I mean, again, I think this ties back to the first three strategic priorities I laid out in the prior call about really strengthening \u2013 demonstrably strengthening our customer value proposition. We took advantage of this call to remind folks that this is not something we started with me becoming the CEO four months ago. This is something that's been in the works for roughly eight years through both inorganic and organic measures, putting together critical puzzle pieces, expanding across the globe in terms of where the customers need our capacity, adding connectivity hubs and innovating and bringing more to our customers, adding \u2013 we've changed up our go-to-market motion over time. What we go from here is, again, accelerating from that success. A piece of that \u2013 delighted to have Steve Smith on board to lead our essentially newly created Americas region. Steve comes with a tremendous background of really driving the \u2013 one of the only U.S.-only focused interconnection and colo platforms in a prior \u2013 previously a very formidable competitor. And I think he's going to be very added to that our team, our leadership table. The incremental things that we're doing in terms of continuing to innovate and bring more value to our customers. Chris touched upon ServiceFabric, which I still would characterize as just out of the bar in terms of where we're going in terms of bringing more partners onto that platform, and drilling more value to our customers. We are \u2013 there's a whole host of things that I'd say we're doing behind the scenes to continue to accelerate our growth. And I think the fruits of our labor are continuing to build each and every quarter in terms of success. So I think there's multiple angles that we are moving towards in that endeavor to be one of a very short list of global interconnection colo providers. And I think the industry demands and the broader competitive backdrop are also our wins at our sales. I'll let Matt, take it off in re-leasing spreads and we can tag some longer term outlook pieces. Frank, do you want \u2013 do you mind repeating that second part of your question just to make sure we hear it correctly? Yes. Frank, I'd direct you to our development table to follow, see the progression of yields. There's \u2013 I would say the yields are improving in our favor. The pricing dynamic is outpacing the inflationary pressures. It's not an overnight phenomenon, but we are moving into a better territory. I mean, you can look at episodic things like Ashburn, Virginia, where quite frankly, the rates have pretty much doubled in a pretty short time from deals in the, call it, low $70s to now call it, market rates of, call it, $140, and that's flowing to the bottom line and enhancing those deals dramatically. So I think that table is a work in progress in our sub because it's got a lot of pre-leasing, some of which was signed prior to some of this price progression. But as we continue to add more projects to that, that they are not pre-leased or we fill out the leasing on the available capacity, I think there's ability to raise those yields. And I would also say the North America piece of that has a large project in it that is an open book build-to-suit to a very highly rated financial institution on a triple net lease basis. So it's an apple to the oranges there in a good way. It's been dramatically derisked in terms of its build and in terms of its ongoing revenue and EBITDA stream at the same time, lowering our Americas yields. I would say, I mean, it's a new phenomenon in terms of recent history of the data centers, which is still, I'd call a nascent asset class, but we are seeing it. If you look at, call it, our less than a megawatt signings, either the Americas region or EMEA region where there's critical consistent massive new signings, the rates have been up, call it, four quarters in a row. And that example I gave you, in Ashburn, Virginia, from rates going from $70 plus E [ph] to $140 plus E. That is quite a run. And I know I'm picking out one particular market there, an example, but it is the largest and most diverse market out there, our largest market as well. And it's flanks the East Coast with a power constraint problem, but the West Coast is having the same low with Santa Clara now having power constraints to likely outpace when power comes online in Virginia. And I think this phenomenon is going to continue in other parts of the world, not just the U.S. And I think you're going to continue to see those rates move more and more favor. David, I know you're a student of the traditional real estate asset classes. I mean, it was a good 20 years where industrial had no rate growth before it's had the renaissance that's been experienced in the last few years. And I'm not saying that that's going to happen to data centers, but it feels like we're teeing ourselves up way for a healthier pricing environment for the incumbents. Yes, if you look at our financials, we've got a sizable amount of contiguous land capacity and available power that's committed to us outside of these, call it, zones of disruption. But longer term, eventually we will exhaust that and you could have that phenomenon. At the same time, when you're doing business at twice the rates, you have to sell half the kilowatts in certain markets. So, I'm not sure that the top-line pacing on our new signings will be all that disrupted near term based on what we have in this table in terms of capabilities and estimated power. But I agree with you this assessment and it's going to continue. The other thing I'd emphasize is, we're actively managing our platform and our capabilities, and we're essentially always looking to reproductize for higher, better use when applicable. So if we have churn, which this is not a totally static business, it provides opportunity to release that capacity at higher rate opportunities and often higher better uses towards some granular enterprise colocation oriented customers. And on a big company like digital, you probably don't see that. It's not top of the waves, but that's happening in terms of how we manage our footprint. Thanks, Matt. I'm going to have Greg tackle the first one and then Sharp and I can both tackle the second one. And turning to your second question \u2013 just one quick thing for I turn over to Chris GBT [ph] to give his view on AI. The \u2013 I think a misnomer here is that, in my opinion, that everyone thinks every data center is going to turn into one that's going to be supporting artificial intelligence. The use cases, the applications, the workloads that exist today are still going to be thriving within the global data center footprint and digital. Yes, we have many data centers that lend themselves towards supporting the increasing power densities and cooling environments that will be required, and we're doing a lot of that as we speak. But I look at more \u2013 the bigger picture around AI is that this is an incremental major wave of long-term demand that will certainly need to have proximity to the major data that sits today. And the first two waves of demand of moving from on-prem locations to hybrid locations and the second wave of multi-cloud haven't even hit the shore yet while this next wave of demand, it is falling behind it. But Chris, why don't you speak a little your view on AI? Thanks Eric. And we touched a little bit on this in the prepared remarks. The good news is that the powers that be in the region are sorting out ways to bring incremental power to the region by 2026. I think the \u2013 from there, I think you'll see a much more rational providing power to that market. And I do think it's going to move ourselves to be our history and track record of working in that region is going to keep us top of queue when power becomes more freely. Between now and then we \u2013 last quarter, had a good fortune having worked with the local providers to be able to deliver on all of our customer commitments, which is fantastic. We do believe that we will be able to bring on incremental growth capacity in this market between now and 2026 through called some development as well as some churn. We are working through all the resources we have in terms of excess power at sites, customers that may not be using their suites and be able to go to spare some capacity. So I don't have a fine point of the quantity, but I don't believe our shelves at Digital will be bearing, and we will be able to support our customers. Certainly our colocation customers and some of our hyperscale customers we'll be able to grow with Digital in Ashburn in the coming years. And then as we get a finer point on the quantities probably in lockstep with leasing in that capacity, we'll certainly be happy to share. In terms of spillover effect, the spillover is real. Manassas, I think is front center of a spillover market to the Loudoun County pinch point. I would say that's \u2013 we've seen the greatest spillover effect. But there's always potential some of the non-Northern Virginia markets will continue to but at auction. But I don't think \u2013 I don't see anyone packing their wagons and leaving Ashburn due to this. I think the momentum has been building for years, and it's called out escape velocity in terms of its criticality to the data center industry and its customers. Thank you, Andrea. Digital Realty is off to a strong start to the year. Our results demonstrate that our value proposition is resonating with customers which was confirmed by our record interconnection signings, continued strength in the 0-1 megawatt category and strong new logo additions. We expect that our operating momentum will continue through the year and the steps we are taking will further accelerate our progress. We also remain confident in our funding plan, and I look forward to updating you with further developments on this front at the appropriate time. We are very excited to bring together our customers and partners on May 24th and 25th at our Marketplace Live 2023 event.

            "name": "Matt Mercier",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our first quarter results. We signed a total of $83 million of new leases in the first quarter, highlighted by a second consecutive quarterly record in interconnection signings and continued strength in the 0-1 megawatt category, particularly in EMEA, which nearly matched the record level from last quarter. 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection accounted for a robust 57% of total bookings. Our greater than a megawatt bookings moderated to $35 million in the quarter. Though this activity was broadly dispersed throughout our global portfolio with leases signed in Toronto, the U.S., Mexico, Europe and South Africa, but nothing in Northern Virginia. These deals can be lumpy and the downtick in the greater than a megawatt leasing follows a record year in 2022, in which we signed more than $370 million and 288 megawatts of new leases. Importantly, our demand funnel remains quite strong as a number of our highly strategic customers remain actively engaged and are seeking to add capacity across our global portfolio. Of course, as we have discussed on the last few calls our largest scale market, Northern Virginia, is experiencing capacity constraints as a result of the power transmission issues that emerged last summer. Over the course of the last three years, including the second half of 2022 we signed approximately $20 million per quarter of new leases in Northern Virginia, versus $2.5 million of new leases signed in this market in 1Q 2023. As I'll expand on in a moment, we expect the ballast to lower new lease volume to show up in better pricing including renewal spreads. Turning to our backlog slide. The current backlog signed but not yet commenced leases was $434 million at quarter end, as commencements were once again well over $100 million, partly balanced by new leasing. We expect the remaining $200-plus million of commencements in 2023 to be somewhat evenly weighted throughout the balance of the year. The lag between signings and commencements in the quarter was 16 months, principally due to a few larger long-term leases that require buildouts. During the first quarter, we signed $155 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 4.5% on a cash basis, our strongest renewal pricing quarter since the early days of the pandemic. The strength was shared across both products and also across our three regions. So we're off to a good start relative to our full year 2023 guidance. Renewal spreads in the 0-1 megawatt category continued accelerating up 4.6% in the first quarter on $118 million of volume, nearly 400 basis points faster than it was in the final quarter of 2021, but also more than 100 basis points better than full year 2022. Greater than a megawatt renewals were similarly strong in the first quarter, as cash re-leasing spreads increased by 4.4% on $30 million of renewals. We were also pleased to see 100% of the leases signed in the quarter roll up in this category, and we remain optimistic about the potential for the rest of this year. Turning to our operating results. Our performance in the first quarter was a bit better than our expectations, highlighted by the continued improvement in our core operating performance, higher development returns and a record quarter in interconnection revenue. In terms of earnings growth, we reported first quarter core FFO of $1.66 per share, $0.01 better versus prior quarter and a $0.01 light relative to last year. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was $1.69 per share relative to the $1.67 we reported in the first quarter of 2022. Total revenue was up 19% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. As discussed on the last call, this revenue growth is somewhat distorted due to the significant increases in utility costs and reimbursements as the impact of last year's energy price increases went into full effect in January. As most of you understand, the large majority of energy costs are directly passed through to our customers. Excluding utility reimbursements, total revenue was up 13% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, while reimbursements remained a relatively consistent percentage of utility expenses at 92%. Due to a decline in spot energy prices between the fourth and first quarters, our top line revenue including utility reimbursements from our customers was more than $40 million below our original forecast, but this was directly mirrored by lower-than-expected utility expenses, since these expenses are directly borne by our customers. Interconnection revenue was up 5% sequentially, reflecting the ongoing improvement in our core operating performance. Other than utilities, expenses were well contained as NOI margins, excluding utilities, remained steady, resulting in adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. On our last two calls, we've highlighted the improvement in operating performance that started to emerge with our stabilized same capital portfolio, but was largely masked by FX headwinds. These positive trends strengthened further in the first quarter despite continued year-over-year currency headwinds. Same-capital cash NOI grew 3.4% in the first quarter compared to 1Q 2022, demonstrating the turn in our core operations that we have been discussing. The step-up was driven by a 90 basis point improvement in same-store occupancy as commencements outpace churn, upside from annual rent escalators and the benefit of positive re-leasing spreads. Turning to our currency slide, 51% of our first quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, with 25% in euros, 6% in British pounds, 5% in Singapore dollars, 3% in South African rand and 2% in each of the Brazilian real and Japanese yen. The weakening of the U.S. dollar in the first quarter provided a slight sequential tailwind, but the dollar's strength through much of 2022 resulted in a continued headwind to year-over-year results. As a result, the dollar strength negatively impacted our reported revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth by about 300 basis points apiece on a year-over-year basis, whereas core FFO per share saw just under 200 basis points headwind. Turning to the balance sheet. Our reported leverage ratio at quarter end was 7.1 times, while fixed charge coverage was 4.4 times. In January, we completed a $740 million two year term loan with an initial maturity date at March 31, 2025, plus a one year extension option and an effective rate of 5.6%. Leverage remains above our historical average and our long-term target, and we intend to reduce our leverage toward our long-term target over the course of 2023. Our plan hasn't changed. We are in active discussions on our asset sale and joint venture plans and remain confident in our ability to execute on these plans over the course of the year so that our leverage moves back towards the six times area by year-end. Our weighted average debt maturity is at five years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.8%. Approximately 82% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar-denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Over 80% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have minimal near-term debt maturities with only $100 million maturing in 2023, together with a well-laddered maturity schedule. Lastly, let's turn to our guidance. We are maintaining our core FFO and constant currency core FFO per share guidance ranges for the full year 2023 of $6.65 to $6.75. And our first quarter results were consistent with this range. We are also affirming our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.7 billion [ph] at the midpoint as the downward adjustment in our overall revenue guidance is purely due to lower utility expenses driven by lower spot electricity rates that are passed on directly to our customers. We are also modestly tweaking our year to U.S. dollar exchange rate expectations for the year to reflect the relative appreciation of the euro year-to-date. We also made meaningful progress on the turn in our fundamentals during the quarter, providing strong support to the organic operating metrics supporting our full year guidance, including cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads over 3%, same-capital cash NOI growth of 3% to 4% and year-end portfolio occupancy between 85% and 86%. As I mentioned a few moments ago, we remain confident in our funding plan for the year. So we have reiterated our guidance for dispositions and JV capital. We have tweaked our debt financing cost expectation to be consistent with the move in rate seen since the banking sector fall out last month, which will be largely mitigated by the upside we saw versus our core FFO expectation the first quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? Yes, thanks. So I mean, the simple answer is, yes. So our capital plan, I think, as we laid out last quarter, and it really hasn't changed coming into this quarter, is based on, call it, $2-plus billion of capital recycling from our joint venture opportunities as well as the potential for noncore dispositions. And as that capital comes in as well as our expected growth in EBITDA this year, which is a little shy of 10%, we believe that by the end of the year, largely those two items will get us back towards that six times area this year. Yes. So thanks, Frank. I think, one, first, I'd reiterate, we're obviously off to a great start here with positive re-leasing spreads, again, not only across all product types, but across all regions. I will say, we're \u2013 we feel confident that this positive pricing environment that we're in is sustainable and it's here to stay. I'm not going to necessarily speak about every single quarter. But again, I'd come back and reiterate that we're off to a great start. We see \u2013 and we see that come for full year that we expect to be positive for the full year, not only in the 0 to 1 megawatt category but also in the greater than a megawatt category, which I think is, again, something we haven't seen in a few years. And reflects the positive environment and turn in fundamentals that we're seeing not only from that, but then down into our stabilized portfolio as well."

            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Look, I'd say, look, with respect to our capital initiatives, I'd say we're still on track with the plan we outlined in our earnings call in early February. But you should recall that was the $500 million of the noncore dispositions, call it, roughly $750 million from core JVs and $750 from million development JVs. And I would characterize it without saying too much, is that we're making good progress in these transactions. And we've received significant interest from multiple institutional partners, whether it's sovereign wealth funds, infrastructure funds, PE, real estate funds, pension funds, insurance companies and the like. So the way I'd characterize it is we're executing on plan. And we feel good about where we are into these processes."

            "name": "Chris Sharp",
            "content": "Yes. Appreciate it, Andy. And thanks for the question, Jon. A couple of dynamics here where I think we've led by our core existing products. And I think your direct question to, is it new logos or its existing, it's both, right? I really want to emphasize the fact that the physical cross connects reaching 214,000 and growing, it's something that we constantly have looked at and Andy referenced this earlier, growing the platform, right, investing and making sure that customers know how to access one another to get further value out of the deployment is absolutely important to us. And so just really watching how that evolves over time. And with the advent of the ServiceFabric and bringing that to market and what that's being able to do for our customers, we're just starting to see \u2013 it's early innings, but future growth on virtual, right, where it's going to be married to where now they're going to be able to access multiple destinations in a more simplistic fashion, because of that product being purpose built in the way that we brought it to market, it really removes a lot of the technical complexity that has precluded other customers from getting the full value out of the deployment. But one of the things I'm just very pleased about is this customer-led and balanced approach that we've been doing on even new markets inside of Europe. We've talked about in the past where just bringing the value or the pricing closer to parity in some of these markets \u2013 we see really strong growth within Germany and France, where making sure that we're delivering those capabilities to those customers in all these critical markets around the globe. And I would just say lastly, I'm pleased with the fact that Digital has been able to provide one of the greatest quarters of interconnection signings in the company's history, and that's just really representative of the value we're bringing to the customers. Yes. No, absolutely. I appreciate the question. A couple of pieces. Just to reiterate what Andy said, the existing cloud infrastructure we have today, AI is cloud adjacent because of a lot of the applications, it's empowering and the way the customers are bringing it to market it's something we've been watching for many, many years. And I think one of the pieces I always try to emphasize is that a lot of the R&D from the hyperscalers and from the technological providers has been happening within digital, which has allowed us to evolve our infrastructure with this demand. And I would reiterate also that there are pockets of AI that we're able to support rather efficiently. And I think this is something that's unique to Digital's designs and the R&D work that we've been doing with some of the cooling technologies. It's really important for us to continue to support the broader spectrum of the customer requirements, so not only their traditional type of digital transformation, but we are seeing more and more customers show up with AI specific requirements and association with that digital transformation. And then the last one is, really emphasizing that to the customer base to design early and understand the implications of not only the power, but the interconnectivity. And just to circle back to why we believe the value of from Digital is differentiated is the ability to interconnect in an open fashion with the right partners in a very simplistic manner is what's making a lot of these AI deployments successful. And so that's the core of how we continue to focus on AI and bringing that to market in a very repeatable fashion. And so you'll see some recent sales tools we'll start talking about publicly to visualize how you tie together this infrastructure on a global basis. So very exciting about this additive demand coming to market, and you'll see more and more of the use cases and case studies coming out on the success that our customers are having within Platform Digital."

During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone to Digital Realty's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; and Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our third quarter. First, new leasing volume of $521 million at our share, shattered our prior record and even our own expectations for the realm of possibility in a quarter. In fact, 3Q leasing was more than a full year's growth by previous standards as activity in the quarter exceeded the leasing completed in all of 2023, pushing our backlog of signed, but not commenced leases up to nearly $860 million. While greater than 1 megawatt leasing was the primary driver over 0 megawatt to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment also posted record bookings in the quarter. Second, strong fundamentals translated into improved pricing for data center capacity, and this was evident across both new and renewed leases with record rates on new greater than 1 megawatt leases, 4% escalators on the majority of new leases and a record 15% uplift in cash renewal spreads in the quarter. And third, our development pipeline increased by nearly 50% sequentially to 644 megawatts under construction and is now 74% pre-leased at a 12% average expected yield as a result of successful leasing of shell and land capacity in North America. These results continue to move Digital Realty closer to management's objective to improve longer-term sustainable growth. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. I don't often start this way, but this quarter was certainly one for the record books. As Jordan noted, we posted record results across a broad array of metrics. These results are the product of Digital Realty's team capitalizing on a favorable demand backdrop, but are also a testament to our efforts to enhance our value proposition and to drive long-term sustainable growth. Demand for data center capacity remains strong, both for larger capacity blocks in our core markets and to support continued growth in both cloud and digital transformation. We are well positioned to take advantage of this favorable environment, given our full spectrum strategy, our global footprint across six continents and a robust land bank that can support 3 plus gigawatts of incremental development, together with an investment grade balance sheet that is complemented by a diverse group of capital partners and the expertise to put it all together and operate these facilities on behalf of the world's leading technology companies and enterprises. Highlights for the third quarter were abundant and include $521 million of new leases signed at Digital Realty share, more than double our prior record in the first quarter of this year. Greater than 1 megawatt bookings in North America led the way, driven by large hyperscale deals in Manassas, Ashburn and Chicago. New leasing volume in this segment was up more than 75% from the 1Q record, while pricing moved up nearly 30%. Included in our greater than 1 megawatt signings was a large lease in our hyperscale development venture in Manassas. Like, all of our JVs, we report these leasing results at our share or 20% in this case. The total leasing into our facilities at 100% share was in excess of $700 million in the third quarter, demonstrating the significant appetite for data center capacity. Given the size of those numbers, it might be easy to overlook a very strategic and important milestone with a sizable record quarter in our 0-1 plus interconnection business, which saw more than $66 million of new bookings, topping our prior record in this product category by over 20%, with particular strength in small deals under 0.5 megawatt, which accounted for 80% of our 0-1 megawatt leasing. Not to be forgotten, new interconnection bookings also hit a record in the quarter. We view these bookings very favorably as it further validates our full spectrum product strategy and provides us with growing momentum in a segment with durable pricing power and steadily increasing customer demand. Our strength in this category was also characterized by a record 149 new logos for the quarter. PlatformDIGITAL offers our customers the convenience and simplicity to manage their global data center needs and is reflected by record export activity in the third quarter, which were 50% plus higher year-over-year with Americas to EMEA exports leading the way, followed by APAC into the Americas. With a record $859 million backlog of favorably priced leases, largely commencing over the next two years, we are positioned for accelerating top line and bottom line growth. In support of our customers' growing requirements, and all of the new leasing accomplished in the quarter, we also substantially scaled our development pipeline in the third quarter, increasing the capacity underway by almost 50% to 644 megawatts under construction today. And we maintained another 3 gigawatts of buildable IT load capacity in land and shell condition. As we noted last quarter, we also strengthened our value proposition in Europe with the acquisition of a densely connected enterprise data center campus in Slough. During the quarter, we also continued to bolster our balance sheet and diversify our capital sources through a combination of favorable debt and ATM issuances. Matt will provide more details on these activities in a few minutes. Over the past few weeks, we've seen several examples of the lengths that some hyperscalers will go to reserve enough power for their fast growing compute requirements. We've seen a deal to reactivate 3 mile Island, another hyperscaler partnering with an existing utility to develop small modular reactors and the third executing power purchase agreements to purchase nuclear energy for multiple SMRs that have yet to be built. These agreements are similar, in that they are seeking long-term carbon-free energy solutions to help power growing data center portfolios and speak to the longer-term demand outlook for data center capacity. Yet each of these plants is still years away from beginning to generate power, underscoring the value of lower capacity blocks today and perhaps for the next several years. And sourcing available power is just one piece of the data center infrastructure puzzle. Supply chain management, construction management and operating expertise are all challenges that customers rely on Digital Realty to solve, and they are clearly a critical aspect of the overall value proposition that we bring to the table. While the large hyperscale deals get plenty of focus, customers and partners are recognizing the value that Digital Realty's meeting place can bring to their private cloud and hybrid IT applications around the world. We continue to see a meaningful share of our 0-1 megawatt wins influenced by our partners, expanding our reach into more enterprises around the world. Our wins this quarter include a Global 2000 telecom provider who partners with one of our largest customers choosing PlatformDIGITAL to deploy a distributed cloud solution to alleviate geographic data gravity challenges. A leading health care provider and a new logo for Digital Realty, which also came to us from a partner, modernizing its infrastructure to take advantage of the cloud connectivity available on PlatformDIGITAL, while maintaining data compliance for personal health information privacy. Another new logo, an international financial institution critical to global financial and monetary policy, chose PlatformDIGITAL to secure their cloud requirements while maintaining global access. A Global 2000 technology company is expanding their presence on PlatformDIGITAL in support of its autonomous driving solution. A top 20 Japanese electronics and semiconductor manufacturer is joining PlatformDIGITAL through another partner as part of an integrated tech-refresh initiative where robust connectivity was a critical differentiator. And a global cloud optimization provider is deploying additional capacity on PlatformDIGITAL across two continents to support their expanding enterprise customer base, who require access to rich and scalable connectivity solutions. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our global ESG progress during the third quarter. We continue to lead the industry in green building IT capacity, the 178 megawatts certified in the last 12 months, while our Swiss team achieved the first ever Swiss Datacenter Efficiency Association Gold Plus certification for our data centers in Zurich. Digital Realty also continued to be recognized for ESG leadership, including Broad Group's Datacloud Global works 2024 for AI data center on the year, The Tech Capitals, Digital Infrastructure Action Global Award 2024 and Frost & Sullivan recognized our Japanese joint venture, MC Digital Realty with the 2024 Japan Data Center Services Company of the Year Award. Moving to Green Finance, where Digital continues to be a leader in the data center industry. During the quarter, we issued EUR850 million green bond, adding to Digital's long history of support for linking its debt to sustainable projects. Additionally, we maintained a sustainability linked pricing component on our new credit facility, further demonstrating the company's commitment to ESG. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment, while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.\nMatthew Mercier: Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our third quarter results. We signed $521 million of new leases in the third quarter, of which $450 million fell into the greater than 1 megawatt category and was heavily weighted toward the Americas. We also signed $50 million of 0-1 megawatt leases and $16 million of interconnection bookings. Each of these figures were new records for Digital Realty. Importantly, more than 75% of the dollar volume of leases signed include annual rent escalators of 4% or greater, which bolsters the growth profile associated with our portfolio of long-term hyperscale leases. Our backlog at Digital Realty share increased by more than 60% sequentially to $859 million at the end of September, as new leasing dramatically outpaced $180 million of record commencements in the quarter. To offer some perspective, the backlog now represents 20% of this quarter's annualized data center revenues and we expect more than 85% of these leases to commence by the end of 2026. Looking ahead a $100 million of the backlog is scheduled to commence by the end of this year, with another $350 million scheduled to commence next year, and over $300 million already slated to commence in 2026, setting us up for accelerating multiyear growth. During the third quarter, we signed $258 million of renewal leases at a 15.2% increase on a cash basis, driving year-to-date cash renewal spreads to 10.5%. Similar to the first quarter, these robust releasing spreads were driven by a package deal that pulled forward a sizable renewal that was not scheduled to expire for several more years. Excluding this package deal, overall renewal spreads were still a healthy 5.8%, which is more consistent with the 5% to 7% guidance we previously provided for 2024. While the package deals demonstrate the levers available to capitalize on the current pricing environment and also reflect our customers' views of the overall market, they are less predictable in nature. Breaking down renewals by product category, cash renewal spreads in the 0-1 megawatt segment were up a healthy 4.5% in the third quarter, while releasing spreads in the greater than 1 megawatt segment were up by over 30%. Excluding the package deal greater than 1 megawatt renewals were still up 8.6%. For the quarter, churn remained low and well controlled at 1.5%. In terms of earnings, we reported third quarter core FFO of $1.67 per share, reflecting continued healthy growth in revenues and adjusted EBITDA. Data center revenue grew by 7.5% year-over-year as the combination of improved renewal spreads, rent escalators and year-to-date commencements more than offset the drag associated with \u2013 the more than $2.5 billion of capital recycling activity since the middle of 2023. Pro forma for the transaction activity data center revenues were up 10% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 11% year-over-year, principally due to a near 200 basis point improvement in margin from the flow-through of higher data center and interconnection revenues with improved pricing. Same capital NOI growth increased by 0.8% year-over-year in the third quarter, as 2.5% growth in data center revenue was offset by higher property operating costs and roughly 200 basis points of bad debt reserves in the quarter. Year-to-date, same capital cash NOI has increased by 2.6%, which continues to be negatively impacted by about 200 basis points of power margin headwinds year-over-year, given the elevated utility prices in EMEA in 2023. Moving on to our investment activity. We spent $651 million on consolidated development in the third quarter. Gross development spend at 100% share was $855 million in the quarter. Given the strong demand for data center capacity, we doubled our development underway in the Americas and added more projects in EMEA for an almost 50% increase in our pipeline, ending the quarter with 644 megawatts under construction. More specifically, we delivered just 36 megawatts of new capacity in the quarter, while we backfilled the pipeline with another 244 megawatts of new starts at 100% share. The overall pipeline is now 74% preleased, up from 66% at the end of 2Q, with an average expected yield of 12%. Almost all the development underway in the Americas is preleased with an expected stabilized yield of 13.6%. Some development capacity remains in both EMEA and APAC, with both currently expecting stabilized yields over 10%. Over the first-nine months of the year, we spent $2.4 billion in development CapEx at 100% share, which has been balanced by nearly $900 million of partner contributions, keeping us on track and well within the range of our original full year spending expectations. Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet in the third quarter, with over $800 million of equity raised on the ATM. On the debt side, we paid off $250 million gilts in July and added an EUR850 million green bond in September. We also upsized and extended our credit facilities to $4.5 billion in September. At the end of the third quarter, we had nearly $5 billion of total liquidity, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 5.4 times. Moving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is over four years, and our weighted average interest rate is 2.8%. Approximately 85% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 89% of our net debt is fixed rate and 96% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have no remaining debt maturities until early 2025, and the maturities remained well laddered through 2033. Let me conclude with our guidance. We are raising our core FFO guidance range for the full year of 2024 to $6.65 to $6.75 per share, increasing the low end of the range by $0.05 per share and maintaining the high end. The increase in our guide at the midpoint of the range reflects the strength in our year-to-date leasing and commencements and the benefit of stronger than expected renewal pricing, partly balanced by the impact of customer bankruptcies in the second half of this year and balance sheet positioning to capitalize on the robust opportunity we are seeing. We are also adjusting our total revenue guidance to reflect the impact of lower utility expense reimbursements and are increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance to reflect better than expected leasing volumes and higher pricing. Accordingly, we are also adjusting the following operating assumptions. Reflecting our success on cash renewals to date, we are increasing the full year range to 8% to 10% from 5% to 7%. We are also tightening full year same-store guidance to a range of 2.75% to 3.25%. In terms of investing expectations for 2024, we tightened the range of our net share development spend to $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion and maintained our recurring maintenance CapEx ranges. Lastly, on financing, the EUR850 million bond raise was completed slightly ahead of previous expectations, but was mitigated by higher short-term rates than we anticipated at the beginning of this year. Looking to the fourth quarter, Core FFO per share remains poised to increase as the momentum from strong year-to-date leasing increasingly contributes to bottom line results. Looking out in 2025 and beyond, Digital Realty's growth remains poised to accelerate for 2024 levels as the fundamental environment for data centers remain strong, and our robust backlog commences. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?\nOperator: We will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks, and good afternoon. When we were together last in September, and you mentioned there could be another record before the end of the year, this was bigger. So congrats to you and the team on this. Maybe the first question with respect to that is, how much of the demand is at a risk of maybe pulling forward what the natural opportunity for Digital Realty is? And for the capacity that's in the pipeline, but not in development today, how much of that is power ready that's ready to sell into the market? Thanks.\nAndrew Power: And thanks, Mike. Really appreciate it. So going to your question, obviously, a quarter of this magnitude, any one of those sizable deals that slipped the quarter were really change the density of where our fourth quarter looks like. So I won't say there was zero pull forward. But at the same time, we are far from anywhere near selling that. Some of our largest signs during the quarter, selling the capacity blocks that are literally adjacent the most identically sized capacity blocks with nearing power deliveries in the very same markets we highlighted Manassas and Ashburn being one and two, and Chicago being three in terms of our top signings. Those specific markets, going to your second question, they are not ready -- the available capacity in those specific locations that comes next or not necessarily powered today, but those deliveries are approaching rapidly. And we have those in many markets, be it Dallas, Santa Clara in the U.S., EMEA, we have Frankfurt Paris, Amsterdam, Seoul, South Korea, as well as similar in South Africa and South America. And those all aggregate to north of 3 gigawatts of capacity, including Shell capacity that we can activate quickly. So \u2013 and last but not least, we also \u2013 as you saw in some of the release, we\u2019ve not been sitting idle. We\u2019ve made some very attractive additions including a parcel that will be adjacent to our Richardson campus in Dallas, I think approaches 80 megawatts of growth capacity and more to come. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t call this as a massive pull forward. Quite frankly, the scaling of demand we\u2019re seeing to take place here, I think, is just overall restrained from numerous factors.\nOperator: The next question is from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Petersen: Great. Thanks. Really impressive quarter, good job guys. I wanted to ask, so clearly, given the size of these leases, it seems like we're probably talking about AI use cases and some of the latest GPU technology out there. So maybe can you give us some more color on some of the design changes that are required to meet these power densities? And then also, the rental rates were looked really impressive. But I'm kind of curious if the build cost side of it is also higher on some of the leases that you signed this quarter?\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Jon. Really a massive team effort from obviously the leadership team on the call with the Florida\u2019s Digital Realty efforts globally to contribute to this type of quarter. Going to the second, then I'll hand it over to Chris and Colin to have an egg, the AI use cases and contributions from AI. Yes. We've seen some inflationary trends and build costs, bringing more higher power densities has been part of our heritage and that requires incremental CapEx spend. But the size of that as a percentage of the build is in the, call it, closer to single-digit percentile increases relative to what you've seen now in the rental rate movements that have well outpaced those inflationary elements. But maybe, Colin, can you just give us a little color on the composition from AI and then Chris can chime in on the -- what we're doing on the tech infrastructure front?\nColin McLean: Sure. Thanks, Andy. Yeah, Contribution was significant about 50% of our overall bookings came from AI. The larger tranche capacity, which obviously our heritage comes well supported from, it is a real value in these use cases. These large capacity blocks are in high demand across our core markets. And so clients are certainly looking to take advantage of that. I would also say, it's a growing part of our less than 1 megawatt framework, Chris and team have rolled out a substantial program in HD Colo, which you can probably highlight in just a moment that really fits in the sweet spot of where we're taking our platform on the whole, so Chris?\nChristopher Sharp: Yeah. No, I appreciate it. And I appreciate the question. This is something that we've been contemplating for many years. So we've seen a lot of the cloud infrastructure densifying, but then as artificial intelligence has come to market, just working on the data center design, and we've talked about this about modularity and the modularity around cooling and being able to maximize the utilization of air, and I think a lot of understand that liquid is coming into play, which is a core component that we've always anticipated and how we can retrofit in an efficient fashion to bring that liquid in to meet this demand on a case-by-case basis. And so I think that's one of the critical elements that we've always watched in the market. I think the other thing is the capacity block. Just the sheer sizes that you just heard Andy walk you through that\u2019s also very aligned to what a lot of the AI use cases are looking for. And I think one of the things we're always watching is how inference comes into play. And part of the data center design is also the interconnectivity of that. And so how we allow those different types of AI environments, be it inference, be it different types of recursive models, where how this advanced solutions are coming to market, that's core to what we've been watching and understanding at a very granular level. And then to Colin's point, I think it's important for us to understand how that gets fitted out within the data center. So we've launched an offering called HD Colo a while back. And I think what's interesting about what we're able to do with HD Colo across 30 markets, 30 metros, 170 facilities within 12 weeks, we're able to build in a capability that takes you to 150 kilowatts a rack. And what\u2019s important about that to put a little context on it, is that supports three NVIDIA H100 systems with them a single rack. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s really \u2013 we\u2019re seeing in a lot of the form factors coming to market. And I think the state of the play today is the latest GB200s from NVIDIA as well. We\u2019re constantly staying aligned to how we can support a lot of that infrastructure coming to market.\nOperator: The next question is from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Okay, that's a great quarter. But Andy, I guess a couple of questions, if I could. So this quarter was so strong in the wake of a record quarter in 1Q, a far from record quarter in 2Q, it kind of, I think, scrambles people's expectations about how we think about what's the new normal and when we were talking about the first half, we were saying, well, it was a record first half. And the average of the first half was about $200 million in new bookings. And now we got this crazy number in the third quarter. Just could you level set people now that we've kind of run the bell about what is the new normal for this? And then the second question was just related to, I think what we just heard, which was that like the first quarter, record quarter, which was 50% AI bookings, the third quarter, a record quarter is also 50% AI bookings which suggests that we're having record everything else to? And could you speak to what is driving that? Thank you.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, David. So maybe I'll try to tackle in reverse. I think it's very important what you just highlight there we're estimating based on numerous data points we have in terms of infrastructure, customer references, applications, estimation of AI today, that could be changing down the road. These customers, as you can see from our lease terms starting 10, 15 year contracts, and we have the ability to retrofit our infrastructure along the way. But I think it's important that the core demand fundamentals that preexisted before Gen AI came on the scene are still massive and growing, be it digital transformation for enterprise and hybrid IT and cloud computing. I'm hoping to get a lot more questions on the highlight of $66 million in 0-1 megawatt interconnection. That's up 20% over our prior record nearly 150 new logos this has not just been about just big large capacity blocks. This is what we've been spending many years in making -- and certainly, our execution has been growing and the fall through on that category has been a major contributor and more to come on that front. Going back to your definition of the new normal. A couple of data points that we highlighted two quarters ago that I think are important. First quarter record was based on 10% more megawatts and 60% higher prices. This quarter record is on top of that, 70% more volume, again, on 30% higher prices versus the prior record we just said. So these -- both levers, the volume and the price are contributing to this growth algorithm. When I look at it, I think there's two important other takeaways. We're not going to be able to put up a record quarter like this in Q4, especially in a quarter with so many holidays approaching us. There's no question like that. But if you look at our inventory blocks, we do have a runway to repeat this record down the road. There's no question. I don't think we top ticked for Digital in any regard, that\u2019s one thing. Two, a lot of these signings are really, call it, turning into long-term contracts with great escalations that are going to commence in late 2025 and 2026 and really hopefully translating into long-term sustainable growth that flows from the top line down to the bottom line. That\u2019s another big piece of the composition. And lastly, I try not to focus necessarily on just the fluctuations in the signings. But let\u2019s look at our backlog. After a record commencement quarter \u2013 during the quarter, we\u2019re in a record backlog that represents, call it, 20% of our revenue base today. And that record backlog not necessarily maybe next quarter, but I think that record backlog has a lot of potential to keep growing and derisking our revenue run rate for years to come.\nOperator: Next question is from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Atkin: Thank you. So just given the strong backlog and inventory blocks that you've talked about, just wondering, if you could talk about the implications for future CapEx levels given all the demand and delivery ahead as well as balance sheet leverage goals. Thank you.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Jon. I'm going to pass it over to Matt to walk you through those elements.\nMatthew Mercier: Sure. Thanks, Jon. So look, I think in terms of CapEx, we're sitting here today, our CapEx for '24. We narrowed it down. We're still within the range. I think for '25, as we look forward, I mean, we'll obviously give more specific guidance as we get to the fourth quarter, but just considering where we are in terms of the megawatts under construction, I don't suspect that it will be lower than what we're seeing for '24 and again, we'll give more as we look ahead towards guidance at the start of the year. But I think probably somewhat more important and going to your second point, from a balance sheet perspective, we're sitting here today, given all the things we've done to put the balance sheet back in place where we're already at our leverage targets. We've got $5 billion of liquidity and ultimately, we've -- I think we've got ahead of, and we've -- our plan, we prudently funded, I think, 325 with a view that we'll be able to stay within those leverage targets as well.\nOperator: The next question is from Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Choe: Hi. I wanted to follow up on these large package deals. You've done two of them now. How many more are out there that can be done? And is that driving the 4% escalation in the large deals or is 4% kind of something that you're looking at for all deals that are being done?\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Richard. So taking the escalation first. We have, for some time now been looking to push on all the levers on our business, and it's whether it's rates, returns, duration of contracts. And that was, I think -- I believe we were a leader when CPI (ph) was escalating to kind of bring more CPI clauses into our contracts and our escalations, and especially the larger contracts, even moving up and up for some time now. Obviously, when you have core handful of larger deals, having the higher escalation certainly helps the weighting along the way. And going to your prior question on packaged deals. Listen, this is very episodic. I think the good news is, even if you take off our largest mark-to-markets, we're still at cash mark-to-market like close to about 6%, 7% on the high end of our guidance on the cash mark-to-market. So one specific deal that you referred to done really underlying deals were also great renewals as well. In terms of more, this is again, it\u2019s a product of having a large installed customer base, which you can see from our top customer role, having customers in 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 locations around the world to help them. And in times like today, we\u2019re seeing some customers having real business needs and urgency around their requirements and being able to come a table with a holistic solution to help them that brings kind of these packages to the table. So again, I can\u2019t promise them in any given year or any given quarter, but I think it speaks to breadth of relationships and using all the tools in our toolkit to maximize our growth formula.\nOperator: The next question is from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Great. Appreciate you taking the question. So just curious, I know you have about 3 gigawatts of land in Shell that haven't been developed yet. But given the size and the speed of the deals that you're leasing up now, how are you thinking about maintaining that runway either from new land in existing markets, potentially new markets, where you could extend your reach even further? And then separately, you touched on it a little bit on Northern Virginia. I think we've seen some reports here as long as a seven year wait time for power in parts of that footprint. I think you said, you still have some capacity blocks in Manassas and in Ashburn. So maybe just an update on power delivery within your footprint would be helpful. Thank you.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Eric. I'll take the second part first and then hand it over to Greg to speak to what he's been spending a lot of time on this year. In Northern Virginia, I highlighted those are two major -- those markets were two of our largest capacity signings went into and in those markets, we have adjacent buildings literally identical sizes. So almost 100-megawatt IT load in both our Digital Dallas and then a similar one in Manassas. And they're coming on in short order not necessarily call it, early 2025. But one of the two, I think, can be brought into late 2025, potentially certainly 2026. And thereafter, we've got another 230-ish in the next series of buildings, where actually the power will be delivered with more substation and it's really called substation components on our end that will push those deliveries, call it closer to 2027. So that starts tipping away and call it getting when you add that all up closer to, call it, 400 to 450 of Digital Dallas and rounding up 200 megawatts in total of Manassas, which leaves us another 0.5 gigawatt at least at Digital Dallas another couple -- we've got another 100 megawatts not in Digital Dallas, in Northern Virginia. So long runway of growth and I would say, capacity blocks as their deliveries keep getting near and year and time goes by, it just keeps getting more and more precious. Greg, why don't you speak to a little bit of what we've been doing on the -- adding to that on the other end of our supply chain?\nGregory Wright: Yeah. Thanks, Andy. Thanks for the question, Eric. Eric, I think the first thing to highlight is Andy's point about our buildable capacity on balance sheet. So, clearly, within existing markets, we have over 3 gigawatts of buildable capacity. So I think when you think about the context of where new growth is going to come from, that's pretty sizable. I think there's probably very few that have that kind of pipeline, that we can bring to service in a relatively short period of time. So look, I guess I would summarize is, we're buying land primarily in our existing markets. buying land, purchasing power and the like, and really across the globe, whether it\u2019s North America, South America, Europe, particularly in the flat markets, Africa, particularly South Africa, Johannesburg and Cape Town and then throughout the major markets in APAC. So, that strategy hasn\u2019t changed. We still think that\u2019s the best risk-adjusted return on our capital. And with that said, we\u2019re selectively looking at new markets, but that will not be the primary driver of our growth on the development front.\nOperator: The next question is from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you. So you've talked to us earlier about looking at some markets where you've seen a lot of data center demand popping up and the long-term visibility is a little bit less clear, and you're kind of avoiding some of those as you're looking at some of these larger deployments. Are you still holding to that? And how should we think about that? And then how are you set up for funding for these developments and thoughts on capital for the next 12 months? Thanks.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Frank. So -- and I think this dovetails well with Greg's answer. What we're doing is continuing to focus on markets that we believe a robust and diverse demand. That is, call it, enterprise digital transformation, hybrid IT demand, service provider, data cloud demand as well as various stages of AI demand. We believe that certainly exist and has for some time in our, call it, 50 metropolitan areas where we're operating today, call it, runway in addition to operating capacity growth 3 plus gigawatts. And we are -- I think that dovetail Greg's point, we're expanding into markets where we're operating today, but maybe now at a bigger scale, a bigger presence, i.e., markets we're looking at where we are the major player in the connectivity hubs, or have a strong enterprise hand but a much smaller scale or hyperscale plan and looking at those as adding to our footprint in those markets. What we're not doing, which I think is even more relevant, is chasing demand for demand stake to market that we just don't believe are there for the long term. I'm not suggesting data centers and demand won't be in some of those markets, and there'll be opportunities for one-off builds and contracts with customers. But we've been a company now for just reaching our 20 years as a public company. We've been through cycles before. And we're looking to generate long-term sustainable growth. And within a key element when it comes to that is having a robust and diverse customer demand. So when renewals do come, you can maintain your pricing power and generate that sustainable growth.\nOperator: The next question is from Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nIrvin Liu: Hi. Thank you for the question and congrats on the strong bookings. You indicated that you were positioned for acceleration multiple times in your prepared remarks. And if I recall correctly, you previously also said that 2025 growth should be somewhere closer to mid-single digits. But is it safe to assume that based on where your commencement schedule looks like today, there is potential for upside versus this growth expectation? And if so, how should we be thinking about your medium growth -- medium-term growth algorithm?\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Irvin. I'll ask Matt to unpack the 2025 and the financial algorithm from there.\nMatthew Mercier: Yeah. Thanks, Irvin. I feel like I think I lost the back because I thought for sure the growth question will come before the first 15 minutes. So -- but thanks. So look, I think I think a few things, I've been pretty consistent, I think, all year in terms of our mid-single digit growth for '25 and setting that as a foundation and keep in mind, that's in spite of doing, call it, 1.5 turns of deleveraging over the course of the last 12 months to 18 months. We continue to focus on our objective to improve the company's long-term sustainable growth profile. You've seen that in the results we put up. Some of those things accrue to the bottom line a little faster than the others. Obviously, our renewal spreads in the 0-1 comes in the financials a little bit sooner. The greater than 1 megawatt takes a little bit longer, and you see most of that in terms of our backlog, which is already at $350 million for next year. And I think even more importantly is at $300 million for 2026. So, which if you looked at that same step a year ago, in terms of where that would have been, kind of in a two year forward view. It's $200 million more. So again, this quarter really derisks the plan to achieve the goals that we set out, which provides a solid foundation for accelerating growth, not only in \u201825, but even further beyond that. And I would say we were confident in what we said before about that, and we're even more confident now.\nOperator: The next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJames Schneider: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, if you can maybe talk a little bit about the complexion of the bookings in the quarter. And roughly, how many customers kind of contributing to the sort of the 60% or 50% or 80% mark of that, meaning the concentration of customers in that booking. Can you maybe talk to any of the -- whether any of those customers of substantial size were, in fact, new customers in the quarter?\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Jim. So why don't I ask Colin to kind of walk through some of the highlights. Maybe Colin you can try to break it down to two categories, one by one.\nColin McLean: Sure. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Jim. Appreciate it. Yeah. Obviously, successful quarter, a lot of impact across the board, both new customers, existing customers and growth. We have about 1,000 customers booked within the platform in Q3. A good chunk of those 149 were new logos. This predominantly came in the commercial segment. We think about the segmentation of customers within global large enterprise in commercial, the large number of new logos come out of that commercial basis, but we're putting more and more focus on large enterprise. So in that $66 million of bookings, we had about 52% of that on a large enterprise, which is an all-time high. So again, that's a growing segment with our business. Again, I think that references to what Andy's talking about the diverse demand that's hitting PlatformDIGITAL across digital transformation, cloud and AI. So we continue to see that characteristics at our pipeline. Current pipeline for Q4 aggregate all-time high, particularly key strong characteristics in the 0-1 megawatt variety. Maybe a little bit more context as to what we're seeing across the platform and just double down on one of the questions that proximity matters. So our core networks in terms of bookings variety 80% plus were in our primary markets, our top 20 markets. So we continue to see strength there, continue to see indirect focus, so about 26% of our bookings were indirect future pipeline, about 30%, so that's going to continue to grow. And frankly, our flexibility to support the various density and scalability requirements for our clients will continue to be a big value proposition for our clients. So this adds up to a pretty robust quarter, very robust in terms of number of customers, new logos and types of customers landing up on the business.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Elias with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMichael Elias: Hey. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations to whole Digital Realty team on a really exceptional quarter. I want to switch focus and actually talk about the enterprise. The great bookings in the enterprise segment. What I'm curious about is, kind of what changed there from the prior run rate of bookings where you were on? Was it that the enterprise backdrop got better for you guys or was it something that you shifted in terms of your go-to-market? And just as part of that, what are you seeing in terms of the ability to price up enterprise customers, i.e., what are you seeing on the renewal spread side with them? Are we getting past some of that price hike fatigue? Those are my questions. And again, congratulations to you guys.\nAndrew Power: Thank you, Michael. Before I -- Colin touched a little bit on this in his last question, but before I turn it back to him, going back to your pricing question, and this kind of dovetails what I think maybe Frank asked about spreads and bumps. I mean, we've been looking at, call it, making sure we have a strong value proposition for our customers. This has been many years in the work and building momentum, and you've seen the success grow. And certainly, this is a milestone quarter. But I don't -- definitely, this will not be a record in that category. We're going to build on that record, that is an incredibly important strategic priority to this company, given the long-term value it provided to customers and the growth it provides. If you look in the 0-1 megawatt signings category, we've been flat based on the cash mark-to-markets. They\u2019re up, call it, 4.5% on an LTM basis. I think they're up about 70 basis points just quarter-over-quarter. You can see that the asking rates as well. I think we'll have more -- we have more opportunity to go on the interconnection side in terms of continuing to make sure our value we bring to the customers is appropriately commercialized. And that's even with a record interconnection signing in this quarter. So -- we're looking at all levers. And again, it's about giving more value to the customer. It's about their infrastructure and their power densities. It is about helping them connect it all pain points. It's about being their one-stop global shop from no matter what side of the deployment of workflow be it, enterprise hybrid IT, cloud or certainly AI, which is starting to percolate in that category. Colin deserves a tremendous amount of credit as well. And -- but I'll turn it over to him to kind of walk through what his insights on the inflection this quarter as well.\nColin McLean: Yeah. Thanks, Andy. I appreciate it. I think one point to make is this is not one quarter in the making. This is a multiyear transformation, a platform oriented company servicing service providers and enterprises. And the way that you do that is you make your platform more attractive. So we announced a couple of [indiscernible] this quarter. One in Dallas. We did a couple in Europe, in Zurich and Amsterdam, that's material in attracting enterprises. Andy mentioned that the digital transformation is now in full steam, but we still think it's early innings. So we think that our platform will continue to grow because enterprises see value in PlatformDIGITAL. One key metric that I'll leave you with, that's a really good sign of a platform-oriented approach of our exports were a record 43% 0-1 megawatt. That's material that shows customers sustain value, but they're expanding across the platform into other geos. So again, strong contribution across the board for the team to bring this to fruition.\nOperator: The next question is from Georgi Dinkov with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nGeorgi Dinkov: Hey. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the strong results. So I just noticed the development yields are now 12%, which is higher compared to the second quarter. And given the strong market rent growth, can we see development yields move even higher? And is there a cap on how high they can go? And also, can you just provide more color on what the contracts on the development pipeline look like in terms of land and caps on the renewals? Thank you.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Georgi. So again, this goes back to the accelerated development CapEx sizably 50% higher. And we did that based on demand. So you could see, overall, we're close to north of 75% preleased. In North America, now 97% preleased. Some of the signings in North America, in particular, actually, I've called on the longer end of our sign commencing trail. So they were resigning capacity that the Shell is just getting delivered. Last quarter, we signed nearly 50-ish megawatt deal in the land state. So they're close to two years, so they elongated. So that means we didn't sell just the nearest term capacity blocks we sold at what the customer needed given the facts and circumstances. We're doing everything we can to maintain, if not improve our yields. That's a product of making sure we're scaling our infrastructure and economies of scale and where we deliver and obviously, seizing upon the right rates and translating to better returns as products in that development life cycle of to roll up. In today's market, we're looking to have, again, all the levers of the commercials in the discussion, rates, escalations, real estate, tax base tops and certainly, renewal options, we\u2019re not entertaining called capping when those contracts come to.\nOperator: The next question is from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Niknam: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats on the question. I will keep it to one question, and I know that was specified upfront. On the AI front, I know you mentioned there was about half of your bookings. Is there any contribution from enterprise or sovereign players or is it primarily traditional hyperscalers and newer AI model builders. Thanks.\nAndrew Power: First off, Matt, thank you for being a role follower. Really appreciate that. Chris, why don't you give a little percentage, 50% overall, but how much in the call it, enterprise and then give us a little more color on some of the AI demand we've seen upon in the quarter and also within the pipeline.\nChristopher Sharp: Yeah. No, I appreciate the question, Matt. And so there's a lot happening across AI, which I think is at the core of your question. So it's not just about the hyperscalers. And I think it\u2019s pretty important to understand that the demand is pretty broad across all of the segments. And one just to particular highlight, and I don't speak about any customer specific details. But one of the things that we have great history with NVIDIA, right? And so we've been DGX certified, one of the leading providers, 30-plus data center is already pre-certified, but what's important to us is just yesterday, we were able to host Jensen Wong, CEO of NVIDIA and a kickoff of the largest DGX supercomputer in Europe. And so, it's just very exciting to support Novo Nordisk Foundation in that overall effort. And like, one of the things that I think is pretty interesting that highlight it is that Jensen quoted that it was the factor of intelligence. So something like that is fundamental in showing this private AI deployments are very relevant in coming into our overall portfolio. And the last piece I\u2019d like to just say is just to highlight that, that Digital Realty is foundational in that, and we\u2019re able to do it in a sustainable way because that facility runs on 100% renewable power.\nOperator: The next question is from David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nDavid Guarino: Thanks. On your greater than 1 megawatt new leasing in the Americas, rents on a GAAP basis were almost 225-kilowatt this quarter. I'm guessing Manassas in Chicago, you called out were below that number. But does that suggest that hyperscale rental rates in Ashburn are pushing close to that 225 or maybe even 250-kilowatt number? Just any color you could share on the relative spread between markets would be helpful.\nAndrew Power: So -- those are GAAP rates, just a reminder. So you got to take the duration of the lease. You know the drill, David, in terms and the bumps. So they've certainly pushed them over. I can tell you in Ashburn, we had multiple customers, call it, face rates in the call it, 175 or 200 or higher, just slightly over 200, and call it, 8 megawatts or higher type of capacity blocks. Where we go from here? I'm not sure, you're going to see this repeat itself immediately. But the other markets have been catching up, but I think we'll continue to catch up over time, certainly, the comparables in the Chicago, the Dallas that have always trailed, the Ashburn trailing the Santa Clara and now trailing in Ashburn. And I do think you're just going to see more and more markets coalesce at these higher rates over time.\nDavid Guarino: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nNicholas Del Deo: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. You've obviously got a ton of development work underway that's going to grow. I guess, can you talk a little bit about the steps you're taking to ensure that you're able to deliver all that on time, on budget without hiccups?\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Nick. So, first off, it's very important that we just didn't call it the [indiscernible] income and just get it yesterday. This company has been solely focused on this business for 20 years now. And we've been in these markets that I really touched on. We've been consistently operating, assembling land, building and delivering for our customers for many, many years. And in green to the communities with the utility providers. As we saw this opportunity evolve in scaling certainly came to mind, and that is what we did. -- that was feeling our supply chain. Our teams have call it, a great relationships with their vendors and making sure that we are future proofing those supply chains and being very collaborative with our partners. If one utility, some switch gear that we have in one market, we can bring it to another market, we're bringing those economies of scale. We're certainly scaling our team as well operationally. We're delivering a lot of capacity for our customers, and we're investing in our team, in our systems and actually the great training development of our team along the way. And then lastly, the capital. Massively capital intensive business and the great work of our organization over the last year to supplement our use of public equity with some great private investment partnerships, both on the stabilizing development. We see a really fantastic runway of capital intensive growth here interesting the fruits of our labor in terms of the rates and the returns bearing fruit, and we see this playing out for years to come. And we want to make sure that we have stable partners to help fund this business to generate long-term growth for our customers and our shareholders.\nOperator: That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power for his closing remarks. Andy, please go ahead.\nAndrew Power: Thank you, Gary. Digital Realty posted a remarkable quarter in 3Q, reflecting the strong demand environment and demonstrating how Digital Realty is meeting the challenge to support our customers around the world. We set a number of records throughout our business, raise guidance and position the company for accelerating growth in 2025 and beyond. I am extremely proud of how our team executed to deliver this quarter's results. We are excited about the outlook for data center demand and our position in the market. But most importantly, we remain focused on seizing on the opportunity at hand. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. I'd like to thank our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world turning. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Christopher Sharp",
            "content": "Yeah. No, I appreciate it. And I appreciate the question. This is something that we've been contemplating for many years. So we've seen a lot of the cloud infrastructure densifying, but then as artificial intelligence has come to market, just working on the data center design, and we've talked about this about modularity and the modularity around cooling and being able to maximize the utilization of air, and I think a lot of understand that liquid is coming into play, which is a core component that we've always anticipated and how we can retrofit in an efficient fashion to bring that liquid in to meet this demand on a case-by-case basis. And so I think that's one of the critical elements that we've always watched in the market. I think the other thing is the capacity block. Just the sheer sizes that you just heard Andy walk you through that's also very aligned to what a lot of the AI use cases are looking for. And I think one of the things we're always watching is how inference comes into play. And part of the data center design is also the interconnectivity of that. And so how we allow those different types of AI environments, be it inference, be it different types of recursive models, where how this advanced solutions are coming to market, that's core to what we've been watching and understanding at a very granular level. And then to Colin's point, I think it's important for us to understand how that gets fitted out within the data center. So we've launched an offering called HD Colo a while back. And I think what's interesting about what we're able to do with HD Colo across 30 markets, 30 metros, 170 facilities within 12 weeks, we're able to build in a capability that takes you to 150 kilowatts a rack. And what's important about that to put a little context on it, is that supports three NVIDIA H100 systems with them a single rack. And so that's what's really \u2013 we're seeing in a lot of the form factors coming to market. And I think the state of the play today is the latest GB200s from NVIDIA as well. We're constantly staying aligned to how we can support a lot of that infrastructure coming to market. Yeah. No, I appreciate the question, Matt. And so there's a lot happening across AI, which I think is at the core of your question. So it's not just about the hyperscalers. And I think it's pretty important to understand that the demand is pretty broad across all of the segments. And one just to particular highlight, and I don't speak about any customer specific details. But one of the things that we have great history with NVIDIA, right?

            "content": "Yeah. Thanks, Andy. Thanks for the question, Eric. Eric, I think the first thing to highlight is Andy's point about our buildable capacity on balance sheet. So, clearly, within existing markets, we have over 3 gigawatts of buildable capacity. So I think when you think about the context of where new growth is going to come from, that's pretty sizable. I think there's probably very few that have that kind of pipeline, that we can bring to service in a relatively short period of time. So look, I guess I would summarize is, we're buying land primarily in our existing markets. buying land, purchasing power and the like, and really across the globe, whether it's North America, South America, Europe, particularly in the flat markets, Africa, particularly South Africa, Johannesburg and Cape Town and then throughout the major markets in APAC. So, that strategy hasn't changed. We still think that's the best risk-adjusted return on our capital. And with that said, we're selectively looking at new markets, but that will not be the primary driver of our growth on the development front."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Matthew Mercier",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our third quarter results. We signed $521 million of new leases in the third quarter, of which $450 million fell into the greater than 1 megawatt category and was heavily weighted toward the Americas. We also signed $50 million of 0-1 megawatt leases and $16 million of interconnection bookings. Each of these figures were new records for Digital Realty. Importantly, more than 75% of the dollar volume of leases signed include annual rent escalators of 4% or greater, which bolsters the growth profile associated with our portfolio of long-term hyperscale leases. Our backlog at Digital Realty share increased by more than 60% sequentially to $859 million at the end of September, as new leasing dramatically outpaced $180 million of record commencements in the quarter. To offer some perspective, the backlog now represents 20% of this quarter's annualized data center revenues and we expect more than 85% of these leases to commence by the end of 2026. Looking ahead a $100 million of the backlog is scheduled to commence by the end of this year, with another $350 million scheduled to commence next year, and over $300 million already slated to commence in 2026, setting us up for accelerating multiyear growth. During the third quarter, we signed $258 million of renewal leases at a 15.2% increase on a cash basis, driving year-to-date cash renewal spreads to 10.5%. Similar to the first quarter, these robust releasing spreads were driven by a package deal that pulled forward a sizable renewal that was not scheduled to expire for several more years. Excluding this package deal, overall renewal spreads were still a healthy 5.8%, which is more consistent with the 5% to 7% guidance we previously provided for 2024. While the package deals demonstrate the levers available to capitalize on the current pricing environment and also reflect our customers' views of the overall market, they are less predictable in nature. Breaking down renewals by product category, cash renewal spreads in the 0-1 megawatt segment were up a healthy 4.5% in the third quarter, while releasing spreads in the greater than 1 megawatt segment were up by over 30%. Excluding the package deal greater than 1 megawatt renewals were still up 8.6%. For the quarter, churn remained low and well controlled at 1.5%. In terms of earnings, we reported third quarter core FFO of $1.67 per share, reflecting continued healthy growth in revenues and adjusted EBITDA. Data center revenue grew by 7.5% year-over-year as the combination of improved renewal spreads, rent escalators and year-to-date commencements more than offset the drag associated with \u2013 the more than $2.5 billion of capital recycling activity since the middle of 2023. Pro forma for the transaction activity data center revenues were up 10% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 11% year-over-year, principally due to a near 200 basis point improvement in margin from the flow-through of higher data center and interconnection revenues with improved pricing. Same capital NOI growth increased by 0.8% year-over-year in the third quarter, as 2.5% growth in data center revenue was offset by higher property operating costs and roughly 200 basis points of bad debt reserves in the quarter. Year-to-date, same capital cash NOI has increased by 2.6%, which continues to be negatively impacted by about 200 basis points of power margin headwinds year-over-year, given the elevated utility prices in EMEA in 2023. Moving on to our investment activity. We spent $651 million on consolidated development in the third quarter. Gross development spend at 100% share was $855 million in the quarter. Given the strong demand for data center capacity, we doubled our development underway in the Americas and added more projects in EMEA for an almost 50% increase in our pipeline, ending the quarter with 644 megawatts under construction. More specifically, we delivered just 36 megawatts of new capacity in the quarter, while we backfilled the pipeline with another 244 megawatts of new starts at 100% share. The overall pipeline is now 74% preleased, up from 66% at the end of 2Q, with an average expected yield of 12%. Almost all the development underway in the Americas is preleased with an expected stabilized yield of 13.6%. Some development capacity remains in both EMEA and APAC, with both currently expecting stabilized yields over 10%. Over the first-nine months of the year, we spent $2.4 billion in development CapEx at 100% share, which has been balanced by nearly $900 million of partner contributions, keeping us on track and well within the range of our original full year spending expectations. Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet in the third quarter, with over $800 million of equity raised on the ATM. On the debt side, we paid off $250 million gilts in July and added an EUR850 million green bond in September. We also upsized and extended our credit facilities to $4.5 billion in September. At the end of the third quarter, we had nearly $5 billion of total liquidity, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 5.4 times. Moving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is over four years, and our weighted average interest rate is 2.8%. Approximately 85% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 89% of our net debt is fixed rate and 96% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have no remaining debt maturities until early 2025, and the maturities remained well laddered through 2033. Let me conclude with our guidance. We are raising our core FFO guidance range for the full year of 2024 to $6.65 to $6.75 per share, increasing the low end of the range by $0.05 per share and maintaining the high end. The increase in our guide at the midpoint of the range reflects the strength in our year-to-date leasing and commencements and the benefit of stronger than expected renewal pricing, partly balanced by the impact of customer bankruptcies in the second half of this year and balance sheet positioning to capitalize on the robust opportunity we are seeing. We are also adjusting our total revenue guidance to reflect the impact of lower utility expense reimbursements and are increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance to reflect better than expected leasing volumes and higher pricing. Accordingly, we are also adjusting the following operating assumptions. Reflecting our success on cash renewals to date, we are increasing the full year range to 8% to 10% from 5% to 7%. We are also tightening full year same-store guidance to a range of 2.75% to 3.25%. In terms of investing expectations for 2024, we tightened the range of our net share development spend to $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion and maintained our recurring maintenance CapEx ranges. Lastly, on financing, the EUR850 million bond raise was completed slightly ahead of previous expectations, but was mitigated by higher short-term rates than we anticipated at the beginning of this year. Looking to the fourth quarter, Core FFO per share remains poised to increase as the momentum from strong year-to-date leasing increasingly contributes to bottom line results. Looking out in 2025 and beyond, Digital Realty's growth remains poised to accelerate for 2024 levels as the fundamental environment for data centers remain strong, and our robust backlog commences. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? Sure. Thanks, Jon. So look, I think in terms of CapEx, we're sitting here today, our CapEx for '24. We narrowed it down. We're still within the range. I think for '25, as we look forward, I mean, we'll obviously give more specific guidance as we get to the fourth quarter, but just considering where we are in terms of the megawatts under construction, I don't suspect that it will be lower than what we're seeing for '24 and again, we'll give more as we look ahead towards guidance at the start of the year. But I think probably somewhat more important and going to your second point, from a balance sheet perspective, we're sitting here today, given all the things we've done to put the balance sheet back in place where we're already at our leverage targets. We've got $5 billion of liquidity and ultimately, we've -- I think we've got ahead of, and we've -- our plan, we prudently funded, I think, 325 with a view that we'll be able to stay within those leverage targets as well. Yeah. Thanks, Irvin. I feel like I think I lost the back because I thought for sure the growth question will come before the first 15 minutes. So -- but thanks. So look, I think I think a few things, I've been pretty consistent, I think, all year in terms of our mid-single digit growth for '25 and setting that as a foundation and keep in mind, that's in spite of doing, call it, 1.5 turns of deleveraging over the course of the last 12 months to 18 months. We continue to focus on our objective to improve the company's long-term sustainable growth profile. You've seen that in the results we put up. Some of those things accrue to the bottom line a little faster than the others. Obviously, our renewal spreads in the 0-1 comes in the financials a little bit sooner. The greater than 1 megawatt takes a little bit longer, and you see most of that in terms of our backlog, which is already at $350 million for next year. And I think even more importantly is at $300 million for 2026. So, which if you looked at that same step a year ago, in terms of where that would have been, kind of in a two year forward view. It's $200 million more. So again, this quarter really derisks the plan to achieve the goals that we set out, which provides a solid foundation for accelerating growth, not only in \u201825, but even further beyond that. And I would say we were confident in what we said before about that, and we're even more confident now."

            "name": "Colin McLean",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Andy. Yeah, Contribution was significant about 50% of our overall bookings came from AI. The larger tranche capacity, which obviously our heritage comes well supported from, it is a real value in these use cases. These large capacity blocks are in high demand across our core markets. And so clients are certainly looking to take advantage of that. I would also say, it's a growing part of our less than 1 megawatt framework, Chris and team have rolled out a substantial program in HD Colo, which you can probably highlight in just a moment that really fits in the sweet spot of where we're taking our platform on the whole, so Chris? Sure. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Jim. Appreciate it. Yeah. Obviously, successful quarter, a lot of impact across the board, both new customers, existing customers and growth. We have about 1,000 customers booked within the platform in Q3. A good chunk of those 149 were new logos. This predominantly came in the commercial segment. We think about the segmentation of customers within global large enterprise in commercial, the large number of new logos come out of that commercial basis, but we're putting more and more focus on large enterprise. So in that $66 million of bookings, we had about 52% of that on a large enterprise, which is an all-time high. So again, that's a growing segment with our business. Again, I think that references to what Andy's talking about the diverse demand that's hitting PlatformDIGITAL across digital transformation, cloud and AI. So we continue to see that characteristics at our pipeline. Current pipeline for Q4 aggregate all-time high, particularly key strong characteristics in the 0-1 megawatt variety. Maybe a little bit more context as to what we're seeing across the platform and just double down on one of the questions that proximity matters. So our core networks in terms of bookings variety 80% plus were in our primary markets, our top 20 markets. So we continue to see strength there, continue to see indirect focus, so about 26% of our bookings were indirect future pipeline, about 30%, so that's going to continue to grow. And frankly, our flexibility to support the various density and scalability requirements for our clients will continue to be a big value proposition for our clients. So this adds up to a pretty robust quarter, very robust in terms of number of customers, new logos and types of customers landing up on the business. Yeah. Thanks, Andy. I appreciate it. I think one point to make is this is not one quarter in the making. This is a multiyear transformation, a platform oriented company servicing service providers and enterprises. And the way that you do that is you make your platform more attractive. So we announced a couple of [indiscernible] this quarter. One in Dallas. We did a couple in Europe, in Zurich and Amsterdam, that's material in attracting enterprises. Andy mentioned that the digital transformation is now in full steam, but we still think it's early innings. So we think that our platform will continue to grow because enterprises see value in PlatformDIGITAL. One key metric that I'll leave you with, that's a really good sign of a platform-oriented approach of our exports were a record 43% 0-1 megawatt. That's material that shows customers sustain value, but they're expanding across the platform into other geos. So again, strong contribution across the board for the team to bring this to fruition."

            "name": "Andrew Power",
            "content": "Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. I don't often start this way, but this quarter was certainly one for the record books. As Jordan noted, we posted record results across a broad array of metrics. These results are the product of Digital Realty's team capitalizing on a favorable demand backdrop, but are also a testament to our efforts to enhance our value proposition and to drive long-term sustainable growth. Demand for data center capacity remains strong, both for larger capacity blocks in our core markets and to support continued growth in both cloud and digital transformation. We are well positioned to take advantage of this favorable environment, given our full spectrum strategy, our global footprint across six continents and a robust land bank that can support 3 plus gigawatts of incremental development, together with an investment grade balance sheet that is complemented by a diverse group of capital partners and the expertise to put it all together and operate these facilities on behalf of the world's leading technology companies and enterprises. Highlights for the third quarter were abundant and include $521 million of new leases signed at Digital Realty share, more than double our prior record in the first quarter of this year. Greater than 1 megawatt bookings in North America led the way, driven by large hyperscale deals in Manassas, Ashburn and Chicago. New leasing volume in this segment was up more than 75% from the 1Q record, while pricing moved up nearly 30%. Included in our greater than 1 megawatt signings was a large lease in our hyperscale development venture in Manassas. Like, all of our JVs, we report these leasing results at our share or 20% in this case. The total leasing into our facilities at 100% share was in excess of $700 million in the third quarter, demonstrating the significant appetite for data center capacity. Given the size of those numbers, it might be easy to overlook a very strategic and important milestone with a sizable record quarter in our 0-1 plus interconnection business, which saw more than $66 million of new bookings, topping our prior record in this product category by over 20%, with particular strength in small deals under 0.5 megawatt, which accounted for 80% of our 0-1 megawatt leasing. Not to be forgotten, new interconnection bookings also hit a record in the quarter. We view these bookings very favorably as it further validates our full spectrum product strategy and provides us with growing momentum in a segment with durable pricing power and steadily increasing customer demand. Our strength in this category was also characterized by a record 149 new logos for the quarter. PlatformDIGITAL offers our customers the convenience and simplicity to manage their global data center needs and is reflected by record export activity in the third quarter, which were 50% plus higher year-over-year with Americas to EMEA exports leading the way, followed by APAC into the Americas. With a record $859 million backlog of favorably priced leases, largely commencing over the next two years, we are positioned for accelerating top line and bottom line growth. In support of our customers' growing requirements, and all of the new leasing accomplished in the quarter, we also substantially scaled our development pipeline in the third quarter, increasing the capacity underway by almost 50% to 644 megawatts under construction today. And we maintained another 3 gigawatts of buildable IT load capacity in land and shell condition. As we noted last quarter, we also strengthened our value proposition in Europe with the acquisition of a densely connected enterprise data center campus in Slough. During the quarter, we also continued to bolster our balance sheet and diversify our capital sources through a combination of favorable debt and ATM issuances. Matt will provide more details on these activities in a few minutes. Over the past few weeks, we've seen several examples of the lengths that some hyperscalers will go to reserve enough power for their fast growing compute requirements. We've seen a deal to reactivate 3 mile Island, another hyperscaler partnering with an existing utility to develop small modular reactors and the third executing power purchase agreements to purchase nuclear energy for multiple SMRs that have yet to be built. These agreements are similar, in that they are seeking long-term carbon-free energy solutions to help power growing data center portfolios and speak to the longer-term demand outlook for data center capacity. Yet each of these plants is still years away from beginning to generate power, underscoring the value of lower capacity blocks today and perhaps for the next several years. And sourcing available power is just one piece of the data center infrastructure puzzle. Supply chain management, construction management and operating expertise are all challenges that customers rely on Digital Realty to solve, and they are clearly a critical aspect of the overall value proposition that we bring to the table. While the large hyperscale deals get plenty of focus, customers and partners are recognizing the value that Digital Realty's meeting place can bring to their private cloud and hybrid IT applications around the world. We continue to see a meaningful share of our 0-1 megawatt wins influenced by our partners, expanding our reach into more enterprises around the world. Our wins this quarter include a Global 2000 telecom provider who partners with one of our largest customers choosing PlatformDIGITAL to deploy a distributed cloud solution to alleviate geographic data gravity challenges. A leading health care provider and a new logo for Digital Realty, which also came to us from a partner, modernizing its infrastructure to take advantage of the cloud connectivity available on PlatformDIGITAL, while maintaining data compliance for personal health information privacy. Another new logo, an international financial institution critical to global financial and monetary policy, chose PlatformDIGITAL to secure their cloud requirements while maintaining global access. A Global 2000 technology company is expanding their presence on PlatformDIGITAL in support of its autonomous driving solution. A top 20 Japanese electronics and semiconductor manufacturer is joining PlatformDIGITAL through another partner as part of an integrated tech-refresh initiative where robust connectivity was a critical differentiator. And a global cloud optimization provider is deploying additional capacity on PlatformDIGITAL across two continents to support their expanding enterprise customer base, who require access to rich and scalable connectivity solutions. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our global ESG progress during the third quarter. We continue to lead the industry in green building IT capacity, the 178 megawatts certified in the last 12 months, while our Swiss team achieved the first ever Swiss Datacenter Efficiency Association Gold Plus certification for our data centers in Zurich. Digital Realty also continued to be recognized for ESG leadership, including Broad Group's Datacloud Global works 2024 for AI data center on the year, The Tech Capitals, Digital Infrastructure Action Global Award 2024 and Frost & Sullivan recognized our Japanese joint venture, MC Digital Realty with the 2024 Japan Data Center Services Company of the Year Award. Moving to Green Finance, where Digital continues to be a leader in the data center industry. During the quarter, we issued EUR850 million green bond, adding to Digital's long history of support for linking its debt to sustainable projects. Additionally, we maintained a sustainability linked pricing component on our new credit facility, further demonstrating the company's commitment to ESG. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment, while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier. And thanks, Mike. Really appreciate it. So going to your question, obviously, a quarter of this magnitude, any one of those sizable deals that slipped the quarter were really change the density of where our fourth quarter looks like. So I won't say there was zero pull forward. But at the same time, we are far from anywhere near selling that. Some of our largest signs during the quarter, selling the capacity blocks that are literally adjacent the most identically sized capacity blocks with nearing power deliveries in the very same markets we highlighted Manassas and Ashburn being one and two, and Chicago being three in terms of our top signings. Those specific markets, going to your second question, they are not ready -- the available capacity in those specific locations that comes next or not necessarily powered today, but those deliveries are approaching rapidly. And we have those in many markets, be it Dallas, Santa Clara in the U.S., EMEA, we have Frankfurt Paris, Amsterdam, Seoul, South Korea, as well as similar in South Africa and South America. And those all aggregate to north of 3 gigawatts of capacity, including Shell capacity that we can activate quickly. So \u2013 and last but not least, we also \u2013 as you saw in some of the release, we've not been sitting idle. We've made some very attractive additions including a parcel that will be adjacent to our Richardson campus in Dallas, I think approaches 80 megawatts of growth capacity and more to come. So I don't \u2013 I wouldn't call this as a massive pull forward. Quite frankly, the scaling of demand we're seeing to take place here, I think, is just overall restrained from numerous factors. Thanks, Jon. Really a massive team effort from obviously the leadership team on the call with the Florida's Digital Realty efforts globally to contribute to this type of quarter. Going to the second, then I'll hand it over to Chris and Colin to have an egg, the AI use cases and contributions from AI. Yes. We've seen some inflationary trends and build costs, bringing more higher power densities has been part of our heritage and that requires incremental CapEx spend. But the size of that as a percentage of the build is in the, call it, closer to single-digit percentile increases relative to what you've seen now in the rental rate movements that have well outpaced those inflationary elements. But maybe, Colin, can you just give us a little color on the composition from AI and then Chris can chime in on the -- what we're doing on the tech infrastructure front? Thanks, David. So maybe I'll try to tackle in reverse. I think it's very important what you just highlight there we're estimating based on numerous data points we have in terms of infrastructure, customer references, applications, estimation of AI today, that could be changing down the road. These customers, as you can see from our lease terms starting 10, 15 year contracts, and we have the ability to retrofit our infrastructure along the way. But I think it's important that the core demand fundamentals that preexisted before Gen AI came on the scene are still massive and growing, be it digital transformation for enterprise and hybrid IT and cloud computing. I'm hoping to get a lot more questions on the highlight of $66 million in 0-1 megawatt interconnection. That's up 20% over our prior record nearly 150 new logos this has not just been about just big large capacity blocks. This is what we've been spending many years in making -- and certainly, our execution has been growing and the fall through on that category has been a major contributor and more to come on that front. Going back to your definition of the new normal. A couple of data points that we highlighted two quarters ago that I think are important. First quarter record was based on 10% more megawatts and 60% higher prices. This quarter record is on top of that, 70% more volume, again, on 30% higher prices versus the prior record we just said. So these -- both levers, the volume and the price are contributing to this growth algorithm. When I look at it, I think there's two important other takeaways. We're not going to be able to put up a record quarter like this in Q4, especially in a quarter with so many holidays approaching us. There's no question like that. But if you look at our inventory blocks, we do have a runway to repeat this record down the road. There's no question. I don't think we top ticked for Digital in any regard, that's one thing. Two, a lot of these signings are really, call it, turning into long-term contracts with great escalations that are going to commence in late 2025 and 2026 and really hopefully translating into long-term sustainable growth that flows from the top line down to the bottom line. That's another big piece of the composition. And lastly, I try not to focus necessarily on just the fluctuations in the signings. But let's look at our backlog. After a record commencement quarter \u2013 during the quarter, we're in a record backlog that represents, call it, 20% of our revenue base today. And that record backlog not necessarily maybe next quarter, but I think that record backlog has a lot of potential to keep growing and derisking our revenue run rate for years to come. Thanks, Jon. I'm going to pass it over to Matt to walk you through those elements. Thanks, Richard. So taking the escalation first. We have, for some time now been looking to push on all the levers on our business, and it's whether it's rates, returns, duration of contracts. And that was, I think -- I believe we were a leader when CPI (ph) was escalating to kind of bring more CPI clauses into our contracts and our escalations, and especially the larger contracts, even moving up and up for some time now. Obviously, when you have core handful of larger deals, having the higher escalation certainly helps the weighting along the way. And going to your prior question on packaged deals. Listen, this is very episodic. I think the good news is, even if you take off our largest mark-to-markets, we're still at cash mark-to-market like close to about 6%, 7% on the high end of our guidance on the cash mark-to-market. So one specific deal that you referred to done really underlying deals were also great renewals as well. In terms of more, this is again, it's a product of having a large installed customer base, which you can see from our top customer role, having customers in 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 locations around the world to help them. And in times like today, we're seeing some customers having real business needs and urgency around their requirements and being able to come a table with a holistic solution to help them that brings kind of these packages to the table. So again, I can't promise them in any given year or any given quarter, but I think it speaks to breadth of relationships and using all the tools in our toolkit to maximize our growth formula. Thanks, Eric. I'll take the second part first and then hand it over to Greg to speak to what he's been spending a lot of time on this year. In Northern Virginia, I highlighted those are two major -- those markets were two of our largest capacity signings went into and in those markets, we have adjacent buildings literally identical sizes. So almost 100-megawatt IT load in both our Digital Dallas and then a similar one in Manassas. And they're coming on in short order not necessarily call it, early 2025. But one of the two, I think, can be brought into late 2025, potentially certainly 2026. And thereafter, we've got another 230-ish in the next series of buildings, where actually the power will be delivered with more substation and it's really called substation components on our end that will push those deliveries, call it closer to 2027. So that starts tipping away and call it getting when you add that all up closer to, call it, 400 to 450 of Digital Dallas and rounding up 200 megawatts in total of Manassas, which leaves us another 0.5 gigawatt at least at Digital Dallas another couple -- we've got another 100 megawatts not in Digital Dallas, in Northern Virginia. So long runway of growth and I would say, capacity blocks as their deliveries keep getting near and year and time goes by, it just keeps getting more and more precious. Greg, why don't you speak to a little bit of what we've been doing on the -- adding to that on the other end of our supply chain? Thanks, Frank. So -- and I think this dovetails well with Greg's answer. What we're doing is continuing to focus on markets that we believe a robust and diverse demand. That is, call it, enterprise digital transformation, hybrid IT demand, service provider, data cloud demand as well as various stages of AI demand. We believe that certainly exist and has for some time in our, call it, 50 metropolitan areas where we're operating today, call it, runway in addition to operating capacity growth 3 plus gigawatts. And we are -- I think that dovetail Greg's point, we're expanding into markets where we're operating today, but maybe now at a bigger scale, a bigger presence, i.e., markets we're looking at where we are the major player in the connectivity hubs, or have a strong enterprise hand but a much smaller scale or hyperscale plan and looking at those as adding to our footprint in those markets. What we're not doing, which I think is even more relevant, is chasing demand for demand stake to market that we just don't believe are there for the long term. I'm not suggesting data centers and demand won't be in some of those markets, and there'll be opportunities for one-off builds and contracts with customers. But we've been a company now for just reaching our 20 years as a public company. We've been through cycles before. And we're looking to generate long-term sustainable growth. And within a key element when it comes to that is having a robust and diverse customer demand. So when renewals do come, you can maintain your pricing power and generate that sustainable growth. Thanks, Irvin. I'll ask Matt to unpack the 2025 and the financial algorithm from there. Thanks, Jim. So why don't I ask Colin to kind of walk through some of the highlights. Maybe Colin you can try to break it down to two categories, one by one. Thank you, Michael. Before I -- Colin touched a little bit on this in his last question, but before I turn it back to him, going back to your pricing question, and this kind of dovetails what I think maybe Frank asked about spreads and bumps. I mean, we've been looking at, call it, making sure we have a strong value proposition for our customers. This has been many years in the work and building momentum, and you've seen the success grow. And certainly, this is a milestone quarter. But I don't -- definitely, this will not be a record in that category. We're going to build on that record, that is an incredibly important strategic priority to this company, given the long-term value it provided to customers and the growth it provides. If you look in the 0-1 megawatt signings category, we've been flat based on the cash mark-to-markets. They're up, call it, 4.5% on an LTM basis. I think they're up about 70 basis points just quarter-over-quarter. You can see that the asking rates as well. I think we'll have more -- we have more opportunity to go on the interconnection side in terms of continuing to make sure our value we bring to the customers is appropriately commercialized. And that's even with a record interconnection signing in this quarter. So -- we're looking at all levers. And again, it's about giving more value to the customer. It's about their infrastructure and their power densities. It is about helping them connect it all pain points. It's about being their one-stop global shop from no matter what side of the deployment of workflow be it, enterprise hybrid IT, cloud or certainly AI, which is starting to percolate in that category. Colin deserves a tremendous amount of credit as well. And -- but I'll turn it over to him to kind of walk through what his insights on the inflection this quarter as well. Thanks, Georgi. So again, this goes back to the accelerated development CapEx sizably 50% higher. And we did that based on demand. So you could see, overall, we're close to north of 75% preleased. In North America, now 97% preleased. Some of the signings in North America, in particular, actually, I've called on the longer end of our sign commencing trail. So they were resigning capacity that the Shell is just getting delivered. Last quarter, we signed nearly 50-ish megawatt deal in the land state. So they're close to two years, so they elongated. So that means we didn't sell just the nearest term capacity blocks we sold at what the customer needed given the facts and circumstances. We're doing everything we can to maintain, if not improve our yields. That's a product of making sure we're scaling our infrastructure and economies of scale and where we deliver and obviously, seizing upon the right rates and translating to better returns as products in that development life cycle of to roll up. In today's market, we're looking to have, again, all the levers of the commercials in the discussion, rates, escalations, real estate, tax base tops and certainly, renewal options, we're not entertaining called capping when those contracts come to. First off, Matt, thank you for being a role follower. Really appreciate that. Chris, why don't you give a little percentage, 50% overall, but how much in the call it, enterprise and then give us a little more color on some of the AI demand we've seen upon in the quarter and also within the pipeline. So -- those are GAAP rates, just a reminder. So you got to take the duration of the lease. You know the drill, David, in terms and the bumps. So they've certainly pushed them over. I can tell you in Ashburn, we had multiple customers, call it, face rates in the call it, 175 or 200 or higher, just slightly over 200, and call it, 8 megawatts or higher type of capacity blocks. Where we go from here? I'm not sure, you're going to see this repeat itself immediately. But the other markets have been catching up, but I think we'll continue to catch up over time, certainly, the comparables in the Chicago, the Dallas that have always trailed, the Ashburn trailing the Santa Clara and now trailing in Ashburn. And I do think you're just going to see more and more markets coalesce at these higher rates over time. Thanks, Nick. So, first off, it's very important that we just didn't call it the [indiscernible] income and just get it yesterday. This company has been solely focused on this business for 20 years now. And we've been in these markets that I really touched on. We've been consistently operating, assembling land, building and delivering for our customers for many, many years. And in green to the communities with the utility providers. As we saw this opportunity evolve in scaling certainly came to mind, and that is what we did. -- that was feeling our supply chain. Our teams have call it, a great relationships with their vendors and making sure that we are future proofing those supply chains and being very collaborative with our partners. If one utility, some switch gear that we have in one market, we can bring it to another market, we're bringing those economies of scale. We're certainly scaling our team as well operationally. We're delivering a lot of capacity for our customers, and we're investing in our team, in our systems and actually the great training development of our team along the way. And then lastly, the capital. Massively capital intensive business and the great work of our organization over the last year to supplement our use of public equity with some great private investment partnerships, both on the stabilizing development. We see a really fantastic runway of capital intensive growth here interesting the fruits of our labor in terms of the rates and the returns bearing fruit, and we see this playing out for years to come. And we want to make sure that we have stable partners to help fund this business to generate long-term growth for our customers and our shareholders. Thank you, Gary. Digital Realty posted a remarkable quarter in 3Q, reflecting the strong demand environment and demonstrating how Digital Realty is meeting the challenge to support our customers around the world. We set a number of records throughout our business, raise guidance and position the company for accelerating growth in 2025 and beyond. I am extremely proud of how our team executed to deliver this quarter's results. We are excited about the outlook for data center demand and our position in the market. But most importantly, we remain focused on seizing on the opportunity at hand. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. I'd like to thank our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world turning. Thank you."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jordan Sadler. Please go ahead.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to Digital Realty's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information, reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our second quarter. First, we continue to execute within a very favorable demand environment with $164 million of new leasing executed in the quarter, again marking one of the top quarters in our history, which together with last quarter's record leasing drove a record first half of the year. Second, our operating momentum continued through the second quarter as a record level of commencements translated into meaningful improvement in both total and same capital occupancy, while cash releasing spreads remained firmly positive and continued growth in cross connects drove interconnection revenue to a new record in the quarter. And third, through capital recycling and demand-driven equity issuance in the quarter, we reduced our leverage to 5.3 times at quarter end, below our long-term target level, helping to position Digital Realty for the opportunity that we continue to see in front of us. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. The momentum we experienced in the first quarter continued in the second quarter. In the first half of 2024, our new leasing was up over 100% from the activity we saw in the first half of 2023, with a strong and steady contribution from our 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection segment. Demand for data center capacity remains as strong as we've ever seen, especially for larger capacity blocks in our core markets. We are well-positioned to take advantage of this favorable demand environment given our track record of execution across six continents, a robust land bank and shell capacity that could support 3 gigawatts plus of incremental development, reduced leverage, and our growing and diverse array of capital partners. During the second quarter, we remain focused on our key priorities. We signed $164 million of new leasing in the second quarter, which excluded another $16 million of bookings within one of our newest hyperscale private capital ventures. While bookings integrated a megawatt category were once again the primary driver, there was no contribution from our largest hyperscale market, Northern Virginia, as Dallas led the way in the second quarter. Importantly, we posted one of our strongest quarters ever in the 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment with record new logos and near-record bookings in each of the 0 to 1 megawatt and interconnection categories. This leasing strength is a positive reflection of the value that our 5,000 and growing base of customers realize from our full spectrum product strategy. We also delivered strong operating results with 13% data center revenue growth year-over-year pro forma for the capital recycling activity completed over the last year. In addition, we have enjoyed healthy growth in recurring fee income associated with our new hyperscale ventures. In the first half, fee income was up 26% over the first half of 2023, primarily reflecting the formation of almost $10 billion of institutional private capital ventures over the last year. And we would expect this line item to continue to gather momentum. With the record commencements in the second quarter and the healthy backlog of favorably priced leases ready to commence in the second half, we are well positioned for accelerating top line and bottom line growth for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. Subsequent to quarter end, we also strengthened our value proposition in Europe through our entrance into the sought submarket of London. With the acquisition of a densely connected enterprise data center campus, which we expect to be highly complementary to our existing co-location capabilities in the City and the Docklands. The new campus supports an existing community of more than 150 customers, utilizing over 2,000 cross-connects. Consistent with our key priorities, we continue to innovate and integrate as we unveiled our HD Colo 2.0 offering in the second quarter with advanced high-density deployment support for liquid-to-chip cooling across 170 of our data centers globally. In addition, just last week, we announced the deployment of a new Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute Cloud On-Ramp at our Dallas campus, along with the launch of the new Azure Express Route Metro Service in the Amsterdam and Zurich market. We also bolstered our balance sheet and significantly diversified our capital sources, availing Digital Realty of more than $10 billion of private capital over the past year through our new hyperscale ventures and non-core dispositions. During the quarter, we expanded our existing Chicago Hyperscale venture with the sale of a 75% interest in CH2, the remaining stabilized data center on our Elk Grove campus. We also sold an additional 24.9% interest in a data center in Frankfurt to Digital Core REIT, increasing their total position in the campus to just under 15%. These two transactions together raised over $0.5 billion. Finally, we raised approximately $2 billion of equities since our last earnings call, including the $1.7 billion fallout offering in early May and proceeds raised under our ATM. These transactions together with the others of the past year have positioned our balance sheet to capitalize on this unique environment and construct the capacity that our customers demand. Artificial intelligence innovation is reshaping the global data center landscape. As new applications are developed and proliferate across industries and around the world, AI is driving the incremental wave of demand for robust computing infrastructure. According to Gartner, global spending on public cloud services is projected to grow over 20% to reach $675 billion in 2024 and is forecast to grow another 22% in 2025 with AI-related workloads driving a significant portion of this growth. Digital transformation, cloud, and AI are fueling demand for data center capacity worldwide. Traditional data centers were already being pushed to their limits on demand for cloud and digital transformation. Whereas demand for AI-oriented data center infrastructure is being accommodated in upgraded suites in our existing facilities and in newly built facilities. These AI workloads are taking place on specialized hardware with massive parallel processing capabilities and lighting fast data transfer speeds. Fortunately, Digital Realty's modular data center design can accommodate these evolving requirements. The growth in demand is global. We're seeing strong demand across our North American metros first, but it is spread and beyond with interest in locations like London, Amsterdam, and Paris in EMEA, and Singapore and Tokyo in APAC. Our global footprint is well-suited to capture this growing demand, whether it'd be for major cloud service providers adding to an availability zone, a major enterprise digitizing their business processes, or an AI model being trained or be it or put into production. However, this exponential growth in data center demand is not without its challenges. The environmental impact of these energy-intensive facilities is growing alongside the scaling of user requirements. According to the IEA, data centers consumed almost 2% of global electricity in 2022, a figure that could double by 2026, absent significant efficiency improvements. I will touch on Digital Realty's latest sustainability highlights in a moment. As we look to the future, the interplay between AI advancements and data center evolution will continue to shape the global technology landscape. IDC predicts that by 2027, worldwide spending on digital transformation will reach nearly $4 trillion, driven by AI, further accelerating the demand for data center infrastructure. We believe that the providers who can officially scale their capacity while addressing sustainability concerns will be best positioned to benefit from these three key drivers, digital transformation, cloud, and AI in the years to come. Customers and partners are recognizing the value that Digital Realty can bring to their applications around the world. During the second quarter, we added 148 new logos, marking a new quarterly record. A growing number of these new logos are being sourced by our partners who have officially expanded our sales team to reach into enterprises and around the world. The wins this quarter include Global 2000 advanced engineering and research enterprise developing a private AI Sandbox on PlatformDIGITAL to enable experimentation and development by federal agencies and brought to us by one of our large connectivity partners, Lumen Technologies. Another partner bought a new logo that is an AI-enabled SaaS provider repatriating all public cloud to save costs and enable growth. That same partner was also assisting two large financial institutions to increase their capacity on PlatformDIGITAL in APAC and North America. And yet another example of our growing partnerships, an AI SaaS provider and recognized leader in natural language speech synthesis is growing their commitment to PlatformDIGITAL with an expansion of current AI workloads where proximity is the driving requirement. A Global 2000 manufacturer is rearchitecting their network on PlatformDIGITAL with a regional hub to improve efficiency, lower their network costs, and implement controls while eliminating the capital cost of maintaining their own facilities. And two leading financial services firms are both leveraging PlatformDIGITAL to extend their respective virtual desktop infrastructure environments to improve performance and user experience across their North American and EMEA employee base. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the second quarter. We continue to make meaningful progress on ESG performance. We were recognized by TIME and Statista as one of the world's most sustainable companies of 2024. We also released our Annual ESG Report in June, highlighting our ongoing efforts to develop and operate responsibly. As described in our ESG report, we further increased our renewable energy supplies with 152 data centers now matched with 100% renewable energy. We improved water efficiency and expanded the use of recycled water, which accounted for 43% of our total water consumption last year. We also launched a new supplier engagement program to drive sustainability and decarbonization through our supply chain. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.\nMatthew Mercier: Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our second-quarter results. We signed $164 million of new leases in the second quarter with two-thirds of that falling into the greater than megawatt category, the majority of which landed in the Americas, with healthy contributions from both EMEA and APAC. Not to be overlooked, however, was the $40 million of 0 to 1 megawatt leasing and a standout $14 million of interconnection bookings. Our fourth consecutive quarter exceeding $50 million in our 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment. Turning to our backlog, we commenced a record $176 million of new leases this quarter, which was largely balanced by the strong second-quarter leasing. As such, the $527 million backlog of signed and not yet commenced leases moderated by only 2% from last quarter's peak and remains robust at more than 9% of our total revenue guidance for the full year 2024. Looking ahead, we have over $175 million scheduled to commence through the remainder of this year with over $230 million already scheduled to commence next year. During the second quarter, we signed $215 million of renewal leases at a 4% increase on a cash basis, driving year-to-date renewal spreads to 8.2%. Re-leasing spreads were once again positive across products and regions. Last quarter, we noted that the underlying renewal spread after stripping out two outliers was 3.4%. Our cash renewal spreads in the 0 to 1 megawatt segment were up 3.8% in the second quarter, while the greater than 1 megawatt segment was up 3.9%. As a reminder, the 0 to 1 megawatt segment is the primary driver of our overall re-leasing spreads, given the heavier weighting of lease expirations in this category, which are typically shorter-term leases with inflationary or better escalators. 0 to 1 megawatt deals renew reliably and predictably, making them track closer to market over time, thereby reducing the outsized movements that can come with larger or longer-term lease renewals. On the greater than 1 megawatt side, renewals reflected the strong pricing environment with leases renewed at $159 per kilowatt compared to the $133 per kilowatt achieved on greater than 1 megawatt renewals last quarter. The key difference between the quarters was the rate on the expiring leases. This quarter, leases in this segment expired at $153 per kW, while last quarter's leases expired at an average of $112 per kilowatt. For the quarter, churn remained low and well-controlled at 1.6% and our largest termination was immediately backfilled at an improved rate. In terms of earnings growth, we reported second quarter core FFO of $1.65 per share, reflecting continued healthy organic operating results, partly balanced by the impact of the meaningful deleveraging and capital-raising activity executed over the course of the last year. Revenue growth in the quarter was tempered by the decline in utility expense reimbursements, a comparison that is likely to persist throughout this year, given the decline in electricity rates in EMEA year-over-year, along with the impact of substantial capital recycling activity. Despite the deleveraging headwinds, rental revenue plus interconnection revenues were up 5% on a combined basis year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA also increased 5% year-over-year through the first half and remains well on track to meet our 2024 guidance. Pro forma for the capital recycling completed since last July, rental plus interconnection revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew by 13% and 14% year-over-year, respectively, in the second quarter. Stabilized same capital operating performance saw continued growth in the second quarter with year-over-year cash NOI up 2% as 3.6% growth in data center revenue was offset by a catch-up in rental property operating costs, which were flat last quarter. Year-to-date, same capital cash NOI has increased by 3.5%. And as we have previously highlighted, same capital NOI growth is expected to be impacted by nearly 200 basis points of power margin headwinds year-over-year, given the elevated utility prices in EMEA in 2023. Moving on to our investment activity, we spent $532 million on consolidated development in the second quarter, plus another $90 million for our share of unconsolidated JV spending. We delivered 72 megawatts of new capacity across the globe for our customers in the quarter, while we backfilled the pipeline with 71 megawatts of new starts. The blended average yield on our overall development pipeline moderated 20 basis points sequentially to 10.4% as a result of a market mix-shift of completions and starts in North America during the quarter. In the first half of the year, we spent a bit over $1 billion in development CapEx, tracking closely towards our full-year guidance. As the second half should see a ramp from newly commenced projects along with the typical seasonal uplift. Turning to the balance sheet, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet in the second quarter with the closing of the two transactions in April that we disclosed during last quarter's earnings report and was referenced earlier by Andy. Together, these two transactions raised just over $500 million of gross proceeds. Additionally, since our last earnings report, we sold 14.7 million shares, including a 12.1 million share follow-on offering in early May and incremental ATM issuance raising $2 billion of net proceeds while using cash-on-hand to pay off a \u20ac600 million bond that matured in April and a GBP250 million that matured last Friday. At the end of the second quarter, we had more than $4 billion of total liquidity and our net debt to EBITDA ratio fell to 5.3 times, which is below our long-term target. Moving on to our debt profile, our weighted average debt maturity is over four years and our weighted average interest rate is 2.9%. Approximately 84% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 86% of our net debt is fixed rate and 96% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, after paying off the euro notes in April and Sterling notes last week, we have zero remaining debt maturities through year-end. Beyond that, our maturities remain well laddered through 2032. Let me conclude with our guidance. We are maintaining our core FFO guidance range for the full year of 2024 of $6.60 to $6.75 per share, reflecting the continued strength in our core business, partly balanced by the front-half weighted capital recycling and funding activity, which helped to reduce our reported leverage by a full turn to better position the company to fund development in 2024 and beyond. We are also maintaining our total revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges for 2024, as well as the operating, investing, and financing expectations that we previously provided. Looking forward to the balance of 2024, core FFO per share remains poised to increase in the second half as the backlog commences and the impact of prior deleveraging moderates. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Choe: Hi. I wanted to ask about the long-term pipeline, you're seeing for the -- over 1 megawatt category. I think there is some concerns that right now we might be in a kind of pull-forward or kind of elevated cycle. And just wanted to get your sense of how far out this pipeline of deals that you're looking at in the current environment could last. Thank you.\nAndrew Power: Hi. Thanks, Richard. So I would say in the greater than 1-megawatt category, we're seeing a continuation of the trends we've been playing out for the last several quarters. The biggest customers are desiring, one, contiguous capacity blocks that are very large; two, they want them right now or as soon as possible; and three, the desire of fungible markets, i.e., markets where they can service certainly GenAI workloads, trading ultimately inference, but also if they miss the measure, they can support their cloud computing needs as well. So we have not seen a -- the ease in terms of the demand for those attributes in the market.\nOperator: The next question comes from Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Please go ahead, Irvin.\nIrvin Liu: Sorry, I was muted. So I wanted to double-click on renewal rates. So, I guess, a couple of items stood out. One, in the Americas, the $146 per kilowatt monthly rate and for the greater than 1 megawatt segment, that marked a sequential decline. Similarly, you know we've seen rates on new leases decline sequentially as well. So can you help us understand what's driving the sequential declines versus a quarter ago? Was this step-down mostly a function of markets and mix or were there other sort of industry dynamics that we should be thinking about?\nAndrew Power: Hi, thanks, Irvin. So I think the one big deal or the one market you were pointing to is just the North America greater than 1 megawatt. Now just a mix of composition of deals. This quarter, in particular, Dallas market really led the way. It's had outside strength and this is actually a quarter where we didn't actually have any signings into our Northern Virginia market, which was not a lack of demand for that market, and we still have some great options for customers available at large capacity blocks in two parts of that market, but we just didn't penned anything in this particular quarter. So if you look more broadly, I think almost all the other, call it regions in both segments had an uptick in rates and that's always on apples-to-apples that the mix in the region could be different metros like that one example I just gave you, but that would be only outlier is the one that I just discussed.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. Curious if you could talk about some of the ideas that you shared in the past around working on ways to participate in private capital recycling, whether it's trying to establish mechanisms to be able to react to when some of your private capital partners are going to hit their kind of maturity dates of those investments, what to do with those as well as maybe other opportunities in the category where there is private investments in other data center assets?\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Michael. Maybe I'll kick it off and then Greg can expand upon this. So this topic is not new. I think we have embarked on this journey at least 18 -- or at least a year and a half ago and made great progress, call it accumulating north of $10 billion or call it hyperscale private ventures with numerous parties. You've seen that few places, which we called out in the prepared remarks, we've seen our fee revenue having a step up of a recurring revenue basis in the P&L. Two, you've seen that in the balance sheet. Those private capital initiatives have obviously certainly moved our balance sheet from a defensive posture to an offensive posture and allow us to now pull forward some of these great projects in our land bank that's north of 3 gigawatts of runway of growth for our customers. And maybe I'll ask Greg just to give you a slightest preview of what's next in that evolution when it comes to our private strategic product accounting initiatives.\nGregory Wright: Yes. Thanks, Andy. Thanks for the question, Michael. I think the first thing I would say is consistent with as Andy said, we laid out a year ago, January. We're going to continue to bolster and diversify these private capital sources and that's just what we're doing. And as he said, we did a lot of transactions over the last 18 months. We're continuing to evolve that strategy. And when we have something to report, we will. I think it's important to note that the importance of that capital because if you take a look at the demand profile for the business right now, the hyperscale business in and of itself between now and 2030 is expected to grow almost three times and that includes AI hyperscale and non-AI hyperscale. So look, we think that the strategy that Andy laid out and that we embarked upon was the right strategy, but we're not done yet. And as we said, it's continuing to evolve. And when we have something to report on that front, we'll tell you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Atkin: Yes, good afternoon. I wonder about kind of the speed at which you can kind of deliver on your new starts that you've commenced recently, supply chain, access to energy, access to heavy equipment, and so forth. Any kind of color there?\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Jon. So I mean, we are -- if you almost think it was like a continuous conveyor belt of trying to deliver timely product for end customers' needs, that's certainly playing out in our enterprise colocation markets model. And now apply more than ever on the larger capacity blocks. This quarter and -- this quarter the book to sign a commencement was elongated out to about 20-ish months. That was based on one particular customer that we serviced and they had a very locational sensitive need than a radius restriction. And the only thing where we had in that radius was the land state. Luckily, it was on a cadence where we own the land and we were ready to get moving on. So that obviously elongated to be called delivery timeline for that particular signing. We excluded that, where we were basically call signing commencing like 4.5 type months. So we're continuously obviously delivering capacity and adding new capacity, whether it's from land to sell active suites and making sure we're maintaining our production slots and vendor relationships from that time of delivery in our 50 plus metros around the world.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Petersen: Okay. Thank you. I was hoping you could talk about some of the larger greater than 1 megawatt lease expirations that are coming up in the coming quarters. How many of those have fixed renewal options and how much can be mark-to-market rents? And if I can sneak in a follow-up question, I think there is a $168 million impairment in the income statement. Just curious what that is really into.\nMatthew Mercier: Yes. Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. So in terms of lease expirations, so what I'd say is less than half of our or greater than 1 megawatt leases have options with total fixed increases on them. But I would call that significantly less than that are typically renewed pursuant to those options. And that's generally for a few reasons. One, our customers must provide us notice of renewal within the proper period and that doesn't always happen to -- renewals must come in essence without any changes. So if there's any additional space, term, anything changes that opens up the contract. I think as we've talked about in the past and third, some of those customers also end up churning. So that all gives us an ability to be able to bring those contracts to market for the majority of what ends up rolling within a given period. On your second point on impairment, yes, we did have -- we did have impairment associated with a few of our non-core assets, which are part of our disposition plans and those are all located in the secondary market. We -- and I'd also put that in context to the fact that we've generated, call it, close to I think over $1.3 billion of gains from the capital recycling efforts that we've done over the last year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAri Klein: Thank you. I guess, just the comments on the pipeline coming off two very strong quarters of leasing and with the development pipeline, 66% leased, including 80% in the Americas. How should we expect CapEx to trend from here? And then what's your appetite to add new domestic markets given what seems like a broadening of demand?\nAndrew Power: Hi, thanks, Ari. Why don't I first let Colin just speak to the pipeline overall and then we can kind of talk about a little bit development side of that as well as new markets?\nColin McLean: Yes. Thanks, Ari. I appreciate the question. Andy highlighted strong performance over 1-megawatt -- pipeline overall for 1-megawatt trends to -- is trending positively below 1 megawatt, which we deem as important as heading in the right direction as well, record pipeline driven from digital transformation, cloud, and AI. And you saw that trending positively in our results, both directly and indirectly. Indirect execution has picked up the last quarter and we're now 23% of our pipeline being indirect, which we think is a positive sign on value proposition there. One of the things that Andy highlighted is the key value of metros. With the demand cycle, we're seeing enterprises and hyperscalers like zero value of proximity and the metro play that we have in key metros across the globe being particularly important. Finally, the ability both for enterprise and hyperscalers to grow in scale and capacity is of keen value really across the spectrum of low and above 1 megawatt.\nAndrew Power: Then Ari, on the second part of your question, I would say, we remain very focused on our core markets, north of 50 of them around the world, nearly 30 countries on six continents. Those markets we continuously see robust and diverse customer demand. I'm talking cloud commute from the numerous CSPs, enterprise, hybrid, IT, and service providers in markets where we see really long-term barriers. And to be speaking to our actions on those, a sizable piece of our activation in shells moving from our 3-plus gigawatt land bank into shells and ultimately to be delivered in suites is all in those same core markets.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hi guys. Thanks a lot. So I guess, two, if I could. Andy, I guess last quarter you talked about how 50% of these record bookings were -- or roughly 50% were AI-related. It obviously stepped down sequentially. But to your point about the lengthening of the delivery period, it seems like there is still some very large customers in what was the new leasing number this quarter. Could you kind of revisit on an apples-on-apples basis, how 2Q unfolded versus 1Q from an AI versus non-AI type of new leasing pattern? And how do we think about this? Is there going to be a seasonality to this sort of thing? That would be kind of my first question. And then the second question is, I was just going back to 2019, you guys generated $6.65 of core FFO, which is kind of what you're guiding to for 2024. And I know that you've laid out a hope that there will be growth -- more meaningful growth in the forward-looking periods. Also, you said that your balance sheet is now less in a defensive and more in an offensive position. And historically, when you've been offensive, it's meant dilution to secure future growth opportunities. So I was wondering if you could kind of, Andy, revisit the bull case for growth to take all these great things that are happening with the top line and turn them into bottom line growth? Thank you.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Dave. So obviously posted apples-to-apples from a 50% contribution last quarter to this quarter is probably closer a quarter of our science. We would say, we really pin on AI use cases. But I would caveat that in a few ways. One, that's in a quarter that's not our record quarter, but I think the top four quarter overall signings, great contribution of both 0 to 1 and plus 1 megawatt, as well as a near record in interconnection signings. And that means we're still winning with the traditional demand drivers of digital transformation, cloud computing, and the like, that though that demand is not nearly exhausted shelf or played out. I would also say that there was certainly a deal that I didn't count in the category of AI that is certainly pushing the envelope on power density and post-ink drawing, already thinking about evolving that capacity block or signed with them in towards what will ultimately be supporting AI down the road is my guess, which I think speaks to the modularity of design and how we're able to scale infrastructure to the demands of our customers as they needed. The second part of your question, let -- first off, I don't want to confuse the word offense with M&A. I think we've not done any real M&A or external growth for several years now. You can maybe save the resolution of the Cyxtera relationship, but that was I think making lemonade out of lemons more than anything. And when I use the word offense, I mean, that's converting this 3 plus gigawatt land bank, which we've assembled over the years, i.e., we didn't just go buy that yesterday and turning that into a great product for our customers to land and expand in -- at great returns on our investment. And you've been seeing that play out now with our ROIs and development schedule, crescendoing into the double-digits. You've seen that in the pricing power and you've seen our value proposition really resonate in all of our customer segments across our core markets. And lastly, our eye is on the price of accelerating the bottom line. That's where we reoriented our strategy 18 months ago about our value proposition, integrated, innovating, bolstering, diversifying our capital sources. And all those things were about, call it making sure we're driving per share -- FFO per share growth that's accelerating and it's going to be continuously compounding for years to come. So there is been no divergence in that conviction of what comes next for the rest of 2024 and what we've said about 2025, next year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: I appreciate it. Thanks for taking the questions. So Andy, could you maybe comment on what type of market rent growth you're seeing right now in some of your key metros on an apples-to-apples basis relative to last year and whether that continues to evolve as this year has progressed? And then as you look out into the future, do you see an opportunity for market rent growth to continue to outstrip your development costs and we can see the kind of 10% to 12% development yields you have in your pipeline move even higher? Thank you.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Eric. I mean, I would outcast that market rent growth is continuing to move in our favor. You've seen two elements happening, the most precious capacity blocks in the key markets like in Northern Virginia continue to set new records in terms of rates. And you've also seen a catch-up phenomenon where other markets in North America or outside of the U.S. are catching up a fair bit in terms of their trajectory of growth. Listen, I look at this, you've got these waves of demand being cloud computing and digital transformation, hybrid IT, and now AI that are just getting going in some of these. They're large and dynamic and it's happening in a supply constraint backdrop from numerous avenues of supply constraint. And those elements are ultimately resulting in the increases in rate that we've been able to execute on for several quarters and I believe will be three quarters in common. And I also believe they will likely outstrip the -- whatever inflationary cost we see in terms of build costs and at least maintain these ROIs, if not continue to notch it up slightly higher.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJames Schneider: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. On the topic of power constraints and supply environment you see relative to transmission. With the time horizon, let's say, 12 to 18 months, do you think the outlook for power availability is getting more constrained, less constrained, or staying about the same relative to new projects you have either under development or contemplating?\nAndrew Power: Jim, I think that there is a few phenomenons happening. One, we're getting closer, I mean, some of these constraints popped up now a years in a rearview mirror. And we're obviously inching our way close to destinations of resolutions, be it in Northern Virginia, which I think 2026 is supposedly above or within like in Santa Clara and there is other non-U.S. markets as well. At the same time as we approach the power constraints, there is obviously a good potential that the delivery dates may not deliver on time. These are multifaceted projects that require easement, substations, construction projects. At the same time, the demand didn't standstill while the power was constrained. The second phenomenon I think they're seeing is -- this is becoming a more pervasive topic. It was very focused on one cloud center of the universe market with Northern Virginia and we're hearing more and more about other markets. And lastly, I wouldn't pin it just on power. Yes, the power has got broader generation issues in the economy that we're trying to green. It's got transmission issues that navigate municipalities and substation deliveries and transmission lines cutting through the backyards of folks that rather not have them there. But there are also other elements of sustainability concerns, moratoriums in certain parts of the world. And so I think that this is a multifaceted supply constraint, which I would also mention that even if it does get fixed, has a propensity that could -- history could repeat itself here. So I think this is going to make our value proposition with what we deliver to our customers even more compelling and valuable at the end of the day.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nVikram Malhotra: Hi, good afternoon or evening. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just a bigger picture, you've talked about leasing spreads in greater than 1 megawatt improving over time given the differential of what's expiring versus, I guess, market, but you also referenced market rent growth improving quite a bit. So with that and just some recent comments from hyperscalers, just talking about the risk of oversupply or just too much CapEx. Can you sort of just frame the near-term opportunity set in the greater than 1 megawatt from -- maybe bookings, but more so pricing standpoint versus the puts and takes over time just from a demand-supply? I'm just wondering, is there a risk that you see the spreads theoretically improve, but there is a lot of supply coming down the pipe?\nAndrew Power: I'll take the -- mainly the second -- first and second part of your question, I'll ask Matt to comment on our outlook on leasing spreads and really kind of talk about the stairstep in our exploration schedule, which does -- call it, become even more attractive in its coming years. But I think from -- the heart of your second question is the broader AI theme question you're hearing more on -- in the mainstream media over AI overdone, this is a bubble, what could come next? I think some of that is not unnecessarily 100% germane to what we're seeing. And the reason I say that is in our business, when it comes to AI, we are signing long-term contracts, I'm talking 15 years with some of the largest, most established technology companies ever. Two, and I mentioned before, we're doing that, we're not chasing this out to unproven territories. We're focused on core markets with robust and diverse customer demand where traditional use cases, be it cloud commuting from numerous CSPs, enterprise, hybrid IT, and service provider demand are continuing to grow over time, and even if the AI has peaks and valleys. And we're doing it in markets that we believe are real term -- real long-term supply constraints. And lastly, all this is happening probably in the most supply-constrained moment in the last 20 years of data centers. So I don't -- I'm not sure or convinced that even if AI takes a breather on its long-term innovation trajectory. I think that volatility -- we are somewhat insulated in our sector from that volatility based on how we're pursuing it. But Matt, why don't you hit on the question?\nMatthew Mercier: Sure. So what I look, what I call it is -- if you look at the greater than 1-megawatt leases that are expiring, call it the next 18 months, the rate -- average rate on that in the 140 to 145 area. But then it steps down pretty gradually to as low as 111 by the time you get to 2029. So I think you're going to see a continued positive trajectory on our leasing spreads, not only in the greater than 1-megawatt category, but I think also across all the categories. So I think you'd also recall within our 0 to 1 spreads have been positive. I think throughout our history, those are typically more regular steady inflationary type increases or better. So I think this puts us in a -- I think in a good position considering where market rates are, where some of the supply constraints are to where we'll see market rates now continue to remain positive and grow and continue to accrue benefits to our releasing spreads as we go through time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you. So in talking before, you mentioned you're prioritizing retail Colo over hyperscale. How should we think about that practically and kind of track that? Is that part of the reason the sub of megawatt bookings have remained a little bit elevated? How should we think about that trend going forward?\nAndrew Power: Colin, why don't you -- I think that's a great question because we are obviously spending a lot of time on the bigger deals right now. But Colin, why don't you walk-through on the highlights of the quarter?\nColin McLean: Sure. Frank, thanks for the question. I'm not sure I'd use the word prioritize. We definitely want to emphasize a full platform to have an offering set. So as highlighted in Andy's opening remarks, performance in Q2 was particularly strong 0 to 1, fourth consecutive quarter over $50 million, which I think was -- which is in also the third highest ever from 0 to 1. We think this consistency is really driven from our ability to serve the full spectrum of requirements for our enterprisers and service providers across the Global 5000 focus of customer set. New logos are also pretty strong as well, most solid ever in terms of 148% with 40% of that coming from the indirect side. Channel also which I highlighted earlier was a particularly strong point with over 20% booking contribution from the indirect side overall. So we view this segment as continuing on our value proposition out to our client set. And a lot of the drivers Andy talked about around digital transformation, cloud, and AI are also playing out in 0-1 segment across enterprises and service providers. And Andy highlighted a couple of those key wins on opening remarks, namely Fortune 5,000 clients, excuse me, offering their virtual desktop requirements and the global manufacturing win we had on the enterprise side. I also want to highlight the particular highlight of the Microsoft ExpressRoute launch into Dallas, which we feel like is a presumably strong representation of our platform.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Elias with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMichael Elias: Great. Thanks for taking the questions guys. Andy, in the past, you've talked about CapEx being an accordion that you expand and contract to the end of solving for consistent bottom line growth. So as I'm thinking about it, given the leasing success that you've had over the last two quarters and also as part of that like the market opportunity in both hyperscale and enterprise. Is now the time to be expanding that Accordion and really hitting the gap on CapEx? And if so, I just want to be clear, what is the explicit FFO per share that you can grow -- that you guys are solving for as part of that algorithm? Thank you.\nAndrew Power: Thanks, Michael. So the -- just to clarify, I would say, CapEx is the core and I think it's how we funded, which I think the same concept you're outlining in your question. The CapEx intensity is being pulled forward, right? We talked about this of greenlining more shell capacity, ultimately suites in a super highly leased -- pre-leased development pipeline at very attractive returns. So we're seeing the CapEx intensity increase. We're intersecting at great rates, great returns for our business for good -- and supporting great customers in numerous markets. And we've now positioned ourselves in a balance sheet position of greater strength, not only just from our leverage standpoint but from our liquidity and our diverse sources of capital. And what we're trying to do is essentially use the levers of using our public capital and our private capital to get back to, call it mid-single digits, call it floor to our growth next year and then it's further acceleration on top of that. And do that in a consistent year -- method of compounding that growth for numerous years to come. So it's really those levers of using public and private capital to drive that bottom line to new levels and on a consistent framework.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nDavid Guarino: Thanks. I appreciate the industry statistics you guys included in your investor presentation. And I wanted to ask specifically about the declining global vacancy you highlighted, which it's around 6%. But when I look at your stabilized portfolio, the vacancy level is about three times higher than that. So I guess, first, why is it so much higher? And then second, given the record demand we're seeing across the industry, how long do you think it's going to take before digital's portfolio resembles more like the industry is?\nAndrew Power: I think Dave - you got to remember that our portfolio is not all -- just call it hyperscale. And the hyperscale portion of this business can literally be 100% leased in many buildings or markets, right? And my gut is that chart, which I think data center walk, which they're doing the best they can, is very much about more of a hyperscale lens. I was actually pretty pleased on the occupancy front. We're up 100 basis points in the same-store occupancy quarter-over-quarter and we have a big same-store pool. It's not mountain. We're also actively taking it one step backwards sometimes on occupancy to take two, three, four steps forward when vacant -- when suites come back and scale and we convert those to Colo and really support our customers' Colo growth as well. So this was the year we said that with occupancy, we're going to be moving the needle and we have been moving the needle. We got more to do in that arena. So I think we'll be seeing -- see it move up. And if you look at, you can also look to get a number of apples-to-apples. If you look at their occupancy, we show by markets. There are certain markets of way less than 60% vacancy that are just very much heavily weighted towards our hyperscale business. They just have a much, much smaller a footprint like Northern Virginia, where if you parse through it, especially on a megawatt basis. I wish, I had that type of vacancy to sell right now and we just don't.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Niknam: Hi, guys. Thanks for getting me on. I had two follow-ups. First, on the Colo side, so you cited the record new logo is 148 this quarter. I'm just wondering from a macro perspective, any change in terms of macro impacts across different customer sizes within that sub 1 megawatt base? And then secondly, you talked about leverage getting back under 5.5 turns, the prospect of improving bottom line growth from next year. How do you think about the dividend and the potential for forward growth in the dividend relative to some potential incremental investments in the business? Thanks.\nAndrew Power: Matt, why don't you hit the dividend question first and Colin, and I can hit a little bit on what we're seeing in the enterprise demand piece of the puzzle?\nMatthew Mercier: Yes, sure. So thanks, Matt. So in terms of the dividend, look I think it's back to kind of what we've said historically. I think we've got a unique opportunity here to take advantage of what we see as a tremendous growth opportunity throughout our global portfolio and one of the easiest and cheapest forms of capital within that is internally generated funds. And so we continue to look to try to maximize our cash flow as part of our funding strategy on that front. And on top of that, we're also -- I think as we've also mentioned throughout this call, we're keenly focused on growing the bottom line and accelerating that growth in outer years. So as we grow the bottom line, which is going to benefit and accrue benefits to not only core FFO but then on to AFFO, we then look to keep our dividend growth in line with that bottom line per share growth as well.\nColin McLean: Great. On the new logo question, a couple of trends just maybe to highlight in that question. So first, we really believe it's in the hybrid world. So we're seeing that continued trend in the new logo base, hybrid work, cloud, data that our new logo requirements really are served well across our global platform. Number two is the mix of that 148 was very much split between commercial and Global 5000 accounts. So we're seeing continued interest in the platform across the larger customers who buy with more frequency in the smaller area of the spectrum. Not sure that we can necessarily point to a growing density in that particular base of clients yet or capacity. But I can tell you this particular base of clients sees real value, as I mentioned in our global platform, which really serves well across their requirements.\nAndrew Power: And just one, Chris, why don't you just chime in on the early reads on the HD Colo 2.0, with some of the -- I would say an uptick in the enterprise segment?\nChristopher Sharp: No, so I think I agree with you, Andy, on the macro trend of what we're doing with HD Colo is just really aligning the right capability to cool some of these higher-power density requirements coming into the market. And so we see a lot of the capabilities that we brought in across the 170 facilities. We can execute these higher-density solutions in 12 weeks or less. And I think what's interesting about that is the capacity blocks are getting larger, but like the capabilities that customers are trying to bring to market are definitely challenging for a lot of your traditional Colo offerings where we've really started to see that come to market about six to seven months ago. And so we've been able to pre-procure a lot of these capabilities to get ahead of that challenge. But just kind of current rack densities in the market today are 6 to 8 kilowatts. And I think one of the things I think you're really hitting on is like what are some of these new requirements coming in. And so healthcare, we're seeing 10 kilowatts of rack. I mean, gaming, we're seeing 15 kilowatts of rack this last quarter. And then some of the AI software capabilities, 40 kilowatts. But at the end of the day, we can meet a customer requirement of 150 kilowatts. So we have a lot of runway with that. And to put a little context to it, in the most recent state-of-the-art NVIDIA GB200, we can support that requirement in an under 12-week fashion with our current HD Colo offering. So definitely seeing a lot of growth in that market.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Anthony Hau with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Hau: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I noticed that the weighted average commencement period for new leases are 20 months away. I'm assuming most of these leases are probably for 2026 deliveries, but are customers looking to sign leases for 2027? If they are, what type of customers are looking to pick up space thus far out?\nAndrew Power: Thanks. So I mean customers are -- especially when it comes to larger capacity blocks, they're really trying to future proof and that's where our 3 gigawatts of growth comes in handy. So they certainly -- the nearest-term deliveries are precious, but I think in the years ahead. Now that particular example, as I mentioned, the 20 months was elongated because that customer -- one particular customer had very much their eyesight on a particular market and then various restrictions about where they could grow and where we can support that growth, we are literally their capacity. So that we were able to do deliver as fast as we could, but it certainly elongated. Look, excluding that one outlier, we're close to 4.5 months. And I think you'll -- I wouldn't count on those outliers consistently popping up, they'll be more sporadic.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Nispel: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Question for Matt. Can you talk about not updating the guidance at all? Maybe there is some moving pieces from FX and the recent acquisition that you call out. Just as I was looking at it, if you look at the first half of the year and annualize it, revenue really need to accelerate while adjusted EBITDA would need to be backwards, actually to hit the midpoint of your guide. So I guess, the question is, is the EBITDA FFO guidance is conservative? Are there some uncertainty in terms of timing of commencements, unusual expenses? Hoping you could just unpack that for us. Thanks.\nMatthew Mercier: Sure. I don't -- look there's a -- I would, again, I'd probably focus kind of on the bottom line. If you look at -- if you look at where we are halfway through the year, we're a little less than halfway through the midpoint of our core FFO guidance. And we talked about -- we expected this quarter would be -- would have a little bit of pressure because of the capital recycling efforts that where we've concluded with closing CH2 and having the related income from that come out this quarter. And so look what we're going to see is in the second half, growth we're expecting to improve and accelerate as the backlog of deals and signings come online. And as we expect -- as we haven't changed the guidance, we've obviously given a wide range. But if you look at -- I think where we are this year and the expectations for accelerating in the back half, which I think will set us up very nicely for 2025. We feel pretty good about the midpoint of guidance and being able to achieve that.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'd like to now turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power, for closing remarks. Andy, please go ahead.\nAndrew Power: Thank you. Digital Realty posted another strong quarter in 2Q with record leasing in the first half, demonstrating how Digital Realty is positioned to support the elevated level of demand we continue to see for data center infrastructure. Fundamental strength continued through the second quarter with robust leasing volume, healthy pricing, and record commencements poised to drive an acceleration in bottom line growth. We continue to innovate and integrate with the rollout of HD Colo 2.0 and the addition of new cloud on-ramps to PlatformDIGITAL in the quarter. Then we have repositioned the balance sheet by recycling capital out of stabilized assets, diversifying our capital sources, and reducing our leverage. All of this was done with an eye towards improving our growth profile while supporting our customers' growing needs. We are excited about this quarter's results and remain optimistic about the outlook for data center demand and our position in the market. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today and would like to thank our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world turning. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

We're going to continue to bolster and diversify these private capital sources and that's just what we're doing. And as he said, we did a lot of transactions over the last 18 months. We're continuing to evolve that strategy. And when we have something to report, we will. I think it's important to note that the importance of that capital because if you take a look at the demand profile for the business right now, the hyperscale business in and of itself between now and 2030 is expected to grow almost three times and that includes AI hyperscale and non-AI hyperscale. So look, we think that the strategy that Andy laid out and that we embarked upon was the right strategy, but we're not done yet. And as we said, it's continuing to evolve. And when we have something to report on that front, we'll tell you."

            "name": "Matthew Mercier",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our second-quarter results. We signed $164 million of new leases in the second quarter with two-thirds of that falling into the greater than megawatt category, the majority of which landed in the Americas, with healthy contributions from both EMEA and APAC. Not to be overlooked, however, was the $40 million of 0 to 1 megawatt leasing and a standout $14 million of interconnection bookings. Our fourth consecutive quarter exceeding $50 million in our 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment. Turning to our backlog, we commenced a record $176 million of new leases this quarter, which was largely balanced by the strong second-quarter leasing. As such, the $527 million backlog of signed and not yet commenced leases moderated by only 2% from last quarter's peak and remains robust at more than 9% of our total revenue guidance for the full year 2024. Looking ahead, we have over $175 million scheduled to commence through the remainder of this year with over $230 million already scheduled to commence next year. During the second quarter, we signed $215 million of renewal leases at a 4% increase on a cash basis, driving year-to-date renewal spreads to 8.2%. Re-leasing spreads were once again positive across products and regions. Last quarter, we noted that the underlying renewal spread after stripping out two outliers was 3.4%. Our cash renewal spreads in the 0 to 1 megawatt segment were up 3.8% in the second quarter, while the greater than 1 megawatt segment was up 3.9%. As a reminder, the 0 to 1 megawatt segment is the primary driver of our overall re-leasing spreads, given the heavier weighting of lease expirations in this category, which are typically shorter-term leases with inflationary or better escalators. 0 to 1 megawatt deals renew reliably and predictably, making them track closer to market over time, thereby reducing the outsized movements that can come with larger or longer-term lease renewals. On the greater than 1 megawatt side, renewals reflected the strong pricing environment with leases renewed at $159 per kilowatt compared to the $133 per kilowatt achieved on greater than 1 megawatt renewals last quarter. The key difference between the quarters was the rate on the expiring leases. This quarter, leases in this segment expired at $153 per kW, while last quarter's leases expired at an average of $112 per kilowatt. For the quarter, churn remained low and well-controlled at 1.6% and our largest termination was immediately backfilled at an improved rate. In terms of earnings growth, we reported second quarter core FFO of $1.65 per share, reflecting continued healthy organic operating results, partly balanced by the impact of the meaningful deleveraging and capital-raising activity executed over the course of the last year. Revenue growth in the quarter was tempered by the decline in utility expense reimbursements, a comparison that is likely to persist throughout this year, given the decline in electricity rates in EMEA year-over-year, along with the impact of substantial capital recycling activity. Despite the deleveraging headwinds, rental revenue plus interconnection revenues were up 5% on a combined basis year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA also increased 5% year-over-year through the first half and remains well on track to meet our 2024 guidance. Pro forma for the capital recycling completed since last July, rental plus interconnection revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew by 13% and 14% year-over-year, respectively, in the second quarter. Stabilized same capital operating performance saw continued growth in the second quarter with year-over-year cash NOI up 2% as 3.6% growth in data center revenue was offset by a catch-up in rental property operating costs, which were flat last quarter. Year-to-date, same capital cash NOI has increased by 3.5%. And as we have previously highlighted, same capital NOI growth is expected to be impacted by nearly 200 basis points of power margin headwinds year-over-year, given the elevated utility prices in EMEA in 2023. Moving on to our investment activity, we spent $532 million on consolidated development in the second quarter, plus another $90 million for our share of unconsolidated JV spending. We delivered 72 megawatts of new capacity across the globe for our customers in the quarter, while we backfilled the pipeline with 71 megawatts of new starts. The blended average yield on our overall development pipeline moderated 20 basis points sequentially to 10.4% as a result of a market mix-shift of completions and starts in North America during the quarter. In the first half of the year, we spent a bit over $1 billion in development CapEx, tracking closely towards our full-year guidance. As the second half should see a ramp from newly commenced projects along with the typical seasonal uplift. Turning to the balance sheet, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet in the second quarter with the closing of the two transactions in April that we disclosed during last quarter's earnings report and was referenced earlier by Andy. Together, these two transactions raised just over $500 million of gross proceeds. Additionally, since our last earnings report, we sold 14.7 million shares, including a 12.1 million share follow-on offering in early May and incremental ATM issuance raising $2 billion of net proceeds while using cash-on-hand to pay off a \u20ac600 million bond that matured in April and a GBP250 million that matured last Friday. At the end of the second quarter, we had more than $4 billion of total liquidity and our net debt to EBITDA ratio fell to 5.3 times, which is below our long-term target. Moving on to our debt profile, our weighted average debt maturity is over four years and our weighted average interest rate is 2.9%. Approximately 84% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 86% of our net debt is fixed rate and 96% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, after paying off the euro notes in April and Sterling notes last week, we have zero remaining debt maturities through year-end. Beyond that, our maturities remain well laddered through 2032. Let me conclude with our guidance. We are maintaining our core FFO guidance range for the full year of 2024 of $6.60 to $6.75 per share, reflecting the continued strength in our core business, partly balanced by the front-half weighted capital recycling and funding activity, which helped to reduce our reported leverage by a full turn to better position the company to fund development in 2024 and beyond. We are also maintaining our total revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges for 2024, as well as the operating, investing, and financing expectations that we previously provided. Looking forward to the balance of 2024, core FFO per share remains poised to increase in the second half as the backlog commences and the impact of prior deleveraging moderates. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? Yes. Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. So in terms of lease expirations, so what I'd say is less than half of our or greater than 1 megawatt leases have options with total fixed increases on them. But I would call that significantly less than that are typically renewed pursuant to those options. And that's generally for a few reasons. One, our customers must provide us notice of renewal within the proper period and that doesn't always happen to -- renewals must come in essence without any changes. So if there's any additional space, term, anything changes that opens up the contract. I think as we've talked about in the past and third, some of those customers also end up churning. So that all gives us an ability to be able to bring those contracts to market for the majority of what ends up rolling within a given period. On your second point on impairment, yes, we did have -- we did have impairment associated with a few of our non-core assets, which are part of our disposition plans and those are all located in the secondary market. We -- and I'd also put that in context to the fact that we've generated, call it, close to I think over $1.3 billion of gains from the capital recycling efforts that we've done over the last year. Sure. So what I look, what I call it is -- if you look at the greater than 1-megawatt leases that are expiring, call it the next 18 months, the rate -- average rate on that in the 140 to 145 area. But then it steps down pretty gradually to as low as 111 by the time you get to 2029. So I think you're going to see a continued positive trajectory on our leasing spreads, not only in the greater than 1-megawatt category, but I think also across all the categories. So I think you'd also recall within our 0 to 1 spreads have been positive. I think throughout our history, those are typically more regular steady inflationary type increases or better. So I think this puts us in a -- I think in a good position considering where market rates are, where some of the supply constraints are to where we'll see market rates now continue to remain positive and grow and continue to accrue benefits to our releasing spreads as we go through time. Yes, sure. So thanks, Matt. So in terms of the dividend, look I think it's back to kind of what we've said historically. I think we've got a unique opportunity here to take advantage of what we see as a tremendous growth opportunity throughout our global portfolio and one of the easiest and cheapest forms of capital within that is internally generated funds. And so we continue to look to try to maximize our cash flow as part of our funding strategy on that front. And on top of that, we're also -- I think as we've also mentioned throughout this call, we're keenly focused on growing the bottom line and accelerating that growth in outer years. So as we grow the bottom line, which is going to benefit and accrue benefits to not only core FFO but then on to AFFO, we then look to keep our dividend growth in line with that bottom line per share growth as well. Sure. I don't -- look there's a -- I would, again, I'd probably focus kind of on the bottom line. If you look at -- if you look at where we are halfway through the year, we're a little less than halfway through the midpoint of our core FFO guidance. And we talked about -- we expected this quarter would be -- would have a little bit of pressure because of the capital recycling efforts that where we've concluded with closing CH2 and having the related income from that come out this quarter. And so look what we're going to see is in the second half, growth we're expecting to improve and accelerate as the backlog of deals and signings come online. And as we expect -- as we haven't changed the guidance, we've obviously given a wide range. But if you look at -- I think where we are this year and the expectations for accelerating in the back half, which I think will set us up very nicely for 2025. We feel pretty good about the midpoint of guidance and being able to achieve that."

            "name": "Colin McLean",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Ari. I appreciate the question. Andy highlighted strong performance over 1-megawatt -- pipeline overall for 1-megawatt trends to -- is trending positively below 1 megawatt, which we deem as important as heading in the right direction as well, record pipeline driven from digital transformation, cloud, and AI. And you saw that trending positively in our results, both directly and indirectly. Indirect execution has picked up the last quarter and we're now 23% of our pipeline being indirect, which we think is a positive sign on value proposition there. One of the things that Andy highlighted is the key value of metros. With the demand cycle, we're seeing enterprises and hyperscalers like zero value of proximity and the metro play that we have in key metros across the globe being particularly important. Finally, the ability both for enterprise and hyperscalers to grow in scale and capacity is of keen value really across the spectrum of low and above 1 megawatt. Sure. Frank, thanks for the question. I'm not sure I'd use the word prioritize. We definitely want to emphasize a full platform to have an offering set. So as highlighted in Andy's opening remarks, performance in Q2 was particularly strong 0 to 1, fourth consecutive quarter over $50 million, which I think was -- which is in also the third highest ever from 0 to 1. We think this consistency is really driven from our ability to serve the full spectrum of requirements for our enterprisers and service providers across the Global 5000 focus of customer set. New logos are also pretty strong as well, most solid ever in terms of 148% with 40% of that coming from the indirect side. Channel also which I highlighted earlier was a particularly strong point with over 20% booking contribution from the indirect side overall. So we view this segment as continuing on our value proposition out to our client set. And a lot of the drivers Andy talked about around digital transformation, cloud, and AI are also playing out in 0-1 segment across enterprises and service providers. And Andy highlighted a couple of those key wins on opening remarks, namely Fortune 5,000 clients, excuse me, offering their virtual desktop requirements and the global manufacturing win we had on the enterprise side. I also want to highlight the particular highlight of the Microsoft ExpressRoute launch into Dallas, which we feel like is a presumably strong representation of our platform. Great. On the new logo question, a couple of trends just maybe to highlight in that question. So first, we really believe it's in the hybrid world. So we're seeing that continued trend in the new logo base, hybrid work, cloud, data that our new logo requirements really are served well across our global platform. Number two is the mix of that 148 was very much split between commercial and Global 5000 accounts. So we're seeing continued interest in the platform across the larger customers who buy with more frequency in the smaller area of the spectrum. Not sure that we can necessarily point to a growing density in that particular base of clients yet or capacity. But I can tell you this particular base of clients sees real value, as I mentioned in our global platform, which really serves well across their requirements."

            "name": "Andrew Power",
            "content": "Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. The momentum we experienced in the first quarter continued in the second quarter. In the first half of 2024, our new leasing was up over 100% from the activity we saw in the first half of 2023, with a strong and steady contribution from our 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection segment. Demand for data center capacity remains as strong as we've ever seen, especially for larger capacity blocks in our core markets. We are well-positioned to take advantage of this favorable demand environment given our track record of execution across six continents, a robust land bank and shell capacity that could support 3 gigawatts plus of incremental development, reduced leverage, and our growing and diverse array of capital partners. During the second quarter, we remain focused on our key priorities. We signed $164 million of new leasing in the second quarter, which excluded another $16 million of bookings within one of our newest hyperscale private capital ventures. While bookings integrated a megawatt category were once again the primary driver, there was no contribution from our largest hyperscale market, Northern Virginia, as Dallas led the way in the second quarter. Importantly, we posted one of our strongest quarters ever in the 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment with record new logos and near-record bookings in each of the 0 to 1 megawatt and interconnection categories. This leasing strength is a positive reflection of the value that our 5,000 and growing base of customers realize from our full spectrum product strategy. We also delivered strong operating results with 13% data center revenue growth year-over-year pro forma for the capital recycling activity completed over the last year. In addition, we have enjoyed healthy growth in recurring fee income associated with our new hyperscale ventures. In the first half, fee income was up 26% over the first half of 2023, primarily reflecting the formation of almost $10 billion of institutional private capital ventures over the last year. And we would expect this line item to continue to gather momentum. With the record commencements in the second quarter and the healthy backlog of favorably priced leases ready to commence in the second half, we are well positioned for accelerating top line and bottom line growth for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. Subsequent to quarter end, we also strengthened our value proposition in Europe through our entrance into the sought submarket of London. With the acquisition of a densely connected enterprise data center campus, which we expect to be highly complementary to our existing co-location capabilities in the City and the Docklands. The new campus supports an existing community of more than 150 customers, utilizing over 2,000 cross-connects. Consistent with our key priorities, we continue to innovate and integrate as we unveiled our HD Colo 2.0 offering in the second quarter with advanced high-density deployment support for liquid-to-chip cooling across 170 of our data centers globally. In addition, just last week, we announced the deployment of a new Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute Cloud On-Ramp at our Dallas campus, along with the launch of the new Azure Express Route Metro Service in the Amsterdam and Zurich market. We also bolstered our balance sheet and significantly diversified our capital sources, availing Digital Realty of more than $10 billion of private capital over the past year through our new hyperscale ventures and non-core dispositions. During the quarter, we expanded our existing Chicago Hyperscale venture with the sale of a 75% interest in CH2, the remaining stabilized data center on our Elk Grove campus. We also sold an additional 24.9% interest in a data center in Frankfurt to Digital Core REIT, increasing their total position in the campus to just under 15%. These two transactions together raised over $0.5 billion. Finally, we raised approximately $2 billion of equities since our last earnings call, including the $1.7 billion fallout offering in early May and proceeds raised under our ATM. These transactions together with the others of the past year have positioned our balance sheet to capitalize on this unique environment and construct the capacity that our customers demand. Artificial intelligence innovation is reshaping the global data center landscape. As new applications are developed and proliferate across industries and around the world, AI is driving the incremental wave of demand for robust computing infrastructure. According to Gartner, global spending on public cloud services is projected to grow over 20% to reach $675 billion in 2024 and is forecast to grow another 22% in 2025 with AI-related workloads driving a significant portion of this growth. Digital transformation, cloud, and AI are fueling demand for data center capacity worldwide. Traditional data centers were already being pushed to their limits on demand for cloud and digital transformation. Whereas demand for AI-oriented data center infrastructure is being accommodated in upgraded suites in our existing facilities and in newly built facilities. These AI workloads are taking place on specialized hardware with massive parallel processing capabilities and lighting fast data transfer speeds. Fortunately, Digital Realty's modular data center design can accommodate these evolving requirements. The growth in demand is global. We're seeing strong demand across our North American metros first, but it is spread and beyond with interest in locations like London, Amsterdam, and Paris in EMEA, and Singapore and Tokyo in APAC. Our global footprint is well-suited to capture this growing demand, whether it'd be for major cloud service providers adding to an availability zone, a major enterprise digitizing their business processes, or an AI model being trained or be it or put into production. However, this exponential growth in data center demand is not without its challenges. The environmental impact of these energy-intensive facilities is growing alongside the scaling of user requirements. According to the IEA, data centers consumed almost 2% of global electricity in 2022, a figure that could double by 2026, absent significant efficiency improvements. I will touch on Digital Realty's latest sustainability highlights in a moment. As we look to the future, the interplay between AI advancements and data center evolution will continue to shape the global technology landscape. IDC predicts that by 2027, worldwide spending on digital transformation will reach nearly $4 trillion, driven by AI, further accelerating the demand for data center infrastructure. We believe that the providers who can officially scale their capacity while addressing sustainability concerns will be best positioned to benefit from these three key drivers, digital transformation, cloud, and AI in the years to come. Customers and partners are recognizing the value that Digital Realty can bring to their applications around the world. During the second quarter, we added 148 new logos, marking a new quarterly record. A growing number of these new logos are being sourced by our partners who have officially expanded our sales team to reach into enterprises and around the world. The wins this quarter include Global 2000 advanced engineering and research enterprise developing a private AI Sandbox on PlatformDIGITAL to enable experimentation and development by federal agencies and brought to us by one of our large connectivity partners, Lumen Technologies. Another partner bought a new logo that is an AI-enabled SaaS provider repatriating all public cloud to save costs and enable growth. That same partner was also assisting two large financial institutions to increase their capacity on PlatformDIGITAL in APAC and North America. And yet another example of our growing partnerships, an AI SaaS provider and recognized leader in natural language speech synthesis is growing their commitment to PlatformDIGITAL with an expansion of current AI workloads where proximity is the driving requirement. A Global 2000 manufacturer is rearchitecting their network on PlatformDIGITAL with a regional hub to improve efficiency, lower their network costs, and implement controls while eliminating the capital cost of maintaining their own facilities. And two leading financial services firms are both leveraging PlatformDIGITAL to extend their respective virtual desktop infrastructure environments to improve performance and user experience across their North American and EMEA employee base. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the second quarter. We continue to make meaningful progress on ESG performance. We were recognized by TIME and Statista as one of the world's most sustainable companies of 2024. We also released our Annual ESG Report in June, highlighting our ongoing efforts to develop and operate responsibly. As described in our ESG report, we further increased our renewable energy supplies with 152 data centers now matched with 100% renewable energy. We improved water efficiency and expanded the use of recycled water, which accounted for 43% of our total water consumption last year. We also launched a new supplier engagement program to drive sustainability and decarbonization through our supply chain. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier. Hi. Thanks, Richard. So I would say in the greater than 1-megawatt category, we're seeing a continuation of the trends we've been playing out for the last several quarters. The biggest customers are desiring, one, contiguous capacity blocks that are very large; two, they want them right now or as soon as possible; and three, the desire of fungible markets, i.e., markets where they can service certainly GenAI workloads, trading ultimately inference, but also if they miss the measure, they can support their cloud computing needs as well. So we have not seen a -- the ease in terms of the demand for those attributes in the market. Hi, thanks, Irvin. So I think the one big deal or the one market you were pointing to is just the North America greater than 1 megawatt. Now just a mix of composition of deals. This quarter, in particular, Dallas market really led the way. It's had outside strength and this is actually a quarter where we didn't actually have any signings into our Northern Virginia market, which was not a lack of demand for that market, and we still have some great options for customers available at large capacity blocks in two parts of that market, but we just didn't penned anything in this particular quarter. So if you look more broadly, I think almost all the other, call it regions in both segments had an uptick in rates and that's always on apples-to-apples that the mix in the region could be different metros like that one example I just gave you, but that would be only outlier is the one that I just discussed. Thanks, Michael. Maybe I'll kick it off and then Greg can expand upon this. So this topic is not new. I think we have embarked on this journey at least 18 -- or at least a year and a half ago and made great progress, call it accumulating north of $10 billion or call it hyperscale private ventures with numerous parties. You've seen that few places, which we called out in the prepared remarks, we've seen our fee revenue having a step up of a recurring revenue basis in the P&L. Two, you've seen that in the balance sheet. Those private capital initiatives have obviously certainly moved our balance sheet from a defensive posture to an offensive posture and allow us to now pull forward some of these great projects in our land bank that's north of 3 gigawatts of runway of growth for our customers. And maybe I'll ask Greg just to give you a slightest preview of what's next in that evolution when it comes to our private strategic product accounting initiatives. Thanks, Jon. So I mean, we are -- if you almost think it was like a continuous conveyor belt of trying to deliver timely product for end customers' needs, that's certainly playing out in our enterprise colocation markets model. And now apply more than ever on the larger capacity blocks. This quarter and -- this quarter the book to sign a commencement was elongated out to about 20-ish months. That was based on one particular customer that we serviced and they had a very locational sensitive need than a radius restriction. And the only thing where we had in that radius was the land state. Luckily, it was on a cadence where we own the land and we were ready to get moving on. So that obviously elongated to be called delivery timeline for that particular signing. We excluded that, where we were basically call signing commencing like 4.5 type months. So we're continuously obviously delivering capacity and adding new capacity, whether it's from land to sell active suites and making sure we're maintaining our production slots and vendor relationships from that time of delivery in our 50 plus metros around the world. Hi, thanks, Ari. Why don't I first let Colin just speak to the pipeline overall and then we can kind of talk about a little bit development side of that as well as new markets? Then Ari, on the second part of your question, I would say, we remain very focused on our core markets, north of 50 of them around the world, nearly 30 countries on six continents. Those markets we continuously see robust and diverse customer demand. I'm talking cloud commute from the numerous CSPs, enterprise, hybrid, IT, and service providers in markets where we see really long-term barriers. And to be speaking to our actions on those, a sizable piece of our activation in shells moving from our 3-plus gigawatt land bank into shells and ultimately to be delivered in suites is all in those same core markets. Thanks, Dave. So obviously posted apples-to-apples from a 50% contribution last quarter to this quarter is probably closer a quarter of our science. We would say, we really pin on AI use cases. But I would caveat that in a few ways. One, that's in a quarter that's not our record quarter, but I think the top four quarter overall signings, great contribution of both 0 to 1 and plus 1 megawatt, as well as a near record in interconnection signings. And that means we're still winning with the traditional demand drivers of digital transformation, cloud computing, and the like, that though that demand is not nearly exhausted shelf or played out. I would also say that there was certainly a deal that I didn't count in the category of AI that is certainly pushing the envelope on power density and post-ink drawing, already thinking about evolving that capacity block or signed with them in towards what will ultimately be supporting AI down the road is my guess, which I think speaks to the modularity of design and how we're able to scale infrastructure to the demands of our customers as they needed. The second part of your question, let -- first off, I don't want to confuse the word offense with M&A. I think we've not done any real M&A or external growth for several years now. You can maybe save the resolution of the Cyxtera relationship, but that was I think making lemonade out of lemons more than anything. And when I use the word offense, I mean, that's converting this 3 plus gigawatt land bank, which we've assembled over the years, i.e., we didn't just go buy that yesterday and turning that into a great product for our customers to land and expand in -- at great returns on our investment. And you've been seeing that play out now with our ROIs and development schedule, crescendoing into the double-digits. You've seen that in the pricing power and you've seen our value proposition really resonate in all of our customer segments across our core markets. And lastly, our eye is on the price of accelerating the bottom line. That's where we reoriented our strategy 18 months ago about our value proposition, integrated, innovating, bolstering, diversifying our capital sources. And all those things were about, call it making sure we're driving per share -- FFO per share growth that's accelerating and it's going to be continuously compounding for years to come. So there is been no divergence in that conviction of what comes next for the rest of 2024 and what we've said about 2025, next year. Thanks, Eric. I mean, I would outcast that market rent growth is continuing to move in our favor. You've seen two elements happening, the most precious capacity blocks in the key markets like in Northern Virginia continue to set new records in terms of rates. And you've also seen a catch-up phenomenon where other markets in North America or outside of the U.S. are catching up a fair bit in terms of their trajectory of growth. Listen, I look at this, you've got these waves of demand being cloud computing and digital transformation, hybrid IT, and now AI that are just getting going in some of these. They're large and dynamic and it's happening in a supply constraint backdrop from numerous avenues of supply constraint. And those elements are ultimately resulting in the increases in rate that we've been able to execute on for several quarters and I believe will be three quarters in common. And I also believe they will likely outstrip the -- whatever inflationary cost we see in terms of build costs and at least maintain these ROIs, if not continue to notch it up slightly higher. Jim, I think that there is a few phenomenons happening. One, we're getting closer, I mean, some of these constraints popped up now a years in a rearview mirror. And we're obviously inching our way close to destinations of resolutions, be it in Northern Virginia, which I think 2026 is supposedly above or within like in Santa Clara and there is other non-U.S. markets as well. At the same time as we approach the power constraints, there is obviously a good potential that the delivery dates may not deliver on time. These are multifaceted projects that require easement, substations, construction projects. At the same time, the demand didn't standstill while the power was constrained. The second phenomenon I think they're seeing is -- this is becoming a more pervasive topic. It was very focused on one cloud center of the universe market with Northern Virginia and we're hearing more and more about other markets. And lastly, I wouldn't pin it just on power. Yes, the power has got broader generation issues in the economy that we're trying to green. It's got transmission issues that navigate municipalities and substation deliveries and transmission lines cutting through the backyards of folks that rather not have them there. But there are also other elements of sustainability concerns, moratoriums in certain parts of the world. And so I think that this is a multifaceted supply constraint, which I would also mention that even if it does get fixed, has a propensity that could -- history could repeat itself here. So I think this is going to make our value proposition with what we deliver to our customers even more compelling and valuable at the end of the day. I'll take the -- mainly the second -- first and second part of your question, I'll ask Matt to comment on our outlook on leasing spreads and really kind of talk about the stairstep in our exploration schedule, which does -- call it, become even more attractive in its coming years. But I think from -- the heart of your second question is the broader AI theme question you're hearing more on -- in the mainstream media over AI overdone, this is a bubble, what could come next? I think some of that is not unnecessarily 100% germane to what we're seeing. And the reason I say that is in our business, when it comes to AI, we are signing long-term contracts, I'm talking 15 years with some of the largest, most established technology companies ever. Two, and I mentioned before, we're doing that, we're not chasing this out to unproven territories. We're focused on core markets with robust and diverse customer demand where traditional use cases, be it cloud commuting from numerous CSPs, enterprise, hybrid IT, and service provider demand are continuing to grow over time, and even if the AI has peaks and valleys. And we're doing it in markets that we believe are real term -- real long-term supply constraints. And lastly, all this is happening probably in the most supply-constrained moment in the last 20 years of data centers. So I don't -- I'm not sure or convinced that even if AI takes a breather on its long-term innovation trajectory. I think that volatility -- we are somewhat insulated in our sector from that volatility based on how we're pursuing it. But Matt, why don't you hit on the question? Colin, why don't you -- I think that's a great question because we are obviously spending a lot of time on the bigger deals right now. But Colin, why don't you walk-through on the highlights of the quarter? Thanks, Michael. So the -- just to clarify, I would say, CapEx is the core and I think it's how we funded, which I think the same concept you're outlining in your question. The CapEx intensity is being pulled forward, right? We talked about this of greenlining more shell capacity, ultimately suites in a super highly leased -- pre-leased development pipeline at very attractive returns. So we're seeing the CapEx intensity increase. We're intersecting at great rates, great returns for our business for good -- and supporting great customers in numerous markets. And we've now positioned ourselves in a balance sheet position of greater strength, not only just from our leverage standpoint but from our liquidity and our diverse sources of capital. And what we're trying to do is essentially use the levers of using our public capital and our private capital to get back to, call it mid-single digits, call it floor to our growth next year and then it's further acceleration on top of that. And do that in a consistent year -- method of compounding that growth for numerous years to come. So it's really those levers of using public and private capital to drive that bottom line to new levels and on a consistent framework. I think Dave - you got to remember that our portfolio is not all -- just call it hyperscale. And the hyperscale portion of this business can literally be 100% leased in many buildings or markets, right? And my gut is that chart, which I think data center walk, which they're doing the best they can, is very much about more of a hyperscale lens. I was actually pretty pleased on the occupancy front. We're up 100 basis points in the same-store occupancy quarter-over-quarter and we have a big same-store pool. It's not mountain. We're also actively taking it one step backwards sometimes on occupancy to take two, three, four steps forward when vacant -- when suites come back and scale and we convert those to Colo and really support our customers' Colo growth as well. So this was the year we said that with occupancy, we're going to be moving the needle and we have been moving the needle. We got more to do in that arena. So I think we'll be seeing -- see it move up. And if you look at, you can also look to get a number of apples-to-apples. If you look at their occupancy, we show by markets. There are certain markets of way less than 60% vacancy that are just very much heavily weighted towards our hyperscale business. They just have a much, much smaller a footprint like Northern Virginia, where if you parse through it, especially on a megawatt basis. I wish, I had that type of vacancy to sell right now and we just don't. Matt, why don't you hit the dividend question first and Colin, and I can hit a little bit on what we're seeing in the enterprise demand piece of the puzzle? And just one, Chris, why don't you just chime in on the early reads on the HD Colo 2.0, with some of the -- I would say an uptick in the enterprise segment? Thanks. So I mean customers are -- especially when it comes to larger capacity blocks, they're really trying to future proof and that's where our 3 gigawatts of growth comes in handy. So they certainly -- the nearest-term deliveries are precious, but I think in the years ahead. Now that particular example, as I mentioned, the 20 months was elongated because that customer -- one particular customer had very much their eyesight on a particular market and then various restrictions about where they could grow and where we can support that growth, we are literally their capacity. So that we were able to do deliver as fast as we could, but it certainly elongated. Look, excluding that one outlier, we're close to 4.5 months. And I think you'll -- I wouldn't count on those outliers consistently popping up, they'll be more sporadic. Thank you. Digital Realty posted another strong quarter in 2Q with record leasing in the first half, demonstrating how Digital Realty is positioned to support the elevated level of demand we continue to see for data center infrastructure. Fundamental strength continued through the second quarter with robust leasing volume, healthy pricing, and record commencements poised to drive an acceleration in bottom line growth. We continue to innovate and integrate with the rollout of HD Colo 2.0 and the addition of new cloud on-ramps to PlatformDIGITAL in the quarter. Then we have repositioned the balance sheet by recycling capital out of stabilized assets, diversifying our capital sources, and reducing our leverage. All of this was done with an eye towards improving our growth profile while supporting our customers' growing needs. We are excited about this quarter's results and remain optimistic about the outlook for data center demand and our position in the market. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today and would like to thank our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world turning. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] \n I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead. \nJordan Sadler: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer; Colin McLean are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. \n Management will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. \n This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. \n Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our first quarter. First, our customer value proposition continues to resonate as reflected by an AI-driven acceleration in leasing activity that drove our overall leasing volume to a new record. First quarter leasing was more than 40% above our prior record, principally driven by an improvement in pricing. \n Second, our fundamental strength picked up where 2023 left off with record cash re-leasing spreads and strong, stabilized same-capital cash NOI growth of 4.7%, reflecting continued strength in data center fundamentals combined with the benefit of the improvements that we have made to our portfolio over the past year. \n And third, we've made meaningful progress on our 2024 funding plan [ already ], with just over $1 billion of fresh capital raised from asset sales and joint ventures to date, putting us above the low end of our guidance range for 2024, just 1/3 of the way through the year. \n As a result of our efforts, reported leverage fell from 6.2x at year-end to 6.1x at March 31 and remains at 5.8x on a pro forma basis, reflecting completed and announced transactions. \n With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power. \nAndrew Power: Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Following the successful course we set in 2023, Digital Realty experienced accelerating momentum in the first quarter of 2024, headlined by a collection of multifaceted AI opportunities that drove a number of new leasing records as demand for our capacity in core markets remains elevated while visibility surrounding competitive new supply remains cloudy. \n At Digital, we continue to focus on our strategic priorities and on delivering on behalf of our expanding list of 5,000-plus customers across our 50-plus markets in 25-plus countries on 6 continents. \n During the first quarter, we posted record leasing results surpassing our prior record by more than 40% and exceeding our leasing results for all of 2019 in just this 1 quarter. We also delivered strong operating results as evidenced by healthy stabilized same-capital growth and the highest re-leasing spreads in the company history. \n We continue to innovate and integrate a further expansion of ServiceFabric through the launch of our Service Directory marketplace, which has seen the addition of over 90 members offering more than 150 services, including secure and direct connections to over 225 global cloud on ramps, creating a vibrant community for [ seamless ], interconnection and collaboration. \n And just last week, we launched Private AI Exchange powered by ServiceFabric, which enables enterprise data to be at the center of an AI architecture, directly adjacent and interconnected with AI capabilities. This architecture are leading the data [ crafted ] barriers that emerge as data is generated and exchange with multiple applications across end-to-end AI-enabled digital workflows. \n We also continued down the path of bolstering our balance sheet and diversifying our capital sources with the expansion of one of our stabilized hyperscale joint ventures and the addition of a new hyperscale development JV, together with our first transaction with our perpetual capital partner, Digital Core REIT and well over the year. These transactions help to fund development pipeline capacity that our customers are seeking while reducing our overall leverage. \n Operating and financial results in the first quarter were encouraging. We posted sequential growth in our core data center revenues while growing adjusted EBITDA and core FFO per share. Development returns also continued to improve and we further enhanced the product mix of our portfolio while maintaining strong liquidity and lower leverage. \n Bookings and renewal results were even better with a number of metrics reaching new records, reflecting a strong demand environment and limited new capacity. Total bookings were $252 million, well ahead of our prior quarterly record of $176 million, reflecting the impact from the acceleration of AI and the improved pricing environment. \n Importantly, when comparing this quarter's leasing to the prior record set in 3Q 2022, we leased an incremental 10% of IT load capacity while REITs in a greater than 1 megawatt segment for approximately 60% higher than those achieved 18 months prior. \n Perhaps have been overshadowed by these record-setting results was another strong quarter in our 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment, which delivered a third straight quarter of over $50 million. Demand for connectivity-oriented capacity remains healthy and pricing remains firm. \n Our mark-to-market renewal spreads were up by 11.8%, aided by a record 18.5% increase in our greater than 1 megawatt category. Churn remained low and well controlled at 1.7% for the quarter. \n Same capital cash NOI growth also remained healthy, growing by 4.7% year-over-year in the quarter. And marking our fifth consecutive quarter of positive same capital growth. A year ago, data center demand was strong, driven by the growth of cloud and digital transformation while supply was tightening in power transmission constraints, supply chain delays and other factors. Since then, AI has become a significant driver of demand as hyperscalers race to develop, deploy and implement the technology while enterprise begins to explore the potential of this wave of technological evolution. \n McKinsey recently forecasted data center demand growth at a double-digit CAGR through 2030. This growing secular demand is broad and deep and both enterprises and service providers need a significant new data center capacity to accommodate their expanding needs, fueled by trends such as enterprise AI adoption, AI as a service, IoT and the relentless growth in data creation. \n Reflecting these trends, I want to highlight 2 highly strategic AI signs that came to fruition during the quarter. First, we were selected to host one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in one of our data centers in Copenhagen in a collaboration spearheaded on the Novo Nordisk Foundation and the Export and Investment Fund of Denmark where researchers from Denmark's public and private sectors, access to a cutting-edge NVIDIA-powered AI supercomputer in addition to NVIDIA's software platforms, training and expertise. \n Second, Digital Realty further strengthened its collaboration with Oracle to accelerate the growth and adoption of AI among enterprises, aiming to develop hybrid integrated solutions that address data gravity challenges, expedite time to market for enterprise deploying next-generation AI services and unlock data and AI-based business outcomes. Oracle will deploy critical GPU-based infrastructure with Digital Realty that leverages PlatformDIGITAL's open, purpose-built global data center solution and caters to enterprise and AI customers critical NVIDIA and AMD deployments among others. \n Our 0 to1 plus interconnection customers also continue to recognize our demonstrable strength and value proposition whether that related to power dense applications, a network of globally-connected data centers or other critical infrastructure requirements. \n During the first quarter, we added over 128 new logos. Our wins included a leading Fortune 500 AI component maker, is expanding their presence on PlatformDIGITAL to a new EMEA market to support their streaming service capabilities. \n A global cloud computing and content distribution provider are leveraging the leading connectivity proposition of PlatformDIGITAL in Mombasa to support their global edge pop expansion project. A global 120 manufacturing company is building an AI HPC environment in Frankfurt to support its autonomous vehicle project. \n A leading French cloud service provider is deploying on PlatformDIGITAL to build out its edge cloud offering across the globe to support their enterprise customers' hybrid infrastructure by delivering low latency performance while retaining mobile data residency. \n Fortune 500 technology distributor in [indiscernible], IT service provider chose PlatformDIGITAL and Phoenix to support data exchange and interconnect with key partners. And a Fortune 500 health benefits provider has expanded into 2 additional North America metros to take advantage of cloud and network [indiscernible] available on PlatformDIGITAL. \n Moving over to a quick update on our largest market, Northern Virginia. During the first quarter, we leased approximately 80 megawatts of capacity in a supply-constrained quarter in Eastern Loudoun County. Demand for our capacity remains strong. And while hyperscale leasing is typically lumpy, we continue to see healthy traction on the remaining capacity, and we are focused on helping our customers and partners source the incremental data center infrastructure that they require. \n During the first quarter, we worked with Dominion Energy to help address the transmission [ model ] at Ashburn by providing them with a easement to land a southern line at the Mars substation that they plan to construct on a quarter parcel, along 450-acre Digital Dallas campus. \n We remain cautiously optimistic about getting access to additional power with Dominion's current forecast for completion of the Southern Line transmission project by late 2025. \n Today, we have roughly 80 megawatts of remaining capacity available for lease within our first building on our Digital Dallas campus in Loudoun known as Building 7. And we have almost 200 megawatts available for development for our [ regular ] campus in Manassas, which was contributed to our JV with last [indiscernible] in the first quarter. As a reminder, Manassas is currently outside of the constrained area and [indiscernible] is accessible there. \n Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the first quarter. We continue to make meaningful progress and be recognized for our strong ESG performance in 2024. We went live with a switch to 100% renewable energy supplies for our Texas, New Jersey, and Sydney data center portfolios, benefiting 30 sites and addressing more than 10% of our mobile electricity footprint. \n We are recognized by the EPA as Energy Star Partner of the Year with sustained excellence for the fourth year, and we added a new green building certification at our MRS 4 development at Marseille, France. We also announced a partnership with a leading global energy solution provider to use our UPS systems to support Ireland's transition to renewable energy. \n And we've announced a significant expansion of our use of HVO diesel, a cleaner fuel made from waste, cooking oils and fats to power our backup generators. This will up our use of HVO to 20 global sites and 15% of our global portfolio by IT capacity. \n We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. \n With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier. \nMatthew Mercier: Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our first quarter results. We signed a record $252 million of new leases in the first quarter, led by $175 million of greater than a megawatt leasing in the Americas and another $53 million of 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection leasing, with interconnection bookings remaining firm at $13 million. \n Turning to our backlog. Given the record leasing, the backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases swelled to a new record of $541 million at quarter end, with new leasing outstripping a record $156 million of commencements during the quarter. Looking ahead, more than half of the record backlog is slated to commence during the remainder of 2024, indicating that commencements are likely to remain elevated. \n During the first quarter, we signed a record $248 million of renewal leases at a record increase of 11.8% on a cash basis. Re-leasing spreads were once again positive across products and regions, with particular strength in the Americas. Re-leasing spreads have been increasing steadily for well over a year now, and while we expect that they will remain very healthy, they're likely to moderate in this quarter's record given the significant weighting of lease expirations in the 0 to 1-megawatt segment for the remainder of the year. \n In addition, we think it is important to consider a normalized view of the headline renewal spreads as 2 separate items skew our reported spreads higher in the first quarter. First, there was a notable outlier in the other category that should not be considered recurring or repeatable and removing this transaction would reduce our overall reported spreads by 250 basis points to 9.3% for the quarter. \n Second, there was a significant early renewal transaction in our greater than 1 megawatt segment that was part of a large package deal as we work to support this customer's broader data center capacity needs in one of our tightest markets. While this transaction enabled us to opportunistically pull forward some of our below-market expirations from the outer years, our forward year lease expiration schedule remains dominated by our 0 to 1 megawatt segment, which tends to experience spreads in the low to mid-single digits, akin to what we saw in the first quarter. \n Excluding both the outlier transaction and the packaged deal renewal, re-leasing spreads in the quarter would have been up 3.4% on a cash basis. We feel that this is a more predictable aspect of our portfolio, that we will continue to see opportunities and may periodically be able to capture the growing mark-to-market opportunity in our greater than 1 megawatt portfolio. \n In terms of earnings growth, we reported first quarter core FFO of $1.67 per share, reflecting strong organic operating results, partly balanced by dilution associated with the stabilized asset sales and JV contributions completed early in the year and the ongoing deleveraging of our balance sheet. \n And normalizing for the sale or JV of $3 billion of stabilized assets completed since the beginning of last year, total revenue growth was 7% year-over-year in the first quarter due to the benefit of improved leasing spreads, along with favorable new leasing. Revenue growth in the quarter was tempered by the decline in utility expense reimbursements as electricity rates fell sharply in EMEA year-over-year. \n Normalized adjusted EBITDA increased 9% year-over-year, reflecting the strong revenue growth and modest increase in operating expenses. As Andy noted earlier, stabilized same-capital operating performance saw continued strength in the first quarter, with year-over-year cash NOI up 4.7% driven by 4% growth in rental plus interconnection revenues and further supported by expense control. \n Moving on to our investment activity. We spent $550 million on consolidated development for the first quarter, plus another $23 million for our share of managed unconsolidated JV spending while delivering 32 megawatts of new capacity across the globe for our customers. \n It's worth mentioning, the approximate $300 million of sequential decline in our development spending this quarter which highlights the effects of the contributions of our 3 development JVs. However, seasonal and other timing-related factors also contributed to less CapEx spending in the first quarter. \n Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet in the first quarter with the closing of previously disclosed transactions, including the Cyxtera transaction, the first phase of the Blackstone hyperscale development JV and the sale of an additional 50% share of the 2 stabilized hyperscale assets in our Chicago JV to GI Partners. \n During the quarter, we also completed a hyperscale development JV with Mitsubishi for 2 assets in the Dallas Metro. In terms of new news, we also sold a piece of land in Sydney, Australia for $65 million, and we provided an easement to Dominion Energy to build the Mars substation on our Digital Dulles campus for $92 million, which all contributed to a reduction in our reported leverage to 6.1x at the end of the first quarter versus 6.2x at the end of 2023. \n Then in April, we continue to recycle capital by selling 75% of CH2, the third and final stabilized hyperscale facility on our Elk Grove campus at a 6.5 cap rate to GI Partners, raising nearly $400 million. And we sold to Digital Core REIT, an additional 24.9% interest in our Frankfurt site where Digital Core REIT previously owned 25%, raising another $129 million. \n In addition, we used some of our cash on hand to pay off the $600 million of maturing euro notes. After adjusting for these transactions, along with the anticipated closing of Phase 2 of the Blackstone transaction later this year, pro forma leverage is 5.8x. \n We continue to keep significant cash on the balance sheet with approximately $1.2 billion on hand and over $3 billion of total liquidity at March 31 to support ongoing investment opportunities. \n Moving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is over 4 years, and our weighted average interest rate is 2.9%. Approximately 85% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 86% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. \n Finally, after paying off the [ earnouts ] in April, we have $316 million of debt maturing through year-end 2024. Beyond that, our maturities remained well [ levered ] through 2032. \n I'll finish with guidance. We are maintaining our core FFO guidance range for the full year 2024 of between $6.60 and $6.75 per share, reflecting the continued improvement we are seeing in our core business. Positive underlying operating trends are partly balanced by potential acceleration in development spending and additional capital recycling, as we move our leverage down towards the long-term target and position the company for the accelerating opportunity in front of us. \n We are maintaining our total revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges for 2024, so we are notching up our cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads along with our same capital cash NOI growth expectations, reflecting better-than-expected execution on the leasing front in the first quarter, and the strength in fundamental conditions that we continue to see across our portfolio. \n Specifically, cash re-leasing spreads are now expected to increase 5% to 7% in 2024, up 100 basis points at the midpoint from the prior 4% to 6% range. And same-capital cash NOI is now expected to increase by 2.5% to 3.5%, up 50 basis points from the 2% to 3% range we provided in February. \n Highlighted in our investor presentations, excluding the nearly 200 basis points of power margin headwinds that we have previously discussed, our same-capital cash NOI growth for 2024 would be 4.5% to 5.5%. While these improvements and stronger core FFO per share realized in the first quarter bode well for the balance of the year, there are a few mitigating factors to consider as you're refining your models. First, we will see a modest drag on the $500-plus million of capital recycling completed in April. Second, we are only 1/3 of the way into the year, and there is still significant potential for both development spend and asset sales guidance to reach the high end of their guidance ranges. \n In addition, it is worth pointing out that the interest rate outlook and curve have changed considerably since we provided guidance and remains another source of uncertainty for the balance of this year. \n Just one final reminder and update. Over the course of 2024 and 2025, we expect that our $6 billion development pipeline will become increasingly accretive as higher-yielding projects are completed and stabilized. The expected yield on our stabilized pipeline ticked up another 20 basis points sequentially, reflecting the addition of higher-yielding projects and the completion or contribution to joint ventures of lower-yielding projects. \n To help provide increased transparency around this important and evolving aspect of our company, we have enhanced our development life cycle schedule on Page 25 of our supplemental to: one, reflect our proportionate share of total data center development, including our unconsolidated joint ventures; and two, to provide increased disclosure around our available developable capacity in terms of [ IQ logo ]. We hope you find this helpful. \n This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, could you please begin the Q&A session? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. \nJonathan Petersen: Great. I guess I could start with -- actually, let me start on the leasing side. So the -- I was curious how much of the leasing that was done this quarter was inside of some of the joint ventures, like maybe the Blackstone joint venture, that you did.\n And in terms of the yield on development in Northern Virginia -- or North America, I noticed that was up 200 basis points to 12.3% as your expected yield from last quarter. I guess, is that kind of a good number to think about of what new developments you're signing today are as kind of in the 12-plus percent range. \nAndrew Power: So John, thanks for the question. So I'd say the lion's share of high, high percentage was not done into any of the JVs. I don't have the exact stat given we have now numerous strategic capital partners across our hyperscale platform, be it stabilized JVs. But I'm very confident that none of the leasing we reported in this quarter went into the deal you identified with Blackstone. We are seeing great traction on those projects. But this quarter, none of that lease went inside.\n On your second question in terms of improvement in ROIs, in particular in North America, I would say we've definitely moved the needle quite dramatically on that category from some of our build-to-suit projects that we'll call closer to 7% that we joint ventured to now north of 12% ROIs. And we're still working through projects that are obviously weighing that down a little bit, and we have projects that are entering that schedule on the higher side as well given the rapid improvement in the rate environment. \nOperator: And our next question today comes from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. \nJonathan Atkin: So you mentioned rate environment and maybe continuing on that theme a little bit in terms of pricing. As we think about next year's core FFO per share growth rate, you gave a little bit of commentary on that in the last call. And any updated thoughts in terms of what we should be considering around puts and takes as that number potentially goes higher, whether it's execution of leases or pricing or renewals or whatnot? \nAndrew Power: Thanks, Jon. Maybe I'll speak to market rates and where we are able to execute on new leases signed and also renewals first and then hand it over to Matt in terms of FFO trajectory into next year.\n As you saw from our results, we're obviously benefiting from overall supply/demand dynamic with robust demand trends be it enterprise digital transformation, cloud computing and now AI on top of that, that's playing out in our 0 to 1-megawatt category as well as our greater than megawatt category. And that's all having a backdrop of supply constraints from numerous sources. And we were able to continue to push rate both on the existing contracts that were coming up for renewal as well as on new contracts to higher and higher levels. That is, obviously, you see in the leasing results and believe that trend is going to remain intact for some time.\n Matt, why don't you speak to the FFO trajectory, please? \nMatthew Mercier: Sure. Thanks, Jon. So what I would say is I think we're -- based on our first quarter results, we -- our optimism is improved -- has improved in terms of our -- what we expect to see and what we talked about last quarter in terms of improving growth as we look to 2025.\n And a big part of that, I would say, is driven by the successful leasing execution that we saw this quarter, $250 million and the shorter signed commence lag, which is at 7 months, it really sets us up for accelerating revenue and therefore, bottom line growth as we exit this year and into next year.\n But from boiling all that down, I would say that the growth algorithm is generally similar to what I discussed last quarter, which is we'd expect to see, call it, plus 4% related to our stabilized same-store portfolio. On top of that, you'd add another, call it, 2-plus percent as we deliver developments into our operating portfolio at yields that are continuing to improve. There'll be some offset, call it, in the 1% area, given higher rates and the debt refinancing that we have over the next couple of years. And I think that kind of sets us up for mid-single-digit and greater growth going forward. \nOperator: And our next question today comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. \nEric Luebchow: I wanted to dive into Northern Virginia a little bit. Can you maybe just provide an update on the timing of the Dominion transmission upgrades and when you think you can get even more capacity into that market? And then on rental rates in Northern Virginia, I think that probably had a big influence on the 170-plus you reported in North America. Could you just talk about where you're seeing rental rates in that very supply-constrained market and what that kind of -- how that influences your yields, your underwriting and your development table? \nAndrew Power: Sure. Thanks, Eric. So Northern Virginia, obviously, has been a highly dynamic market for some time here. We were very pleased to come together and support our partner at Dominion with a very strategic easement to be the landing of the Mars substation, which we are -- it is our understanding, they are on track to be delivering power and bring power back online by the beginning of 2026 from that southern line. So there's not been a divergence in terms of timing what that was previously expressed to us.\n We definitely benefited from the increase in rates in that market. Our largest signing was in that market as well as a few other decent-sized signings, although we also had some very great signings in the London market, and north of a megawatt signings also in Copenhagen. So they were not the only contributors in the plus the megawatt category.\n The rates, I would say, the market rates in general are call it, continue to improve in that market and as the precious capacity becomes more and more finite, as you saw on that slide, we now have -- are turning our attention to really 80 megawatts remaining at Digital Dallas as well as the Manassas campus, which is not impacted by the power delays. And I'd say rates in both Manassas and Loudoun County are converging right at this moment, call it in the 165, call it to almost 180 type area on a market basis. That'd be the cash rate, not a GAAP rate that we report. \nOperator: And our next question today comes from David Barden with Bank of America. \nDavid Barden: I guess if I could just explore, Andy, the commentary around how AI is contributing already to your business. A lot of the retail data center-centric companies have kind of said that's not really a thing for them yet. So could you kind of elaborate a little bit on within that greater than 1 megawatt category, how much of that is the hyperscale? Is it really hyperscale? Or is it these maybe more bespoke Copenhagen Nordisk Foundation engines that are coming online? And what do these builds look like, in what way are they different than maybe what you've been doing historically? And how is that informing how your development is evolving? \nAndrew Power: Sure. Thanks, David. So let me just give you the tops of the ways then I'm going to turn it to Chris on how we're tapping our infrastructure capabilities to really excel in this category.\n Obviously, the data points are smaller in the more enterprise-oriented wins, but they are there. We, I would say, call it, less than 0.5 megawatt supported through a partner, a global manufacturing company, on its AI journey in Europe. You noted the slightly larger than that, but still not -- certainly not hyperscale. The great win we had with Novo Nordisk supporting them in their NVIDIA-backed chips with a real landmark win with a supercomputer in their market.\n And then for some time, we've seen the emergence of the hyperscalers with larger capacity block needs. And the largest of our wins in the quarter, I would characterize as an AI win as well. And all in all, it's probably close to 50% of this quarter's signs, which is up relative to prior quarters. And I think there's a lot about what our platform offers that really allows us to capture this demand, maybe even earlier in the an evolution of AI than some others, but Chris can speak to that as well. \nChris Sharp: Yes. No, I appreciate it, David. This is Chris Sharp. And so a couple of comments. I think you're thinking about it correctly in that there's 2 lenses, right? There's kind of that hyperscale lens that has AI built within it. And then there's this other pocket that we kind of look at that's definitely emerging with private AI. And so these are these larger deployments that we're seeing come out from multiple types of enterprises.\n And I think it's important to understand from a design perspective, it kind of starts with a little bit broader in how we master plan our campuses. And so I think the work that we've been doing around building out substations and doing a long-term plan within the market has allowed us to then bring a very large capacity block design to market, which is very modular. And I think in that modularity, it's something that we continue to ideate with our customers to be able to support the varying power densities.\n And I think we talked last call about HD colo and being able to do what we're very proud about wit  70 kilowatts, but then you'll see us start to evolve over the next quarter here, the ability to even support 150 kilowatts. And so being able to support these densities, which is representative of the AI workload is absolutely paramount to our modular designs and be able to do that very efficiently.\n And then I think the last piece is the heritage. The heritage of the team on a global basis, being able to really meet and ideate with these customer bases is what's really building a distinct differentiator for us to not only capture that hyperscale AI, which we see growing and burgeoning, which you see in the prepared remarks with Oracle and some of those customers.\n But then I think directly to your point, David, these smaller, if you will, from a hyperscale perspective, private AI around Novo Nordisk Foundation and just we really are at the cusp of a lot of this AI demand coming into the PlatformDIGITAL globally. \nOperator: And our next question today comes from Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI. \nJyhhaw Liu: Maybe to piggyback on the prior question related to retail and enterprise. Do you see potential for AI tailwinds to perhaps drive meaningful acceleration to your 0 to 1 megawatt segment, similar to what you saw in the greater than 1 megawatt segment this quarter just as AI workloads begin to evolve towards private AI and inferencing? \nAndrew Power: Sure, Irvin. So I mean, the here and now I think AI is having a numerous positive implications for the sector. And I'll have Chris speak into what's next because I don't think we're really at what's next, be it inference, private data sets, enterprise consumption. But the here and now you have a backdrop of big existing customers with desires to have immediate [ see ] around the capacity.\n There's still -- we're winning that in our core markets where we see robust and diverse demand. We are not falling. We're chasing this demand into unproven locations. We're intersecting it, we're supporting availability zones or on ramps, where there's network density and not in unproven markets.\n You're also seeing new players pop up that obviously are not front of queue for those larger capacity blocks who are going to try to get their hands on what we have and are often able to fit in some of the more challenging places in our portfolio to sell, but they're going to take it because they have urgency around their business models and bringing their AI models on. That's the right now, the last quarter, the next quarter, but there's more to come here in this AI story. And I'll let Chris expand upon it in terms of the next chapter. \nChris Sharp: Yes. Thanks, Irvin. Absolutely. And I think one of the things that we really have thought about for some time now is the data is at the core of a lot of these AI kind of capabilities coming to market. So being to able place that algorithm right next to the data in that market, I think is everything that we've been looking at and doing that algorithm in proximity to the data is absolutely paramount for a lot of these kind of 0 to 1 megawatt offerings.\n And so what we've been thinking about with HD colo and why I talk about on a rack by rack basis, is allowing our customers to leverage a lot of their existing kind of inventory and architecture to bring AI in proximity to that capability. And I think that's where, even recently, we talked about private AI exchange, that's really focused on removing that technical barrier. So customers can get the right state-of-the-art infrastructure, be it NVIDIA, be it AMD and being able to support those power densities in an existing environment. So we do see the future of that coming to market in that fashion.\n I will tell you that -- you brought up inference. Inference is being done within training today just because of time to market, but we do see inference picking up and being a longer-term demand cycle over the years, which I think PlatformDIGITAL is well positioned to continue to support. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Richard Choe with JPMorgan. \nRichard Choe: You noted a pull forward of leases in Northern Virginia. Do you have other -- are you having other conversations? And should we expect to see more of those? \nAndrew Power: Thanks, Richard. Maybe I'll hand it to Colin here in a second to talk about the broader backdrop for both the enterprise and also the hyperscale AI side. But I wouldn't call our Northern Virginia activity as a pull forward. As you could see, they're signed to commence time, materially step down, there is urgency around the capacity blocks. We still have significant runway of precious capacity in the Northern Virginia market between now and 2026 that our numerous customers have desires for and we're in various stages of negotiation.\n And it's not just in Northern Virginia story. We have the similar types of opportunities in other parts of the North America portfolio, be it Santa Clara, Dallas, New Jersey. And we'll also have the equivalent in the major flat markets in Europe, and in parts of Asia Pacific. So -- and I think this trend is going to continue for some time. Now again, you can't predict some of these large capacity blocks executing on consecutive quarters necessarily but I believe it's going to continue. But Colin, why don't you speak a little bit about the pipeline we see on both sides? \nColin McLean: Thanks, Andy. Appreciate the question. Yes, I mean, overall, I would say our pipeline kind of reflects some of the same characteristics or bookings this quarter. So pretty AI heavy, as Andy highlighted, of 50% of our bookings this quarter were AI. I would say our pipeline is representative of that. But honestly, it's a pretty diverse characterization overall between enterprise, namely hybrid, IT, cloud compute and then AI. So I think it's a pretty robust platform across the globe, and you saw that in some of our bookings, in particular, London really jumped up this quarter.\n If you look at the sub-1-megawatt, and really what's going on in the digital transformation story, the explosion of data and really the IT spend, you're seeing a pretty pervasive enterprise activation going on where that is really taking place really across the globe in a big way. That's, in our view, enabled by channel, which this quarter, we had about 22% of our business go through channel, which was, I think, substantive. And those channel partners are really helping us tap into new logos, which you might have seen was 128 this quarter, which I think was fourth highest on record. So I think that's substantial.\n So overall, I'm pretty pleased with the balance we're seeing across the portfolio and the pipeline and hope to see that continue in the future. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. \nMichael Rollins: Just curious if you take a step back, where does the overall mark-to-market it for the portfolio and the anticipated duration over which you could achieve that if pricing were to stay at current levels? \nAndrew Power: I think you asked the overall mark-to-market on the portfolio, Mike? \nMichael Rollins: Yes. \nAndrew Power: So as I think  you can get the -- obviously, you look at the in-place rates even pro forma for our recent positive cash mark-to-market on our schedule. I think that question provide more focus on the greater than megawatt category, which we've seen the greatest resurgence or uptick that it does tick down, call it lower for the next few years, call it down to the 130s and then it even hits 100 upon exploration as the low watermark in a few years' time.\n And I just commented on the Northern Virginia rates, if they call it, 155 to 180. Not all markets are at Northern Virginia. There are some markets that are ahead of Northern Virginia. But it does feel like big deals are gravitating towards that mid-100s type area pretty quickly and universally and it does not seem like that trend is taking any cessation or pause. \nOperator: And our next question today comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. \nFrank Louthan: Great. And kind of to that point, when you're looking at new investment and expansion, how much are you focused on retail colo expansion versus wholesale? And what's kind of pushing you in one direction or the other? \nGregory Wright: Frank, it's Greg right here. Look, I think consistent with past practice, we continue to play across the product spectrum, and it's going to vary by market, right? I mean, as we've mentioned, we're using our third-party capital model to continue to support our hyperscale customers and grow that element of the business. As you know, demand for that business is projected to increase 2.7x between now and 2030.\n And then when you look over at the colocation in the enterprise segment of the product spectrum, that's still supposed to grow. It's still a very large market. People forget about how large that market is, and the solid growth in that market, too, is still like 2.3x. So I mean, we're not sitting here today saying, hey, it's a zero-sum game. We're only going to do enterprise/colo versus hyperscale. It's going to vary by market and what our customer needs are. But we're actually pretty bullish and optimistic on both right now in terms of underlying fundamentals and potential for rent growth. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. \nSimon Flannery: Great. Great to see the leasing in Loudoun County. It looks like the Americas was about 80% of your leasing. Could you just talk a little bit about Europe and Asia Pac? It seems like AI is sort of starting off in the U.S. You talked about Copenhagen as well. But just help us think about broadening this out beyond the kind of key U.S. markets. And then, Matt, on the leverage. Could you just update us on getting -- once you get to the 5.8, what's the plan from there? \nAndrew Power: Thanks, Simon. So I'll do the quick non-U.S. world tour. You're correct, Americas had put up some record results in contribution, and that was not just in the greater than megawatt category. It was also a major contributor in our less than megawatt category, which is great to see.\n Outside the U.S., starting in EMEA on the 0 to 1 megawatt category, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and London shined. And on the greater than 1 megawatt category, which Colin, I think touched on, London turned out to be a big contributor this quarter, which has not been for a while, which is also great to see. We saw a fair bit of importing business into Europe from outside of Europe, on both sides and firm pricing.\n In APAC, while this particular quarter, we did not have a significant contribution from the greater than megawatt category, we did have strong results both in pricing and volume on the 0 to 1 megawatt category with Singapore, Hong Kong and Seoul leading the way. And I would just say that the greater than megawatt category is just the fact that there's just fewer markets in APAC that we're landing big deals into so it's not as consistent of every single quarter being a major contributor. But all in all, I agree with your sentiment that AI is certainly landed on the U.S. shores sooner than the rest of the globe, and I think it has a great propensity to likely globalize as did cloud. \nMatthew Mercier: Yes. Makes sense. So on the leverage front, I mean, just to take a little step back. I mean, hopefully, as you've seen, we've made some considerable progress. You go back a year ago, we were at a little over 7x. We're now at a reported 6.1x, so a full turn of leverage that we've taken out in the last year, thanks to all the work and execution that the broader team has done.\n We continue that. As Greg is seeing, even subsequent to the quarter, we brought in another $500 million of proceeds from some additional JV activities as well as transaction within our Digital Core REIT showing the diversity of capital sources we have. We're going to continue to see as a result of the strong operating fundamentals, continue to increase our overall EBITDA and we're now sitting at approximately $3 billion of liquidity.\n So we're well on our way, and we feel confident about being able to achieve our goal of getting down to 5.5x leverage this year. And I think we've done a lion's share of the work. So we'll continue to execute and feel pretty good about it. \nOperator: And our next question today comes from Aryeh Klein with BMO Capital Markets. \nAryeh Klein: I guess one of your larger customers is at risk of a potential ban in the U.S. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how you perceive the risks around that? And maybe the potential mark-to-market opportunity if it came to that. \nAndrew Power: Thanks, Aryeh. So on all scenarios, we don't want to speak to confidential customer information whatsoever. Obviously, anyone who's picked up a newspaper can refer to the scenario you're talking about. 2 comments: first one, which is just from the cheap seats, I would -- my personal opinion is not to jump up to any draconian conclusions on outcomes just yet. There's a lot of innings left in that game and a lot of outcomes that could happen. So I won't jump to a doomsday scenario for Digital, depending on what plays out in ensuing months.\n And even under that scenario, I would group them among all of our hyperscale customers that have maximized the pricing curve when markets were less softer and have contracts that are, like all our hyperscale customers, some of the best contracts on the books in terms of markup opportunities, certainly, on the south of 100 side rather than the north of 100 side, by and large. So if the doomsday draconian scenario was to play out, which I'm discounting, we would have some churn to refill, but probably couldn't come at a better time with a better mark-to-market opportunity for the company. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. \nMatthew Niknam: Just bigger picture question. With pricing seeing the type of growth it's seeing, supply chain constraints that I think largely plagued the industry a couple of years back are now largely resolved. Can you help us frame what you're seeing in terms of new hyperscale builds that are in-sourced relative to outsourced to partners like yourself?\n And I guess, more importantly, how Digital can enhance the utility it offers its larger customers in what's looking like a firmer pricing backdrop that's likely to persist for some time. \nAndrew Power: Matt, so I would not characterize the world of supply constraints or just hindrances to supply as being in the rearview mirror in general. And maybe we're not talking about the proverbial waiting for your refrigerators COVID supply chain equivalent. But the friction to supply, whether it is power transmission, power generation, supply chains on data center components or just positions in queue for production or components for substations, broader sustainability concerns, nimbyism in general, that friction is existing, and it's happening in a backdrop where I think we can add more and more value to our customers than probably ever before.\n And even despite historical preferences or to often do it yourself, I think by and large, the customer base is seeing having the benefit of global outsourced trusted partner with 20 years of experience operationally, delivery-wise, and really turn in to Digital in their times of need and really at a time or it could be continuing of urgency around those capacity blocks. And that's certainly been highlighted in the Northern Virginia market, but I think that's a broader Americas phenomenon and a growing global phenomena. \nOperator: And our next question today comes from Michael Elias with TD Cowen. \nMichael Elias: Congrats, guys, on a record leasing quarter. Just a quick one for me. I know it's been a while since you guys have done an acquisition. Maybe for Andy or Greg, curious how you're thinking about the potential for M&A, particularly given where your stock is trading right now? \nAndrew Power: Going to Greg on that one, Michael. Thank you for the compliment. \nGregory Wright: Yes. Thanks, Michael. Look, I think right now, our appetite for acquisitions, unless they're smaller tuck-in strategic acquisitions. Michael, I think we've discussed this before. It's not that great right now.\n When we look across most markets, we think we already have the footprint and the product and the team to continue to drive our business and succeed. And as you know, most of our legacy M&A activity was either gaining access to markets, to product or to teams in select markets where we didn't have a real presence. We don't have nearly as much of that today, particularly when you look across the Americas and EMEA.\n Over time, would we continue to look in markets through APAC to potentially grow, yes, but there's not a lot of those platforms, if you will, for example, there's not the logical interaction sitting in APAC for us to try to do a strategic transaction. So while you never say never, I think we look at things today. And Matt and Andy and the team laid out where we are in our development yields and the like. And you look at this on a risk-adjusted basis. And we still prefer right now, at least given current conditions, to buy land and build organically. And we think that's a better risk-adjusted return than what multiples would imply in the M&A market. So I don't think you're going to see a lot. But again, you never say never. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. \nNicholas Del Deo: Andy, earlier you said that you're not going to chase demand into unproven markets, which you're seeing a fair bit of demand today. I guess what sort of thresholds would those markets have to cross before they might become interesting in your eyes, especially if power constraints in key markets remain exceedingly tight or even get worse? Or are they like so far down the list of priorities that we really shouldn't be thinking about them? \nAndrew Power: Thanks, Nick. So I think if you look at our strategy, we're focused on supporting workloads, be it enterprise, digital transformation or hybrid or hyperscale cloud or AI in markets with robust and diverse demand and supporting applications with latency and locational sensitivity.\n The cloud has been around for a long time and did not put [ AZs ] as in every single NFL city in America or it's equivalents around the globe. They picked locations where GDP, population, infrastructure and data are essentially there, which I think lends itself to greater longevity and sustainable growth in our asset class and our strategy and our business.\n Now there's markets that have been added to that list over time. They didn't get -- put chiseled in stone and put away on a shelf years and years ago. But -- so I think new markets for us would have to give us the similar conviction we have, invest in our core markets to want us to go there. So that could happen. That certainly could happen in a rapidly changing world, with power becoming such a precious resource as well as other precious resources. But anything we're thinking about is investing in -- we're not in this [ risk trade ], we're investing in this for the long term, for long-term sustainable growth.\n And we're fortunate, if you can look at our newly tweaked and disclosure on our development cycle, we've got north of 3 gigawatts of growth in land capacity or shell capacity in those core markets. So we've got a lot of runway to harvest that demand before even feeling the urgency to chase into less proven markets. \nOperator: And our final question today comes from Erik Rasmussen at Stifel. \nErik Rasmussen: Obviously, North America is very strong, greater than 1 megawatt. And I think based on your commentary, a lot of that was AI driven. And then also, it seems like it's going to -- AI will sort of follow a similar pattern as we saw with cloud. So would you expect -- I mean I wouldn't expect similar levels of quarterly leasing, but would you expect sort of a similar outperformance throughout the year in North America, especially the greater than 1 megawatt based on sort of the other regions? Just want to get a sense of sort of how the year could be shaping up in terms of the bookings. \nAndrew Power: Thanks, Erik. So just more on the tactical on the quarterly bookings. I mean, we're out of the gates here with a great start on both the less-than-megawatt category, call it north of 50 for several consecutive quarters now. I think 2 in a row, north of 53, great new logos contribution and obviously, an overall record which we discussed. By and large, I wouldn't say usually another record follows the prior record on the one hand. But on the other, we're certainly in a different territory right now in terms of demand. We have the large capacity blocks that are deeply sought after. We have a team focused on executing, and we got 3 more at bats in 2024 to put those results up.\n Bigger backdrop. If you look back at cloud globalizing, it's one of those things that the famous quote \"It happened slowly and then it happened really fast.\" I can remember years of the thesis being it's going to globalize forever and ever, and then it really took off. So I'm not -- I wouldn't -- I couldn't pound the table and say 2024 year is the year that AI globalizes like cloud. But signs do point that it should follow a similar trend over time. \nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power, for his closing remarks. Andy, please go ahead. \nAndrew Power: Thank you all for dialing in. We really appreciate it. Digital Realty had a strong first quarter with record leasing results that reflected the growing impact of AI on our business. Fundamental strength continued through the first quarter with healthy same-capital organic growth and robust re-leasing spreads.\n We've continued to innovate with the expansion of ServiceFabric, new products like our Private AI Exchange, along with modular designs to accommodate increasingly power dense workloads.\n Finally, we've closed a number of transactions already this year bringing in additional private capital and enhancing our ability to deliver new capacity to meet our customers' growing needs. We are excited about this quarter's results and look ahead with continued optimism. The 3 key demand drivers, AI, cloud and enterprise digital transformation are showing no signs of letting up, and we are well positioned with over 300 data centers across the key markets around the world.\n I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and would like to thank our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world running. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. This conference has now concluded, and we thank you for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful afternoon.",

            "content": "Frank, it's Greg right here. Look, I think consistent with past practice, we continue to play across the product spectrum, and it's going to vary by market, right? I mean, as we've mentioned, we're using our third-party capital model to continue to support our hyperscale customers and grow that element of the business. As you know, demand for that business is projected to increase 2.7x between now and 2030.\n And then when you look over at the colocation in the enterprise segment of the product spectrum, that's still supposed to grow. It's still a very large market. People forget about how large that market is, and the solid growth in that market, too, is still like 2.3x. So I mean, we're not sitting here today saying, hey, it's a zero-sum game. We're only going to do enterprise/colo versus hyperscale. It's going to vary by market and what our customer needs are. But we're actually pretty bullish and optimistic on both right now in terms of underlying fundamentals and potential for rent growth. Yes. Thanks, Michael. Look, I think right now, our appetite for acquisitions, unless they're smaller tuck-in strategic acquisitions. Michael, I think we've discussed this before. It's not that great right now.\n When we look across most markets, we think we already have the footprint and the product and the team to continue to drive our business and succeed. And as you know, most of our legacy M&A activity was either gaining access to markets, to product or to teams in select markets where we didn't have a real presence. We don't have nearly as much of that today, particularly when you look across the Americas and EMEA.\n Over time, would we continue to look in markets through APAC to potentially grow, yes, but there's not a lot of those platforms, if you will, for example, there's not the logical interaction sitting in APAC for us to try to do a strategic transaction. So while you never say never, I think we look at things today. And Matt and Andy and the team laid out where we are in our development yields and the like. And you look at this on a risk-adjusted basis. And we still prefer right now, at least given current conditions, to buy land and build organically. And we think that's a better risk-adjusted return than what multiples would imply in the M&A market. So I don't think you're going to see a lot. But again, you never say never."

            "name": "Chris Sharp",
            "content": "Yes. No, I appreciate it, David. This is Chris Sharp. And so a couple of comments. I think you're thinking about it correctly in that there's 2 lenses, right? There's kind of that hyperscale lens that has AI built within it. And then there's this other pocket that we kind of look at that's definitely emerging with private AI. And so these are these larger deployments that we're seeing come out from multiple types of enterprises.\n And I think it's important to understand from a design perspective, it kind of starts with a little bit broader in how we master plan our campuses. And so I think the work that we've been doing around building out substations and doing a long-term plan within the market has allowed us to then bring a very large capacity block design to market, which is very modular. And I think in that modularity, it's something that we continue to ideate with our customers to be able to support the varying power densities.\n And I think we talked last call about HD colo and being able to do what we're very proud about wit  70 kilowatts, but then you'll see us start to evolve over the next quarter here, the ability to even support 150 kilowatts. And so being able to support these densities, which is representative of the AI workload is absolutely paramount to our modular designs and be able to do that very efficiently.\n And then I think the last piece is the heritage. The heritage of the team on a global basis, being able to really meet and ideate with these customer bases is what's really building a distinct differentiator for us to not only capture that hyperscale AI, which we see growing and burgeoning, which you see in the prepared remarks with Oracle and some of those customers.\n But then I think directly to your point, David, these smaller, if you will, from a hyperscale perspective, private AI around Novo Nordisk Foundation and just we really are at the cusp of a lot of this AI demand coming into the PlatformDIGITAL globally. Yes. Thanks, Irvin. Absolutely. And I think one of the things that we really have thought about for some time now is the data is at the core of a lot of these AI kind of capabilities coming to market. So being to able place that algorithm right next to the data in that market, I think is everything that we've been looking at and doing that algorithm in proximity to the data is absolutely paramount for a lot of these kind of 0 to 1 megawatt offerings.\n And so what we've been thinking about with HD colo and why I talk about on a rack by rack basis, is allowing our customers to leverage a lot of their existing kind of inventory and architecture to bring AI in proximity to that capability. And I think that's where, even recently, we talked about private AI exchange, that's really focused on removing that technical barrier. So customers can get the right state-of-the-art infrastructure, be it NVIDIA, be it AMD and being able to support those power densities in an existing environment. So we do see the future of that coming to market in that fashion.\n I will tell you that -- you brought up inference. Inference is being done within training today just because of time to market, but we do see inference picking up and being a longer-term demand cycle over the years, which I think PlatformDIGITAL is well positioned to continue to support."

            "name": "Matthew Mercier",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our first quarter results. We signed a record $252 million of new leases in the first quarter, led by $175 million of greater than a megawatt leasing in the Americas and another $53 million of 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection leasing, with interconnection bookings remaining firm at $13 million. \n Turning to our backlog. Given the record leasing, the backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases swelled to a new record of $541 million at quarter end, with new leasing outstripping a record $156 million of commencements during the quarter. Looking ahead, more than half of the record backlog is slated to commence during the remainder of 2024, indicating that commencements are likely to remain elevated. \n During the first quarter, we signed a record $248 million of renewal leases at a record increase of 11.8% on a cash basis. Re-leasing spreads were once again positive across products and regions, with particular strength in the Americas. Re-leasing spreads have been increasing steadily for well over a year now, and while we expect that they will remain very healthy, they're likely to moderate in this quarter's record given the significant weighting of lease expirations in the 0 to 1-megawatt segment for the remainder of the year. \n In addition, we think it is important to consider a normalized view of the headline renewal spreads as 2 separate items skew our reported spreads higher in the first quarter. First, there was a notable outlier in the other category that should not be considered recurring or repeatable and removing this transaction would reduce our overall reported spreads by 250 basis points to 9.3% for the quarter. \n Second, there was a significant early renewal transaction in our greater than 1 megawatt segment that was part of a large package deal as we work to support this customer's broader data center capacity needs in one of our tightest markets. While this transaction enabled us to opportunistically pull forward some of our below-market expirations from the outer years, our forward year lease expiration schedule remains dominated by our 0 to 1 megawatt segment, which tends to experience spreads in the low to mid-single digits, akin to what we saw in the first quarter. \n Excluding both the outlier transaction and the packaged deal renewal, re-leasing spreads in the quarter would have been up 3.4% on a cash basis. We feel that this is a more predictable aspect of our portfolio, that we will continue to see opportunities and may periodically be able to capture the growing mark-to-market opportunity in our greater than 1 megawatt portfolio. \n In terms of earnings growth, we reported first quarter core FFO of $1.67 per share, reflecting strong organic operating results, partly balanced by dilution associated with the stabilized asset sales and JV contributions completed early in the year and the ongoing deleveraging of our balance sheet. \n And normalizing for the sale or JV of $3 billion of stabilized assets completed since the beginning of last year, total revenue growth was 7% year-over-year in the first quarter due to the benefit of improved leasing spreads, along with favorable new leasing. Revenue growth in the quarter was tempered by the decline in utility expense reimbursements as electricity rates fell sharply in EMEA year-over-year. \n Normalized adjusted EBITDA increased 9% year-over-year, reflecting the strong revenue growth and modest increase in operating expenses. As Andy noted earlier, stabilized same-capital operating performance saw continued strength in the first quarter, with year-over-year cash NOI up 4.7% driven by 4% growth in rental plus interconnection revenues and further supported by expense control. \n Moving on to our investment activity. We spent $550 million on consolidated development for the first quarter, plus another $23 million for our share of managed unconsolidated JV spending while delivering 32 megawatts of new capacity across the globe for our customers. \n It's worth mentioning, the approximate $300 million of sequential decline in our development spending this quarter which highlights the effects of the contributions of our 3 development JVs. However, seasonal and other timing-related factors also contributed to less CapEx spending in the first quarter. \n Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet in the first quarter with the closing of previously disclosed transactions, including the Cyxtera transaction, the first phase of the Blackstone hyperscale development JV and the sale of an additional 50% share of the 2 stabilized hyperscale assets in our Chicago JV to GI Partners. \n During the quarter, we also completed a hyperscale development JV with Mitsubishi for 2 assets in the Dallas Metro. In terms of new news, we also sold a piece of land in Sydney, Australia for $65 million, and we provided an easement to Dominion Energy to build the Mars substation on our Digital Dulles campus for $92 million, which all contributed to a reduction in our reported leverage to 6.1x at the end of the first quarter versus 6.2x at the end of 2023. \n Then in April, we continue to recycle capital by selling 75% of CH2, the third and final stabilized hyperscale facility on our Elk Grove campus at a 6.5 cap rate to GI Partners, raising nearly $400 million. And we sold to Digital Core REIT, an additional 24.9% interest in our Frankfurt site where Digital Core REIT previously owned 25%, raising another $129 million. \n In addition, we used some of our cash on hand to pay off the $600 million of maturing euro notes. After adjusting for these transactions, along with the anticipated closing of Phase 2 of the Blackstone transaction later this year, pro forma leverage is 5.8x. \n We continue to keep significant cash on the balance sheet with approximately $1.2 billion on hand and over $3 billion of total liquidity at March 31 to support ongoing investment opportunities. \n Moving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is over 4 years, and our weighted average interest rate is 2.9%. Approximately 85% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 86% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. \n Finally, after paying off the [ earnouts ] in April, we have $316 million of debt maturing through year-end 2024. Beyond that, our maturities remained well [ levered ] through 2032. \n I'll finish with guidance. We are maintaining our core FFO guidance range for the full year 2024 of between $6.60 and $6.75 per share, reflecting the continued improvement we are seeing in our core business. Positive underlying operating trends are partly balanced by potential acceleration in development spending and additional capital recycling, as we move our leverage down towards the long-term target and position the company for the accelerating opportunity in front of us. \n We are maintaining our total revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges for 2024, so we are notching up our cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads along with our same capital cash NOI growth expectations, reflecting better-than-expected execution on the leasing front in the first quarter, and the strength in fundamental conditions that we continue to see across our portfolio. \n Specifically, cash re-leasing spreads are now expected to increase 5% to 7% in 2024, up 100 basis points at the midpoint from the prior 4% to 6% range. And same-capital cash NOI is now expected to increase by 2.5% to 3.5%, up 50 basis points from the 2% to 3% range we provided in February. \n Highlighted in our investor presentations, excluding the nearly 200 basis points of power margin headwinds that we have previously discussed, our same-capital cash NOI growth for 2024 would be 4.5% to 5.5%. While these improvements and stronger core FFO per share realized in the first quarter bode well for the balance of the year, there are a few mitigating factors to consider as you're refining your models. First, we will see a modest drag on the $500-plus million of capital recycling completed in April. Second, we are only 1/3 of the way into the year, and there is still significant potential for both development spend and asset sales guidance to reach the high end of their guidance ranges. \n In addition, it is worth pointing out that the interest rate outlook and curve have changed considerably since we provided guidance and remains another source of uncertainty for the balance of this year. \n Just one final reminder and update. Over the course of 2024 and 2025, we expect that our $6 billion development pipeline will become increasingly accretive as higher-yielding projects are completed and stabilized. The expected yield on our stabilized pipeline ticked up another 20 basis points sequentially, reflecting the addition of higher-yielding projects and the completion or contribution to joint ventures of lower-yielding projects. \n To help provide increased transparency around this important and evolving aspect of our company, we have enhanced our development life cycle schedule on Page 25 of our supplemental to: one, reflect our proportionate share of total data center development, including our unconsolidated joint ventures; and two, to provide increased disclosure around our available developable capacity in terms of [ IQ logo ]. We hope you find this helpful. \n This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, could you please begin the Q&A session? Sure. Thanks, Jon. So what I would say is I think we're -- based on our first quarter results, we -- our optimism is improved -- has improved in terms of our -- what we expect to see and what we talked about last quarter in terms of improving growth as we look to 2025.\n And a big part of that, I would say, is driven by the successful leasing execution that we saw this quarter, $250 million and the shorter signed commence lag, which is at 7 months, it really sets us up for accelerating revenue and therefore, bottom line growth as we exit this year and into next year.\n But from boiling all that down, I would say that the growth algorithm is generally similar to what I discussed last quarter, which is we'd expect to see, call it, plus 4% related to our stabilized same-store portfolio. On top of that, you'd add another, call it, 2-plus percent as we deliver developments into our operating portfolio at yields that are continuing to improve. There'll be some offset, call it, in the 1% area, given higher rates and the debt refinancing that we have over the next couple of years. And I think that kind of sets us up for mid-single-digit and greater growth going forward. Yes. Makes sense. So on the leverage front, I mean, just to take a little step back. I mean, hopefully, as you've seen, we've made some considerable progress. You go back a year ago, we were at a little over 7x. We're now at a reported 6.1x, so a full turn of leverage that we've taken out in the last year, thanks to all the work and execution that the broader team has done.\n We continue that. As Greg is seeing, even subsequent to the quarter, we brought in another $500 million of proceeds from some additional JV activities as well as transaction within our Digital Core REIT showing the diversity of capital sources we have. We're going to continue to see as a result of the strong operating fundamentals, continue to increase our overall EBITDA and we're now sitting at approximately $3 billion of liquidity.\n So we're well on our way, and we feel confident about being able to achieve our goal of getting down to 5.5x leverage this year. And I think we've done a lion's share of the work. So we'll continue to execute and feel pretty good about it."

            "name": "Colin McLean",
            "content": "Thanks, Andy. Appreciate the question. Yes, I mean, overall, I would say our pipeline kind of reflects some of the same characteristics or bookings this quarter. So pretty AI heavy, as Andy highlighted, of 50% of our bookings this quarter were AI. I would say our pipeline is representative of that. But honestly, it's a pretty diverse characterization overall between enterprise, namely hybrid, IT, cloud compute and then AI. So I think it's a pretty robust platform across the globe, and you saw that in some of our bookings, in particular, London really jumped up this quarter.\n If you look at the sub-1-megawatt, and really what's going on in the digital transformation story, the explosion of data and really the IT spend, you're seeing a pretty pervasive enterprise activation going on where that is really taking place really across the globe in a big way. That's, in our view, enabled by channel, which this quarter, we had about 22% of our business go through channel, which was, I think, substantive. And those channel partners are really helping us tap into new logos, which you might have seen was 128 this quarter, which I think was fourth highest on record. So I think that's substantial.\n So overall, I'm pretty pleased with the balance we're seeing across the portfolio and the pipeline and hope to see that continue in the future."

            "content": "Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Following the successful course we set in 2023, Digital Realty experienced accelerating momentum in the first quarter of 2024, headlined by a collection of multifaceted AI opportunities that drove a number of new leasing records as demand for our capacity in core markets remains elevated while visibility surrounding competitive new supply remains cloudy. \n At Digital, we continue to focus on our strategic priorities and on delivering on behalf of our expanding list of 5,000-plus customers across our 50-plus markets in 25-plus countries on 6 continents. \n During the first quarter, we posted record leasing results surpassing our prior record by more than 40% and exceeding our leasing results for all of 2019 in just this 1 quarter. We also delivered strong operating results as evidenced by healthy stabilized same-capital growth and the highest re-leasing spreads in the company history. \n We continue to innovate and integrate a further expansion of ServiceFabric through the launch of our Service Directory marketplace, which has seen the addition of over 90 members offering more than 150 services, including secure and direct connections to over 225 global cloud on ramps, creating a vibrant community for [ seamless ], interconnection and collaboration. \n And just last week, we launched Private AI Exchange powered by ServiceFabric, which enables enterprise data to be at the center of an AI architecture, directly adjacent and interconnected with AI capabilities. This architecture are leading the data [ crafted ] barriers that emerge as data is generated and exchange with multiple applications across end-to-end AI-enabled digital workflows. \n We also continued down the path of bolstering our balance sheet and diversifying our capital sources with the expansion of one of our stabilized hyperscale joint ventures and the addition of a new hyperscale development JV, together with our first transaction with our perpetual capital partner, Digital Core REIT and well over the year. These transactions help to fund development pipeline capacity that our customers are seeking while reducing our overall leverage. \n Operating and financial results in the first quarter were encouraging. We posted sequential growth in our core data center revenues while growing adjusted EBITDA and core FFO per share. Development returns also continued to improve and we further enhanced the product mix of our portfolio while maintaining strong liquidity and lower leverage. \n Bookings and renewal results were even better with a number of metrics reaching new records, reflecting a strong demand environment and limited new capacity. Total bookings were $252 million, well ahead of our prior quarterly record of $176 million, reflecting the impact from the acceleration of AI and the improved pricing environment. \n Importantly, when comparing this quarter's leasing to the prior record set in 3Q 2022, we leased an incremental 10% of IT load capacity while REITs in a greater than 1 megawatt segment for approximately 60% higher than those achieved 18 months prior. \n Perhaps have been overshadowed by these record-setting results was another strong quarter in our 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment, which delivered a third straight quarter of over $50 million. Demand for connectivity-oriented capacity remains healthy and pricing remains firm. \n Our mark-to-market renewal spreads were up by 11.8%, aided by a record 18.5% increase in our greater than 1 megawatt category. Churn remained low and well controlled at 1.7% for the quarter. \n Same capital cash NOI growth also remained healthy, growing by 4.7% year-over-year in the quarter. And marking our fifth consecutive quarter of positive same capital growth. A year ago, data center demand was strong, driven by the growth of cloud and digital transformation while supply was tightening in power transmission constraints, supply chain delays and other factors. Since then, AI has become a significant driver of demand as hyperscalers race to develop, deploy and implement the technology while enterprise begins to explore the potential of this wave of technological evolution. \n McKinsey recently forecasted data center demand growth at a double-digit CAGR through 2030. This growing secular demand is broad and deep and both enterprises and service providers need a significant new data center capacity to accommodate their expanding needs, fueled by trends such as enterprise AI adoption, AI as a service, IoT and the relentless growth in data creation. \n Reflecting these trends, I want to highlight 2 highly strategic AI signs that came to fruition during the quarter. First, we were selected to host one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in one of our data centers in Copenhagen in a collaboration spearheaded on the Novo Nordisk Foundation and the Export and Investment Fund of Denmark where researchers from Denmark's public and private sectors, access to a cutting-edge NVIDIA-powered AI supercomputer in addition to NVIDIA's software platforms, training and expertise. \n Second, Digital Realty further strengthened its collaboration with Oracle to accelerate the growth and adoption of AI among enterprises, aiming to develop hybrid integrated solutions that address data gravity challenges, expedite time to market for enterprise deploying next-generation AI services and unlock data and AI-based business outcomes. Oracle will deploy critical GPU-based infrastructure with Digital Realty that leverages PlatformDIGITAL's open, purpose-built global data center solution and caters to enterprise and AI customers critical NVIDIA and AMD deployments among others. \n Our 0 to1 plus interconnection customers also continue to recognize our demonstrable strength and value proposition whether that related to power dense applications, a network of globally-connected data centers or other critical infrastructure requirements. \n During the first quarter, we added over 128 new logos. Our wins included a leading Fortune 500 AI component maker, is expanding their presence on PlatformDIGITAL to a new EMEA market to support their streaming service capabilities. \n A global cloud computing and content distribution provider are leveraging the leading connectivity proposition of PlatformDIGITAL in Mombasa to support their global edge pop expansion project. A global 120 manufacturing company is building an AI HPC environment in Frankfurt to support its autonomous vehicle project. \n A leading French cloud service provider is deploying on PlatformDIGITAL to build out its edge cloud offering across the globe to support their enterprise customers' hybrid infrastructure by delivering low latency performance while retaining mobile data residency. \n Fortune 500 technology distributor in [indiscernible], IT service provider chose PlatformDIGITAL and Phoenix to support data exchange and interconnect with key partners. And a Fortune 500 health benefits provider has expanded into 2 additional North America metros to take advantage of cloud and network [indiscernible] available on PlatformDIGITAL. \n Moving over to a quick update on our largest market, Northern Virginia. During the first quarter, we leased approximately 80 megawatts of capacity in a supply-constrained quarter in Eastern Loudoun County. Demand for our capacity remains strong. And while hyperscale leasing is typically lumpy, we continue to see healthy traction on the remaining capacity, and we are focused on helping our customers and partners source the incremental data center infrastructure that they require. \n During the first quarter, we worked with Dominion Energy to help address the transmission [ model ] at Ashburn by providing them with a easement to land a southern line at the Mars substation that they plan to construct on a quarter parcel, along 450-acre Digital Dallas campus. \n We remain cautiously optimistic about getting access to additional power with Dominion's current forecast for completion of the Southern Line transmission project by late 2025. \n Today, we have roughly 80 megawatts of remaining capacity available for lease within our first building on our Digital Dallas campus in Loudoun known as Building 7. And we have almost 200 megawatts available for development for our [ regular ] campus in Manassas, which was contributed to our JV with last [indiscernible] in the first quarter. As a reminder, Manassas is currently outside of the constrained area and [indiscernible] is accessible there. \n Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the first quarter. We continue to make meaningful progress and be recognized for our strong ESG performance in 2024. We went live with a switch to 100% renewable energy supplies for our Texas, New Jersey, and Sydney data center portfolios, benefiting 30 sites and addressing more than 10% of our mobile electricity footprint. \n We are recognized by the EPA as Energy Star Partner of the Year with sustained excellence for the fourth year, and we added a new green building certification at our MRS 4 development at Marseille, France. We also announced a partnership with a leading global energy solution provider to use our UPS systems to support Ireland's transition to renewable energy. \n And we've announced a significant expansion of our use of HVO diesel, a cleaner fuel made from waste, cooking oils and fats to power our backup generators. This will up our use of HVO to 20 global sites and 15% of our global portfolio by IT capacity. \n We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. \n With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier. So John, thanks for the question. So I'd say the lion's share of high, high percentage was not done into any of the JVs. I don't have the exact stat given we have now numerous strategic capital partners across our hyperscale platform, be it stabilized JVs. But I'm very confident that none of the leasing we reported in this quarter went into the deal you identified with Blackstone. We are seeing great traction on those projects. But this quarter, none of that lease went inside.\n On your second question in terms of improvement in ROIs, in particular in North America, I would say we've definitely moved the needle quite dramatically on that category from some of our build-to-suit projects that we'll call closer to 7% that we joint ventured to now north of 12% ROIs. And we're still working through projects that are obviously weighing that down a little bit, and we have projects that are entering that schedule on the higher side as well given the rapid improvement in the rate environment. Thanks, Jon. Maybe I'll speak to market rates and where we are able to execute on new leases signed and also renewals first and then hand it over to Matt in terms of FFO trajectory into next year.\n As you saw from our results, we're obviously benefiting from overall supply/demand dynamic with robust demand trends be it enterprise digital transformation, cloud computing and now AI on top of that, that's playing out in our 0 to 1-megawatt category as well as our greater than megawatt category. And that's all having a backdrop of supply constraints from numerous sources. And we were able to continue to push rate both on the existing contracts that were coming up for renewal as well as on new contracts to higher and higher levels. That is, obviously, you see in the leasing results and believe that trend is going to remain intact for some time.\n Matt, why don't you speak to the FFO trajectory, please? Sure. Thanks, Eric. So Northern Virginia, obviously, has been a highly dynamic market for some time here. We were very pleased to come together and support our partner at Dominion with a very strategic easement to be the landing of the Mars substation, which we are -- it is our understanding, they are on track to be delivering power and bring power back online by the beginning of 2026 from that southern line. So there's not been a divergence in terms of timing what that was previously expressed to us.\n We definitely benefited from the increase in rates in that market. Our largest signing was in that market as well as a few other decent-sized signings, although we also had some very great signings in the London market, and north of a megawatt signings also in Copenhagen. So they were not the only contributors in the plus the megawatt category.\n The rates, I would say, the market rates in general are call it, continue to improve in that market and as the precious capacity becomes more and more finite, as you saw on that slide, we now have -- are turning our attention to really 80 megawatts remaining at Digital Dallas as well as the Manassas campus, which is not impacted by the power delays. And I'd say rates in both Manassas and Loudoun County are converging right at this moment, call it in the 165, call it to almost 180 type area on a market basis. That'd be the cash rate, not a GAAP rate that we report. Sure. Thanks, David. So let me just give you the tops of the ways then I'm going to turn it to Chris on how we're tapping our infrastructure capabilities to really excel in this category.\n Obviously, the data points are smaller in the more enterprise-oriented wins, but they are there. We, I would say, call it, less than 0.5 megawatt supported through a partner, a global manufacturing company, on its AI journey in Europe. You noted the slightly larger than that, but still not -- certainly not hyperscale. The great win we had with Novo Nordisk supporting them in their NVIDIA-backed chips with a real landmark win with a supercomputer in their market.\n And then for some time, we've seen the emergence of the hyperscalers with larger capacity block needs. And the largest of our wins in the quarter, I would characterize as an AI win as well. And all in all, it's probably close to 50% of this quarter's signs, which is up relative to prior quarters. And I think there's a lot about what our platform offers that really allows us to capture this demand, maybe even earlier in the an evolution of AI than some others, but Chris can speak to that as well. Sure, Irvin. So I mean, the here and now I think AI is having a numerous positive implications for the sector. And I'll have Chris speak into what's next because I don't think we're really at what's next, be it inference, private data sets, enterprise consumption. But the here and now you have a backdrop of big existing customers with desires to have immediate [ see ] around the capacity.\n There's still -- we're winning that in our core markets where we see robust and diverse demand. We are not falling. We're chasing this demand into unproven locations. We're intersecting it, we're supporting availability zones or on ramps, where there's network density and not in unproven markets.\n You're also seeing new players pop up that obviously are not front of queue for those larger capacity blocks who are going to try to get their hands on what we have and are often able to fit in some of the more challenging places in our portfolio to sell, but they're going to take it because they have urgency around their business models and bringing their AI models on. That's the right now, the last quarter, the next quarter, but there's more to come here in this AI story. And I'll let Chris expand upon it in terms of the next chapter. Thanks, Richard. Maybe I'll hand it to Colin here in a second to talk about the broader backdrop for both the enterprise and also the hyperscale AI side. But I wouldn't call our Northern Virginia activity as a pull forward. As you could see, they're signed to commence time, materially step down, there is urgency around the capacity blocks. We still have significant runway of precious capacity in the Northern Virginia market between now and 2026 that our numerous customers have desires for and we're in various stages of negotiation.\n And it's not just in Northern Virginia story. We have the similar types of opportunities in other parts of the North America portfolio, be it Santa Clara, Dallas, New Jersey. And we'll also have the equivalent in the major flat markets in Europe, and in parts of Asia Pacific. So -- and I think this trend is going to continue for some time. Now again, you can't predict some of these large capacity blocks executing on consecutive quarters necessarily but I believe it's going to continue. But Colin, why don't you speak a little bit about the pipeline we see on both sides? I think you asked the overall mark-to-market on the portfolio, Mike? So as I think  you can get the -- obviously, you look at the in-place rates even pro forma for our recent positive cash mark-to-market on our schedule. I think that question provide more focus on the greater than megawatt category, which we've seen the greatest resurgence or uptick that it does tick down, call it lower for the next few years, call it down to the 130s and then it even hits 100 upon exploration as the low watermark in a few years' time.\n And I just commented on the Northern Virginia rates, if they call it, 155 to 180. Not all markets are at Northern Virginia. There are some markets that are ahead of Northern Virginia. But it does feel like big deals are gravitating towards that mid-100s type area pretty quickly and universally and it does not seem like that trend is taking any cessation or pause. Thanks, Simon. So I'll do the quick non-U.S. world tour. You're correct, Americas had put up some record results in contribution, and that was not just in the greater than megawatt category. It was also a major contributor in our less than megawatt category, which is great to see.\n Outside the U.S., starting in EMEA on the 0 to 1 megawatt category, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and London shined. And on the greater than 1 megawatt category, which Colin, I think touched on, London turned out to be a big contributor this quarter, which has not been for a while, which is also great to see. We saw a fair bit of importing business into Europe from outside of Europe, on both sides and firm pricing.\n In APAC, while this particular quarter, we did not have a significant contribution from the greater than megawatt category, we did have strong results both in pricing and volume on the 0 to 1 megawatt category with Singapore, Hong Kong and Seoul leading the way. And I would just say that the greater than megawatt category is just the fact that there's just fewer markets in APAC that we're landing big deals into so it's not as consistent of every single quarter being a major contributor. But all in all, I agree with your sentiment that AI is certainly landed on the U.S. shores sooner than the rest of the globe, and I think it has a great propensity to likely globalize as did cloud. Thanks, Aryeh. So on all scenarios, we don't want to speak to confidential customer information whatsoever. Obviously, anyone who's picked up a newspaper can refer to the scenario you're talking about. 2 comments: first one, which is just from the cheap seats, I would -- my personal opinion is not to jump up to any draconian conclusions on outcomes just yet. There's a lot of innings left in that game and a lot of outcomes that could happen. So I won't jump to a doomsday scenario for Digital, depending on what plays out in ensuing months.\n And even under that scenario, I would group them among all of our hyperscale customers that have maximized the pricing curve when markets were less softer and have contracts that are, like all our hyperscale customers, some of the best contracts on the books in terms of markup opportunities, certainly, on the south of 100 side rather than the north of 100 side, by and large. So if the doomsday draconian scenario was to play out, which I'm discounting, we would have some churn to refill, but probably couldn't come at a better time with a better mark-to-market opportunity for the company. Matt, so I would not characterize the world of supply constraints or just hindrances to supply as being in the rearview mirror in general. And maybe we're not talking about the proverbial waiting for your refrigerators COVID supply chain equivalent. But the friction to supply, whether it is power transmission, power generation, supply chains on data center components or just positions in queue for production or components for substations, broader sustainability concerns, nimbyism in general, that friction is existing, and it's happening in a backdrop where I think we can add more and more value to our customers than probably ever before.\n And even despite historical preferences or to often do it yourself, I think by and large, the customer base is seeing having the benefit of global outsourced trusted partner with 20 years of experience operationally, delivery-wise, and really turn in to Digital in their times of need and really at a time or it could be continuing of urgency around those capacity blocks. And that's certainly been highlighted in the Northern Virginia market, but I think that's a broader Americas phenomenon and a growing global phenomena. Going to Greg on that one, Michael. Thank you for the compliment. Thanks, Nick. So I think if you look at our strategy, we're focused on supporting workloads, be it enterprise, digital transformation or hybrid or hyperscale cloud or AI in markets with robust and diverse demand and supporting applications with latency and locational sensitivity.\n The cloud has been around for a long time and did not put [ AZs ] as in every single NFL city in America or it's equivalents around the globe. They picked locations where GDP, population, infrastructure and data are essentially there, which I think lends itself to greater longevity and sustainable growth in our asset class and our strategy and our business.\n Now there's markets that have been added to that list over time. They didn't get -- put chiseled in stone and put away on a shelf years and years ago. But -- so I think new markets for us would have to give us the similar conviction we have, invest in our core markets to want us to go there. So that could happen. That certainly could happen in a rapidly changing world, with power becoming such a precious resource as well as other precious resources. But anything we're thinking about is investing in -- we're not in this [ risk trade ], we're investing in this for the long term, for long-term sustainable growth.\n And we're fortunate, if you can look at our newly tweaked and disclosure on our development cycle, we've got north of 3 gigawatts of growth in land capacity or shell capacity in those core markets. So we've got a lot of runway to harvest that demand before even feeling the urgency to chase into less proven markets. Thanks, Erik. So just more on the tactical on the quarterly bookings. I mean, we're out of the gates here with a great start on both the less-than-megawatt category, call it north of 50 for several consecutive quarters now. I think 2 in a row, north of 53, great new logos contribution and obviously, an overall record which we discussed. By and large, I wouldn't say usually another record follows the prior record on the one hand. But on the other, we're certainly in a different territory right now in terms of demand. We have the large capacity blocks that are deeply sought after. We have a team focused on executing, and we got 3 more at bats in 2024 to put those results up.\n Bigger backdrop. If you look back at cloud globalizing, it's one of those things that the famous quote \"It happened slowly and then it happened really fast.\" I can remember years of the thesis being it's going to globalize forever and ever, and then it really took off. So I'm not -- I wouldn't -- I couldn't pound the table and say 2024 year is the year that AI globalizes like cloud. But signs do point that it should follow a similar trend over time. Thank you all for dialing in. We really appreciate it. Digital Realty had a strong first quarter with record leasing results that reflected the growing impact of AI on our business. Fundamental strength continued through the first quarter with healthy same-capital organic growth and robust re-leasing spreads.\n We've continued to innovate with the expansion of ServiceFabric, new products like our Private AI Exchange, along with modular designs to accommodate increasingly power dense workloads.\n Finally, we've closed a number of transactions already this year bringing in additional private capital and enhancing our ability to deliver new capacity to meet our customers' growing needs. We are excited about this quarter's results and look ahead with continued optimism. The 3 key demand drivers, AI, cloud and enterprise digital transformation are showing no signs of letting up, and we are well positioned with over 300 data centers across the key markets around the world.\n I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and would like to thank our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world running. Thank you."
